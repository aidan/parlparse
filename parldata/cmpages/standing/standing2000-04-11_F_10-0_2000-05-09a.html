<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> In many ways it is too early to quote the words of London mayors but, as I was saying before I was interrupted, between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. of local learning and skills councils' funds will be outside the national formula approach for activities where such a funding approach is not appropriate. That will include work force development and funding to support improvement in the standards and quality of local providers. For those funds, local LSCs will make decisions about pricing as well as allocations. Within that percentage band, there will also be a significant local initiatives fund. That will enable local LSCs to support important local learning and skills initiatives that would not otherwise be funded because they do not fit easily into the categories of activity that attract mainstream funding.
<P>
In January, we proposed, as a further area of local LSC discretion, the power to vary national prices within limits set by the national council. It is worth emphasising that, in terms of our discussion on local discretion, the ability to vary national prices means much more local discretion for the local councils than might at first sight appear to be the case. A local LSC might want to exercise discretion if, for example, it thought that that would help to tackle local shortages of good-quality training for skills that are in particular demand.
<P>
The second technical consultation paper on funding will be published shortly. It will set out in much greater depth than my brief overview the Government's proposals for the LSC's funding and allocations system and the flexibility and discretion that will rest with the local LSCs. I hope that, given those assurances, the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I have listened carefully to the Minister's response and am grateful for the way in which he framed it. I am still not entirely convinced that there will be sufficient discretion in local funding.

<P>
The Minister mentioned areas that could be funded from the 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. non-formula element, which will be at the discretion of the local LSCs. The Minister included adult and community learning and work force development. I do not think that he listed another item that could come within the ambit of non-formula funding, which is contained in the ``Learning to Succeed'' White Paper: pump priming initiative funding for small-scale local projects. If he did mention that, he certainly did not highlight it in his response. One wonders whether, after all the other calls upon the non-formula element mentioned by the Minister have been met, there will be sufficient money left for such pump priming.

<P>
Many training and enterprise councils value pump priming. I recently received news from Hertfordshire TEC, which has done much work in connection with the film industry. That industry is important in my constituency, which, as has been mentioned, includes Elstree studios. Other studios are near by and there is a need to meet the particular skills called for by the film industry. That is an example of the need for the local flexibility that Hertfordshire TEC has provided in helping to fund several local initiatives.

<P>
We wonder whether there will be sufficient money in the discretionary fund to meet all the calls on it. We will want to reflect carefully on what the Minister has said and perhaps look at the technical consultation document that he mentioned. The amendment was tabled to explore the issues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): While we are on the subject, it would be immensely helpful if the Minister would arrange to send directly to members of the Committee a copy of the technical consultation document on its publication later this week.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend and I are jointly grateful for the Minister's assent to that suggestion. On the basis of the case that I have outlined, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 9, line 27, after ``consult'', insert ``representatives of education providers,''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 131, in page 9, line 27, leave out ``regional development agencies'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`organisations which appear to it to represent business, including small businesses, in the areas covered by the local council'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 138, in page 11, line 30, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Before giving directions to the Council the Secretary of State must consult organisations which appear to him to represent the interests of business, including small businesses.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The amendments relate to consultation on the preparation of guidance. I have no difficulty with them being grouped together although, strictly, they relate to slightly different duties and to different clauses. Amendments Nos. 159 and 131 relate to consultation by the council and the preparation of guidance for each local learning and skills council. Amendment No. 138 relates to guidance that the Secretary of State might wish to give by way of direction and the organisations to be consulted when doing so.

<P>
The issue concerns not the small print of form but the way in which action is to be taken. The proposals would be entirely consistent with the tenor of our discussions and fair to the all-party basis on which we have said that it would be much better to have as much consultation and co-operation as possible. I say that not to remove the possibility of dissent or a clash of interests but because, given the difficulties, the complexities and the needs of individual learners, it is important that people are seen to be working together.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 159 and 131 relate to guidance from the national council to the local councils. The objectives are unexceptionable and I shall not go on about them. The question is: who is to be consulted? Strangely, perhaps, the Bill provides for consultation with regional development agencies and local education authorities. In our earlier exchanges about membership, there was a specific commitment by Ministers to include a representative of the RDA and the suggestion that they would seek to involve representatives of local authorities. Those authorities would be at the top table anyway because they would have representatives on the national and local councils. I am not suggesting that Ministers should remove the requirement to consult the RDAs and LEAs about guidance-they could hardly avoid the process because of the anticipated membership.

<P>
However, the two interests referred to in the amendments are not explicitly covered. One matter that has not been featured enough in Committee is the representation of local education providers. There are sometimes difficulties with that representation, not least because there might be many such providers within an area and because, in certain cases, they might have interests that do not coincide or which are mutually opposed to those of the body. Generally, one would have thought it possible to pick further education representatives and consult them on the important matter of guidance, not least because the Association of Colleges conforms in its reference to regional committees. The regional committee for London has been instrumental in discussion and consultation with the Minister on the form of the local learning and skills councils in London and will no doubt wish to be consulted on aspects of continuing performance and on whether the model works satisfactorily.

<P>
I do not believe that Ministers would try to exclude consultations with further education providers. We are not in the business of pursuing paranoia, even if we may sometimes disagree, but why does the Bill not state that further education providers should participate in the council? How does the Minister intend the council to consult?

<P>
My second point relates to amendment No. 131 and small business interests. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) spoke eloquently about those matters in another context. I echo the emphasis that he placed on the importance of involving business. Business will be-to use a new Labour phrase-a stakeholder, and it is important that it is consulted on the guidance. I do not think that Ministers are wilfully trying to exclude business, not least because if their undertakings are to be honoured, representatives of the business sector will be members of the national council and the local LSCs. It is odd that business will not have the same handle on guidance as the regional development authorities and local education authorities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I am listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman is saying about small business, not least because I have emphasised the need for it to be consulted. However, why would it be appropriate to refer to small business but to exclude regional development agencies? There is no logic in that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I recognise the hon. Gentleman's involvement in small business, which is as important to his constituency as it is to many others that are represented by members of the Committee. The amendment does not specify RDAs, but they are not excludable because Ministers are committed to making them members. The purpose of the amendment is to provide a vehicle for a debate on who should be involved in the consultation process.

<P>
I am inclined to include everyone, but Ministers might be worried about the length of the list. The longer it becomes-we discussed this with regard to transport and child care-the more the legal cards could stack up against an unfortunate exclusion. We might want the council to consult trade union representatives. I have often said that trade unions have an important role in delivering education services to their members and in helping to promote the education agenda. I do not want to wipe anyone out and I am anxious to be told that, as far as possible, everyone will be in the business of consultation. By way of a happy accident, today is small business day. I hope that that has no significance for
the resolution-albeit temporary-of the Rover difficulties. However, on the substantive point, we want people to be included in the consultation process.

<P>
Amendment No. 138 relates to the Secretary of State giving directions to the council. It suggests that he should bear in mind the importance of business, which is an important indirect consumer of the council's services.

<P>
There is no fixed agenda on who should be in or out of the business of consultation. We have a strong preference for the maximum involvement and wish to obtain an assurance on that.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Michael Wills):</B> It will not surprise the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) that we agree entirely that the LSC should consult representatives of education providers. It is eminently sensible for it to do so when it prepares its guidance and it is vital that the sector is fully involved in the process. The requirement for the LSC to consult local education authorities, with their statutory responsibilities for education, gets us some of the way towards the amendment, not least as LEAs will also play a leading role in consulting education providers for their own education development plans and take a central part in local learning partnerships. However, there are, as ever, problems with the definitions that are necessary in respect of such a duty to specify which representatives should be included and excluded.

<P>
The objective that the hon. Gentleman and I share can be achieved sensibly by including such a requirement in the guidance that we offer to the national LSC. It is probable that the council would in any event wish to consult representatives of education providers with the aim of improving the guidelines. It is also probable that it would wish to extend consultation on the guidance to representatives of training providers.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman seeks in amendment No. 131 to remove RDAs from post-16 matters, just as his noble Friends did in another place. In their place, the amendment would require the national council to consult organisations that represent business, including small business, on the guidance that it intends to give to its local LSC. Whether the hon. Gentleman supports RDAs in principle or not, the fact remains that they have a statutory responsibility to produce regional skills strategies, so it is vital that the LSC's guidance must include their input. As RDAs are chaired by people with substantial business or commercial experience, they will be well placed to reach out to the business world and to reflect its views in commenting to the local LSC on the national council's guidance.

<P>
Although RDAs are new organisations, they are already developing an influential role in driving forward regional strategies for sustainable economic development, regeneration and social exclusion. They have contributed to the success of the new arrangements by making recommendations to the Government on the number and boundaries of local LSCs proposed in their respective regions, which the Government were pleased to accept in almost every case.

<P>
In view of the RDAs' statutory responsibilities and their achievements to date, we believe that it is right that their role should be explicitly recognised in the Bill. That is why the Bill stipulates that RDAs should be consulted by the national council on its draft guidance to local LSCs, by the local LSCs on their draft annual plans and by the national council on whether it should approve the final annual plans of local LSCs in their regions.

<P>
As a body that is chaired by a business leader, and as 40 per cent. of its membership will come from a business background, the LSC will be well equipped to ensure that the annual guidance reflects a business perspective. For the sake of providing clarity to the hon. Member for Daventry and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden), I remind the Committee that the guidance will inevitably include the perspective of small businesses. We have already discussed the close links with the Small Business Service and with other business organisations at a national level that will inform the guidance. As with representatives of education providers, we want to reflect those principles in the guidance that we give to the LSC on its consultation. I do not see the need for the national council to go as far as to consult local business representatives before it gives its guidance to local councils at the beginning of the planning process. The local LSCs will work closely with business representatives when they prepare the local plans.

<P>
I do not see the need for such consultation to be a factor in the Secretary of State's direction either. Amendment No. 138 would require the Secretary of State to consult business whenever he decides to issue a direction to the Learning and Skills Council under clause 25. Naturally, if a direction were considered necessary and it was appropriate to consult business-or, indeed, any other group-before making it, we would do so. However, in some contexts it would be a nonsense, or even improper, to consult business-for example, if the direction concerned the LSC failing in its statutory duties with respect to a person with learning difficulties, or if mismanagement had been found at a college. Such consultation would only delay the direction and the resolution of the problem, and speed is often of the essence in such matters. It is difficult to see what interest the wider business community would have in those matters that could not be expressed through the representatives on local councils.

<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not intend to impose such a constraint on the Secretary of State's powers to direct the council, as these are an important safeguard. I hope that the reassurances that I have given about our commitment to involve the business community and others will allow him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The bedside manner is out with a vengeance this afternoon. The Minister did well in committing himself to consultation all round, which I welcome. That is sufficient, and I would even go so far as to say that I can see certain technical problems with amendment No. 138 with respect to consultation at large on matters that should not be the specific remit of business. That is the kind of untidiness that arises when the Opposition draft amendments.

<P>
The Minister also made a case for giving local education authorities and regional development agencies a fast track, as they have statutory responsibilities. As to the substance of the point about regional development agencies, which the hon. Member for Blackpool, South touched on earlier, the Minister would be right in assuming that we are perhaps less enthusiastic than he and his party might be about the regional development agencies as a concept. I have seen a lot of words from the regional development agencies, some of which have been quite well conceived and judged, but I remain a sceptic about the likelihood of an increase to value added. I am, literally, a sceptic; I shall not rush to a conclusion. The regional development agencies will certainly have to work hard. While, and to the extent, that they exist and have statutory duties, I shall not get hung up on how they should be consulted.

<P>
The important point is that the Minister has told the Committee that he intends to obtain advice wherever appropriate, including from providers and business representatives, one being the main supply side and the other the demand side of the equation, with students perhaps moving along the curve. That is not conceptually difficult. Given the tone of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Plans of local councils</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 133,
in page 9, line 37, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`which must reflect the skill needs of the local labour market'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 174 and 175.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Clause 22 requires a local LSC to prepare a plan every year. Subsection (2) requires the plan to include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a statement of the needs regarding education and training of the population of the local council's area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment takes matters a little further by requiring the plan to reflect also the skill needs of the local labour market.

<P>
The debate has to some extent been foreshadowed by earlier debates about individuals' needs for education and training as opposed to the demands of employers in the local labour market. The Minister may argue that the existing wording covers the skills needs of the local labour market as well as the needs of the local population. He may say that the local population needs skills and training to meet the requirements of the local labour market. That line of argument was advanced on another occasion. However, it may not be entirely self-evident to everyone, as Ministers seem to believe.

<P>
We have received a submission from the Confederation of British Industry which makes it clear that that is not self-evident. The CBI remains concerned that the existing wording does not sufficiently reflect the needs of local labour markets, and that they, too, should be reflected in the plan. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The local LSC is required to prepare a plan that includes a ``statement of the needs regarding education and training of the population of the Local Council's area. However there is clearly a difference between taking into account the needs of the local population and taking into account the needs of the local economy.'' Both are a key part of the functions of the LSC as envisaged in the Prospectus.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Breaking away from what the CBI had to say, we invite the Minister to take this opportunity to clarify matters and to spell out in the Bill that the plan should provide for the needs of the population and of the local labour market. We submit that there is no harm in that, if that meaning is implicit in the existing wording. The amendment would give the Government an opportunity to spell it out even more clearly. Given the lack of perception that the CBI-and, we suspect, others-have of the Minister's interpretation, he may want to think carefully about taking this opportunity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Alongside the Opposition amendment, we are debating Government amendments Nos. 174 and 175. Given what the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) said, I hope that amendment No. 174, the key amendment, will go a long way to satisfying him. It would insert new paragraph (aa), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a statement of the needs of employers in the local council's area regarding education and training of their employees and potential employees.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That follows earlier amendments tabled by the hon. Members for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) and for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), who sought a more explicit recognition of the importance of employers' needs and local work force development in contributing to the LSC's goals and objectives. I gave a promise at that time that I would consider strengthening our commitment to work force development; it was always our intention to do so. As I said then, a case can be made for making for the LSC's role more explicit. I am further considering clause 16 and the LSC's national strategy, and I still hope to table an amendment on Report.

<P>
I believe that Government amendments Nos. 174 and 175 address the concerns of hon. Members and of the TEC national council, in that they require local LSCs to include a statement of the employment and training needs of employers in their areas, and a statement in their annual plans of how they propose to carry out their functions in the light of those needs. We have discussed the matter with the CBI, which has warmly welcomed our approach. I hope that hon. Members will welcome that positive move.

<P>
As the Government amendments cover the same grounds as amendment No. 133, albeit in language with which the parliamentary draftsman is more comfortable, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment and support the Government amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I rise briefly to say that we welcome the Government's proposal. During the earlier debate, we made it clear that we thought that the Bill was a little light on recognising the need for work force development. I understand that it was always the Government's intention that the Bill should not refer explicitly to that. However, the wording of amendment No. 174 will be helpful in ensuring that work force developments are promoted in the background material published by local LSCs as they develop their plans.

<P>
We hope that the Government will also be committed to ensuring that resources are available for that work force development, in addition to providing for the assessment of need and the drawing up of plans. The contributions made by the sorts of measures that we have discussed, such as Investors in People and training within the work force, are vital to maintaining productivity. Organisations that develop staff and provide training will be the ones that survive, rather than those who feel that they are inadequately supported by Government and Government agencies. Therefore, amendment No. 174 is most welcome. We hope that the Government will try to find other places in the Bill to promote that idea-as the Minister said that they would-especially in the context of the role of the national council.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Purchase </B>(Wolverhampton, North-East): I have a little trouble with the amendments tabled both by the Government and by Conservative Members. Both amendments are laudable and contain excellent sentiments, so I have no difficulty agreeing with their stance, but I wonder how well they reflect the reality of the situation. How do we discover what companies think that they might need?

<P>
We see in-house developments and a range of initiatives taken by good companies, including training, which enhance a company's added value. However, it is extremely difficult for a body that is some distance from the coal face to gather the relevant information. In my experience, most small companies do not know what they might need in the short and medium term, and certainly not in the long term. I almost applauded when the hon. Member for Hallam mentioned the employer who, when asked what additional skills he needed in the work force, said, ``I need another electrician.'' Many years ago, when I was a member of the area Manpower board, that same employer was present in my constituency. That small employer was asked, ``If schools and colleges are so hopeless, tell us what you want'' and he replied, ``As a matter of fact, I need a capstan operator-tomorrow morning.'' That is the sort of hand-to-mouth existence experienced by many small companies.

<P>
I favour the Government amendment because it refers to education and training rather than to a skills audit, which would be almost impossible in certain areas of industry and commerce. Small companies simply cannot put in the time, effort, knowledge and experience needed to plan such things. As a younger man, I worked as part of a team in the aerospace industry discovering ways to cut new metals. To some extent, we were able to plan: we worked in co-operation with scientists, engineers and technicians, and we were able to plan what sort of equipment we needed in the medium term, while we were working on the ill-fated TSR2. However, that sort of planning process is not applicable to small companies.

<P>
Earlier in the debate, we made great play of how we might involve people from small companies by making them members of LSCs. The hon. Member for Hallam took the words out of my mouth when he said that such people do not have the time to sit on boards, or to be involved in any sort of planning. I wonder how loosely the provision should be drafted so that armies of people do not try to find the philosopher's stone of what is in small employers' minds.

<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks), will address the detailed and difficult matters. Such schemes have not done well in this country. One reason for chopping and changing between different schemes over the past 30 years has been that few of them have added much to the process. I hope that we are nearer the mark. However, we need to be sensible about what the amendments will mean for small firms. We must consider the additional bureaucracy. It will be difficult to obtain the information because employers do not know which way the situation will turn. A few years ago, the short term was six or 12 months. A firm would receive an order, decide how to fulfil it, perhaps commission or design a new piece of kit, bring it on stream, profits would roll in and life would become a little easier. But that time scale is no longer relevant. We are talking of the very short term. The essence of the clause is ``education, education, education''. People need to be able to absorb, almost at a moment's notice, new techniques, new methods and new understandings, and apply them where it matters-at the productive sharp end.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilary Benn </B>(Leeds, Central): My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase) has done the Committee a service. He has drawn our attention to the practical difficulties of trying to give voice to the amendment that was moved by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.

<P>
I support the amendment. It makes explicit what was implicit and identifies that the LSCs have a responsibility right across the piece, including work force development which, as my hon. Friend said, has bedevilled this policy for 40 years. In the early 1960s, the Conservative Government established industrial training boards, which they later abolished. They then established training and enterprise councils and brought on board the national training organisations. The process has been a mixture of prescription and laissez faire, but the nub of the matter remains the same: how do we persuade people to do something that they do not want to do or do not realise that they need to do? That is what we are trying to tackle. It is depressing that, in surveys, one in three employees say that they have not been offered training by their employer and one in six employers say that their employees might not have the skills that are necessary for their future business. That is the challenge before us.

<P>
The LSC, both nationally and locally, will have to recognise the best way of stimulating demand. That has been a theme of our discussions. It is impossible to plan for demand. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East said, we do not want a long plan of what the LSC thinks will happen. Instead, it should organise provision to maximise the chances of encouraging demand. It is becoming clear that it is the state's responsibility to get people's skills to an acceptable level. Employers will train people for today's or tomorrow's jobs, but they will not train or educate people for the job or career that we might want them to undertake tomorrow. We must increasingly take on that responsibility.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I support my hon. Friend's points. Does he agree that the crucial problem is that employers provide hard-skill training, for example on a computer programme or a piece of software, but they do not necessarily provide the soft-skill training that is essential to bring people in this country up to the level of training that is available in other European work forces?

<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The demand for more transferable skills that can enable people to obtain jobs elsewhere in the labour market must come from individuals. That is why I support learning accounts. In the famous employee development programme at Ford, there was an explosion of activity when people were given an opportunity to take their own decisions on what learning they wanted and were provided with cash to enable them to do so. Ford, a hard-headed multinational, realised in the end that it stood to benefit as an organisation, which is a lesson for us about the way in which demand can be developed.

<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry spoke about the role of trade unions. Learning accounts can provide the potential for trade unions to bargain collectively on behalf of a group of workers and to say ``If you give us your accounts, we can then negotiate with your employer.''

<P>
<B>Mr. Chris Ruane </B>(Vale of Clwyd): May I bring to the Committee's attention an example of individual learning accounts in my constituency? When Kwik Save's headquarters closed down, 800 of its employees managed to obtain £1,000 each from Somerfield, which organised the closure. A total of £800,000 was therefore allocated. However, only £300,000 was spent, and the remainder had to be returned to Somerfield after 18 months had elapsed. Workers who were faced with redundancy were not taking up the individual learning accounts. Although free money was available to them, they did not use it, which shows that there are problems with the take-up of individual learning accounts even when people's jobs are on the line.

<P>
<B>Mr. Benn:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that contribution, which illustrates the need for a change in culture. I do not know whether the workplace to which he referred was unionised, but I remind hon. Members that one of the roles that trade unions can play is to draw people's attention to the opportunities that are available to them. They can also provide an opportunity for employers to contribute. In time, the importance of the programmes must be recognised, as the whole of industry and business benefits from the investment that individuals make in their own learning and from development of the sort of soft skills to which my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South referred. It is not unreasonable to look to employers to contribute, as everybody will benefit in the end.

<P>
When the local councils discharge the challenging responsibility that the amendment will give to them, I hope that they will conduct themselves in a manner that permits providers, further education institutions and others to be innovative and flexible in seeking to encourage demand, especially from small and medium-sized enterprises. However, one of the difficulties that must be faced is demonstrating the bottom-line benefit that can be gained from investing in skill. We know intuitively that such benefits are available and businesses that are convinced will tell people about them. I hope that the new framework will allow providers to go into partnership with business and to establish a financial framework that allows them to share the success that can be produced. Such arrangements could be similar to the business deals that are increasingly done by partnership organisations out there in the world of commerce. Colleges in Leeds have told me that they want a funding framework that allows them to innovate and to crack this nut of getting business to invest in learning.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I have urged the Opposition to seek to withdraw the amendment in favour of the Government amendments which have similar objectives, and I have given them assurances. These remarks have prompted a useful debate, which has involved many powerful themes and critical issues. I do not think that I have time to comment fully on all of those issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East tried to bring the Committee down to earth when he spoke of the small firm-perhaps a two or three-person company-that says that it is not thinking of planning ahead and that it wants a trained electrician tomorrow.

<P>
There is a reality about that, although, by definition, no body-not even the Learning and Skills Council-can produce an electrician tomorrow. We must examine the implications. Although it is easier said than done, a special part of our task is to encourage small companies to think about their skill requirements, just as they, with medium-sized and large companies, must think about their funding for the next two or three years, perhaps making pension arrangements over a longer period. We must encourage more companies to realise that the skills agenda is for them.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Given the size of some companies, the national training organisations have an increasingly important role. That is why, at different stages in our deliberations, we have noted the role that NTOs must play. I may have given this example before, but I am aware of a coming crisis in the gas installation industry because of the reducing number of qualified gas fitters and installers. That is not a minor example, given that, among other things, the home energy efficiency scheme aims to ensure that more elderly citizens and others have efficient heating systems. Many people in that profession are now nearing retirement, few people are entering the work force and many of the companies involved are quite small.

<P>
We are seeing some interesting developments with the national training organisations. For instance, the Gas Industry National Training Organisation is working with a major bank and talking with the industry about how to train a work force in a way that is fair to the companies involved, not least because employees might be poached by other companies. The industry is also discussing the idea of transferable loans. That is an example of the need for imaginative thinking.

<P>
The theme developed by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) is crucial. If we are to win the battle for skills, we must recognise that individual employees, the professional associations and the trade unions are all key players. I mentioned earlier some survey evidence. I do not wish to make too much of it, but it seemed to show that a growing proportion of employees who are looking for a change of job look to companies that take their training and skills seriously.

<P>
One can predict with some confidence that, during the next 10 years, the training and skills part of the employment package may become as important as some of the more traditional things that workers look to when changing jobs. There are some signs of hope, but I recognise the reality. For example, a third of the companies in the print industry-a rather important and successful British industry that relies on new technological development-put their hands up to the fact that they have offered their staff no training during the past 12 months.

<P>
I welcome this useful discussion, which was inspired by my hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Clwyd (Mr. Ruane) and for Blackpool, South. It goes to the heart of what we hope to achieve in the Bill. However, I urge the hon. Member for Hertsmere to withdraw his amendment in favour of the Government amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I hesitate to speak again, but the Minister sparked a thought when he mentioned the gas industry. The biggest trainer of installers is British Gas, which trains British Gas services fitters in Leeds. In that industry, the spectrum of companies ranges from the local one-man band to organisations such as British Gas. The Government amendment mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a statement of the needs of employers in the local council's area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We must find out how to incorporate, for example, British Gas-a national organisation and perhaps the biggest training organisation, with employees scattered around the country-into the framework. The Minister might want to think about how to approach large national companies given that every local council area will be involved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We are conscious of that. It is one reason why we must balance our stress on the local learning and skills council and its local discretion with the need for strength at the centre. Industries such as gas and construction are not particularly concentrated in one community but are national industries, which is why we are anxious to ensure that LSC members with a business background will be able to make links with appropriate national training organisations. That will enable us to get the balance right.

<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> That might be a strong argument for incorporating relevant provisions in the national council plan, as the Minister has said. My point, using the context of the gas industry, was that the interrelation of a large national employer and many smaller employers is important. I am pleased that the Minister is thinking along those lines.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> This has been a useful debate, with interesting contributions from the hon. Members for Wolverhampton, North-East and for Leeds, Central. It would be churlish not to welcome the Minister's approach. I think that we were right to push the issue. The Minister is correct in anticipating that I shall not press the matter to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any resident of that area might reasonably expect to receive education or training in the authority's area.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can deal in short order with amendments Nos. 160 and 166. Amendment No. 160 is a probing amendment. Under the clause, the local LSC's plan must include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a statement of the education and training whose provision the local council would like a relevant local education authority to secure in the local council's area for persons who have attained the age of 19.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to hear a little more from the Minister about how that would work and about the interrelationship between the LSC and the local education authority. The background is our continuing concern and sensitivity about over-19 provision. I do not want to repeat our arguments about clause 3-the Committee will understand.

<P>
Amendment No. 166 probes the need for flexibility in the arrangements and examines who is to be brought within the ambit of a plan. We are thinking about the possibility that a resident of a local authority area not within a local council area might look to a nearby local council area for education and training. We should like-and I imagine that we will receive-assurances that there will not be any cross-border problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> In considering amendment No. 160 and the contributions that local education authorities will make to the work of local LSCs in securing education and training for adults, I ask hon. Members to read clauses 22 and 23. Subsection (3)(a) of clause 22 should be considered alongside subsection (3)(b). Together, those give local LSCs twin duties to include in their local plans details of the learning provision that they want LEAs in their areas to secure for adults and of the financial resources that they will make available to authorities to enable them to do so. The Bill sets out a statutory base for the key long-term role that we expect and want LEAs to have in the provision of accessible, appropriate and attractive learning opportunities for adults.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I have just started, but I shall give way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has explained the twin duties, which are rightly linked together. Will he clarify-this might also inform our debate on clause 23-what will happen if an LEA is happy with the plan in principle, but does not have adequate resources? Will it be able to state its reservations or make representations before the plan is finalised, or will it have to complain ex post?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> We anticipate that there will be proper consultation between the two bodies at the appropriate times. I hope that that will not be difficult to achieve.

<P>
The role of local authorities is so important that we have included a long-stop power in clause 23 for the Secretary of State to direct a local authority to secure the agreed provision if it has failed to do so. However, that is most emphatically not how we envisage the process working in general. On the contrary, we are keen that the relationship between local LSCs and the authorities is constructive and mutually supportive. The hon. Member for Daventry raised that matter.

<P>
The clause requires the LSC to consult LEAs on its draft guidance to local LSCs and sets out an important role for local authorities in the preparation of local LSC plans. Subsection (5)(b) requires local LSCs to consult local authorities while preparing their plans. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. Subsection (4)(c) provides that local LSCs must have regard to local authority strategies, including that of the Greater London Authority, that are drawn up under clause 4 of the Local Government Bill.

<P>
The provisions will ensure that local LSCs and local authorities work closely together to reach clear agreement on what provision is needed and how it will be funded. They are necessary because the Government believe that locally based adult and community learning is a vital element in widening participation in learning, driving up achievement and strengthening communities.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State acknowledged the importance of LEA guarantee. Provided they produce and implement satisfactory lifelong learning plans, they will receive, for the first two years of the new arrangements, funding that is comparable to what they provide from their education spending resources. Local authorities will be keen to learn more about the guarantee's precise arrangements for funding. An official letter will be sent to them in parallel with the imminent publication of our consultation paper on LSC funding and allocations, which will also be sent to Committee members. If LEAs show that they can do more to help the LSC meet its objectives, especially for those groups that are most excluded from learning, they will be able to bid for further resources that might be available for adult and community learning. At the end of the guarantee period, we expect LEA-secured adult and community learning to continue as a central feature of each local LSC plan. It would be extremely disappointing and worrying if it did not.

<P>
We are confident that LEAs will respond positively to the new environment for post-16 learning. That will reinforce the key role that they can, and often do, play in the planning, development and delivery-both directly and indirectly-of local learning. The repeal of schedule 2 to the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 will mean that LEAs will no longer be subject to artificial distinctions between what they can and must fund. The new arrangements will give local authorities fresh opportunities to influence the planning and to secure the delivery of all adult learning, not just non-vocational education.

<P>
Local authorities will help to ensure that local learning provision responds to community needs. They will do so through their many forms of involvement in the new arrangements: as consultees, as key players represented on the boards of local LSCs or further education college governing bodies or as members of local learning partnerships. As I emphasised in response to an amendment about local authority representation, they will be not just deliverers of learning, but full partners uniquely placed to provide vision and leadership for local communities and to ensure coherence between compulsory education and post-16 learning. The simple fact is that local authorities have everything to gain from our reform of post-16 learning.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 166 seeks to address the interests of individual learners who cross over from one area to another to take up education provision. The amendment would require a local LSC to consult on its local plan any local authority outside its area that has learners-or, indeed, only one learner-who travel to the local LSC's area to participate in their courses. We certainly expect local LSCs to consult LEAs from other areas when a substantial number of people from outside the LSC area are studying within it. We will reflect that expectation in guidance to the LSC. The interpretation of this general principal is best left to common sense in local areas-I suppose that it is a sort of common sense revolution-and should not be prescribed in legislation.

<P>
The problems of including such a requirement in legislation are only too evident when we consider the amendment, which would require consultation in respect of the whole local LSC plan just because a single student was travelling from outside the LSC's area to an education provider within it. That would obviously be nonsense, and I know that the hon. Member for Hertsmere did not intend to allow it to happen.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 179 to 181 are technical and I hope that they will not delay the Committee for long. Clauses 22 and 23 currently refer to education and training. The amendments put it beyond any doubt that the education and training that a local LSC and LEA agree that the authority will secure can include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>connected organised leisure-time occupation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That form of words has featured in the definition of further education since 1944 and is included in the definition of post-16 education used in part I clauses.

<P>
I hope that the Committee will support the Government amendments and that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw his amendment in the light of my assurances.

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We certainly share the objective of promoting adult and community education, but we remain concerned about the signal that is being sent out by clause 3. I am sure that LEAs will want to reflect on the part that they are expected to play and on the Minister's remarks. The amendment sought to probe the Government, and I will not press it to a Division. Amendment No. 166 was a short but worthwhile exploration of cross-border issues. I am pleased to see that the Minister is now accepting not only some of our amendments but, to some extent, our philosophy, as he emphasised the importance that we attach to common sense. I hope that that attitude will be brought to bear on cross-border problems in the way that he described. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or any resident of that area might reasonably expect to receive education or training in the agency's area'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In a sense, we have rehearsed some of the issues and I need not detain the Committee long. The first three amendments would exclude the relevant regional development agency from the matter of guidance and substitute consultation with business. We have already had arguments on that matter and the Minister has replied more or less to our satisfaction. I do not intend to reopen the issue.

<P>
I am concerned more with amendment No. 165, which relates to cross-border issues as they affect regional development agencies. In the interests of speed, I passed over the Minister's slightly perfunctory response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere, who had moved the group of amendments that included amendment No. 166. The reference in amendment No. 165 to RDAs mirrors the reference in amendment No. 166 to local education authorities.

<P>
I assure the Minister that I do not want to be pettifogging. I have a personal engagement in the issue through my experience-I live close to a county boundary and a local learning and skills boundary. Anybody from my village wishing to undertake post-16 education and training, other than in a school, will have to cross to Banbury, which is in another area. I do not want to cause difficulty about that.

<P>
I am pleased to hear that the Minister proceeds with common sense and would not argue that he does not. However, he must assure himself and perhaps must remind the Committee that we can be sure that the funding streams, the behaviour of the institutions and, where appropriate, the institutions' planning will proceed with common sense.

<P>
Lawyers might take me to the cleaners were I to be disrespectful towards them; I say without disrespect that we must be satisfied that they will not foul the process up. In the days before the 1992 legislation, local authorities ran further education and had a proprietorial attitude towards their institutions. I say from my own experience that it was difficult to go outside one's area to attend a different further education institution. That was instanced by the difficulty in obtaining transport without having to pay for it. I would not seek to claim for the purpose of the Committee that everything was perfect in the world of further education after 1992, but at least providers became freestanding of the local education authority. It was easier for a time, although difficulties again arose as local authority provision for discretionary awards became harder.

<P>
We all want people to go where it is best for them to study or to train. The Minister is nodding. It is a truism to say that we want security. I want the Minister to say that we will not have a difficulty if somebody crosses a boundary to achieve that objective. Further, I want to hear that the arrangements either are in place or will be put in place through the guidance, as the Minister suggested, to ensure that providers and local councils that fund the providers will sort out issues. There might have to be a clearing house if more people are imported to an area for education, just as many schools and sixth form colleges take or export populations. We need to know that the process can happen relatively smoothly.

<P>
I also want to raise a matter that worried me after I had tabled the amendment and after I had listened to earlier exchanges on clause 20 and Government amendment No. 173. Where the Government have recognised that sensible cross-border provision could be made for groups of individuals, either because it made sense to do so or because there was a national facility, I have no argument with them. I am not necessarily asking the Minister to reach a final conclusion now, but as the clause defines as relevant for the purposes of guidance both RDAs and LEAs, and as the Minister has sensibly conceded that collective cross-border issues will exist, will he re-examine those provisions to see whether they could embrace the involvement of the next door RDA or LEA in order to consider collective provision? The last thing we want is a turf dispute or row between two RDAs about cross-border provision. It would be better to be inclusive and to involve both RDAs rather than to exclude one of them and cause offence.

<P>
This is a sensitive issue. I assure the Minister that I am not trying to create difficulties but, in my experience, as a constituency Member and local resident who spends a great proportion of my time brokering such issues in cases where people move across boundaries because they have to do so in order to get what they need-whether that is in education or other provision-it is important for the system to work in a joined up way, both in legal terms, so that people do not sue us, and in practical terms so that people can go where they need to go.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I hope I can reassure the Committee that we want joined-up common sense. [Laughter.] It was not that funny.

<P>
As we have heard, the amendments are all linked in that they deal with the role of RDAs in local LSC planning. They would remove the requirement for local LSCs to have regard to and consult RDAs in preparing their local plans. We believe that that would damage the close working relationship that we want to promote between LSCs and RDAs. A good relationship between those two public bodies has been a theme of many of our debates.

<P>
RDAs have an important statutory role to play in skills issues, which is why they should feature in the Bill as statutory consultees of local councils. Opposition Members clearly wish that RDAs would go away-[
Interruption.] The hon. Member for Hertsmere confirms that wish. However, I do not understand why they are so hostile to bodies that have specific duties to promote the development of regional economies and which are business led. Given current Conservative ideology, I am unsure whether the era of U-turns is over. If it is not, I suspect that we might see a U-turn on RDAs in forthcoming years from Conservative Members.

<P>
I share the hon. Gentleman's wish, set out in amendment No. 135, that LSCs should consult organisations that represent business, including small businesses. However, apart from the problems of defining such organisations, we do not think it sensible to specify non-statutory bodies as consultees of local councils. Were we to do so, we would end up with a very long list. We should leave the matter to the LSC, backed up, if necessary, by guidance from the Secretary of State or the use of his powers under subsection 5(c).

<P>
The interests of business will be fully reflected within local LSCs. We have discussed how that must include the voice of small businesses. We intend that 40 per cent. of the members and the majority of chairmen will have recent business or commercial experience. We shall seek, where possible, to ensure a good range of business experience across the different sectors. The LSC's services will meet the work force development needs of small firms-we had a useful discussion about the difficulties of achieving that goal-including through services delivered by the Small Business Service. Amendment No. 165 would have some onerous results. I agree that there should be adequate consultation with RDAs if there is a reasonable amount of what I might call cross-border traffic. We shall deal with that in guidance to the LSC.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I should address the question that has been hovering around us today-whether funding allocations to local LSCs will reflect that cross-border traffic. The answer is yes, as I said earlier. The funding consultation document, to be published on 12 May, contains our proposal that local LSCs should be funded according to the number of people who study with providers in their areas rather than according to the population resident in that area. The Government amendment to clause 20, which we debated this morning, will facilitate that.

<P>
I hope, in the light of my assurances, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was helpful. The Committee will probably not achieve consensus on RDAs. However, we are anxious that the consultation arrangements and development plans should work properly. As I emphasised when moving the amendments, the cross-border arrangements should work sensibly. The Minister has responded in a thoroughly responsible way; he has also given us assurance on the central issue of funding.

<P>
It could just be that reservations were held about persons studying across the border subjects that were rather unsuitable. However, if a pattern has developed that is no longer sensible, it is probably a matter for the local council to sort out. At the back of all our minds is the wish that individuals should, whenever possible, have the freedom of choice to go wherever they want, unconstrained by administrative problems. Having received those assurances, I do not wish to detain the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 10, line 28, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) any relevant institutions providing programmes of higher education'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is designed to probe the Government's intentions on the important interface between the traditional view of further education and higher education in local learning and skills plans. The Government have told us of their intention to develop a seamless service; indeed, we have seen that happen in some institutions. Reference has already been made to Harrogate college in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, which now has higher education status and provides further education courses.

<P>
In some cases, the institutions themselves will cross the boundaries. In others, the institutions will remain separate yet have an increasingly complementary role as students progress through the system. People in the further education and higher education sectors recognise that such integration has not always worked as well as it should.

<P>
The amendment does not seek to elevate the status of higher education over that of further education. We simply want to tease out how to improve matters in the context of the local learning and skills plans. In my area, for instance, in the perverse way of these things, the university of Sheffield is mostly located in my constituency of Sheffield, Hallam, whereas Sheffield Hallam university is located mostly in the constituency of the Minister for Trade, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn). Between them, those two universities are important providers to the local population as well as to students from outside. They have an increasing role to play in developing the local work force as far as level 4, as well as doing outreach work in the community to help students who might want to progress to university institutions. I hope that more of that work will be possible in the new learning and skills framework.

<P>
I am interested in how the Government intend to build significant players into the equation when the learning and skills plans are drawn up. I hope that they will view that as a key component, of benefit to the many students who are able to progress from a low level of education to level 4 qualifications in a higher education institution.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I echo the sentiments of the hon. Member for Hallam. The matter needs investigation and will attract the attention of several members of the Committee, including Labour Members.

<P>
I have some sympathy with the Government to the extent that they do not want to confuse the missions of higher and further education, or to produce some kind of fused sector, not least because higher education often has a wider mission; equally, however, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it also has an important regional and local function. Two further considerations are, first, that some prestigious universities run, or attach their brand to, departments of extra-mural studies, and have always regarded that as part of their remit and, secondly, that-whether or not one likes them, and in so far as one can identify them at present-the Government's proposals for new level 4 qualifications, which might be made available through further education, are relevant.

<P>
It would be unfortunate if the reforms took place and plans were established with no reference to higher education, as if it did not exist. It is often co-located in the same city or area, and many people, as the hon. Gentleman said, quite reasonably aspire to progress through further education to higher education, or, in certain cases, in the reverse direction-by which I mean not that they undergo academic regression, but that, having achieved a degree, or even a higher degree, they might want to top up their skills later. No one would argue that that was undesirable; it is highly desirable. We want a proper assurance from the Minister about what Winston Churchill called ``jaw, jaw'', rather than ``war, war''. The more that the sectors can be seen to work actively together, as many people, both in higher education and in further education or training, would want, the better things will be all round.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): I, too, want to explore the Government's view. I was a casualty of the war mentioned by the hon. Member for Daventry-I taught at a further education college but the bulk of what I taught was higher education and the college was in direct competition with the university, less than a mile away across the river. The local councils' plans should make it clear that such closely identified institutions should be consulted and actively engaged so that they can ensure that all course provision is adequate for student needs and that the different skills and experiences of higher and further education institutions can be taken into account.

<P>
Examples that spring to mind are courses such as the certificate in management studies, to which people with no formal qualifications-supervisors at work-may aspire for job enhancement. That formal qualification could help them in their career. Those courses can now be obtained either at the college of further education or at the university. It is through such collaboration that we shall succeed with the lifelong learning agenda. That will be achieved by involving higher education bodies at the planning stage.

<P>
I am pleased to say that, in Worcestershire, following the creation of the Hereford and Worcester task force, the university sector has been involved in that way, so there are signs that the message is getting through about the importance of further education and higher education institutions working together. I should like to hear the Minister's views on that. The days of strict demarcation between further education and higher education have long gone, as the hon. Member for Hallam said. It is important to remember that when we plan for our constituents and for the economic units that we hope to engage in education and training.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Chaytor </B>(Bury, North): I want to echo the remarks of other hon. Members on this interesting amendment. While I recognise that we do not intend to bring about a fusion of the further education and higher education sectors-although who knows how things might develop in years to come-we can no longer afford to ignore either the increasing involvement of further education colleges in the delivery of higher education or the increasing openness of many higher education institutions. Of course, one of the aims of Government policy during the past three years has been to encourage higher education institutions to be far more open, to develop partnerships with colleges and to be more responsive to their immediate communities.

<P>
The learning and skills council for Manchester will embrace the geographical areas of 10 local authorities and five institutes of higher education: Manchester Victoria university, Manchester Metropolitan university, university of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Salford university and Bolton Institute of Higher Education, which has applied for university status. That represents one of the largest concentrations of higher education in any conurbation in western Europe, and all those institutions enjoy good relationships with their further education colleges. Given the sizeable budgets that are now being brought together under LSCs, it makes sense to consider how higher education can be involved-I am not necessarily suggesting a high level of involvement-in the allocation of those budgets.

<P>
I want to make two further points. First, it is increasingly realised that higher education institutions are important not only for the delivery of education in the traditional sense, but because they have a major role to play in regional economic development. In recent years, many dynamic business innovations have emerged from work done in universities, and that will continue to be the case. If one looks around the world to see where most innovation is taking place in both manufacturing and service industries, one finds that there is a very close relationship between innovation and the research facilities of major universities. The Government's approach makes a lot of sense from the point of view of creating links with RDAs and the drive for regional economic development, in which universities have an important role to play-a role that is only just beginning to develop apace.

<P>
Secondly, in many parts of the country where lifelong learning partnerships have already been established, universities have a place in that partnership. In one sense, it would be paradoxical if a university were represented on the lifelong learning partnership, which is a lower order body with a consultative role, but did not have a role to play on the LSC itself. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> I rise to support and to endorse everything that my hon. Friends the Members for Worcester and for Bury, North have said.

<P>
I want to place the relationship between higher and further education in the context of all the developments that are occurring at the present time, which include the Government's introduction of foundation degrees, the considerable target of ensuring that 50 per cent. of young people are in higher education-which will involve a large number of students from the further education sector-and recognition by those involved in university education of the crucial need to co-operate with further education, which was shown in the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals' report on the current links between higher education and further education.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I remind the Minister that in the Select Committee's deliberations on post-16 provision, which he chaired, numerous examples were given of the extent to which further education and higher education need to work far more closely together and are doing so. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that the new LSC framework provides every opportunity for universities and other higher education institutions to be involved and consulted and to offer their expertise without challenging their autonomy.

<P>
The importance of outreach programmes, which are especially significant for inner-city areas, has already been pointed out. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North and the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam have referred to the inner-city areas where higher education institutions are making a concerted effort to reach out to people who have not traditionally participated in higher education. In the light of the modular development of higher education, the ability to dip in and out between further education and higher education will be increasingly important. Any opportunities that the LSC structure can provide to encourage and offer such opportunities should be taken.

<P>
Blackpool and the Fylde college, which is situated in my area, is an associate college of Lancaster university. The number of people whom I know personally who are doing higher education courses as a result of having originally enrolled in further education courses at Blackpool and the Fylde are testimony to that. I appreciate that the Government have a difficult balance to strike. They do not want to broaden the overall scope of the Bill unnecessarily or to include provisions that will restrict future developments, as has been mentioned. I acknowledged that difficulty at Second Reading, when I referred to the concerns expressed by Baroness Warwick and Lord Dearing. I said that it was extremely important for universities and higher education institutions to be encouraged and nourished under the new structures, and I believe that those are the appropriate terms to use.

<P>
Even if the Government will not accept the amendment in the proposed form, I strongly urge the Minister to consider it and to take on board with clear affection-if I may use a Calvinist phrase-the points that have been made. Will he reflect on further ways in which encouragement and nourishment can be included in the Bill on report without unnecessarily elongating the bureaucracy?

<P>

<B>Valerie Davey </B>(Bristol, West): I, too, welcome this debate. I rise to share with the Committee the idea that came to my mind when I first heard about the Bill. Until then, I had not heard the acronym that is constantly being used in our discussions, and suddenly had a vision of local London Schools of Economics. The idea of the London School of Economics having departments around the country that debate education issues and bring about economic development seemed a masterful stroke, or, dare I say it, a mistressly stroke, and I hoped that the Government were considering it. I found out later that that was not to be, but I trust that this aspect of further education and higher education will be taken seriously.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As a graduate of the LSE myself, I have found it confusing to say LSC. Although it might seem that LSE-educated Ministers run the Department for Education and Employment, we do not support Houghton street imperialism.

<P>
In considering amendment No. 49, I reviewed Liberal Democrat concerns about the perceived exclusion of higher education from the new post-16 framework and what was believed to be the creation of an artificial divide between further education and higher education. The amendment has given us the opportunity to have a fuller discussion on the relevance of higher education to the Government's overall objectives. We, too, want to remove unnecessary barriers so that there is a seamless education and training system that will encourage learners to progress from school to further or higher education. That is why we are proud that one third of our young people have been enabled to enter higher education in recent years. Higher education offers an important progression route for those who move from further education and work-based training. Our discussion becomes more relevant as we move towards achieving the Prime Minister's target of 50 per cent. of younger people who are enabled to attend university.

<P>
I welcome the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough to the Committee-I am sure that he will wait at least 35 seconds before intervening. It is important to acknowledge that there is two-way traffic. It is not just a matter of people in further education moving on to higher education; the traffic can flow the other way. When I was a relatively junior lecturer at Brunel university in the early to mid 1970s, part of my responsibility was to teach social policy to people who were studying social work at MPhil level. I argued with my department that, as well as teaching the traditional subjects of case work and psychoanalysis, it might be useful to teach welfare rights. No senior member of staff in the department backed me, partly because they did not think that welfare rights was an academic subject. My argument that it might benefit social work clients if social workers knew about the complexities of the welfare state did not cut much ice.

<P>
I approached Hillingdon LEA which agreed to run a welfare rights course for several weeks in the evenings. Many of my MPhil students attended, together with some Hillingdon citizens, to learn about the complexities of our welfare state. That is one anecdotal example of how the system cuts both ways. I recently met someone who had benefited greatly from further education in the Bournemouth area. Although he had a PhD, he went to a further education college to improve his accountancy skills. That bears out my assertion there is two-way traffic.

<P>
The amendment is not necessary to ensure co-operation and collaboration. Higher education is and will remain an integral part of our wider post-16 agenda. We will ensure that higher education institutions and the Higher Education Funding Council work closely with the LSC and the new structures. The new arrangements provide scope for greater collaboration and sharing of facilities between universities, further education colleges and adult continuing education institutions. That is why the LSC and the equivalent Welsh council will have the powers to fund forms of higher education, such as higher national diplomas, as the further education funding councils do now.

<P>
I will spend a few moments giving examples of successful collaborations that we are already promoting and that we will ensure the continuance of in the new arrangements. The HEFC and the FEFC administer a joint fund to support projects that build pathways from further to higher education for disadvantaged groups through links between further and higher education institutions. A host of innovative and exciting projects around the country is already being funded. I hope that the Committee will allow me to give two examples.

<P>
The first example concerns the York progression partnership, which involves the college of Ripon and York St. John, City of York council, Guidance Enterprises group, North Yorkshire TEC and the City of York lifelong learning partnership. York college leads the project. It brings together all providers and support services for learning in the city. It will provide enhanced academic and personal support and guidance for targeted further education and higher education students in the first term, and will train a team of role model higher education students to act as mentors to further education students. It will also undertake an awareness-raising campaign of both further education and higher education opportunities for employees through employer and trade union links. That is a good example of good practice.

<P>
My second example is from Birmingham. The project there gives opportunities for higher education to Muslim women in their communities. Research showed that many Bangladeshi and Pakistani women were missing out on higher education because they were unable or unwilling to travel to a university or college. Last year, the HEFC committed £40,000 to a project led by the university of Birmingham Westhill to offer courses on a trial basis to four community-based centres in south and east Birmingham. To build on the success of the courses, the project will be funded for a further three years at a total cost of £154,000 and will include other local further education colleges. Funds will be used to draw more Muslim women into learning, to offer progression groups to those already studying and to extend the use of IT facilities. A summer school is planned to raise awareness in the local communities of higher education opportunities.

<P>
We want the LSC and the HEFC to work closely together on initiatives such as the joint fund. The national LSC will invite to its meetings the HEFC chief executive. We are amending the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to ensure that the LSC can work with the HEFC as the FEFC currently does, where that will help the bodies to function more effectively.

<P>
At a national level, the LSC will draw together authoritative advice on skills supply and demand by convening, with the HEFC and other agencies, an advisory group of leading experts in the field of skills research and information. It will also work closely with the HEFC and with higher education institutions to achieve the national learning target for level 4-the first degree equivalent.

<P>
I have stressed the links and pathways from further to higher education. I should also mention the successful work done to promote modern apprenticeships as a progression route to higher education. We will want to see continued the work that TECs have been doing to encourage higher education institutions to see work-based training as a route into higher education. In 1998-99, almost 22,000 people with national vocational qualifications at level 3, rather than A-levels, were accepted for higher education courses.

<P>
I will give an example that might be familiar to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central. Leeds TEC has been working with the city's two universities on a scheme called ``Learning Power''. That is an innovative programme giving young people the chance to gain university qualifications for practical study, which benefits both participants and their employers. We are starting to see the first successful students in the pilot at Leeds Metropolitan university, who started their learning progression through modern apprenticeships.

<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> As the Minister is giving a comprehensive and encouraging account of interactive developments, I expect that he would not want to leave out the matter of graduate apprenticeships, in which active experience and involvement in work, over and above what happens in the traditional sandwich course, is built into the graduate programme. That may be a powerful and multi-skilled offering for someone at higher education level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I certainly recognise the importance of the graduate apprenticeships. Also, as has been mentioned, our plans for foundation degrees are a further example of our innovative thinking about the future of higher education.

<P>
Local learning partnerships will also be important, as they provide a forum in which providers, including higher education institutions, can work together to fill gaps in, and improve the quality of, local provision. Hon. Members will, I hope, be impressed to hear that higher education institutions are already involved in 62 per cent. of local partnerships. Higher education institutions lead the partnerships in Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Hull.

<P>
Local learning partnerships provide the forum and the stimulus for effective collaboration. Two more examples may be familiar to some of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North may know of the excellent work by the East Lancashire learning partnership to bring together higher and further education institutions with other partners on its higher level skills and work force development working group. It intends to ensure that local provision in both further and higher education institutions complements other local provision and meets demands from employers and individuals. It also aims to improve access and widen participation in programmes that lead from adult and community provision to higher education-another important route and link.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey), who I know cannot be with us today, may also know of the work that the Milton Keynes and North Buckinghamshire learning partnership is doing to help higher and further education institutions and local training providers to work together on skill requirements for companies that want to locate in Milton Keynes.

<P>
I could give many similar examples. The key point, and my reason for wanting to highlight all that excellent work, is that neither the amendment nor any other changes to the Bill are required to bring about collaboration. Sometimes there is confusion outside this place about the fact that what is necessary in a Bill, for the purpose of making law, is not always the same as listing everything-including all the institutions-that is considered important. We are, after all, legislators.

<P>
Local LSCs will most certainly want to consult higher education institutions and, indeed, other providers of learning, when preparing their plans. However, rather than giving an endless list of the types of bodies that local LSCs should consult, the clause should set out only those local and regional bodies that have specific statutory responsibilities in relation to the LSC's functions. Those are the local authorities and regional development agencies, as provided for in subsection 5(a) and (b). However, a reserve power under subsection (5)(c) is available if intervention by the Secretary of State is needed because of failure to consult other bodies that should be consulted. I very much doubt that that will be needed for higher education institutions, since local LSCs will certainly want to consult them. However, I assure the hon. Member for Hallam that we will encourage local LSCs to consult higher education institutions-including through guidance to the LSC and, if necessary, use of the power under subsection (5)(c).

<P>
Higher education institutions, their representatives and the Higher Education Funding Council are, and will continue to be, key players in the post-16 agenda. Indeed, I would hazard a guess that, although this debate is important today, it will be more important in the years and decades ahead.

<P>
I have spoken at some length because the matter is crucial to the success of our post-16 agenda. Indeed, the importance of the subject has been indicated by the Opposition's contributions, and by the interesting contributions made by my hon. Friends the Members for Worcester (Mr. Foster), for Bury, North, for Blackpool, South, and for Bristol, West. I believe that we have the necessary framework to achieve the sort of effective collaboration and co-operation that all hon. Members want. I hope that my assurances will enable the hon. Member for Hallam to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his full response. I am grateful also to hon. Members on both sides for their contributions. I was encouraged to hear the Minister say that he will issue guidance, and I hope that it will be specific in respect to the local LSCs. It is not only the Higher Education Funding Council that needs to be considered; it is important also that the local providers are fully integrated into the planning provision. We shall consider the Minister's response in detail once we can see it in writing. We may return to the matter of higher education links into the LSC system at a later date. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move to amendment No. 137, in page 10, line 36, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(7A) The Council must publish any specified alterations it requires a local council to make under subsection (7) above'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Subsection (7) envisages the Learning and Skills Council approving the plans submitted by the local LSC or requiring the local council to make specified alterations. If required to make alterations by the central council, the local council must make them. It is significant that the central LSC can, in effect, override the local council. The purpose of the amendment is to draw attention to that. If the central LSC makes such alterations and overrides the judgment of the local council, it is not unreasonable that it should be prepared to publish its reasons.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> As we have heard, the amendment would require the national council to publish any alterations that it tells a local LSC to make to its annual local plan. We heard once again the rather misplaced criticisms of top-downery and centralism. I do not accept the picture painted by the hon. Gentleman. Subsection (7) is a simple safeguard to ensure that local plans are consistent and coherent with the priorities and resources of the LSC as a whole. Again, it is a bit of joined-up common sense.

<P>
The amendment would cause problems on two fronts. First, it would add an additional layer to an already extensive planning and consultation process, and I know that Opposition Members are particularly concerned to avoid further bureaucracy. Secondly, in a most unhelpful way, it would interfere in the relationship between the local and national councils. In any planning process, when a national body has occasionally to make some difficult decisions about priorities, it should be able to engage in such discussions without the need for extra bureaucracy.

<P>
I assure the Committee that we do not intend that the national council will be heavy-handed in its scrutiny of local plans. Its role, consistent with local decision making, will be to ensure that the local LSC allocations between different learners are consistent with the national assessment. However, on the rare occasions when a local LSC produces a plan that is at variance with the priorities agreed by the national council and following the Secretary of State's guidance, or that takes insufficient account of the funding that is available, it is appropriate that the national council, as a unitary organisation, should be able to require the local council to make changes.

<P>
The system will not mean rewriting plans or imposing solutions from above; we want dialogue between the national and local councils. If the national council requires changes because of different funding priorities, for example, it will be for the local council to determine how to give effect to those changes in terms of their impact on budget allocations to individual providers for initiatives. Adding a requirement for the national council to publish those changes would not be helpful. Local plans will be part of an involving and collaborative process following wide consultations and discussions between the local LSC and other bodies. On the rare occasion when a plan might be changed by the national council, the local LSC would be bound to inform interested parties about significant changes, not least because local LSCs are already required to publish their plans when they have been approved by the national LSC.

<P>
In view of my assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I did not use the expression ``top down'' in speaking to the amendment, but it has provoked a certain response-

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Guilty conscience.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> As my hon. Friend says, guilty conscience on the part of the Minister.

<P>
I do not draw as much reassurance from what the Minister said as I would like to, but he said that he hoped that the central LSC would not be heavy handed in using the power. He made other observations about how he expects the power to be used. On the basis of the Minister's remarks and because we want to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry that the Minister was disappointed that I was not present earlier; I should like to have been here when the higher education provisions were discussed.

<P>
I want to raise the issue of higher education within the learning and skills council, as the subject is hardly mentioned in the Bill, and we believe that the Government have missed an opportunity. Liberal Democrats support the RDA system, and what I am about to say is not a criticism of the Government; however, the involvement of higher education in RDAs is very patchy. A commonly held view by many members of RDAs and by some chairmen and chief executives is that the higher education sector is a revenue cost to the region, rather than an investment and an opportunity.

<P>
In drafting the Bill, the Government missed an opportunity to cement a relationship between the learning and skills councils, the RDA and higher education institutions. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam, the Minister said that he did not want to put everything in the Bill, and I understand that, but higher education can bring opportunities for level 4-plus qualifications and become part of a region's investment strategy.

<P>
Another important aspect of the Bill that has received scant attention from Opposition members of the Committee as well as from the Government is the work of business. The Bill will underpin our future competitiveness in regional development and regeneration; to exclude the universities and their vital role in that respect is very sad. I hope that the Minister will reflect on the role of the universities in the regions and in the Bill. Perhaps on Report he will think about universities and higher education not as a cost to the regions and to the country, but as one of the greatest investments in the country's future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall not rehearse the assurances that I sought to give earlier about our commitment to see higher education as part of our strategy for post-16 learning and education as a whole-I hope that I provided some reassurance. The involvement of universities in local learning partnerships is an important indicator of that commitment. Much good practice, only some of which I was able to cite, is another indicator.

<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I agree with the main theme set out by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, which was that, whatever their important social and educational roles, our university and further education sectors are key economic institutions in our communities and bring in much income. The links that they have or need to forge with business, trade unions and communities are a crucial part of economic development. Furthermore, in terms of international competitiveness, the sector is one of the things that we are good at, which is important, given that many institutions attract students and research money from overseas.

<P>
Whether we are considering the role of the LSC or the RDAs-I know that the hon. Gentleman is committed to the RDAs- the university sector is a key dynamo of economic change. In arguing that the clause stand part of the Bill, I should say that we are keen for developments in higher education to be related to our overall strategy.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 22, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(and connected organised leisure-time occupation)'.-[Mr. Wicks.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I understand why Ministers have given the clause its present shape, but from my own experience it seems to be tailor-made for persons who want to make trouble. We are talking about LEAs' provision for over-19s, and their practice in that area has been somewhat uneven, to put it mildly.

<P>
Until now, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has had a duty to provide resources through the standard spending assessment, in which there is a notional educational component, as well as sub-components. LEAs must also discharge their duties under the Education Act to provide adult learning. Those duties are somewhat nebulous and are more honoured in the breach than the observance by some authorities, although others still have a high level of provision. It is not terribly easy within the existing structure to take matters to judicial review because the duties are rather wide.

<P>
Under the new arrangements, however, there will be an opportunity for consultation, and it would be odd if there were not. However, I can imagine a problem arising, particularly if relations between a local authority of one political colour and a Government of another become politically charged. To summarise, the authority might say, ``Won't,'' the Secretary of State might say, ``Shall,'' and the LEA might riposte, ``Won't, because you will not give us enough money to do it.'' Virtually all those stages, and certainly the third one, are judicially reviewable. The Minister might think that he has produced a clear structure, but he has provided wonderful opportunities for highly paid lawyers to dispute the issues between the various public authorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The clause enables the Secretary of State to direct local education authorities to make provision for adult education in accordance with the terms of the local learning and skills council's plan. He may direct the LEA to make provision for adult education only if the LSC provides the authority with financial resources. I emphasise that this is a backstop provision. Local authorities will be a key partner of the local LSC. They are guaranteed full consultation. They are the only body for which the local LSC, in its local plan, must specify a role. We have already debated the funding guarantee that the Secretary of State has given to LEAs to ensure that they continue to play a leading role in adult and community education when the LSC is established.

<P>
The Local Government Association made an accurate assessment in its briefing on the clause. It stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>provided that the plan is a genuinely joint one, there should be no circumstances in which the Secretary of State would need to issue directions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree. Indeed, without a proper planning process, it would be unreasonable for the Secretary of State to use his power of direction.

<P>
The clause provides necessary protection of the interests of local people where, despite the clear provisions in the LSC's plan, and available resources, a local authority fails to deliver provision as required. I hope that the Committee agrees that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 23, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clause 24 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 12, line 4, leave out from ``concern'' to end of line 5 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) the provision of financial resources in respect of activities carried on by a particular person or persons or

<P>
(b) the reorganisation of education for persons from the age of 16 to 19 where such education is currently the responsibility of the education authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Clause 25 deals with directions from the Secretary of State to the LSC. Amendment No. 139 would prevent the Secretary of State from giving directions to the council on the reorganisation of education for 16 to 19-year-olds where it is currently the responsibility of LEAs. We are concerned about guaranteeing the protection of sixth forms from directions by the Secretary of State to the LSC. Does the Minister think that the Secretary of State would be able to use this power to give directions to interfere in schools' sixth forms?

<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> With amendment No. 139 we have another rerun of a matter that was raised more than once in another place. Clause 25(6) prevents the Secretary of State from intervening in the funding allocations made by the LSC to a particular person or group. I am sure that the Committee agrees that this core function of the LSC should be carried out independently of Government. There must be no allegations of political interference in funding decisions.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman said, as did Baroness Blatch, that he thinks that the Secretary of State should not be able to issue directions on how the LSC should exercise its functions over reorganisations of 16-19 provision by local education authorities. My noble Friend Baroness Blackstone explained fully in another place why it is essential that the Secretary of State be given power to intervene in any case where he believes that the LSC has acted unreasonably-with the single exception of directions relating to the LSC's funding of individual providers. It may be helpful if I run through the arguments a third-and final-time, for the benefit of the Committee.

<P>
The LSC's functions in respect of the reorganisation of LEA provision are limited to participation as a voting member on school organisation committees where 16-19 matters are involved; making proposals for the incorporation of LEA-maintained 16-19 institutions; and making proposals for the closure of LEA-maintained 16-19 provision that OFSTED has found to be failing, or significantly weak, and that has failed to make the necessary improvements.

<P>
It is likely that the Secretary of State will wish to give guidance to the LSC on some of the three functions in the same way that guidance has been issued to relevant bodies about other school organisation matters. The amendment would not prevent that and the issuing of guidance is one of the Department's usual functions. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the way in which the Secretary of State may give directions to the LSC about the use of its powers, but I hope that he will also consider the reverse situation. What will happen if the LSC exercises the powers unreasonably?

<P>
The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from intervening if, for example, the LSC proposed the closure of a school sixth form that was not justified under the Bill's provisions. By seeking to exclude such matters from the clause, the amendment would weaken rather than strengthen the protection that is available to sixth forms, although I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention.

<P>
We do not want the Secretary of State to use his powers of direction to tell the LSC what to do in every detail. The LSC must be able to exercise its judgment sensibly. If it gets matters badly wrong, if it fails to perform its duties or if it exercises its powers unreasonably, it is right and proper for the Secretary of State to be able to step in. The Secretary of State should be able to do so in response to complaints from those whom the LSC might have treated unfairly.

<P>
In view of that explanation and assurance, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I have listened carefully to the Under-Secretary's remarks. I deliberately framed my opening remarks in terms of a question that was left open by Baroness Blackstone's response in another place, namely, is it possible for the Secretary of State to use the power to give directions to the LSC to interfere with school sixth forms? The answer is, yes, that is possible, and the Under-Secretary explained the circumstances in which that might be the case.

<P>
I shall reflect carefully on the Under-Secretary's comments on the reasonableness of the LSC's actions and on the additional protections that the Secretary of State may be able to offer sixth forms if the LSC acts unreasonably. Other courses of action may be open to those who are dissatisfied with the LSC and believe that it is acting unreasonably. If it acts unreasonably in the way in which the Under-Secretary described, it would lay itself open to challenge by judicial review. I am not convinced that the Secretary of State's power to give directions in such cases involves the sort of protection that the Under-Secretary suggested.

<P>
I shall reflect carefully on the matter, and I may return to it at a later stage. I make no apologies for raising the matter time and again, as it is important to go into all the details that are raised by this sensitive subject. On that basis, and in order to make further progress today, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Committees (England)</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 182, in page 62, line 29, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) The committee must also consider, and advise the Council on, what education and training would be appropriate for young persons of different abilities and aptitudes in order to prepare them for those opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life which are not connected to employment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment was tabled in response to commitments that were given on Third Reading in another place, namely, that the LSC should give due weight to the importance of wider learning opportunities for young people. I am pleased to be able to fulfil the commitment that Baroness Blackstone gave to Lord Northbourne. We want the LSC to make a real difference to people's-especially young people's-lives, by helping to support families and to build stronger neighbourhoods. That means that the LSC must play an important role in promoting the benefits of learning outside the workplace. That should cover the economic, personal, family and community benefits that learning can and should bring. That is why the meaning of post-16 education and training, which lies at the heart of the LSC's duties, has been drawn so widely in the Bill. The LSC has comprehensive powers to help with the wider learning needs of young people outside the workplace.

<P>
The young people's learning committee will play a key role in the work of the LSC. It will advise the national council on the best means of achieving the national learning targets for young people, including strategies for increasing participation and attainment, to ensure that as many young people as possible continue in learning until at least the age of 19.

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The committee's remit is already wide, and, even without the addition of the amendment to the Bill, I have no doubt that its members would regard it as important to consider how young people might, through learning, best be prepared for adult life outside the workplace. However, the amendment would ensure that the committee must consider and advise the council on that matter. That is a firm demonstration of the importance to the Government of the wider dimension of learning. When the Committee reaches the relevant clauses, we can discuss the role of the ConneXions service in enabling more young people to benefit, not just from learning and education, but from wider participation in voluntary activity and the community generally.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

<P>
The new clause has been on the amendment paper for some time, and the Minister and his officials have had ample opportunity to study it. It could be described-although I must be careful to whom I say it-as impeccably new Labour, because everybody in new Labour believes in partnership and collaboration. At least that resonates among Labour Members who are following what I am saying. Equally, I could say that it represents common sense.

<P>
More specifically, the new clause is without prejudice to the learning partnerships, which we discussed in relation to higher education and further education in particular. Of course higher and further education establishments and institutions collaborate, as they should-we do not need to rehearse that point again. The new clause simply relates to the powers of the council. It intends to give the Secretary of State and the council slightly greater flexibility by providing that partnership arrangements and collaborative activities with agencies and other statutory bodies or bodies corporate, even outside England, could be considered. That would not detract from the council's statutory duties and obligations to secure the provision of proper or adequate education; it simply allows it to work flexibly. I hope that the Minister will say that it can work flexibly, and that such activities are not ruled out.

<P>
The new clause is an attempt to provide the maximum opportunity for activities to be carried out in an economical or sensible way. For example, although I would not necessarily canvas the idea, the National Council for Education and Training for Wales and the LSC-I notice that a Welsh Minister has joined us in the Room-might wish to collaborate to have a joint secretariat on a particular problem. Alternatively, the LSC might wish to co-operate with a counterpart body in another European Union member state. There might also be an opportunity for some vertical activity that did not compromise its position with some education provider. None of those should be ruled out. It is in that spirit that I look forward to the Minister's response to the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Wills:</B> I can assure the hon. Member for Daventry that we are wholly in favour of partnership and collaboration, as he would expect, but I am afraid that I will disappoint him. The new clause is simply unnecessary. Under clause 18(1), the LSC has the powers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>do anything which appears to it to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of or in connection with the exercise of its other functions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I will explain how that might work in practice to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the new clause is unnecessary, as the LSC has all the powers that it needs to pursue its goals.

<P>
Clause 18(1) gives the LSC the powers that it needs to enter into partnership arrangements or collaborative activities, as the hon. Gentleman's amendment proposes. Like TECs, the LSC will play a key role in local partnership, as outlined in the LSC prospectus. For example, it will work in single regeneration budget and European social fund-based projects. It will also seek to build on collaborative arrangements between the higher education and further education sectors, through joint working between funding councils. The new arrangements will provide wider scope for collaborative activities between those sectors. We are amending section 82 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 to enable the LSC to exercise functions jointly with the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the HEFCE. That will help to ensure greater effectiveness and efficiency, when the councils judge that to be useful.

<P>
The LSC will also work closely with the HEFCE and with higher education institutions to achieve the national learning targets for level 4. I assure hon. Members that the LSC will build on best practice in collaborative ventures that exists already in the further education and work-based learning sectors. That is why we have given the LSC powers to accept financial resources from sources other than the Secretary of State, and to be a member of companies formed to run projects, provided that the Secretary of State agrees.

<P>
The LSC will continue to support the EC and EU training projects and programmes-for example, Socrates and Leonardo-which offer young people an opportunity to benefit from a different learning experience, not only within the EU but in eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and elsewhere. Since 1995, more than 81,000 young people in the United Kingdom have undertaken education, training or youth placements in EU member states. Those and similar ventures will be one way for the LSC to encourage a sharing of experiences and to effect a mutual understanding of the challenges to be faced in the context of the global community. I hope that gives the hon. Gentleman sufficient reassurance to withdraw the new clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That was a rare bird indeed-an almost entirely satisfactory response by a Minister, in the light of which I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
