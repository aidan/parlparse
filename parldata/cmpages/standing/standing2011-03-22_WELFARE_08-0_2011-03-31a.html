                           </span> Again, I am pleased to serve
under your guidance this afternoon, Mr Weir. I spent lunch time trying
to come up with a gag about bookcases and the Department for Work and
Pensions website, but I failed to come up with anything. What an
admission! How shameful for a Glaswegian not to be able to do that, but
I will have plenty of time to work on it in
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
had just reached the stage where I was asking the Minister whether the
Government intend to table specific amendments at the appropriate time
to enable hon. Members to scrutinise, decide and reflect. I want to get
into the substance of what the proposals are about and explore some of
their issues. I understand that the Government’s intention is to
align arrangements for disabled children with those of disabled adults,
to simplify the system. I appreciate the strong argument for that, but
the most important element of our discussions this afternoon is about
reprioritising existing resources to deliver more support for children
with the most severe disabilities. I accept that that is the
Government’s interesting intention, but it has many
implications.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government therefore intend to introduce two new disability additions
to replace the existing provision, and I am sure that the Minister will
explain them in detail when he replies to the debate. There will be a
higher and a lower addition. For families with disabled children, the
higher rate will increase by £1.50 a week. The current rate is
£74.50. There will be a qualifying benefit for children who
currently receive disability living allowance at the higher rate. A new
provision will extend entitlement to children with a severe visual
impairment.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000013">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that all hon. Members of all parties appreciate the real challenges
faced by families with children with severe visual impairments, and I
understand the rationale of the Government’s thinking on the new
provision. However, I want to focus on the other group of children,
because there are severe implications for them. Children

                           </div>who currently receive the middle rate of disability living allowance
will have the disability addition under the new proposals of universal
credit significantly reduced compared with their existing entitlement
to the disability element of child tax credit. It will be reduced from
existing arrangements of £52 per week to £25.95 a week.
That is a loss of about £26 per week for many families with
disabled
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000014">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Such
a significant reduction will have an impact on thousands of families,
and several families on the middle and lower rate of disability living
allowance will be caught by surprise. We all need to think about the
families who will be affected and the implications for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000015">&#160;</a>

agree that one of the difficulties for families with disabled children
is that the conditions are often less stable than for adults with
disabilities? By narrowing the test in such a way, parents will face
even greater uncertainty not only in respect of the financial

                           </strong> Yes, my hon. Friend makes an important point, and
as we consider the detail of the amendments and decide whether or not
to go ahead with the proposals, we will examine the testimony of
families and their experience, particularly families with the lower and
middle-rate care, because we cannot easily dismiss their experiences.
If children have such experiences, they still have significant
disabilities that have enormous implications for their family’s
income, lifestyle and quality of
life.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000017">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate that the Government are bound to argue that transitional
protection will be built into universal credit and will apply in this
respect, but I ask Members to look particularly at the briefing from
Every Disabled Child Matters, which refers to transitional protection
in some detail. It states:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000018">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Although

                        <p>As we discussed in the
evidence sittings, a change of circumstance could take that
transitional protection away from people, and we are still to have many
detailed debates about possible changes of circumstances. The fact that
another child might leave the house or a partner gets a job could
radically alter the family’s income and seriously undermine the
income of people with children in such circumstances. I ask hon.

my speech, the amendment is slightly out of kilter because it was
tabled with reference to the Bill, but, with your permission, Mr Weir,
I am now referring to the proposals that the Government have since
announced.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000021">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I will come
on to figures because we need to look at them. They are not yet
conclusive, but we have received early indications from some charities
and the Library, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 289<a class="bkMark" name="Column289">&#160;</a>
                           </div>as well as the Department for Work and Pensions to which I shall happily
refer later and perhaps in more detail if hon. Members would like me to
do so. Many families will be caught by surprise by the scale of the
Government’s proposal. I am sure that many hon. Members are now
aware, if they have had time to read their e-mails in the past 24
hours, how many charities have equally been caught by surprise and seem
to be fairly staggered by the nature of the proposal. For example,
Family Action estimates that 100,000 families will be affected and lose
about £1,366 per annum. That can equate to £20,000 in the
lifetime of a disabled child. A family with two disabled children could
lose £40,000. We are talking about a significant financial sum.
Every Disabled Child Matters argues strenuously that the proposal will
have a significant impact on child poverty, as we discussed this
morning. I quote again from its
briefing:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Childhood
disability is frequently a ‘trigger event’ for
poverty”.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000451">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have understood the debate and have listened with great interest to the
Minister talk about how we actually tackle poverty and get people back
to work. I am as passionate about getting people back to work as I am
about anything else, and I fundamentally believe that it is the answer
to poverty, but we must also understand that poverty is complex. If a
child has a disability, it can affect their ability to work. Perhaps
such children cannot work many hours and suchlike. I appreciate that
universal credit is part of an argument to answer some of the
challenges in respect of flexibility that it tends to provide, but
Every Disabled Child Matters is now arguing that the scale of the
change for families with disabled children undermines the universal
credit proposal and could be serious in how it is moved
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000023">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Like my hon. Friend, I am very passionate about
work as a good route out of poverty for all who are able to take it,
but does she agree that, even when parents of disabled children can
move into work, they often face higher in-work costs than other
parents, such as higher child care costs or higher costs of
transporting their child to safe child care places to enable them to go
to work. These premiums have helped families to close the gap when
meeting such
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000024">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Yes, again, I strongly agree with my hon. Friend.
Her knowledge is showing itself yet again and helping us to assess the
proposals. All charities for the disabled, as well as all families with
experience of disability, will talk of the extra costs of disability. I
appreciate that there could be debates about how the extra costs of
disability are met, and there is no doubt that people use the premiums
and elements as a way of assisting them to meet some extra costs. Even
child minding can be a different cost because the parent might need
someone to put specialist equipment in the house.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
children with several disabilities must get the support that they need.
I do not want to get into an argument about people with severe
disability, but they are being pitched against those with a lower
disability and that can sometimes be quite pernicious. We have to be
clear. I am sure that many constituents have made this clear to us. If
someone is a mother or a father of a child who is on the lower and
middle rate for disability, those needs and extra challenges cannot
easily be dismissed.

                           </span> Does my hon. Friend agree
that the difference between a disabled child who is on the middle rate
and one on the higher rate is quite small? A child needs substantial or
continued attention throughout the day to get the middle rate, which
involves the parents in an awful lot of looking after. A substantially
disabled child can get the middle rate, whereas a less disabled child
might get the higher rate because of the need for attention during the
night that is more than a child of that age would usually need. In my
experience, it is very difficult for the parents of a disabled child to
claim the higher rate. A much higher hurdle is put in their
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000027">&#160;</a>

illustrate the knowledge that she brings to our deliberations this
afternoon. In fact, the briefing from Citizens Advice also makes the
point in great depth about the experience of people on the middle rate
and what that involves for such families. It is incumbent on us to
appreciate what that is like, before making what the Government would
argue are such necessary
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000028">&#160;</a>

have a number of questions for the Government. As I have asked already,
will there be a specific amendment and when will we return to the
matter? I am sure that the Minister has got that point. Will an impact
assessment be attached, so that we can understand the full
implications? Why has there been such a steep
reduction—£26 a week is quite a
loss—and why is it of that order? Paragraph 4(f) of
“Additions for longer durations on Universal
Credit”—the document to which I referred
earlier—makes an interesting
point:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“More
generous uprating over the period 2003-10 has seen the child payments
increase at a faster pace than the adult payments, leading to a lack of
alignment in
rates.”<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000452">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

the Minister give us more

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government aim to align child and adult payments, so part of the
problem would seem to be that between 2003 and 2010 more emphasis was
placed on giving resources to disabled children slightly out of kilter
with disabled adults. We need to argue the rights and wrongs of that,
because the Government now seek to alter it. Is that the right policy?
Was it right to give slightly more resources to families with disabled
children than to disabled adults? There is still an argument for, and
it would be interesting to hear the argument
against.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
charities so far are saying that the case has not been made for that
change, as indicated by my hon. Friend the Member for
Manchester—forgive me, my hon. Friend the Member Stretford and
Urmston—my geography has improved enormously since I was elected
to the House. The point has been made that there are particular
stresses and strains in relation to children. Nevertheless, wherever we
stand in that debate, we need to think and argue it through as we move
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000032">&#160;</a>

existing resources within an envelope. I assume that the logic is a
transfer to children with the most severe disabilities, but that raises
some
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
the scale of the reduction, the implication is that there will be
significant savings. Where are those savings? What are they? What is
their scale? Where will they go? Will they go to children with severe
disabilities? If the savings do not go to that group, will they go to
other disabled children or to a broader range of people in the
universal credit system? On those details, the Government’s
proposals stand or fall.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000035">&#160;</a>

is very controversial, and it needs more time and thought. It is of
great import to the disability community, and it will have day-to-day
significance to those families who are working hard to care for their
children. I am sure that we have all received many significant
representations from that community, and it is one that we all must
listen to. Many of us may well have our own family experiences of such
matters. This is of great significance. Mr Weir, I signal again that my
amendment was tabled in a different context, so perhaps we can decide
how to pursue that after we have had the debate if I may be permitted

part of the difficulty that we get into in simplifying. No one would
say that they want to keep the complications in many current benefits.
Although such benefits have assisted a number of families, including
those with disabled children, they are complicated in how they operate
and interrelate, so yes, simplification is a good thing. As we have
said before, however, simplification has its own problems. Will people
lose out as a result? Are they people who we might not want to lose
out, and what is the exact qualification?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When people
see the apparent unfairness of some people getting larger payments than
others, they have a tendency to suggest that the answer is to level
down. We are told that payments for disabled children have become out
of kilter with payments for disabled adults and have risen faster. The
answer, we are told, is to align with the lower payment. There are
alternatives, however, even from the same financial envelope—we
could align somewhere in the middle. It is not essential to level on
the proposed basis.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000038">&#160;</a>

it is not good enough simply to say that existing families with
disabled children will be protected through the transition. We are
still uncertain what a change of circumstances will be and how long
transitional protection will operate. Obviously, such protection will
lose value over time, even if circumstances do not change. Families
will emerge constantly who did not expect to find themselves having to
claim, whether owing to an accident, a developing degenerative disease
or the birth of a child with disabilities. All those difficulties are
unpredictable, and there will be a fresh flow of people in such
circumstances. With a lower benefit, such people will lose out compared
with the previous position. It is therefore not good enough constantly
to say, “Well, it’s okay, because there will be
transitional protection, so that’s fine.” There will be
fresh examples of people falling into this group.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000039">&#160;</a>

people flexibility. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow East has
discussed the importance of people getting into work and the
difficulties that they may face, particularly if they have a disabled
child. Being able to work shorter hours may assist such people in
getting into work; nevertheless, the additional costs remain.
Additional income will become available to many people who work these
“mini-jobs”, which seems to be the trendy word for them.
The problem, however, will be that such jobs will be pretty
low-wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that the thinking behind universal credit, which I do not disagree
with, is that people should be enabled to progress—in the
fullness of time, having has the taste of a mini-job, they could go on
to do a midi-job and then a maxi-job. That is fine—they may or
may not be able to do that—but where people have a disabled
child, for example, the advantage of being able to work shorter hours
is clearly that it fits in with those responsibilities. It could suit
some of them, unlike some of the rest of us, who may well have fewer
caring responsibilities as our children get older and as they get to
secondary school age and no longer want us fussing around them quite so
much. One’s freedom to work longer hours does improve, although
there are some limits to
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000041">&#160;</a>

the parents of disabled children, it is a particular issue that such
arrangements continue. We are dealing with a group who may have the
flexibility to do some work, where previously they could do none, and
to earn a little more than they could have done previously, but in
low-wage jobs and on low hours, the increase will not be significant.
If other payments that were previously made to support that family are
taken away, they will indeed be worse
off.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000042">&#160;</a>

is always getting said in this debate is that, if we have not worked
out the finances and do not know how that money will be paid, we should
not make any suggestions. It is very difficult to use one subject area
and say that that is where we must put all our financial eggs in terms
of reductions or, we hope, future increases in expenditure. Choices
must be made across the whole political board. Hon. Members, even some
in the Opposition, will no doubt differ on how we do that and where we
would make those choices. On that basis, it is not unreasonable for us
to make proposals that will help people, even though they have a

                           </strong> Let me deal with this debate in two halves.
Clearly, the amendments focus very much on the nature of the clause,
which will make provision for an amount to be paid within the universal
credit in respect of a child or qualifying young person.
Amendment 21 would write into primary legislation that we
must include an increased amount if that child or qualifying young
person was disabled. Amendment 22 would create a similar
requirement if someone was severely
disabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000044">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me deal with that practical issue first. It is absolutely our intention
to have a two-tier structure of payments similar to child tax credit;
one rate for a disabled child and a higher amount for a severely
disabled child. The regulation-making powers in the clause will clearly
allow us to that, so I can reassure the hon. Member for Glasgow East on
that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
reasons for not writing this kind of thing formally into primary
legislation is that doing so removes flexibility. We have had one or
two cases in recent times—for example, over visual
impairment—where it has been necessary to return to primary
legislation to make a change if the direction of policy changes or
something arises that requires us to do something slightly differently.
In no way is this an attempt to derecognise severe disability or
disability; we are simply maximising the flexibility to deliver the
most appropriate system at any time. There is an absolute commitment
from us to retain those two
elements.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000046">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
also intend to retain the link with receipt of disability living
allowance, so that the payment for a severely disabled child or
qualifying young person is based on an entitlement to the highest rate
of the care component of DLA, or what will come out when we move over
to the personal independence payment in the future. We intend to expand
eligibility to the higher addition, so that severely visually-impaired
children can also receive the higher
rate.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000047">&#160;</a>

clarified something that he said a moment ago about retaining the

the situation on DLA has been so fast-changing in recent weeks, will he
clarify whether or not the intention is to replace children’s
DLA with PIP in the

                           </strong> At the moment, we are simply moving ahead with
PIP on adults. We have certainly not ruled out moving to PIP in the
future for children. At the moment, that link will apply under DLA; if
we move to PIP in the future for children, that link will be retained.
We are not making big changes, and I hope that that will allay the

me turn to the piece that is not in the Bill itself, but that is a
matter of concern, as articulated by the hon. Members for Glasgow East
and for Edinburgh East. I will start with a simple, clear statement:
this is not a savings exercise. We are reorganising what is there, so
that it fits in the best way possible into the universal credit
structure. What we are doing does not generate savings that move
outside the disability
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000050">&#160;</a>

about the disability world. What about the resources for disabled

                           </strong> Let me talk through what is effectively
happening and what we are doing within this mix. We have decided that
the current situation in which someone who reaches the age of 18
experiences a drop in the support that they receive is not right. We
have decided to harmonise the rates throughout. As the hon. Member for
Glasgow East has identified, that has the effect of releasing some
funds. We have looked at this in detail, and 146,000 families currently
get the disabled child element, of whom 58,000 get the severely
disabled child rate. Our intention is that, for those affected by the
proposed changes, transitional protection will avoid any cash reduction
at the point of change.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000052">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
key point is that the savings generated will be recycled into a higher
element at the support end of the spectrum. We are trying to create a
simple, streamlined system for the bands that exist within the
employment and support allowance for the middle, more severe group. We
want to recycle any funds generated as a result of the changes that we
are making into much higher support within the support group. That will
benefit the most severely disabled, and all the funds generated as a
result of the reorganisation of the system will be kept in that pot. I
freely admit that what is there at the moment will change. This is a
realignment. In many ways, as I said in my opening remarks about the
universal credit, when we take an existing system and try to realign it
into a streamlined, simple form, we get changes and consequences.
Everyone receives transitional protection, but the resulting released
funds will be recycled to those at the most severely disabled end of
the
spectrum.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000053">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister again; he has been very
generous in giving way. May I ask for clarification? I am not sure
whether I agree with his logic, but I understand it, and we may return
to some of the principles of the scale of the change. The resources
that severely disabled children get will increase by about £1.50
a week, from £73 to £74.50. I do not disregard
that—it is welcome and it will matter to the families—but
I do not think that it quite equates with the savings made by the
deduction from those who are on the middle rate. Will the savings from
the lower and middle rate all be given to children in the category of
severe disability, as the Minister understands that
category?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000054">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is not our intention to realise savings for
entirely unrelated purposes as a result of doing this. The aim is to
recycle the funds into the top end of the scale, so I can assure the
hon. Lady that our policy intent is to retain the money within the
disability world and to provide transitional protection for those
affected. Overall, the support that we provide to people with
disabilities will not and should not change as a result of what we are
doing. It will provide a welcome benefit for those at the support end
of the scale—the most severely disabled—who are clearly
among the most vulnerable and needy in our
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000055">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry; I am still not absolutely clear on the
impact of the changes on children. Is the Minister saying that all the
money that is released by removing the premiums from children on lower
and middle rates will go to children in receipt of the higher rate, or
is he saying that the money released may in part go to children but
might go to adults with disabilities as well? If so, in either
circumstance, what impact assessment in relation to children has been
carried
out?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000056">&#160;</a>

very detailed impact assessments on all aspects of the Bill. They are
there for her to see. We have set out a plan that brings back into
alignment the support that is provided for children and adults. The
rationale is that, when a young person grows up reaches the age of 18,
a family can experience a fall in their income, and we think that that
is not right. People have needs related to disability throughout their
lives, so we have created a single system going all the way through
that has led to adjustments to what people receive. We

                           </div>are providing transitional protection where those adjustments reduce the
amount of money that people receive. The money released as a result of
those adjustments will be reinvested in support for the most severely
disabled people. We do not make a distinction between children and
adults in that system, and I hope that that provides
clarification.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000057">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that clarifies the point. The Minister
describes a life-course approach for disabled people. Therefore, the
pot of money available to support disabled people is, in effect, a
single pot whether they are adults or children. Is that
correct?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000058">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We will provide life-course support. We are
trying to move beyond an artificial divide at the age of 18. When we
talk to families with disabled children, one of the big anxieties is
about what will happen to those children once they reach the age of 18.
I am not convinced that there is a case for variation in the support
received once children reach that age. We have thought through this
matter long and hard, and believe it to be the right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000059">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister has been generous in allowing repeated
interventions on this point, but it is so important to families with
disabled children and I am sure he will understand why I and my
colleagues are pressing the matter. The case has been made repeatedly
by parents that the cliff edge at 18 is difficult—the Minister
is right about that. In part, that cliff edge is difficult because so
many other forms of social support for people with disabilities change
at that moment. In other words, the support available from social
services for families with children who have disabilities is different
from the support they receive when those children become adults. I am
concerned that the Minister is saying that the financial support might
continue completely unchanged, when all the other support that that
person receives as they move from childhood to adulthood looks
different.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000060">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With respect, I fear that the provision of
services by local social services departments is beyond by remit,
although I recognise the issue to which she refers. This is a small way
to smoothe what can be an extremely difficult transition. We have
sought a life-course approach to supporting disabled people. We
recognise the issues raised in the two amendments about the need for
differing provisions for less-severely and more-severely disabled
people. We have included flexibility for future policy making in that
area, and we have clearly said that we are taking that life-course
approach. We will provide transitional protection where people are
affected, and across the whole field of support for people with
disabilities, a more aligned, simpler and more logical approach has
been created. That is the right approach to take. I hope I have
reassured Opposition Members and that the hon. Lady will accept the
status quo and withdraw the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000061">&#160;</a>

the Minister to ensure I get it correct. This is a significant change
that will matter enormously to many people. A debate should be had in
principle about the shift the Government are making towards a lifetime
approach, particularly in context of the significant reforms made to
existing benefits for disabled adults. If that were not changing,
perhaps it would be slightly less contentious. Given that the system is
changing so much and that so many adults will purportedly lose their
entitlement to the disability living allowance, this is a significant
step change. We must talk about the principle behind it, and hon.

the legislation because of the scale of change it represents. I will
try to find opportunities to pursue that appropriately during the

                           </span> We have had an interesting debate
on the amendments, and before we agree that the clause should stand
part of the Bill, I would just like to clarify a couple of
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
the Minister has just made it clear that the changes that the Secretary
of State announced to us during last Thursday’s sitting will be
in regulations. Would we therefore need to receive a revised note in
due course, or does the note that we have on regulations under clause
10 already incorporate those
changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
I believe that the Minister has just told us that the Government intend
to reduce support for disabled children in order to increase support
for disabled adults. Did I understand him correctly? Lastly, he said
that we have already received an impact assessment, but as the
announcement is different from what was intended when the original
impact assessment was published, I take it that there will need to be a
revised one. Is that the case and, if so, when is it likely to be
published?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000069">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me respond briefly to those points. First,
on the last point, the measure will in due course be subject to
regulations laid before the House, and under the rules that apply to
such things there will have to be an impact assessment for those
regulations, which will set the specific
rates.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000070">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry to interrupt so soon, but it is
important that we have the impact assessments for the entire Bill in
time for us to debate them on the Floor of the House. Can the Minister
confirm that we will have them on Report, at
least?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000071">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think that the right hon. Gentleman
misunderstands the point. The regulations are about what I described at
the start: the setting of individual rates. The legislation and the
accompanying regulations provide a framework for establishing rates of
support within the universal credit for people with less severe
disabilities and for people with more severe disabilities—in
this clause, children. The rates are set yearly—normally
uprated—on the basis of a decision by the Government of the day,
and are subject to regulatory approval and clearance by the House. At
that time, the individual amounts provided are subject to equality
impact assessments and all the various requirements of the legislation,
but that is not what we are discussing
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Both
in what the Secretary of State set out last week and the papers
provided, we have indicated to the Committee our policy intention,
which is to take the steps we have indicated and to provide
transitional protection. The shadow Minister is absolutely right; we
have taken a decision to realign, and that involves shifting resource
towards people with greater levels of disability. He asked about the
reduction in support for disability. People who are more severely
disabled in this support bracket will receive more support across the
life course than at
present.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000073">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to be precise about that. Does the Minister
propose to reduce the support for children in order to increase the
support for
adults?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000074">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> We propose no reduction at all for current
claimants; they will receive a transitional protection. For future
claims—new people in the system—we intend to make
adjustments so that payments are flattened out across a life course and
that we focus support more on people who are more severely disabled.
There is an important difference there. We do not intend to cut
benefits for current child claimants. We are introducing a new system
for the future and for future claimants, which is what we are doing
across a range of issues related to the universal credit. That,
however, is not what we are considering in the Bill
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000075">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am puzzled as to why the Minister is so reluctant
to confirm what I think he is now clearly saying, that the Government
are reducing support for children in order to increase support for

                           </strong> I simply stress that we are proposing how we
will operate the system in the future, not at present for existing
claimants. As the right hon. Gentleman rightly says, in the future the
balance will move so that resources are targeted more on those who are
more severely disabled. We will remove the divide that exists at the
moment between children and adults. That will be done through
regulation and will be subject to impact assessments at the time, and
we believe that that is a better overall approach to provide support
across the lifetime. What we are discussing in the clause stand part
debate is whether there should be an element of the universal credit to
support children and families and the extra cost and responsibilities
entailed, both for people who are disabled and for those who are not.
That is the question of the clause stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000077">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman continues to
misunderstand the difference between what happens under the regulation
powers in the Bill as time goes by and the measures of the Bill itself.
Decisions about the level of each element of the universal
credit—the actual amounts—and the impact of the decisions
about the amounts and the relationship between them will be subject to
an impact assessment when they are brought before the House. We have
set out in quite a lot of detail our initial intention for the things
that we intend to put in place as part of the universal credit, so that
hon. Members on both sides have a sense of what our policies are when
we implement the measures in the Bill. The existing duty to produce
detailed impact assessments, as we have done, probably goes far beyond
the requirements of the Bill. We have put as much detail as possible
before the House, and there will be further details when the regulatory
powers come
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000079">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand what the Minister is saying about
doing a detailed impact assessment on rates at the time when we have
firm proposals about them, but surely we can already make an impact
assessment of the overall impact on children, on their outcomes and
potentially on child poverty. Does the impact assessment that has been
done for the Bill to date cover the proposal that we are currently
debating in those
regards?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000080">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have looked at the proposals in the context

                           </strong> Again, I am puzzled as to why the Minister is
unable or unwilling to answer what I think is a straightforward
question. The impact assessments that have been published contain many
figures about people who lose and gain and assumptions about rates. Is
the assessment that reflects this clause still correct, in light of the
change in policy that the Secretary of State announced last Thursday?
It is simply yes or
no.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000082">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> The answer is yes. As I keep saying to the right
hon. Gentleman, the impact assessment that has been published for the
clause is unaffected by the change of policy. In due course we will
bring forward an impact assessment that relates to our decisions on
disability additions, which will be available to the Opposition.
Although impact assessments are not required until we table the
regulations, we will bring them forward during the Bill’s
passage through Parliament as early as possible, so that hon. Members
on both sides understand the impact of what we have done. However, the
impact assessment that relates to this clause is still valid.
Furthermore, we do not believe that the package of proposals that we
intend to introduce in due course will have an impact on child poverty
levels—that is important. We think that this is a better way of
doing it. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will accept clause
10.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000083">&#160;</a>

gives sweeping powers to the Secretary of State through secondary
legislation. From clause 11 and clause 68, which we will discuss later,
we know some of the Government’s intentions for universal
credit, and we wish to test them
today.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
practice, clause 11 paves the way for the most fundamental change in
the treatment of housing costs since the introduction of the
contemporary welfare state. Beveridge struggled with, and could not
find, an ideal system for treating housing costs, largely because of
the enormous variation in housing costs in different parts of the
country. That point is still germane today. The clause will make
changes that affect that whole settlement, and we will move away from
the existing structure of treating housing costs that was largely laid
down in legislation in 1992.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000092">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The concerns
about whether the shelf will be strong enough to bear the weight take
us back to an intervention on Tuesday by—I think, but I may be
wrong—the hon. Member for Aberconwy. He made the point that
unemployment is one of the worst and most devastating things that can
happen to anybody, which is absolutely true. I put it to the Committee
that the worst thing that can happen to people—setting aside
human tragedies—is homelessness. Homelessness, which in the past
has often been consequential on unemployment, is one of the most
devastating experiences. We know all the information—volumes of
it—about how homelessness impacts on families, children, and
people’s well-being. We need to be absolutely sure that whatever
we construct as a method of meeting housing costs will not lead to
additional homelessness and will not mean that, when people lose their
job or their income, there is a very real risk that they may also lose
their
home.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
know that the popular mantra of the Government over the past year has
been that housing benefit, which will be rolled into housing costs
under clause 11, is out of control. That phrase is frequently used, but
housing benefit, as a principle—we can discuss the details of
this—is something of which we should be proud. Housing benefit
did exactly what it should have done. It acted as a stabiliser. During
the recession, it acted as a means of ensuring that homelessness did
not soar. Remarkably, given the scale of the recession and given what
it did to people’s jobs and incomes, we did not see soaring
homelessness. The last time that we had a recession, which was less
grave, at the beginning of the 1990s, homelessness soared. It is worth
reminding the Committee that, in 1992, homelessness peaked at 138,740
households, which is the best part of 500,000 people. In 2008, the
figure was 14,000, and it was 11,840 in 2010. Housing benefit,
therefore, worked. It acted as a stabiliser, and it is important,
because we will possibly see a recurrence of those recession years. I
hope that we do not, but we are projecting high levels of unemployment,
so who knows what is going to happen in the future as the economy
withers. We know that it is absolutely essential that we have a
mechanism in place that ensures that we do not repeat the experience of
1992.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000095">&#160;</a>

at risk of losing their home. The definition is clear. It can include
people whose homes are repossessed, and it can mean people who are
losing their homes as a consequence of, as is often the case, the end
of an assured shorthold tenancy. If people have to move and
downsize—I have no problem with that—we need to be sure
that people will not go through the trauma of enforced

their ability to look for employment or to remain in education or

makes a specific point about the comparison between the figures of the
early 1990s and those of the recent recession. If she is specific on
that point about individuals and families at risk, she will find that,
in the early 1990s, lenders were much more predisposed to going down
the route of repossession, because of a different economic situation. I
think she will find that that may answer the
question.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000100">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is not an unfair point. Part of the reason that
lenders behaved differently were changes made by the Labour Government.
Measures were put in place to discourage early intervention on the part
of lenders. One of the issues, which I will refer to later on, is that
there is concern among lenders over what will happen to their
investments, and some of the uncertainty comes from measures that might
increase arrears if actual housing costs are not
met.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000101">&#160;</a>

be very clear, I am not arguing that the Government’s universal
credit will see homelessness return to the kind of levels that we saw
in 1992. I am merely saying that a range of measures were put in place
after the peak in homelessness in 1992 that have been effective. One of
those measures was the extent to which housing benefit helped to take
the strain during the recession. We know this because the increase in
the housing benefit case load during the recession was driven so
extensively by in-work
claims.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000102">&#160;</a>

amendments on welfare rights later. There are a number of reasons that
help to explain why homelessness did not rise during the recession. I
merely point out—this is beyond dispute—that housing
benefit, as structured, was a very important component, as we can see
from the number of claims made between 2008 and 2010 that were either
from people in work who saw a reduction in their incomes, or from
people who had become unemployed, for whom we ensured that a hopefully
temporary period of unemployment did not lead to excessive debt and the
risk of
homelessness.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000106">&#160;</a>

other ways in which they might have put themselves at risk of losing
their tenancies. The changes will come at exactly the time when many
local authorities experience dramatic cuts in their Supporting People

                           </strong> If one looks at the overall rise in housing benefit,
it is clear that several factors explain that driver, only some of
which are problematic. Particularly during the recession, there was a
significant—indeed, dramatic—increase in case load and a
substantial real-terms increase in council and housing association
rents, which are also factors. The extent to which it is landlords
ripping off the system that explains the increase in housing benefit,
which is the central point of the argument, is very small. We have to
be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater, because
housing benefit provides for 1 million

if I may take the hon. Lady to that issue. The difference between this
and the last recession is, first, that the interest rate was far higher
last time, and it has been very low this time. That has helped to keep
the repossession rate well down. Secondly, there is a two-year lag.
Last time we had a recession, in 1991-92, repossessions spiked in 1994.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that is the case. In effect, we
are most at risk of repossessions this year because of the time
lag.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000121">&#160;</a>

have looked at the prevailing conditions and made a decision. We are
not, as I understand it, discussing what a Labour Government would have

we know so far about the framework in clause 11 on the
treatment of housing costs is that the payment available to private
tenants, which will roll forward into universal credit, has been
reduced from the 50th percentile to the 30th percentile. We also know
that the Government will introduce an uprating for private tenants, and
tenants receiving a local housing allowance, into the universal credit
element; the consumer prices index will replace the current structure.
We know that the Government do not intend in all cases to pay actual
rents in the social rented sector. I will ask a little more about those

relate to the labour market. That is integral because we are all as one

Communities and Local

least 30% of the private rental market remains available to private
tenants, broadly speaking, across the country, because there will be

not clear about the interaction between the universal credit housing
cost proposals and the DCLG’s future rents policies. I will
explore those a little
further.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000127">&#160;</a>

turn first to the uprating of private rentals with the CPI. At the
moment we know that rent levels in the private sector are adjusted
according to local market variations in each broad market rental area.
The level at which help is available will be restricted from the 50th
percentile to the 30th percentile. That will kick in next week. Not
including the removal of the so-called shopping incentive within the
local housing allowance, which the outgoing Labour Government had
announced an intention to remove, according to my reading of the impact
assessment 640,000 households will lose between £7 and
£130 a week under universal credit. That initial framework will
move forward, but it raises fundamental questions such as to what
extent the Government have considered the interaction between housing
liabilities and how much money they intend to leave people to live
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000128">&#160;</a>

morning, we had an aspirational debate about minimum income guarantees,
but all Governments have within the benefit system an expectation that
people should not have to survive on less than a certain minimum level,

reductions rolling forward from what the Government have already said
about housing costs will interact with the requirement that families
have a minimum level available on which to

how the Government view the reduced and reducing sector that will be
available as a result of the measures being put into place and the CPI
uprating. How do they plan to fit people currently receiving local

enormously in different parts of the country, and the
Government’s own impact assessment makes it absolutely clear
that although everybody loses—

country will lose to the extent that they will have to move home.
Indeed, it is entirely possible that in some cases, landlords will
respond to the changes. The difficulty—we have rehearsed this;
it matters, and it will roll forward into universal credit—is
that although in some areas of the country, costs are already

difference. We also know that the Government plan to go forward in the
medium term and—this is what I seek to ask the Minister
about—in the longer term by uprating based on CPI. The
availability of accommodation is already ratcheting down due to
measures taken, and there is potential for a further ratcheting down
that, although it might not be particularly additionally damaging in
the short to medium term, could be devastating unless we have a clear

concentrate for a moment longer on the private rental sector, which is
growing rapidly because of the interaction between the private rental
market and the housing market. The housing market is largely
unaffordable at the moment, so more people are in the private rental
market and there is more competition for private rental accommodation.
Given that a number of people who are on housing allowance and who will
be covered by the housing costs element of universal credit

distorting factor in the market—this is probably a consequence
of recession and pressure on family budgets—is that the
landlords of those people who are moving into privately rented
accommodation are unable to offer any flexibility in their rents, as
Government Members have suggested, because they, too, are locked into
buy-to-let mortgage arrangements whereby they must cover an interest
cost or their lender will repossess the property? It is therefore
impossible for those landlords to reduce the
rent.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is absolutely right, and it leads me nicely to
the issue of landlords. It is absolutely true—I fear that it
will remain so, to some extent, whatever system we have—that
some landlords will take advantage of the system. Of course they will,
and that is wrong. Some landlords will set their rents at the LHA. Some
small anecdotal evidence in the two-year review of LHA shows that that
is partly true, but it is not true everywhere and real risks attach to
that in such
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
issue depends on the share of the total private rental market accounted
for by those people who need assistance from the Government to pay
their housing costs. I do not have the figures to hand, but the
constituency of the hon. Member for Redcar may well be one in which
housing benefit and, in future, the housing costs element of universal
credit will account for a large proportion of the market. In Blackpool,
the figure is, I think, about 80%, but if we drift back into large
parts of the south-east and the south-west—I am prepared to be
contradicted on that—and certainly London, we will see that the
share accounted for by people who need assistance with their housing
costs is very small. However, although the share is smaller, the
amounts involved are much greater. The large private rental markets in
much of London account for 10%, 12% or 15%, according to the different
broad market rental areas, so the leverage available to the state to
bring those rents down is vastly diminished. The problem is that the
amounts involved are so much
greater.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000147">&#160;</a>

the housing costs element of universal credit could bring down the
cover given in the Blackpools or Redcars of this world, that would be
fine and welcome. If we can save money in that way, that is fine. The
amounts involved, however, are small and relatively little money will
be saved. If we apply that to whole swathes of the country and look
forward to 2013 and beyond, we see that the real risk and implications
of the provision are not that it will save the money that the
Government intend it to, but that it will end up costing
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000148">&#160;</a>

that one of the problems—I hope that the Minister will respond
to this if we do not get it right in future—is that landlords
have no obligation to be in the market at all. No law says that any
landlord must make accommodation available for people on low incomes.
If they do not, someone else must deal with the problem. What we are
seeing is that the number of landlords not willing to let to people
receiving financial assistance from the Government is already down
by 16%.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000149">&#160;</a>

We do know that, if the survey of landlords is being taken and
landlords are conscious of the fact that the Government are prepared
for greater flexibility on the private element at least with direct
payments, it has not yet had a huge impact. The measure will have an
impact, of course, which I welcome. It will ensure that some
accommodation is available that might not have been available
beforehand, but there is no sign yet of its having such an impact,
partly because, even with a direct payment, the amount set by the state
and the actual costs as we look forward are well below—now very
well below—market levels. Therefore, in a market with
competition for the private rented sector, that property is simply not
available to
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000151">&#160;</a>

the longer-term issue of uprating in respect of private rental costs,

the Minister give a very clear indication of the long term for
universal credit? Given the overlapping prefiguring measures set in
place, how will the availability of private rented accommodation at a
reasonable level across the country be maintained? What is the future
of broad market rental areas, which the CPI uprating effectively
abolishes in any meaningful sense, and the rent officer service, which
will not be needed in the transition period, but, as we understand from
other ministerial comments, might be required at a later
stage?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000167">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On the
amendments, for the first time the relationship between the housing
support available and actual housing costs in the social rented sector
will change. Until now, there has always been a reflection of actual
rents in the social rented sector and, very importantly, they have of
course been adjusted for income. That has been the case because social
rents are controlled and there is no market within the social rented
sector. Allocations are made on the basis of need, even within the
choice-based element.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000168">&#160;</a>

from the White Paper, “21st Century Welfare”, that that
point was accepted last summer when we were first thinking about the
structure of our bookcase, because the White Paper said that the
housing component would build on the support that is provided by the
current housing benefit system, which is based on actual rents.
However, changes that are being introduced and—unless we hear
otherwise—being rolled forward into the universal credit are
telling us something fundamentally different.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000169">&#160;</a>

we know that the intention, for the first time, is to reduce the amount
of support that is available for tenants in the social rented sector
according to the size of their household. We know from the impact
assessment that that will apply a benefit restriction to 670,000
households, a figure that will rise over time. We see that rise
projected forward into the universal credit figures. I do not know the

                        <p class="tabbed">As we roll
forward into the universal credit, we know that the Government intend
to restrict the entitlement for actual housing costs in the social
rented sector for 670,000 households, a figure that will rise over the
early lifetime of the universal credit, including an impact on 440,000
disabled people and on 160,000 lone parents.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The question
is this—can the objectives of the universal credit be met? If we
look at the impact assessment of the universal credit that was
published by the Government, it says that one of the stated policy
objectives of the universal credit is
to<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>That
is absolutely marvellous—I could not agree more. I have always
been an advocate of doing that. The impact assessment says that another
objective of the universal credit is
to<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000177">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That
is absolutely right, although we do not know—forgive me if I am
wrong, but I do not think that the impact assessment tells
us—whether any of those people are currently in work. Perhaps
the Minister could clarify matters, because I do not know the answer to
that point. I do not know whether any of those people are receiving any
housing support at the moment but are also
working.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government also want to save money, but the impact assessment
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
other words, if the Government achieve their objective of increasing
mobility, that will cut the amount of money that is being saved. The
impact assessment goes on to
say:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“if

                        </p>
                        <p>There
is a problem here and I would like the Minister to help us to
understand it. The impact assessment appears to be saying two things.
It appears to be saying that if the claimants move address the savings
will not be made, but the next sentence says that if claimants remain
in their existing homes the savings will not be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 313<a class="bkMark" name="Column313">&#160;</a>
                           </div>made. If we add those two together we would probably get to 100% and
there would be no savings, but certainly there is a fundamental
contradiction in the impact assessment, because it appears to argue
both ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I suspect
that the Government’s proposed savings in the universal credit
will be reduced the more under-occupation is tackled. It will cost more
money when tenants downsize into newer, smaller housing association
properties, because the rents are higher. The impact assessment
explicitly states that moving into the private rented sector is an
option for people to downsize. In my understanding of social and market
rents across the country, invariably market rents are higher, so such
moves will end up costing more. I do not understand, therefore, how the
universal credit can build on the proposals rolling forward or how the
Government expect the policy to work. All the objectives are in
conflict with each other.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The equality
impact assessment goes on to set out what it sweetly describes as
non-monetised costs. They do not seem terribly non-monetised, however,
because there will be costs to social landlords, local authorities and
registered social landlords. There will be additional costs of rent
collection and action taken against tenants in arrears, the cost of
enabling tenants to be more mobile, additional costs of appeals, extra
demands on discretionary housing payments, removal costs for tenants,
and more. All those taken together make me wonder how the policy will
work. The numbers of people who will be affected are projected to rise,
so if the measure does not work in the shorter term, I do not see how
the Government will meet housing costs in the social rented sector at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">None of that
has any relationship to the duties and costs beyond 2013 on local
authorities when they have to pick up the fallout from people whose
housing costs are not covered. The Localism Bill, to which we have
referred, makes some important changes to the treatment of
homelessness. Its equalities impact assessment on discharging the main
homelessness duty states clearly:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000185">&#160;</a>

no accommodation is available for such people in the private rented

crystal clear that there will be a duty on local authorities to provide
accommodation for them. If such households become homeless, the local
authority has a homelessness obligation, so it will not save money. The
measure will not work; it will simply transfer an under-occupation
problem to a homelessness problem. I do not understand the
Government’s intention. As the numbers increase over time, how
will the universal credit housing cost element deal with
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000187">&#160;</a>

Communities and Local Government is saying that there is a surplus in
three-bedroom accommodation but, in a way, that is not the point. The
point is that the relationship between the universal credit, as
prefigured, and actual rents for social accommodation requires people
to downsize. The problem that we are facing over the coming years is
the availability of smaller units of accommodation, not larger.
However, an even bigger problem is the vast geographical mismatch that
we will face in the coming years. If we look at the impact assessment

Minister’s point because there are transitional arrangements
under clause 68 that we may not need to rehearse in the same detail.
However, as I understand the matter, the Minister is making a flat
contradiction. The expectation is that, as we move towards the
universal credit, there will be plans to more closely match the payment
for housing costs in the social rented sector with things other than
actual rents. The figures in the impact assessment

detail the current situation and imagining that nothing else will
change. We are talking about the medium term. Thank goodness we have
abolished the regional spatial strategy. All over the country, right
now local authorities are developing housing strategies that will
respond to local needs. That is something they could not do when there
were restrictions imposed by the regional spatial strategy. In those
housing strategies, local authorities will be tackling the issue of a
lack of planning for housing for an ageing population, which
fundamentally underlines the fact that there is not enough
accommodation for older people and there is an issue with
under-occupancy. Within the time scale she mentions for addressing the
problems she is envisaging, a whole series of measures will be
introduced locally that will start to address the lack of genuinely
affordable housing that meets the needs of our populations in their
communities all around the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000195">&#160;</a>

planning strategies and building new homes for older people you would
rule me out of order. I am not sure—the Minister might
contradict me on this—that even the Government’s most
ambitious plans will involve constructing 670,000 new homes to enable
some of the matching to take place that the measure requires. The hon.
Lady raised an important question earlier about the Localism Bill and
social rents. The problem is that the cuts in grant to housing
associations has required—this is the stated expectation of the
Minister for Housing—that new housing developments will be at
80% of market rents. If social housing is at 80% of market rents, it is
hard to see how that squares with the Government’s not
unreasonable intention of bearing down on housing benefit expenditure.
Indeed, there is a wide range of assessments that has been made of
this. The House of Commons Library did some modelling on this for me
which indicated that the Minister and the DWP would be liable for
£200 million more in housing benefit expenditure because of
these market rents. The Chartered Institute of Housing has come up, in
the medium to longer term, with a much higher figure even than
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000196">&#160;</a>

Committee if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the Minister said
that there is an expectation that it will be 80%. Indeed, if it falls
below 80%, of course—and it may—not only does the point
still remain at 60%, but the housing associations that are relying on
this income stream in order to defend their development programme will
not be able to develop the homes. It is impossible to have it both
ways. Either rents have to be set at 80% of market values, which

true to say—housing associations often partner property
developers in constructing properties anyway—that the Government
are expecting housing associations to be a partner in delivering this
accommodation. Even if it was a private developer, the issue would
still remain about how the private developer can get an income stream
through housing benefit, and rolling forward into housing credit, that
would enable them to fund this new

other avenues for building social housing, not just through rental
streams, but also through the equity out there. We have used the money

more.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000202">&#160;</a>

pensioner households, which are the households that are most likely to
be under-occupiers. The Government’s policy, driven by the

Government are asking them to do, it is not likely that money will be
saved. Indeed, the impact assessment appears to agree with me. I am
entirely in favour of encouraging downsizing, but pensioner households
that want to downsize will now probably not be able to do so
voluntarily, because housing providers will be pushed into having no
choice but to prioritise the downsizing needs of the 670,000
households, rising through the universal credit to 760,000, which will
face a penalty for under-occupation. Is that really the
Minister’s intention? And we know from the impact assessment
that an additional complication is that the larger share of
under-occupation—the area in which the Government want to bear
down on the actual housing costs in the social rented sector—is
not where overcrowded households are, because they are primarily in
London.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not think that it is the Government’s intention to seek to
move 120,000 households—on present estimates—away from
the property where they are no longer allowed to have their actual
costs and move them to London, and then take the overcrowded London
households and move them to the north-west, even if the households were
able to, because of the constraints that exist in their tenancies. My
other big worry is that the Localism Bill and the homelessness
legislation clearly indicate that if people are no longer able to
maintain their home because they cannot afford it, they will have a
potential application for homelessness, and if they make such an
application, it will not save the Government any money.

                        <p class="tabbed">On mortgage
interest relief there is a worrying lack of detail. All this will be
introduced in regulations, but we know that a fundamental change is
being proposed for how housing costs are treated. And we know, from the
measures being put in place, that it is being prefigured by the changes
already made in housing benefit in the private rented sector and in
local housing allowance by the uprating for CPI, and by the changes
being made in respect of the meeting of actual costs in the social
rented sector. Does the Minister believe that it is fair? Is it his
intention to impose through the universal credit a penalty that most
people cannot avoid? Does he intend that if a household wishes to meet
its obligations and expectations but is not able to do so, a penalty
would apply? A penalty is being proposed here, which will hit people
with disabilities—some 440,000 at the present estimate. In some
cases £34 a week will be removed from their minimum allowable
element of income. I do not know whether that is the Minister’s
intention. Does he think that it will save money?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000211">&#160;</a>

out, if people move it will not save money. According to the impact
assessment, we are not sure whether it will save any money even if they
stay. Does the Minister accept that there is a real issue on what is,
in principle, a laudable aim, which is predicated on a failure to
understand all the areas of the housing market? That includes the fact
that, as his own impact statement makes clear, the people in the north
of England will be most affected. That will not meet any of his other
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000212">&#160;</a>

has the Minister made an assessment of what someone would need to earn
to avoid the penalty, if they follow the advice? We all agree that it
will be much better if people can avoid the penalty by getting a job,
although that is harder to do in some areas of the north where it will
have the most severe impact. It seems to me that people will have to
earn in the region of at least £5,000 just to be one penny
better off after the penalty has been applied. It will be helpful to
know if that is the Minister’s intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000213">&#160;</a>

positive about the Government’s position. It is absolutely right
and desirable that we see a system that becomes closer to being
tenure-neutral. If amendment 35 is agreed, we would have mortgage
interest within the housing cost of the universal credit as mapped out
under clause 11, which would see home owners, private tenants and
social tenants subject to all the caveats outlined and being treated
within a single, integrated system. That would be a good
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000214">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do. We would all agree about two things. First, it
would be better if we could bring down rents in the private rented
sector. Secondly, we agree that there have been cases—Government
Members have often spoken about some of the anecdotal cases that have
been in the tabloid newspapers—that no one could justify. That
is a function, in some cases, of an anomaly in a system that has
generally not worked badly. If a fixed percentage of properties are
allowed to be available in some broad market areas where there is a
housing cost variation, there will occasionally be outliers. That has
been true in central London. There will be people who will make use of
it, just as there are landlords who will sometimes abuse the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000217">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the March
Budget 2010, we brought forward proposals that would have set out a
mechanism taking out some of the most expensive properties in each
broad market rental area and dealt with some of those anomalies. That
is fine; I do not have any problem with that, as long as that can be
done without perverse and unintended consequences, and without making
people homeless. It is fair to say—it will continue to be fair
to say—that there will be people for whom there is a statutory
homelessness duty, who are placed in the private rented sector by both
Conservative and Labour local authorities. That will continue to be the
case. By and large those placements will be in the private rented
sector, which is exactly what has happened in the past. The universal
credit will have to deal with that in the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000218">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Local
authorities with statutory homelessness duties will have to find
somewhere to place and accommodate those households. The discretionary
housing payment goes some way to help to do that, but not very far. I
will give one example concerning a family of a mum and three children.
The mother became psychotically ill; it was a terribly tragic case, and
she was judged by the local authority as being unable to look after her
children. As is usually the case, her ex-husband did not have housing
duties owed to him in his own right. Therefore, the local authority
provided assistance to secure private rented accommodation on an
ex-council estate in my constituency. The rent is £600 a week.
That is phenomenally expensive, but even on an ex-council estate, that
is sometimes what rents cost. That was done in order for the ex-husband
to be near his ex-wife and the children. We must find ways of
accommodating these many often disturbing and difficult cases within
the system. By and large, people who find themselves homeless often
face multiple challenges. It is impossible to develop a fair and humane
system that does not allow such cases to be incorporated.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000219">&#160;</a>

the Committee will be relieved to know that I am coming to the end of
my remarks. I said I would be shorter than Proust, and I think I have
been. The broader issue of integrating mortgage interest relief is
absolutely right. Mortgage interest relief has been enormously valuable
and important, and has helped to reduce the impact of repossessions. Is
the Minister confident about the technical ability to track actual
interest rates, obviously within a financial envelope? Will the IT
allow that to happen with real-time information and without some of the
overshoots and undershoots in interest payments that often occur? Is
the Minister confident that the housing cost element will be flexible
enough to cope if—heaven forfend—we see a sharp increase
in interest rates over time? Will the financial

without racking up difficult and unintended consequences for private
and social tenants? Given that we will shortly be debating issues of
direct payments, does the Minister expect mortgage interest assistance
to continue being paid directly to lenders?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000220">&#160;</a>

I feel I have covered some—although perhaps not all—of
the important issues that need addressing. We must look at the
transitional arrangements, but as we know, they prefigure an important
matter concerning the treatment of housing costs. I want the Minister
to commit to reviewing that policy and explain what its impact will be.
It is important that he assures the Committee that actual housing costs
will be properly treated so as to prevent unemployment leading to a
catastrophe that, at its worst, becomes homelessness. I look forward to
his response.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000221">&#160;</a>

my comments fall under the remit of the debate that we have just had. I
hope you will indulge me, Mr Weir, but my remarks will be significantly
briefer. I wish to raise two main areas of concern about housing
benefit. My points will not surprise anybody, least of all the
Minister, because I have raised them in previous debates.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
point concerns the allocation of the single room rate, and the second
is under-occupancy. I will speak only about the single room rate
because under-occupancy is better covered by clause 68, which we will
discuss in future deliberations. I am particularly concerned about some
groups due to the increase in the age limit for the single room rate
from 25 to 35. That could affect people with
children—non-resident parents. As we know, it is difficult for
non-resident parents to maintain contact with their children, but all
political parties and everybody across society wants to encourage that
contact. If we want to see success from the measures set out in
clauses 128 to 131, we must ensure that it is as easy as
possible for parents to maintain contact with their children. Shared
accommodation is not conducive to that. Having a single room is not
conducive to having children come to stay and it is not conducive to
helping parents build relationships with their children. I also think
it is not very fair on the other tenants. My eight-month-old baby
screamed for an hour and a half in the middle of the night last night
and if I had been in shared accommodation the other tenants would have
been distinctly unhappy about that. There are implications wider than
for the
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
second group I am concerned about are those coming out of prison.
Currently every year a small number of under-25s who are released from
prison pose a public risk and so are not able to go into shared
accommodation. As a result they end up effectively bed blocking in a
bail hostel until they turn 25 and can access a larger amount of
housing benefit. The average age for prisoners in the UK is 29, so a
larger number of people will be caught in that position if the age is
raised to 35. Potentially it could be a more significant problem for
the hostels because if they end up having to stay until they are 35 it
could be much more of an issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000224">&#160;</a>

particularly with young men if they have had a bad experience in the
family home and have been forced to move. In addition to the two
instances that the hon. Lady has raised, which I wholeheartedly support
her on, would the Minister also give us some assurances in relation to
women in that

be affected and that is another group. Another one that I am concerned
about is young homeless people and youngish homeless people if we are
going up to 35. There is evidence from homelessness charities that
putting someone who has been homeless in shared accommodation is
usually unsuccessful. Very often the tenancy breaks down very quickly
and that person ends up being homeless again. If we are trying to break
the cycle of homelessness and to help people back into society, shared
accommodation would probably not be appropriate for young people who
are particularly vulnerable<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000226">&#160;</a>

leaving care where it is not appropriate to have a shared room rate.
They quite often need their own accommodation and support. I had an
example where I worked of a young woman who had been taken away from
her parents due to sustained abuse from the father. She would have been
extremely concerned if she thought that she had to move into shared
accommodation where there was a male present whom she did not know, or
even one she did know. There are also people leaving care or who are
vulnerable because of abuse who would also suffer in such
accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000227">&#160;</a>

that young people who are leaving care are exempt from the current

reasons as well. I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong,

point—that there are likely to be more fathers by the age of 35

available in both properties for the child. That is not the case
currently. Only the person who has custody is entitled to have bedrooms
for the children. I would not dream of suggesting that that should
change. We do not have enough accommodation to have lots of people with
lots of spare rooms in the social housing stock to enable that to
happen. But there is a significant difference between someone having a
child to visit if they are in a one-bedroom property and if they have
one bedroom in a shared property. A child can sleep in the bedroom and
the parent can sleep on the sofa. Arrangements can be made. There is
more space and more ability to build the relationship with the child
than in a house with shared bathroom facilities, shared kitchen and
shared living

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
there are differences across the UK. In London there is plenty of
shared accommodation and most people under the age of 35 who are
working live in shared accommodation, in my experience: it is the norm.
That is not the case in other parts of the country. In Cardiff it is
much more affordable for working people under 35 to have a one-bedroom
property of their own. A lot of the shared accommodation is for
students, whereas in London it is much more mixed.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000231">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In rural
areas there is often little or no shared accommodation. Having a
standard policy across the UK, therefore, will lead to far more
problems for under-35s in some areas of the country than in other
parts. I hope the Minister can take those points on board.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000232">&#160;</a>

part debate, so I apologise if my comments do not neatly fit the
amendments we are talking about. However, they do relate to clause 11,
and in particular to the decision to move support for housing costs
within universal credit. That is a change from the current situation,
where housing benefit is administered by local authorities, and people
are used to dealing with local offices in relation to their housing
benefit claims. Given that this is delivered at district or unitary
level, certainly in England and Wales, people are likely to be able to
access offices local to their
home.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000234">&#160;</a>

know from talking to my constituents that many housing benefit
recipients value the help and support that is available from local
housing benefit staff. The ability to meet someone face to face and
have issues explained and queries answered is important, particularly
when documents have to be inspected. People worry about trusting
documents to the post. This local service may be particularly valued by
vulnerable claimants, especially those with disabilities, those who
struggle with literacy problems or those for whom English is not their
first language.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000235">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My first
question for the Minister is: how have the Government taken into
account the needs of these claimants in designing the system for
delivery of universal credit incorporating a housing support element?
Does the Minister intend to ensure that a network of local offices will
be available to assist in the delivery of universal credit? Could he
say more about how that will operate?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000236">&#160;</a>

question concerns what will happen to the staff who currently deliver
those services. Is it anticipated that those staff currently employed
by local authorities might transfer to the Department of Work and
Pensions under TUPE regulations, or, indeed, to a private sector
employer, or perhaps to a co-operative or social enterprise contracted
to deliver universal credit? If so, would those transfer arrangements
be written into the Bill? Obviously, the many local authority staff who

			Column number: 323<a class="bkMark" name="Column323">&#160;</a>

their future employment terms and conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000237">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Depending
on the arrangements for set-up—whether there will be local
offices where people would be able to find out about and apply for
universal credit, or perhaps call centres in more remote
locations—there may be redundancy costs associated with changing
from delivery by local authorities to delivery by the Department of
Work and Pensions. Could the Minister set out what discussions he has
had with the Department of Communities and Local Government about the
possible redundancy costs arising from that, and whether local
authority funding might be adjusted to take account of those costs? If
there have been discussions, can he explain how those potential
redundancy costs have been factored into the estimated levels of
efficiency savings delivered by the move to universal credit?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000238">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some local
authorities—I am sorry, I do not know off the top of my head the
proportion of those affected—have already outsourced so-called
back-office or administrative functions, so might have contracts with
private sector organisations to deliver services that include housing
benefit. Those contracts are often not just for housing benefit
services, but are very likely for merged housing benefit,
council tax and perhaps council tax benefits. They are often for long
periods, and 10 or 15 years is not unheard of. What assumptions have
the Government made about the cost to local authorities of trying to
disaggregate delivery of housing benefit from other functions? In
particular, what estimate has been made of the financial penalties that
local authorities might face if they need to break or renegotiate
existing contracts to deliver such
services?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
we move away from claimants being able to access support from local
offices to assist them in claiming universal credit, what implication
will that have for the level of administrative errors? It seems to me
that if people are trying to complete applications online, perhaps with
telephone support, they are more likely to make errors or complete the
forms incorrectly than if they were sitting down with local office
staff who can help them to work through the process. I wondered how
that would be taken into account in deciding how likely it was that
people would make errors, and in the figures for the reduction in

housing association tenancies are often loosely referred to as social
tenancies, but I particularly dislike that phrase; they are low rent,
affordable homes. The issue is whether the Government really intend to
move away from the current situation of the actual rent being covered.
The Minister said that that will be the case in the meantime, but no
undertaken has been given as to the Government’s future
intentions. In that respect, social tenancies are different from those
in the private rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000244">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Over
the past 30 years at least, there has been a move to improve the
security of tenure for tenants in such housing. When I became a
councillor in 1988 and was involved in housing issues, I was surprised
that there was no security of tenure for people in council housing. It
was introduced at that time by a previous Conservative Government in
acknowledgement that those were people’s long-term
homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000245">&#160;</a>

concerned about the tenor of the discussion that is taking place both
here, and on the Localism Bill, although fortunately for my
constituents that Bill will not affect them. There is a fundamental
change in approach to the homes that are provided, making them
something into and out of which people can be shuffled. It is a move to
remove security of tenure on the basis that people’s financial
position has improved and they perhaps do not need it any
more—there will be no long-term secure
tenancies.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000246">&#160;</a>

It is a bit like the argument about transitional support making it all
all right. A considerable number of people want to take up tenancies,
and there are difficulties and shortages. I accept that my city will
not be affected by the measures, but there alone we have between 2,500
and 3,000 new tenancies created in the sector every year. In 2009, 900
new affordable homes were built, with 900 people entering into those
forms of tenancies, so a substantial number of people would be
affected. They are people’s homes, and people have been
encouraged to consider that they have security of
tenure.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000248">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
briefly to the issue of under-occupation, as it has been raised
extensively already, the suggestion here is that when people no longer
need a house of the size they were allocated—due to a whole
range of circumstances, including separation, divorce and children
leaving home—they should be required by a financial lever to
move. I accept that there is overcrowding in some places, and having
been involved in housing in Edinburgh I know that it can be frustrating
that on the one hand there are people living in larger
houses—although in Edinburgh not many family-sized houses are
under-occupied—and on the other there are people who would like
to move.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A lot of the
time, the practical problem is that the mix and the match are not quite
right. Many properties of the smaller variety that turn over in
Edinburgh are high-rise flats, and many people who have been tenants
for some considerable time and whose children have now left home, will
not want to rush to move from their house or flat, which they might
have achieved only after several years of waiting, to what they would
consider significantly inferior housing, and perhaps of a type they do
not wish to go back to, having been in that form of housing before. We
would often say, “If only we could find the person here and the
person there who would fit together for the exchange.” There are
mutual exchange schemes, but they achieve only a certain amount because
getting that mix is not that
easy.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000252">&#160;</a>

are other issues about under-occupation. A couple with a two-bedroom
house are theoretically under-occupying and we are suggesting that they
move to a one-bedroom place. I wonder how many of us would be happy to
do that. I am not sure why we take such a considerably different view
of people who are in council housing association accommodation. Those
people may become more ill, they may require separate
bedrooms—quite a common phenomenon—they may have
grandchildren who come to stay. Only today I read a newspaper article
about giving grandparents access rights, but perhaps they would have
nowhere for them to come and
stay.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000253">&#160;</a>

occurred to me. Indeed, I have been part of many of those discussions
about securing the kind of home that would enable people, if they
become progressively disabled, to stay for longer. I do not think a
financial lever is the right or effective way to solve a problem, which
undoubtedly is there, if people wish to move on a voluntary basis. As a
councillor, I had older constituents who did want to move out of a
three-bedroom home, but they wanted to remain in the area where they
had always lived and where they had friends, a social life and family
near by. Finding that match for them was often extremely difficult. It
was not that they did not want to move—they were finding a
larger home difficult. Whether they would want to move to a one-bedroom
home was a different issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000255">&#160;</a>

address the issues of overcrowding, we should address the issues of
overcrowding. If we want to address the issue of there not being
sufficient homes, we should address that. To apply a blunt financial
lever is not the right thing to do. It is significant that this is a
savings measure. If all these people were able to move into these
smaller homes, there would be no savings. If it is about solving the
problem of under-occupation—if that is considered such a major
problem that it has to be resolved quickly—and if that lever
gets people to move, although I am not convinced that it will, there
will be no savings. If savings are achieved, it will be as a result of
people staying where they are. In other words, it is a financial
penalty for the people affected. They will simply have to take a
reduction in their income. We should be clear what we are
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000256">&#160;</a>

tenancies are not only intended to be secure homes for life—and
many people want them to be that—but they are funded by the
state. I was struck by the evidence from David Orr last week, when he

                        <p>If it
is the Government’s view that they wish to stick to the current
position, in which people in social housing—council or housing
association—get their housing component of universal credit paid
at the actual rent, perhaps we should say so. Perhaps that should be
made more explicit through regulations, so there is not this
uncertainty that that might change at some unspecified time in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What would be
the purpose of making that change? It is true that rents vary across
the country, even in the social sector they vary in adjoining
authorities. I know that between Edinburgh and Midlothian there was a
£20 a week difference in council rents. There are historical
reasons for that, to do with pressure on accommodation and the kind of
building. In Edinburgh in the 1960s and 1970s the council built a huge
amount of quite poor quality block density housing. It was not a Labour
council at that time. Midlothian, which was a Labour council, has very
low rents. It did not have the population pressure, which is why it did
not incur the borrowing that is needed to build new homes. The higher
rents in Edinburgh reflect the historical borrowing that built those
houses. Regrettably, many of those houses are not very good and are
being replaced before much older
houses.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Rents
are different. Is the suggestion that they should in some way be
standardised? Rather than pay the actual rent, should there be some
kind of averaging of rent, even in the social rented sector? If that is
the case, it will mean that in some areas people will get less money.
The reason they will get less money is not to do with their choice of
home within something as wide as a council area. Rents are high in one
place and much lower in another for historical reasons, which is not
their choice or their fault; it is a fact.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We had some
discussion earlier about why housing benefit has increased. Over the
years in housing, there has been a move away from subsidising
affordable housing—the bricks and mortar subsidy—towards
subsidising the person. Indeed there was a great deal of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 327<a class="bkMark" name="Column327">&#160;</a>
                           </div>debate about that in the 1980s. At the time, the Government of the day
said that it was inefficient to subsidise the bricks and mortar,
because sometimes it would mean that people who did not need subsidy
were being subsidised and they had Jaguars parked outside. The tabloid
horror of the day was people who had two Jaguars, and four children who
were all earning, living in cheap council housing. There has been a
shift over a considerable period of time from subsidy of bricks and
mortar to subsidy of people. The Government of the day felt that that
was the right thing to do, and they said that housing benefit would
“take the strain”. That has led to rents
rising.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
housing association sector, the percentage of the cost of a new home
that is met by a grant has fallen. It is actually considerably lower in
England than it is in Scotland. One consequence is that housing
association rents are generally considerably higher in England than
they are in most parts of Scotland. There is a direct relationship
between the level of rent and the level of grant. Over a considerable
number of years, therefore, we have seen higher rents across the
country in housing association and council properties and that has
increased the level of housing benefit being paid out. A substantial
amount of housing benefit is not in the private rented sector, which we
expend a lot of energy in trying to understand and describe. A
considerable amount of housing benefit is paid to people across a whole
range of ages in the social rented
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000262">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
it is the Government’s intention to make some change in the
future, it would be fairer to make that absolutely clear. If it is not
their intention, it does not seem unreasonable that regulations should
make it clear that rents on social tenancies would be met at the level
that they are actually charged.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000263">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In the
private rented sector, people already pay considerable shortfalls on
rent. It has been suggested that when the local housing allowance was
set at the 50th percentile, it was too high and that people could
easily find cheaper housing. Even at that level, half of tenants with
LHA are paying the shortfall themselves from their other income. It is
already difficult, even at the 50% level, for people to find
accommodation to rent and they have taken on that extra burden. It is a
worry, and we do not know yet what will happen. I have asked my council
colleagues in Edinburgh to keep an eye on what happens from April when
new tenants start looking for housing in the private rented sector. If
people are paying a shortfall at the higher level, why assume that it
will be easy for them to find cheaper accommodation? Will they not
simply pay an even bigger shortfall in order to get any accommodation
at all?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
reason why housing benefit has increased substantially in some areas is
the recession. The figures show a marked spike upwards, particularly in
the private rented sector, probably because many people in the social
rented sector are already on housing benefit because they are over
retirement age, unemployed, or employed on low income. The sector might
not have had much more room to expand, whereas there has been a
substantial increase in the private rented sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was puzzled
by that. All the research on the private rented sector published until
2007—major research was done for the Scottish and English
Governments, including 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 328<a class="bkMark" name="Column328">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the Rugg report, by Julie Rugg from York university—said that
only about 20% of the private rented sector was funded through housing
benefit. In the years since then, during the recession, that figure has
increased substantially, and now appears to stand at 40%. Whether that
will be sustained is another matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Presumably,
some of those people have had to claim housing benefit because they
have either become unemployed or been given shorter hours during the
course of a tenancy. That does not necessarily mean that their
landlords are housing benefit landlords who want and attract people on
housing benefit; it might be the contrary. They might have little
choice while they are tied into a lease and decide that they would
rather have housing benefit payments than no payments. We will have to
see whether they continue to let to those people. I suspect that the
proportion will drop again.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000267">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In Edinburgh,
where there are students, young professionals and many other people in
the private rented sector, landlords are in no way dependent on housing
benefit claimants for their market. I do not see that they are
substantially likely to reduce rents because otherwise they will get
nobody; they are much more likely, when people come to the natural end
of their lease, to move on and let to somebody else who can pay those
rents.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000268">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was
slightly surprised when the hon. Member for Dover suggested that
housing associations should no longer develop and that private
developers should do so instead. Lots of private developers have
developed in my city in the past 10 years. Many of them have gone into
the private letting market, for various reasons. The rents, however,
are extremely high. That is not a solution for people on low incomes,
unless they can get their rent covered, and most of the rents in
Edinburgh would be above even pre-April LHA levels. Houses there are
being developed, and people are buying them as an investment, but the
rents are not affordable for people who would otherwise be looking for
houses developed by housing associations.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Where does one start? I have been a strong
advocate of more funding for housing association houses, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston will agree, and I have
fought Scottish Governments of different political complexions for
exactly that, because the key is subsidy.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000271">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
that the model is a poor one; the key is subsidy. In 2007 in our city,
we had 4,000 outstanding planning consents for affordable homes that
had not been built, partly because they were linked to private
developments so we had to go at their pace, and partly because the
subsidy was not there. If all of those had suddenly come on-stream, we
would not have had the money to build those affordable homes. The
biggest year of building we had—I said this in the House the
other day—was 900, in 2009. That, for Edinburgh, is very high.
In previous years, the reason why we did not have 900 was because the
level of subsidy simply was not there. The amount of money coming in to
enable us to build those houses and rent them to people was much lower
than it needed to be to meet demand.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000272">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would strongly argue that the problem is not that housing associations
do not have a good model of development. The problem is that if we want
low-rent, affordable housing, it has to be subsidised. It either has be
subsidised, to come back to the subject matter before us, through some
form of bricks and mortar subsidy—which development grant
is—or it will be subsidised through higher rents that the state
will be paying through whatever benefit system it has. If the state
then decides, wearing its Department for Work and Pensions hat, that
those rents are too high and we cannot pay actual rents, even though
they are houses developed by housing associations or councils, then we
are transferring the cost entirely to tenants. We are telling them that
they can bear that burden and that they can pay it out of their other
income.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I remain
absolutely unconvinced that there is some other magic model. In fact,
prior to the election, perhaps in 2009, I gave a number of seminars on
a piece of work, which I had done about rents, to housing associations.
I started by saying that there are external pressures on rents and that
they come from Government policy and so on. One of my slides showed a
picture of the current Prime Minister. I hedged what I was saying. I
said that I had found a think-tank that was suggesting that development
funding should be withdrawn entirely and replaced by much higher rents.
I have to say that my audiences really thought that I was being a rabid
frightener. They just thought that that was nonsense. I kept saying
that I did not really think that that would happen and that I was just
mentioning it to show what could happen, but lo and behold, it is
happening—in England, at least. That is exactly the road that
has been gone down.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Take away the
development grant, and put the rents up—maybe not up to 80%,
but, as my hon. Friend said, the less that goes up, the less houses
will be developed. In effect, we are transferring the costs from the
state to the tenants, but because the tenants need to be subsidised, we
come around to the state paying it again. So there is the worry that on
the one hand housing associations are being encouraged to go down that
new form of development route, but on the other hand the Bill could
give rise to a situation in which those rents that are then charged
will not be met from people’s housing component of universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we are clear about what is covered. That is also why we
have tabled the amendment on mortgage interest. At that point, it is
very difficult for people. If they are in temporary unemployment, they
have been given help. Hopefully, that will not necessarily be a
long-term, life-long position. That is what we have to see.
Unemployment is a much more fluid situation than is sometimes realised.
People are not necessarily in the category of long-term unemployed. In
my experience, people go back and forwards constantly, so while it is
certainly a good thing to give people in employment some assistance
with mortgages, we want to have the understanding that that will be
covered, and will continue to be covered. I do not entirely understand
why the Government seem to be so reluctant to spell out their proposals
on how rent will be calculated, on how mortgage interest will be
calculated and on how rent in social tenancies in particularly will be
met. Is it actual rent, or are we going to keep that apparent ability
to reduce

                           </strong> I will speak briefly to amplify two or three of the
points that have emerged in our wide-ranging debate this afternoon,
which has been the result of the wide-ranging territory covered by the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
issue that I want to address relates to the anxieties that we in Labour
are experiencing about the potential for a disconnect between rents and
the housing benefit payments that will be available as a result of the
Government’s proposals. It is fair to say that broad rental
market areas do not work perfectly at present, and there can be quite
wide variations within such areas. A good example of that is in my own
community, as we are really a borough of two halves in Trafford. There
are real issues when there are higher housing cost areas and lower
housing cost areas within one broad rental market area.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important that we get the boundaries between those areas right and that
we retain the concept of a local rental market area. In other words, we
must understand the housing costs that have to be met in the context of
what local rents are like for local people. We in Labour are concerned
that over time the impact of the Government’s proposals could be
a weakening of that absolute local connection.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
important not only that we have a local area, and that it is the right
local area, but that claimants themselves understand it to be their
local area, because that will aid their attitude towards looking for
employment and help them to have a sense of where they can live while
still looking for work. If people are unclear about what area their
housing costs are likely to be covered within, and if they potentially
have to move, that will create higher anxiety about where they will
live while looking for employment. I suggest that local authority
boundaries are a good way of thinking about those broad rental market
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">The Government
have made a welcome commitment to review the impact of their housing
benefit reforms. That commitment came, very usefully, in the light of
the report by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions. Obviously that
report was not into the changes proposed in the Bill because it
predated a number of the proposals in the Bill. None the less, I think
that it is the Minister’s intention—I hope that it is his
intention—to conduct a wide review of the impact of all the
Government’s proposals on housing costs. Such a review would be
welcomed by Members on both sides of the
House.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
raise with Ministers the possibility that we do not have a
“once-and-then-never-again” review of the impact of the
Government’s proposals. As Labour Members have said, some of
those proposals will only take effect over a long period, and I think
that we all acknowledge that the housing market can fluctuate quite
widely at different points over a five or 10-year period. The housing
boom and bust market is a phenomenon that, regrettably, we are all very
familiar with. Consequently, I invite Ministers to consider not only a
one-off review but an ongoing review process. I hope that the Minister
will comment on that suggestion later this afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000282">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to say
something about under-occupation, which is a cause of great concern. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North said, we are all in
favour of supporting and incentivising people, where we can do so, to
move out of overly large properties and into properties that meet their
needs more effectively. Fundamentally, we do not agree that the tool
the Government are proposing to use will achieve that aim. Instead it
will put great financial pressure on people who are currently in
accommodation that is too large for
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000283">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
consequence will be felt by social landlords. They are regarded by
lenders as a good covenant and one reason for that is that their
rentals are very sound. There is genuine concern that if people in
social housing do not have sufficient moneys to meet their rental
obligations, and fall into arrears, which over time will create a
deficit for landlords, it could make lenders more reluctant to lend
money to social landlords to build more homes. It will potentially put
some of those landlords in breach of current financial covenants, and I
know that some social landlords are expressing that concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Cardiff Central raised useful points about some of the
family structures that could be impacted by some of these changes. I
wish to support family life, and I know that that wish is strongly
shared by Government Members. On the position of separated parents,
particularly the non-resident parent’s ability to have proper
accommodation for his or her children—it is usually his
children, but could be hers—to spend a good chunk of time in the
non-resident parent’s home, much argument is made by hon.
Members in some quarters for moving much more towards genuinely shared
parenting. There are wider issues that we may explore when we debate
child maintenance, but which I will not go into now. I invite the
Minister to comment on how the proposals are intended to promote the
continuing engagement of both parents in parenting their children after
separation, because there are legitimate concerns about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000285">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have had a lengthy discussion of the issues,
which in many ways mirrored this morning’s debate. There is a
clear philosophical divide between the Government and the Opposition.
Before I address the individual amendments, I will briefly set out that
divide so that we have a context against which to debate the
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our proposals
involve placing a limit on the amount of the housing element that goes
into universal credit— before that into housing benefit. The
housing element of universal credit lies at the heart of the clause and
the amendments. We have said, rightly and properly, that the support
that we provide for people who are on low incomes and entitled to
receive universal credit should include a housing element in
recognition of the fact that many people cannot afford to acquire
housing without financial support. It is right and proper that we do
so. There is no dispute about that; it is a clear and central part of
the proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000287">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
afternoon’s debate focused particularly on the decisions that we
have taken about the individual segments of the proposals, and I am
going to talk through each in 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>turn, but let me start with a simple fact and a principle. A lot has
been said this afternoon about the plans to limit access to housing
support, and the hon. Member for Westminster North has spoken a lot
about the impact that she says that will
have.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Most
fundamentally, we believe that we should have a system of support in
this country for those who are on low incomes in work, and particularly
for those who are out of work, which encourages them to move further up
the ladder of work. That is very much the discussion that we had this
morning. The welfare state should not be a place where people live; it
should be a place from which they aspire to climb. That lies at the
heart of our proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, in our view, we have a situation that is wholly unacceptable,
both in practical reality and in principle. It does a disservice to the
many people in this country who are struggling, in different
circumstances, and who depend on the welfare state. It brings the
welfare state into disrepute and adds to the stigma that some of those
people face, which has been rightly articulated by one or two
Opposition Members. It is best demonstrated by the all-too-regular
stories about absurdly expensive housing provision in the private
sector, which is funded by public sector housing support in a way that
is wholly unacceptable to the public at large. It provides a level of
support that is far beyond the means of working people in almost any
part of the country, through which properties in the most expensive
parts of town are paid for by us, the taxpayer, for people who rightly
need housing support but do not necessarily need housing support in the
best streets in town.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The big
failing is that it is not simply a question of bringing the system into
disrepute; the system also traps those people. If someone is living in
an area where they depend on substantial financial support, how can
they possibly move into a situation where they can escape from that
support?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000291">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I ask the Minister to be absolutely clear that we
are talking about two different ways of looking at the comparison
between what a low income working household might pay in rent and
support for out-of-work households. On the one hand we need to be clear
whether we are comparing the rent that each of those households pays or
comparing the rent that the low-income working household pays with the
local housing allowance rate, which may not be the actual rent incurred
by a non-working household. They might be in cheaper accommodation, for
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, as
the Minister is well aware, many low-income working households are in
receipt of housing benefit too, and many move between, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh East pointed out. People are in and out
of work and the universal credit will be helpful in that context for
obvious reasons. I should be grateful if the Minister could be
absolutely clear in his remarks that we are comparing like with
like.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000293">&#160;</a>

adversely affect, so she said, large numbers of people. I want to put
in context

                           </div>what we are doing. The upper limit to the housing support we are
providing is £20,800 per year for a four-bedroom house. Taking
the typical average spend from a household income on housing, that is
equivalent to the amount spent on housing by someone earning
£80,000 a year.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000294">&#160;</a>

that is not an unreasonable level of support for the state to set as a
limit and to say that we cannot afford to pay any more than that. What
is more, if we do not have that kind of limit, we will trap people
there in perpetuity. These are not amounts of money that people on
lower and middle incomes in work could possibly afford to spend
themselves. They rightly look at the system and say, “Actually,
there has to be a cap on what we spend.” We are supportive, we
are generous and we recognise in our society the need to provide for
those who are in difficulty, but there has to be a limit. That is what

                           </strong> It is a very substantial number. I will give the
hon. Gentleman the detailed figure in a moment. I do not have it in
front of me. I will give him another figure. Since 2000, private sector
housing and benefit awards have grown between 70% and 80%, while
average earnings have grown by only 30% to 40%. We have to bring the
situation under control. We must have a system that is logical and
sensible. Because extensive discussions have taken place within the
housing industry about the nature of the situation, we believe that the
vast majority of those affected by the changes we are bringing in will
not have to move. They will stay where they are with only a small
adjustment of rent from their landlord.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000297">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is
nothing unusual about having to commute. Very many working people have
to live in outer London because they cannot afford to live in central
London. That is perfectly normal in working life. The question we
should ask ourselves is whether we should artificially distort the
marketplace through the support we provide to those people, with a
potential impact, not so much on the housing market generally, but on
their ability to move into work. That is what we are about. That is
fundamental to the changes we are trying to put in place. We want a
system that encourages people to take steps into work. It cannot be
right to have a situation where the system effectively traps people,
because of the nature of their housing, from making progress on the
ladder of work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me set
out how we intend to approach the three different prime areas of
support in our housing sector. The universal credit will recognise that
different tenure types require different treatment. In the social
rented sector, although we will limit payments to tenants who
under-occupy their properties, we will base the money spent on actual
rent.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I pay tribute
to the hon. Member for Westminster North for the graceful way in which
she acknowledged the situation. When politicians say things, it is easy
for them to be blown up and distorted, but she made a fair point, and
the Committee listened respectfully. It is particularly important to
remember that for London, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 334<a class="bkMark" name="Column334">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but not only there, the proposals on LHA will not impact on people who
live in social housing. Many hundreds of thousands of people in central
London live in social housing, but they will not be affected by the
change. We do not expect to see a depopulation of the social rented
sector in central London. That would not be right, and it will not
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000300">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are seeking to make changes in the private rented sector. We are still
working on the details, but we intend to build on the LHA approach,
incorporating reforms that will be made over the coming year.
Private-sector tenants will have access to about 30% of the rental
market in their area, including in London. I cited figures to the hon.
Member for Glasgow Central showing that the amount of money that we are
spending is going up. At this point, Mr Weir, I draw your attention to
my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial
Interests.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have seen
rental levels rise and rise in recent years. There comes a point when
we have to say that we cannot go on with landlords setting their rents
according to the money that is available from the Government. We
believe that a combination of the limitations that we are placing on
the marketplace through the levels of rent that we are willing to pay,
and an appropriate formula for increasing rents year by year, adopting
CPI, will ensure that we continue to exert downward pressure on rents,
while we continue to look at rent levels in the local market. The
restriction will apply only in areas where local market rent increases
exceed the annual rate of CPI. We are committed to making savings from
the CPI measure up to 2014-15. I emphasise that we cannot automatically
ascribe a one-size-fits-all policy indefinitely without reviewing it.
We have said that if it becomes apparent that the LHA rates and rents
have become seriously out of step, we are free and able to reconsider
them. As ever, the Bill gives us the flexibility to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000302">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We intend to
commission independent external research to evaluate the impact of the
reforms to housing benefit. Again, that is the right thing to do. We
want to get it right. The review will be comprehensive and thorough. It
will be presented to both Houses, together with a ministerial
statement. We intend to make final findings available in early 2013,
with the initial findings available during 2012. When laying
regulations before Parliament, we will make clear the method by which
housing support rates will be uprated. I hope that I have provided some
additional clarity. The principle remains the same. We have to bring
what has been a fast-growing cost burden on the Government under
control in a variety of ways. We must restore credibility to the system
for a number of reasons.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000303">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall touch
briefly on mortgage interest. Clause 11 provides for the continuing
payment of mortgage interest. As should be the case, universal credit
treats mortgage interest in the same way as support for mortgage
interest—SMI—does at the moment. The introduction of
universal credit also provides us with a unique opportunity to simplify
some of the current housing support provisions. We will consult shortly
on reforms to supported accommodation and simplify the rules, while
ensuring that the support is properly targeted.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000304">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
why the hon. Member for Westminster North tabled her amendment, but I
ask her to bear in mind that if it is set in primary legislation that
mortgage interest payments always have to be paid through
universal  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 335<a class="bkMark" name="Column335">&#160;</a>
                           </div>credit, it may tie a future Government’s hands and cause
unintended consequences of a kind that the amendment is not intended to
achieve. In theory, it may seem a sensible safeguard, and one that
everyone would agree with. However, let us take as an example that a
future Government wanted to provide help for mortgage costs outside
universal credit, based on a different home ownership model, such as
the sustainable home ownership partnership of the kind proposed by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They would need new primary legislation to
make the change, whereas the approach in the Bill provides for
flexibility and would not make that a requirement. I hope that explains
to the hon. Lady why that element is not necessary. Of course, we
intend to provide support for owner-occupiers, but decisions may be
made in the future that universal credit is not always the best way to
provide that
support.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000305">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
me touch on the other issues raised. Returning to what the hon. Member
for Glasgow Central said about the housing benefit annual award, 3,500
families are receiving more than £25,000 a year; 110 households
receive more than £50,000 a year; and 30 households receive more
than £75,000 a year. I cannot give him the number receiving more
£20,000, but the number receiving between £12,000 and
£25,000 is 53,000. There is a dividing point, but it is many
thousands.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff Central made a thoughtful contribution,
and I absolutely understand her concerns. Of course we must ensure that
we do our best to replicate the world of work and the world outside
housing support. In many cases, it is logical and natural to say to
young people, “You need to share in the same way that you would
if you were operating outside the housing benefit world.” The
measures that she discussed are not in the Bill, but I will clarify the
situation for her. We have had a number of discussions with
stakeholders, representative groups and parliamentary colleagues, who
have highlighted issues of the kind that she made due reference to. The
groups involved are varied and have different characteristics, and it
is difficult to legislate for a single formula that applies to all of
them. We are continuing to consider our approach, but we have made
£190 million available through the discretionary housing funds,
which are available to local authorities to provide for such
circumstances. Across a number of other issues raised by hon. Members,
where changes are necessary as a result of the Bill and other
housing-related measures that we will put in place, there will be a
substantial payment to make available discretionary options that can
provide either a short-term transition or, in theory, longer-term
support for people in individual cases. My hon. Friend makes a fair
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000307">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A couple of
people mentioned the issue about women and men. There is, of course, no
compulsion for people to find a shared property with people of the
opposite sex if they choose not to. I say to the hon. Member for
Stretford and Urmston that I am mindful of domestic violence, which is
one reason why we have made sure that in the conditionality rules,
women escaping domestic violence have a window to get their lives
sorted out before the job search rules apply. We are sensitive to that
and will continue to look for sensible ways to ease the pressures on
women in that position.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000308">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Nottingham South asked about the future for local authority
staff. We are still in discussion with local authorities about that.
Powers are being passed to local authorities on, for example, council
tax benefit as a result of the Bill. It is therefore not yet entirely
clear what the work load will be for staff before and after. I make no
pretence that there will not be changes. It is not our intention to
transfer significant numbers of staff back to Jobcentre Plus, but we
are in discussions with local authorities and the DCLG about how to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady made an important point about having local support available.
I remind her that Jobcentre Plus is there to handle the rest of the
benefit system, with 700 branches around the country; probably more
than local authority housing benefit offices. Therefore, there should
be no lack of availability for people in the position that she has
described to seek advice and help with applications and sorting out the
new arrangements. Local authorities will retain their responsibility
for housing, as opposed to housing benefit, and so will undoubtedly
continue to offer practical advice and guidance for people who need
housing. For example, they will retain responsibility for sorting
people out with temporary accommodation.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Fundamentally,
all these things return to what is at heart a philosophical divide
between the two sides. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for
Westminster North earlier, who set out myriad concerns. We have to step
back and ask, “What are we trying to achieve?” We are
trying to achieve a housing benefit system—a system of housing
support—that will be integrated in the universal credit, and
which supports our goal of moving people off welfare and into work and,
most importantly, closely replicates the realities of life when people
are back in
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">A
system that artificially distorts the environment in which people live
and are likely to live, for reasons that may be noble and may be
well-meaning, makes the challenge that such people face in escaping
from welfare dependency more difficult. That is why we have adopted
this approach. That is why there is disagreement between us. We have
been careful to ensure that substantial funds are available to local
authorities to deal with the changes that lie
ahead.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the consequence of what we are doing will be to drive down
rents and make it more likely that people will be able to stay in their
homes within a new system, but the reality is that some people’s
lives will change as a result. If their lives do not change, it is
difficult to see how they will be able to escape their current
position, get properly into long-term work and escape from dependency
on the state altogether. Fundamentally, that is why we are making the
changes. That is why we will be pressing ahead with the measures set
out in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Lady will not press her
amendments, but if she chooses to do so, I will ask my colleagues to
back the measures in the Bill and reject her
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000313">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is absolutely right to say that there is a philosophical
divide. He is also right in saying that there are objectives in the
universal credit—and there will be an element within housing
costs—that are driving ahead with agendas to simplify work. We
agree that there are aspects of the present system that do not work
brilliantly. The problem with the central thrust of the
Minister’s argument, and we have heard it before in this
respect, is that by concentrating as he has done on a relatively small
number of extreme cases, the kind that have drawn tabloid attention,
and a wider pool of cases where there are indeed issues about the
levels of rent and work incentives, he is drawing us away—I
hesitate to say he is doing it deliberately—from the fact that
those few thousands of extreme cases are actually a cover for changes
prefiguring the introduction of the universal credit, which will affect
670,000 people. That is an important point. But there is a genuine
debate to be had about work incentives in very high value parts of
central London. I completely agree with that and that is something that
needs to be dealt with. But why it would need Cornwall, for example, to
face 10,250 losers losing an average of £44 a month, I am not
quite sure, or why Dover would have 2,200 losers losing £250 a
month.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000315">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Does the hon. Lady not accept that in many ways
she has highlighted precisely the rationale for the change? Whether it
is Cornwall or Dover, there is absolutely no reason why people needing
support from the state to find a home to live in cannot do so at a
price that is affordable within the limits that we are setting. It may
require a change in their lives to do so—it may require a move
down the road—but there is no reason why they should not live
perfectly well in those two
places.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000316">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The impact will vary in different parts of the
country. We do not really know exactly how it will work. When people
are making semi-market decisions about where they choose to live, then
choosing reasonably priced accommodation is the right thing to do. But
what we must not do—this was the spirit behind the
amendments—is roll forward a system of housing costs that have
disincentives, particularly in parts of the country where there is not
a response from landlords for different reasons. People need to be
connected to the labour market and they need to be reasonably close to
work without incurring disincentives in travel costs. We must ensure
that there is a reasonable range of accommodation so that communities
are not broken up and disrupted. Above all, we must be in a situation
where we do not have perverse and unintended consequences that drive
costs up in terms of unemployment. That will not be everyone’s
experience, but it might be for a number sufficiently large to be quite
damaging. That is not me speaking; that is based on extensive
university research that has been done for the Chartered Institute of
Housing, Shelter and other organisations. It is not fanciful; it is a
genuine risk. That risk will grow as the changes that have already come
in are potentially exacerbated by the move to CPI over the long
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000317">&#160;</a>

that respect. The Minister confirmed that discussions are ongoing on

participate in the workplace. The absence of a home, or too much
dislocation, has monetary costs, alongside all kinds of social costs.

Members are genuinely concerned about the decision to exclude council
tax benefit from universal credit, and we have a number of questions on
that point. We know that council tax benefit was going to be included,
and now it is not. We know that there is an impact on universal credit,
and that it sets up some interesting questions about localism against
the aims of universal credit. Of course, there are problems with
decentralising the council tax benefit policy at the same time as
introducing a 10% cut. Whether or not one accepts that that cut is
right, there are issues about how it is implemented.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Council tax
benefit is abolished later in the Bill—I believe it is in clause
34. The amendment, however, takes the opportunity of using a clause
that deals with housing costs to tag on questions about the taxes that
fall on housing, which will allow us to debate why the position has
changed on council tax benefit, and what the implications of that are.
As I said about housing benefit and housing costs, we know that both
housing benefit and council tax benefit have a number of similarities
in the way that they have worked for individuals and households. Both
have tended to act as shock absorbers for individuals at a time when
their earnings have fallen out. If someone loses their job or suffers a
significant drop in income, in their different ways, those benefits can
be automatically triggered to relieve what in many cases, hopefully,
are only temporary problems for the household.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We originally
expected an equivalent of council tax benefit to be included in
universal credit in the Welfare Reform Bill. The White Paper stated
that that would happen, promising
that<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“help

                        </p>
                        <p>would
be included. There were several good arguments for that. According to
the Chartered Institute of Housing’s excellent analysis of
aspects of the Welfare Reform Bill, if, among other things, council tax
benefit had been included in universal credit, the income range where
households are better off under current arrangements would have
disappeared. There is, therefore, a smoothing and incentive effect to
be had by integrating CTB into universal credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000331">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That was,
therefore, quite rightly the Government’s original intention. We
understand and sympathise with the Secretary of State, who, we believe,
fought to ensure that the £4.8 billion budget was integrated
into universal credit. With such an important element of universal
credit now left out, there is a question over whether we can continue
to call the credit truly universal. If it was the Department for Work
and Pensions that had a change of heart and decided voluntarily to
localise an important but distinct part of the system, we have yet to
hear a convincing explanation of why that was the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000332">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My suspicion
is that there was something of a battle royal at the heart of
Government between the two different Departments. I am put in mind of
the Oscar-winning film “There Will Be Blood,” in which
Daniel Day-Lewis and his rivals fight over subterranean oil

			Column number: 340<a class="bkMark" name="Column340">&#160;</a>
                           </div>wells. In this context, I have cast the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government as Daniel Day-Lewis, saying to the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, “I drink your
milkshake!” In this respect, he has done that, and I do not
think that it was voluntary. The council tax benefit pool was the
result of a victory by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, which is regrettable.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000333">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
invited to consider the prospect that, between June and October, the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions was so struck by the power of
the localism agenda that he volunteered to hand some of the shelves of
his bookcase over, at the same time as rightly ensuring—subject
to various caveats that we have already discussed—that the
housing component, which is currently localised, is put into universal
credit. Therefore, one component is going one way and one is going the
other.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000334">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am delighted that that is not a particularly
difficult intervention to deal with, and although I cannot personally
testify about the excellence of Wychavon district council, I am
perfectly prepared on this occasion to take the hon. Lady’s word
for it. Indeed, there is much excellent administration, some poor
administration and some authorities move between the two. I am reminded
of a time a few years ago when my own local authority had some 26,000
items of unopened post at the beginning of the contracting-out stage.
Local government, however, does a good job. It is odd, therefore, that
the housing dimension is effectively being taken into central control,
when I would have thought that if a local authority was better placed
to have a real grasp on what was going on locally, it might be in the
area of local housing costs, rather than around council tax, which is
now being given to local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000336">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
things stand, given that localism has won, we are discussing the
important principles about the entirely laudable aims of universal
credit, which are the simplification and integration of benefit system
and the best means of making work pay, without knowing anything about
how the important £4.8 billion component of support for
out-of-work and working households is actually going to work. This has
an impact on 5.8 million people—3.6 million of them
are under 65—who receive an average of £15.88 a week. A
huge number of people will have this element of integration and
simplification taken out of universal credit, and a significant amount
of money will be
involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
rules governing the eligibility for council tax benefit are currently
similar to those for housing benefit. The rulebook for council tax
benefit and housing benefit, which is virtually being
replaced—details are still to come for housing
benefit—currently consists of four volumes, totalling over 1,200
pages, which are the responsibility of local authorities. It is hard to
see how local authorities will not continue to have to administer the
equivalent of 1,200 pages and four volumes of rules, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 341<a class="bkMark" name="Column341">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but, instead of having to do that for two sets of benefits, it will be
one only, while everything else is left in universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000338">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have no real insight into what this is all going to mean. Neither do we
know when this is actually going to happen or what the overlaps are.
The Minister may be able to clarify that. According to the White Paper,
the 10% cut in the cost of council tax benefit is due to take effect in
April 2013, which is six months before the first new claimant is due to
enter universal credit and 12 months before even the first
person receiving existing benefits is moved to universal credit. Now
that council tax benefit is effectively going to be abolished, rather
than simply cut, will the Minister confirm that the timetable is still
the same and that the existing system will cease to be in April 2013,
which is in just 24 months’ time? That is not
consistent with the introduction of universal credit. Why is that
decision being taken? Why will there be different starting points for
universal credit and the important sub-component that will run
alongside it, overlap it and, in many important ways,
undermine
it?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000339">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
other problem with all of this is that—the Minister will correct
me if I am wrong—we do not have an impact assessment. The
Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member
for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb) said in November that an impact
assessment of council tax benefit localisation would be published
“when legislation is introduced”. I recently received a
reply from a Minister in the Department for Communities and Local
Government saying that a consultation would be launched in due course.
So we do not know very much about this at all. We are invited to
consider important and sound aspects of the universal credit and its
impact on work incentives and tapers without having either an impact
assessment or a consultation paper, which would give some indication of
how it will be implemented by local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000340">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Localism
advocates usually say, in many cases rightly, that they reflect the
wishes of local councils for greater control. But I think it is true to
say that, even though local authorities might welcome any additional
powers, the Local Government Association’s evidence flags up a
serious number of risks. It does not look as if we are in any position
to receive answers, although the Minister might be able to
respond.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000341">&#160;</a>

on.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000346">&#160;</a>

have said that the White Paper made it clear that Ministers were
expecting council tax benefit to be included, and the White Paper made
a very strong argument for that. It pointed out that the rules are
already extremely complex and that they should be simplified. As we
keep saying, the universal credit simplification and integration agenda
is absolutely right. It is what we want, and it is what we all agree

universal credit is seeking to do away with absolutely that. A smooth
transition between being in work and out of work is absolutely the
right thing to do, but council tax benefits exclusion means that it
will not happen. It means that people will still have to go to and have
contact with more than one agency. Probably, unless the Minister tells
me otherwise, they will still have to report changes in circumstances
to more than one agency. If people’s earnings decrease or they
fall out of employment, there is still a risk of their experiencing a
delay in payment of council tax benefit, because they will have to go
to another
agency.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000350">&#160;</a>

fear is that it is worse than that, because the selling of the
universal credit as the answer—the total response—to
people’s incomes changing in and out of work may have the
perverse effect of making people less likely even to think that they
have to go to local government to deal with their council tax benefit.
We already know that one of the flaws of council tax benefit, which I
completely accept, is that it does not have particularly high levels of
take-up compared with most other benefits. If we are in a system in
which nearly all in and out-of-work

consequences will almost certainly be that fewer people will think to

the reduced back-dating period, people might not get the benefit at
all, which I am sure is not what the DWP want to happen; I am sure that
it wants to find a way of responding to that, so that there are no
problems about lack of take-up and about the short back-dating period
meaning that people fall out of entitlement, with all the dangers that
that represents. It is a struggle to understand how any of that can be

                           </strong> I do. To turn it the other way round, integrating
all benefits into one—we will probably discuss caveats and fire
walls later—is absolutely the right thing to do. If the
Government want to simplify through integration, which is the single
most important marker of what they are trying to do with the universal
credit, that is what they should do. Of course, it is what the DWP
wanted. It was in the White Paper, but the policy has changed since
then, without any convincing explanation. In the oral evidence sessions
last week, we heard evidence that forcefully drives home that
point.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000354">&#160;</a>

the potential to create a post code lottery in terms of entitlement to
assistance with council tax payments; an increase in complexity and a
lack of transparency with authorities designing their own policies on
entitlement; the possibility of authorities using council tax benefit
to persuade low-income households to live elsewhere—I have to
admit that that one had not occurred to me—and having two levels
of Government sharing control over tax and benefit
redistribution.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000356">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
New Policy Institute has posited that, if the existing CTB withdrawal
rates apply, this could lift the anticipated marginal rate of
withdrawal from 65% to 72%. Lord Freud told us back in November, after
the decision to devolve council tax benefit to local authorities so
that local authorities can start to shape where it goes—we shall
see—that:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000362">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
are also determined to make sure that it works with the incentive
structure of our taper on the universal credit. This will ensure that
we do not have something working against that set of
incentives”.—[<em>Official Report, House of Lords,</em> 11

                        <p class="tabbed">I
completely understand why he has some anxiety. At present, one pound in
every five earned in a mini-job could be lost in the form of reduced
CTB. Even if the tapers were no steeper than at present, someone
earning £6 an hour in a 10-hour-a-week mini-job could end up
losing as a result of this £624 a year in reduced council tax
benefit. That seems to me to be a huge disincentive. I do not think
that that is a universal experience, but it is certainly a
genuinely-worked model. When you start taking into account some of the
other costs involved in going to work, which are inevitable—we
all accept that travel, in particular, costs—that loss alone
could make the difference. I think the Government will have to accept,
if work is always going to pay, that it could make the difference as to
whether a mini-job is effectively worth
taking.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
DWP had been really determined to ensure that the taper did not work
against the improved incentives that universal credit offers, it would
have insisted on designing the council tax benefit replacement itself.
I do not think Ministers are saying, with their localism agenda, that
DWP will be designing the CTB replacement and its taper—I am
sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. I wonder why it is
that even if delivery was to be devolved, DWP was not insisting on
implementing the stated commitment to work with the incentive structure
of the taper on universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000364">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
also wonder whether potentially—I hope that the Minister will
assure me that this is not the case—there is a risk that the
circle is going to be squared another way. After all, the taper only
exists because people in receipt of means-tested benefits currently
receive full relief on their council tax. That is, their council tax
benefit is equivalent to 100% of their council tax. If the Government
decided that people on benefits should, in future pay some or all of
their own council tax, the taper could be lower, or not needed at all.
Of course, the price of doing this would be borne by the very poorest
people, the people we have always ensured, or sought to ensure, do not
fall below a certain minimum out of work. They would have to pay,
potentially, tens of pounds a week towards their own council tax That
would certainly

                           </div>protect the work-incentive element of the council tax benefit, but it
would do so at the expense of the absolute
poorest.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000365">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not believe that this is what the Minister intends to do, but the
problem, however, stands that, with the abolition of council tax
benefit going on, no replacement in sight and no clarity about how
local authorities will carry that forward and make the 10% reduction as
well, it is hard to see exactly what the alternatives are going to be.
Either there will be some fundamental changes in council tax overall
and we do not know what they are, or some of the poorest people, who do
not currently do so, are going to have to contribute to their own
council tax, or one minimal additional set of tapers, not currently
factored in to the universal credit—and possibly a
multiplicity—are going to be laid on top of the council tax
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Lord
Freud recently admitted that the tension between a single taper and
localism was “tough”, but he said:<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000367">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“I can assure

                        </p>
                        <p>I
am not sure whether £4.8 billion constitutes “a
ha’p’orth of tar”, but I cannot see a way around
it. I cannot see the mechanisms for doing something different, and we
do not know the time scale or the wider implications of the measure. I
do not know whether my colleagues will want to raise points that I have
not explored. What are the implications for the devolved authorities?
There are many issues concerning how the benefit will work
elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000368">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I did not
focus particularly on the 10% reduction because if such a reduction has
to be made, it has to be made. Making a fundamental set of changes to
the administration of this benefit—which is at odds with its
central thrust—while at the same time making a 10% cut, seems to
be storing up a great deal of trouble. It will increase, rather than
reduce, the risk of having many different variations, and that will
have all sorts of unfortunate implications for local authorities. The
potential for those different variations is enhanced because as the New
Policy Institute’s modelling found out, the 10% reduction
applied to a locally-delivered alternative to council tax benefit shows
the disproportionate impact of that cut on authorities in areas of high
deprivation, with the most affected losing more than four times as much
per dwelling as the least affected. If local authorities pass on the
cuts to claimants, recipients of council tax benefit in Richmond, for
example, could expect to lose an average of £120 a
year.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000369">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These are
profound issues, and we do not have an impact assessment or a
consultation document on the interaction between the 10% cut and the
local administration of council tax benefits, and the disproportionate
impact in different local authorities. Almost inevitably, it means that
there will be more than one taper. I cannot see how it could work any
other way. Therefore, we will have all the disadvantages that the
Department for Work and Pensions accepted come with a multiple entry
point into the benefit system.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000370">&#160;</a>

wrong decision. I accept that it is almost certainly not a voluntary
decision by the DWP, but none the less we are dealing with a
significant and important piece of in and out-of-work benefit that has
been taken out of the universal credit against original intentions.
That has many risks and implications for

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr Weir. I am sure that as a fellow Scot you will be delighted that I
am going to cover some of the issues concerning the devolved
Administrations, and Scotland in particular. It is strange that council
tax benefit changes have been left out of the universal credit. That
goes against the whole principle of universal credit in the first
place. The main principle behind universal credit is to have simplicity
in our system, but we will achieve that only if all benefits are within
that universal credit system. If council tax benefit is devolved to
local administrations, we could have hundreds of different systems
operating right across the country. That goes against the principle of
simplicity.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
principle of universal credit concerns the transparency of the
financial benefits of being in work, which will come only with a
uniform system right across the country. A different means test by a
local authority, for example, or difficulty in determining financial
breakdown and eligibility in different areas will not provide
simplicity or clarity to an individual about whether they are better
off in work. The Government need to consider that point, and I hope the
Minister will address
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000373">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope the
Minister will also address how the system will affect marginal
deduction rates. I want to put that into the context of the number of
people and the link between council tax benefit and housing benefit and
the overlap between the two. In November 2010, 5.8 million people
claimed council tax benefit, and 4.3 million of them also claimed
housing benefit. Two thirds of council tax benefit recipients received
a passported benefit. Such benefits have not been covered in the Bill,
nor have we seen detailed regulations on them. They include
income-related benefits such as income support, pension credit,
income-based JSA or
ESA.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000374">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Half
of council tax benefit recipients aged under 60 have dependent
children, which is another issue that has not been detailed in the Bill
or regulations. The average council tax benefit award is £15.88
a week, so it is by no means a small amount for hundreds of thousands
of families. Of those who receive council tax benefit, 2.7
million are aged over 60, which is 46% of the total. We are talking not
about the working population, but about some of the most vulnerable
people in our communities—for example, our
pensioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000375">&#160;</a>

implications following the Scottish election and the proposals for a
local income tax from two of the main four political parties that will
have a massive impact on how the policy will affect families across
Scotland. A two-way more detailed discussion needs to take place
between the UK Government and the Scottish Government and local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000383">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
left at an interesting moment. I was being harangued by Government
Members for my comments. I want to put on record some concerns of a
party that deals with local authorities in Scotland about the lack of
consultation on the Bill. My intention is by no means to dwell on that
point, but rather to concentrate on the key elements—the
substance—of their concerns. I want some real debate and
information from the Minister to get clarification on a few
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000392">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Four
key points have been raised by the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities. First, in its words, the “indiscriminate cutting of
budgets” will act as a “disincentive to fiscal
responsibility.” As hon. Members will be aware, council tax has
been frozen for the past four years in Scotland and for six years in
the city of Glasgow. COSLA is concerned that a 10% cut in council tax
benefit might be a disincentive and penalise local authorities in
Scotland, which have already made many efficiency savings over the past
four years. Such authorities might not have much incentive to find more
such savings, which might have an impact on local services. Have the UK
Government, local authorities and the Scottish Government discussed
that matter?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000393">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, how
will the 10% cut be applied? If it is applied across the
board—across the country—rather than as a 10% cut in
existing money spent in Scotland, there will be a disproportionate
impact on Scotland. As my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North
has said, the impact of the cuts will fall on those areas with higher
deprivation. If the measure is taken across the board, rather than by
each devolved Administration, the consequence is likely to be an extra
£50 million of cuts in Scotland. Is that factored into any of
the proposals?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000394">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Thirdly,
COSLA is concerned about council tax benefit and the effect on the 20%
taper. I should be grateful to hear any comments from the Minister. I
shall move on quickly, because we have been in Committee for a
while.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, what
effect will the measure have on the transfer of responsibility and its
impact on local budgets? At present, if we commit to devolving all
spending to local authorities, we might say, “This is what we
currently spend in this local authority; this is the amount that it
will get.” What impacts will be taken into consideration? If,
for example, demand for council tax benefit were to increase, would
that be taken into account? As my hon. Friend has said, uptake is very
low for council tax benefit—COSLA estimates that only 65% of
people 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 349<a class="bkMark" name="Column349">&#160;</a>
                           </div>who are eligible in Scotland apply for it and receive it. In the current
economic situation, with the tightening of budgets and with benefit and
other cuts, the demand for council tax benefit might increase in
certain local authorities. Will that be factored in when budgets are
being agreed? Will there be a continual review of the impact of council
tax benefit demands on local authorities? Broadly, those are the four
main
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are other concerns on which clarification would be helpful. Will the
money that goes to councils be constantly reviewed? What amounts will
go to them at the outset? If there is no centralised system and
councils have to set up their own systems, will they get a lump sum to
do so at the beginning of the process? Local authorities should not
have to find such money in their budgets, which are already cut by
10%.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000397">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What ongoing
discussions will the Government and the devolved Administrations have
when the Bill is enacted and the legislation is passed, particularly if
we have a change of Administration? Such a change might not be your
preference, Mr Weir. If the Administration in Wales or Scotland were to
change at an early stage, what discussions would take place with those
new Governments on the impact of any change under the Bill that
depended on the results of discussions with local
authorities?<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000398">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I shall
conclude with a few comments from some of the key charities and
non-governmental organisations that have been involved in the debate
over the past few months. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee
will recognise the tremendous contribution that they have made in
providing us with briefings, information and clarity on many matters.
They have helped to inform us about the implications of the changes for
thousands of our constituents. I want to put on record my thanks to all
the charities and NGOs for their hard work and efforts. Some of them
have already been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
Westminster North, so I am not going to dwell on them too
much.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000399">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Barnardo’s,
for example, has said that even if eligibility is decided locally, the
benefit should be paid through universal credit to give clarity and
simplicity to the system. That will ensure there is no postcode
lottery. Again, my hon. Friend has covered many of the points about the
impact of a postcode lottery, increasing complexity, a lack of
transparency and the possibility that people will be forced to move
from a local authority. Interestingly, the Institute for Fiscal Studies
has said that, of all the changes that are taking place in welfare
reform and across the Government, the council tax benefit issue is of
most concern. That needs to be reflected in the Minister’s
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000400">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
shall end by making the point that the New Policy Institute has
modelled the broad cut of 10% across the country and has said that it
will have a disproportionate impact on authorities of high deprivation.
That is a serious concern to me and my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow East. I am sure that hon. Members who represent some of the
most deprived constituencies will see a disproportionate cut and impact
on thousands of our constituents. That concern also needs to be
considered. The New Policy Institute has estimated that the
measures  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 350<a class="bkMark" name="Column350">&#160;</a>
                           </div>will have four times more of an impact on those living in the most
deprived areas than on those living in more affluent areas. What impact
will the measure have on poverty in those regions? We were promised a
detailed equality impact assessment from another Minister when the
proposals were introduced. However, we have not seen any such equality
impact assessment on the possible effects of devolving council tax
benefit to local authorities. I hope that the Minister will address
those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000401">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will be brief because I know that everyone is
keen to wrap up for today. I want to put on the record that I also have
some serious concerns about the abolition of council tax benefit. I am
very supportive of the localism agenda—in fact, it has been part
of the Lib Dems’ DNA for decades. The strength of universal
credit is its simplicity. The single taper rate and single system is
what will make it work. Removing council tax benefit has the potential
to undermine
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000402">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
real concern is about the impact that the measure could have on the
work incentive, which is a key part of universal credit. I am concerned
that councils could undermine that work incentive, which has been
created and fostered by the Government. For example, if a Government of
any colour decided to reduce the taper rate, councils could take that
opportunity to realise some savings by reducing the amount that they
put into council tax benefit, thereby undermining the
Government’s efforts to encourage people back into
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000403">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
already heard about the situation in Scotland. As a Welsh MP, the
matter is of particular concern to me because of the implications for
devolution. Westminster can only devolve power to the Welsh Assembly
Government and the Scottish Parliament; it cannot devolve it down to
local authorities. England, Wales and Scotland will definitely have
three different systems, which will undermine the system’s
simplicity. Depending on what the political circumstances are in the
devolved Administrations, that could also have an impact on the work
incentive.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000404">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">The
benefit system has not been devolved—although lots of other
things have been—in principle, to ensure that support for those
who are out of work and on low incomes is consistent across the UK.
Such an approach also ensures that the system does not encourage people
to move from one area to another to get a better level of benefit. Such
consistency is very important. The measure has the potential to
undermine that and change that policy. People could get and probably
will get differing levels of support from their local council,
depending on where they live. That will change in a fundamental way how
the benefit system works, both for those in work and out of work. I
have concerns about the policy and I would be interested to hear the
Minister’s
response.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000405">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will try to keep my remarks brief but full, Mr
Weir, if you get my gist. Let me start with the principles of what we
are seeking to achieve. Clause 34 makes provision for the future
abolition of council tax benefit. It will not abolish it immediately,
but it makes it possible for that to happen in due course. At the time
of the spending review, we announced that council tax support will be
localised from April 2013. The amendment has the reverse effect,
seeking to lock in support for council tax into universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000406">&#160;</a>
                        </p>  
                        <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 351<a class="bkMark" name="Column351">&#160;</a>
                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Council tax
benefit is currently delivered by local authorities but administered in
accordance with nationally prescribed rules, which means that the
benefit can reflect local circumstances in only a limited way. For
example, local authorities can decide how to treat income from war
pensions, but have little discretion beyond that to vary the national
scheme.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000407">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
localising council tax support we aim to ensure that local authorities
will be able to tailor support to meet the needs of their local
communities. That is the dilemma, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff Central is absolutely right, there will always be a tension
between localism and centralisation. If we take steps to move
responsibility down to a local level, there will always be some ways in
which we could come back and ask about this or that. I take her point
about the work incentive issue, which I will come back to in a moment,
but I fully accept the tension between the status quo and localism
positions. We will find that in a lot of places throughout government.
If the philosophy of localism lies at the heart of what the Government
want to achieve, we will sometimes have to deal with those tensions and
overcome them. That is what we intend to do with council tax benefit,
which, after all, provides support for the relief of a tax that is
decided and paid locally and in which central Government, rightly, does
not have an active
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000408">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On balance, we
think that decisions about the support to be provided should be made at
a local level and, combined with other incentives, such as the local
retention of business rates, the changes will give councils a greater
stake in the economic development of their area. Currently, council tax
benefit is also costly to administer and difficult for people to
understand. Localising support gives us the opportunity to remove some
of the
complexities.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000409">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turning
to the points made, but in no particular order, I shall start with the
Scottish issue. The hon. Member for Glasgow Central made a number of
sensible points, but I do not think that he has been fully and properly
briefed by the local government team in Scotland. The meeting that took
place in March involved senior civil servants, the level at which we
would expect such a discussion to take place. In a devolved world,
inevitably the starting point is with the devolved
Administration.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Scotland
might seek to take a different approach, which is theoretically
possible. If the scheme could be run at devolved Administration level,
it might be done at a local government level, but I do not
know—we have not yet reached the point in the discussions at
which final decisions have been taken. It is right and proper, where we
have a devolved settlement in the UK, for us to have full discussions
with the devolved Administrations about plans, while working with DCLG
to identify the best way of delivering our localising plans for council
tax benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000411">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Glasgow Central and others mentioned the 10% cut. It is
true, we have had to make some tough decisions, and that is one of
them. I will not rehearse all the arguments for why we have had to take
tough decisions. Ultimately, there are things that

overall package of change that spreads throughout our society, that is

                        <p class="tabbed">What is
important, which we very much recognise—my hon. Friend the
Member for Cardiff Central was absolutely right to make it
clear—is that we must not diminish the work incentive, whatever
structures we put in place. Our current discussions with DCLG are very
much focused on how we ensure that the localisation of council tax
benefit does not create the impediment to work that she described. Nor
do I think that there will be a desire at local council level for that
to happen, because it is often local councils, through the various
services that they provide, that must pick up the pieces from
worklessness.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000413">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not trying to hold up the Committee but I
want to make a brief point. I absolutely agree with the Minister about
work incentives. In the east end of Glasgow, that is a huge issue. I
can tell the Minister that the resources that people get from council
tax benefit are actively factored into their decisions and calculations
about whether it is in their interest to go to work. If that money is
removed as he suggests—I take his point about devolution, but
irrespective of what that Scottish Government do—such a change
could very much alter the impact of universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000414">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I accept that the change must be done immensely
carefully. I accept some of the points made about the differential
spread of budgets around the UK and some areas having a higher take-up
than others. Those are clearly things we must take into account in the
detail of what we do. Leaving aside the issue of the financial change,
it is our desire to ensure that we get it right, that we devise a
system that has appropriate local flexibility but marries closely with
our overall objectives for universal credit. We will bring more detail
before Members as time goes by. This will not be the last occasion on
which this is debated, as the Bill passes through both Houses of
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000415">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Fundamentally,
in the job we are doing behind the scenes, we seek to find a vehicle to
ensure that we can deliver a benefit that balances against a local tax
on a local basis with local discretion to integrate into local
strategies, without undermining the work incentives that lie within
universal credit. I am happy to commit to the Committee that we will
bring forward as soon as practical further information about our plans.
It is not true to say that there is a great bust-up behind the scenes.
We are trying to find the best way to make something work, which fits
clearly with our philosophy of localism. We will keep the Committee
informed and keep everyone involved briefed, as the Bill goes through
the House and the other place. We will have to bring the detail back to
Parliament before any measure can be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000416">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The measure in
the Bill is to enable that work to take place. I hope that hon. Members
will allow that work to take place, that they will leave the Bill with
the flexibility we need to make that change, and that they will judge
the detailed proposals as and when they come
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000417">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not doubt that that is exactly what the
Minister wants to do. I do not doubt that there are very powerfully
expressed negotiations going on in that respect. The fact is I do not
see how it can work. Even allowing for effective negotiations dealing
with some of the fundamental problems about localisation, it is
fundamentally wrong and unacceptable that there is localisation at all,
that this very important and significant strand of funding for in and
out-of-work benefits is absent from universal credit, and that we have
so little information about how it will work, while we are discussing
universal
credit.<a class="bkMark" name="11040127000418">&#160;</a>
