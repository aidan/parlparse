<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
1</h4><a name="06062050000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Fraud</div><a name="06062050000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000286"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Mr. Amess, it is a pleasure to
introduce clause one, which introduces the new general offence of
fraud. It establishes the three ways in which the offence can be
committed. These are fraud by false representation, failing to disclose
information and abuse of position. The new offence will extend to
England and Wales and Northern Ireland. It will have a maximum
custodial sentence of 10 years. The new offence closely follows
proposals set out in the 2002 Law Commission report on fraud, which
concluded:</div><a name="06062050000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
existing legislation was deficient in a number of
respects.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
over-particularisation of the deception offences in the Theft Act means
that it is possible for some behaviour to fall outside the statutory
offences. Therefore, defence lawyers can argue that it may have been
some form of deception but it was not that precise form of deception.
The prosecutors have charged the defendant with the wrong
offence.</div><a name="06062050000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the
risk that the offences are going to result in unjustified acquittals
and costly appeals. The reliance on deception, as an essential
ingredient of the crime, is problematic if it is not always clear that
there is a victim who has been deceived. For example, a shopkeeper may
have accepted a credit card for a payment not knowing, or being
indifferent to, whether the cardholder has the authority to use the
card, provided that the transaction results in the shopkeeper being
paid, which it normally would.</div>
<a name="06062050000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Commission concludes
that the laws of fraud could be improved by the introduction of a
general offence of fraud. A general law would improve the prosecution
process, first by reducing the chances of offences being wrongly
charged. Secondly it would, by virtue of its simplicity, be fairer to
citizens who might face a trial and would better be able to understand
the law. Thirdly, it would provide a greater flexibility to keep pace
with the increasing use of technology in crimes of fraud.</div>
<a name="06062050000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals for this offence
were widely welcomed during the consultations undertaken by the
Government and will improve the law of fraud by moving away from the
existing patchwork of deception offences towards a clearer definition
of fraud. The simplified and rationalised fraud offence will provide
those working on the frontline with the necessary tools to be able to
tackle fraud more
effectively.</div><a name="06062050000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000287"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> May I first of all apologise for removing my
jacket without permission? I made an assumption of your benevolence
that I should not have made, although I am delighted that having done
so, I was not ticked off. I thank you for that. Broadly speaking, I
welcome the new offence of fraud and have no doubt that the
Solicitor-General is right in what he says about the necessity of
having such an offence. I also welcome the manner in which the Law
Commission put forward the proposals.
The Government have followed
those proposals inclause 1 and I have every reason to welcome
what has been done.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 5</div><a name="06062050000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I was to
flag up a concern, it would be one that will become clearer a little
further on in the Bill, when we come to fraud by abuse of position. But
it is also worth highlighting it as this stage. As the
Solicitor-General rightly says, one of the consequences of what we are
doing is dealing with the problem of the victimless crime.</div>
<a name="06062050000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although little crime is
victimless, my experience of fraud cases&#151;in particular, one long
fraud trial in which I was involved&#151;was that, as the
Solicitor-General has highlighted, the prosecution case collapsed
precisely because it was unable to show upon whom the false
representations had been operated. As I was appearing for the defence I
suppose I was jolly glad about
this.</div><a name="06062050000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case was one
of mortgage fraud. The nature of the crime was that fictitious
applications were being made for mortgages in the names of all sorts of
people who did not exist, or front individuals were being used to apply
for mortgages. But the mortgages all related to real properties. As the
case proceeded, it became quite clear that those operating in the
building societies at a time when the market was entirely buoyant and
was rising spectacularly could not have cared less where the
applications for mortgages were coming from. As far as they were
concerned, they knew that the lending was secure on the property;
therefore, the fact that the circumstances in which this information
was coming to them was totally bogus was of no interest to
them.</div>
<a name="06062050000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A cynic might
have said that they were rather pleased to get the work; as they were
all on bonuses according to the amount of mortgages that they were
handing out and they knew that the lending was secure, they may even
have turned a blind eye to the fact that the person submitting this
large number of mortgages was in fact concocting the names of the
people making the applications.</div>
<a name="06062050000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That illustrates precisely the
sort of point the Solicitor-General and the Law Commission have
highlighted and which clause 1 is designed to deal with. The sort of
activity I have just described would be caught by the clause because,
by its very nature it was a case of false representation and failures
to disclose information about what was taking place.</div>
<a name="06062050000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I make that point to the
Solicitor-General because as we look at the Bill in its entirety, we
will have to be careful to try to ensure that we draw a dividing line
between activity we wish to criminalise and activity that we might
regard as morally reprehensible but which I have some doubts as to
whether we would wish to make criminal. That comes to light
particularly when we consider abuse of position. I highlight that now
because it may be advantageous to look at it in terms of the broadest
framework of the Bill before we move on to the specifics. To summarise,
we are completely satisfied with clause 1 and with the broad thrust of
the Bill, which merits
support.</div><a name="06062050000042"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000288"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> May I echo the closing words of the hon. Member for
Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)? There is common agreement that the Law
Commission has done an extremely good job in issuing its report and
recommendations. Its argument for simplification and rationalisation of
fraud offences is one that is difficult to argue against. As Griew
noted about theft,</div>
<a name="06062050000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
one wanting to construct a rational, efficient law of criminal fraud
would choose to start from the present position. The law...is in a
very untidy and unsatisfactory condition.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 6</div><a name="06062050000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
commonly held view. The conclusions are to be applauded not only
because they provide clarity where there was a lack of it and because
they provide offences that are comprehensive where there was a lack of
comprehensiveness in respect of previous offences, but because there is
a higher likelihood of successful prosecution when a simple test can be
applied. At the moment, there is every opportunity for the defence to
produce technical arguments in favour of acquittal that bear no
relationship to the actual acts that took place. They are essentially
legal arguments rather than arguments about fact. I support clause 1.
It is a sensible
measure.</div><a name="06062050000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about the danger of
having something so broad and encompassing that it covers behaviour
that we may consider occasionally falls short of criminality, which
nevertheless is not to be encouraged. When framing statute and
offences, there is a difficulty whether we make them so comprehensive
to ensure that criminal acts are without doubt caught within that
compass or make them so particular that they fail to do that. There are
arguments on both sides and we must accept that often we must make a
compromise between those two positions and that a lot depends on the
good sense of the prosecuting authorities in respect of what is put
before a court.</div><a name="06062050000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
considering such matters, we must be extremely careful to make sure
that we are not putting in the hands of prosecuting authorities an
overbearing offence that can be applied improperly to those who are, in
the judgment of most people, acting in a way that is worthy of
opprobrium, but not criminal sanction. However, we shall be debating
that matter later in the Bill. I welcome clause 1 and feel no need to
amend it or argue against
it.</div><a name="06062050000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000289"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to both hon. Gentlemen
for the way in which they set out their views. We can clearly deal with
the abuse of position when we discuss the amendments. The Government
considered some of the points raised, particularly whether there should
be a broader offence in respect of fraud but, although a general
offence should be created, there would be obvious risks in making it so
broad that it would be imprecise and unclear about what would be
covered by
it.</div><a name="06062050000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government took the view that the Law Commission&#146;s
recommendation that there should be a general offence, with its
specific limits categorised in the subsequent clauses that we shall
come to, was the best way forward, and that we had therefore got the
balance right. I am grateful to both main Opposition parties for saying
that they, too, feel that the Law Commission and the Government have
got that balance
right.</div><a name="06062050000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000290"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The clause makes it an offence to
commit fraud by false representation. The offence was recommended by
the Law Commission and widely welcomed in responses to the
Government&#146;s consultation paper. A representation is defined as
false if it is &#147;untrue or misleading&#148;, and if</div>
<a name="06062050000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the person making it knows that
it is, or might be, untrue or
misleading.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The types of
representation covered by the clause may be of fact or law, including a
representation as to a person&#146;s state of mind. They can be
stated in written or spoken words, or in non-verbal
communication.</div> <a name="06062050000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
2 goes wider than the existing Theft Act 1968 offences, which rely on
the deception of a victim. Under clause 2, it will be immaterial
whether the person subject to the false representation believes it to
be true. The fact that the representation was made will be sufficient
evidence to prove the
crime.</div><a name="06062050000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000291"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I do not wish to repeat what I said earlier, and
clauses 1 and 2 have a clear linkage. The major change in the law that
the clause brings about is that it will no longer be necessary to show
that the dishonest representation acted upon the mind of another
person. There will therefore be a great simplification in the
presentation of cases.</div>
<a name="06062050000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I highlighted in my earlier
example, there will be a grey area in such cases because of the extent
to which there is sometimes collusion between the person being
&#147;deceived&#148; and the person doing the deceiving. The matter
is not always as clear cut as one might think. Certainly, from my
experience of criminal practice, the turning of a blind eye to a
deception that may be of mutual advantage occurs quite frequently in
the fraudster&#146;s canon. Prosecutors and judges will have to
exercise a measure of discretion in such cases, particularly when it
comes to sentencing, and that may prove quite complex. That having been
said, I think it right, as a basic principle, that Parliament should
insist that individuals do not make dishonest representations for the
purpose of obtaining gain for themselves. I do not see anything wrong
with the philosophical principle behind clause 2. For that reason, it
commands my
support.</div><a name="06062050000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000292"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I would take a similar view. I just want to make a
couple of observations about the framing of the clause, for reference
when we discuss later clauses. First, there is a clear mens rea in this
clause, which I think is right. Secondly, the term is</div>
<a name="06062050000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dishonestly makes a false
representation&#148;,</div>
<a name="06062050000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">not &#147;makes a
dishonest representation.&#148; That is an important distinction.
There are two factors in play: first, there is the issue of whether the
representation is false; secondly, making that false representation is
a dishonest act in itself, and there is the issue of whether the person
is aware that they are dishonestly making a false representation. That
has relevance to debates that we will have on later clauses, but it
would be wrong of me to explore that area further at this stage. I
simply point out, for the benefit of the Committee, that that is the
case.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000293"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful for the way in which
Opposition Members have raised their views on the clause, and for the
general support for it. I have one point to make to the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath): the current definition of dishonesty
was established, as the explanatory notes say, in the case of Ghosh in
1982. The judgment sets out a two-stage test. To respond to the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about dishonesty, the first question is
whether the defendant&#146;s behaviour would be regarded as dishonest
by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people. If the
answer is positive, the second question is whether the defendant was
aware that his conduct was dishonest and would be regarded as dishonest
by reasonable and honest people. That is the approach to dishonesty
that we want to see the Bill
take.</div><a name="06062050000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000294"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Clause 3 will make it an offence to
commit fraud by failing to disclose information. The Law
Commission&#146;s initial consultation paper proposed that mere
non-disclosure of information should not suffice for an offence of
deception. However, during its consultations, a substantial minority of
respondents argued that from the victim&#146;s point of view, a
failure to reveal material facts can be just as devastating and
tantamount to deception by conduct.</div>
<a name="06062050000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Commission, in revising
its proposals and moving away from the overriding concept of deception,
concluded that the ordinary concept of fraud is wide enough to embrace
at least some dishonest non-disclosure. It noted that it is arguable
though by no means clear that that is the effect of existing law, at
least where there is a legal duty to disclose. In its final report, it
therefore recommended creating such an offence, and the Government
sought views on that in their 2004 consultation
paper.</div><a name="06062050000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Reactions
to the paper showed that a majority welcomed this second limb of the
general offence. The only point of controversy was the issue of going
beyond legal duties. A suggestion was made in consultation that failure
to disclose information could amount in some cases to a false
representation and that such cases were therefore already covered
implicitly by the first limb. However, it was also recognised that it
might be helpful, particularly for juries, if the point were made clear
in law. The Government agreed with that
view.</div><a name="06062050000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
also considered the argument that if the offence is restricted to
situations where there is already a legal duty to provide information,
it will add little to existing law, as failure to meet the legal
obligation will carry its own sanctions. We do not agree. Even though
the offence will be limited in that way, it will add to the law, as the
existing sanctions for such failures might be of a civil nature,
difficult to pursue and unlikely to lead to sufficient sanctions. The
clause clearly sets out our position.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column8" />Column number: 9</div><a name="06062050000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There will be
difficulties relating to how failure to disclose information arises,
and it must be for the prosecutors, the courts and in due course the
jury to determine whether the person who failed to disclose the
information did so with the intention to act dishonestly. Clause 3
clearly sets out the terms, and I hope that we will have general
agreement on it as
well.</div><a name="06062050000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000295"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I think that the Solicitor-General will get
agreement on the clause, although it and clause 4 are closely linked,
so we need to consider both to understand what they will
achieve.</div>
<a name="06062050000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as the
element of offence in clause 3 is concerned, the key issue is what it
places a legal duty on individuals to disclose. It might be helpful if
the Solicitor-General gave the Committee some examples of individuals
under a legal duty to make a disclosure. If I have understood correctly
what the Government are seeking to achieve, the clause will place a
considerable restriction on who will be caught by the
provisions.</div> <a name="06062050000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
there are numerous instances in which individuals might elect not to
tell somebody something because they think that it is to their
financial advantage. The classic example is the person being offered an
object for sale at &#163;50 who knows very well from his greater
expertise that the item is worth &#163;50,000 and chooses not to tell
the vendor. He is under no legal duty to give him that information and,
therefore, he would not be caught by the provisions of clause
3.</div><a name="06062050000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
circumstances seem to encapsulate what clause 3 is trying to do. I am
broadly supportive of that, but we need to be clear. What might be
helpful during the course of the debate is if the Solicitor-General
confirmed whether my understanding of clause 3 is correct and amplified
examples of what he regards as a legal duty. I take a legal duty to be
a duty prescribed by law&#151;no more and no less&#151;and not a
duty prescribed by morality. Perhaps a more interesting and difficult
area is whether that covers duties that could be thought to be
equitably placed upon his shoulders. Having a certain amount of
clarification would be helpful before we rush in headlong
and&#151;which I would want to do&#151;approve clause
3.</div><a name="06062050000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000296"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I look forward to the explanations, which will be
extremely helpful. My brief comment is in similar form to my comment on
the previous clause. I simply point out that clause 3(a) says that
he</div><a name="06062050000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;dishonestly fails to
disclose to another person the information which he is under a legal
duty to disclose&#148;</div><a name="06062050000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">and not
information that he is expected to disclose. That has relevance when we
come to consider the next
clause.</div><a name="06062050000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000297"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentlemen for
the way in which they set out their views on the clause. Probably the
best place to start is with the concept of legal duty, as explained in
the Law Commission report on fraud, in paragraphs 7.28 and
7.29.</div><a name="06062050000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking
at the duty, with such duties there is an overlap between clauses 3 and
4. There is also a view that a legal duty can arise in a number of
ways, primarily by operation of law, but not necessarily prescribed by
law in the sense that a duty can arise by the nature of a relationship
that has been formed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 10</div><a name="06062050000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will come
back to the Law Commission report in a moment, but let me make that
clear. When people are engaged in commercial relationships, there is
the principle of caveat emptor, which has been restricted by various
pieces of legislation over the years by Parliament. Let the buyer
beware. That will still be the case. When people engage in normal
commercial relationships, the buyer will need to be beware, to be aware
of what the person who is selling the product
says.</div><a name="06062050000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause will do for situations where a legal duty has been created prior
to or during the course of a relationship between the alleged victim
and the defendant. There is therefore a duty on the defendant to
disclose to the potential victim various information. An example would
be where a solicitor fails to tell a client relevant information about
the law or case that would result in the solicitor gaining financial
benefit personally and the client losing. There is a clear relationship
between the solicitor and the client. There is a duty to disclose that
information. He has failed to disclose that information. He has done so
knowing that he has the duty and, therefore, he has acted dishonestly.
The result of that should be that he has failed to disclose information
and therefore committed an act of
fraud.</div><a name="06062050000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
question might arise in a more difficult case, when a person is
applying for insurance and has a heart condition, which they failed to
disclose. That is a civil matter; to some extent, it involves a breach
of an uberrima fides duty to disclose information in particular types
of contract. Obviously, insurance companies may well take the view that
they would deal with that through the civil procedures and that would
be the normal way. However it is possible for someone who was
deliberately intending to obtain insurance coverage and, in due course,
to make a claim on it to be in a position where they were failing to
disclose relevant information where they had a legal duty to do so,
with the intention of benefiting, either by insurance coverage or by
undertaking a medical procedure using that insurance. The result might
be that they are in breach of the
clause.</div>
<a name="06062050000257"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06062050000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are a
couple of examples of examples of where there is a clear duty and where
failure to disclose information may well put someone in breach of the
clause. I hope that those comments deal with hon. Members&#146;
concerns and that the Committee will allow the clause to stand part of
the Bill.</div> <a name="06062050000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000300"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> As I indicated to the Solicitor-General earlier,
the clause has caused me and, I suspect, some of my hon. Friends and
others in the House, a little more trouble than previous clauses. I
should make it clear to the hon. and learned Gentleman that the problem
does not lie in the principle behind the clause: it is generally agreed
that if a person is in a position of trust he owes a duty to the person
who has entrusted his or her affairs to him not to abuse that position.
That includes not abusing the position</div>
<a name="06062050000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to make a gain for himself or
another, or...to cause loss to another or to expose another to a
risk of loss.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
well established principle. Barristers, solicitors, accountants know
well the underlying principles behind it, and if people have been
abused, civil remedies lie against those who have abused their position
in that way. Translating that into the criminal law is, on the face of
it, perfectly reasonable.</div>
<a name="06062050000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The greater problem comes in
defining who is in a position in which he
is</div><a name="06062050000235"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expected to
safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another
person&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who
are we talking about? Historically, we have, I think, been talking
about people who, in the old-fashioned parlance&#151;that is the
nature of the amendment that I tabled&#151;are &#147;under a
fiduciary duty&#148; to another person to act in their best
interests. The Government have chosen&#151;the Solicitor-General made
that clear on Second Reading&#151;quite deliberately to move away
from that description to one that, on the face of it, is much looser.
Such a person is defined as one who</div>
<a name="06062050000236"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;occupies a position in which he
is expected to safeguard, or not to act against, the financial
interests of another
person&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Who is to make
the judgment on who occupies a position in which they are</div>
<a name="06062050000237"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;expected to safeguard, or not to
act against, the financial interests of another
person&#148;?</div> <a name="06062050000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
law should, as far as is possible, contain a degree of certainty. The
way in which clause 4 is worded gives me cause for concern, because it
is by no means clear to me who is the person referred to in clause
4(1)(a). If it is an accountant or a solicitor, it presents no problem.
I suppose that if we were to move and say somebody who has been
entrusted with the affairs of a near relative by a power of attorney or
a continuing power of attorney, we would not think there was any
difficulty, either. But what happens in those myriad informal
relationships that arise and on which human relations depend? Where is
the dividing line to be drawn in respect of a person occupying a
position in which he is expected to safeguard another&#146;s
interests?</div> <a name="06062050000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
no list. It is not as if Parliament is being asked to be prescriptive.
There is an underlying suggestion that the definition will be left to
develop on a case-by-case basis and will gradually be evolved over time
by the courts and, presumably, by juries in their verdicts and by
judges on submissions. I am slightly anxious about that. It ought to be
possible for us to define things more
tightly.</div><a name="06062050000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
would insert the notion of fiduciary duty, which is well understood,
but I should like to make it clear to the Solicitor-General that it is
in the nature a probing amendment to provoke debate. I appreciate that
there may be other ways to approach the
matter.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000302"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> That is true, although I should have thought that
a judge would be capable of explaining to a jury what a fiduciary duty
is. In the course of a criminal trial, if a fiduciary duty appears in
the relevant statute, the judge ought to be in a position to explain
that to the jury. Furthermore, a judge would also be in a position to
rule, on a submission of no case to answer, whether the prosecution had
laid the basis of whether a fiduciary duty
existed.</div><a name="06062050000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty of the present wording of the clause is that, other than
leaving the matter to a judge on a ruling of no case to answer, the
case is pretty much open to the jury. The old saying, when I was first
at the Bar, was that perhaps we should get rid of all forms of criminal
code and simply present facts to a jury, which would be allowed to say
on its verdict &#147;in order&#148;, &#147;out of order&#148;
or &#147;totally out of order.&#148; There is a sense that that is
what we are doing with the clause: a set of facts is put to a jury and
it is asked, &#147;Is it in order, out of order or totally out of
order,&#148; and on that depends guilt or innocence. That worries
me.</div><a name="06062050000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said earlier to the Solicitor-General, hopefully the criminal code is
in accordance with moral principles. However, many people are allowed
to behave in an immoral fashion and still not face criminal sanction.
The wording of the clause leaves a grey area. Let me give an example,
which has just come into my head, of the sorts of problems that might
arise.</div><a name="06062050000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Earlier, I
mentioned buying and selling. A person is helping his aged aunt with
her affairs, in the course of which she gives him access to all her
private papers. From those, he discovers that a bust sold out of the
family 20 years before in a house sale was made by Bernini. Nobody knew
about that at the time, but it is clear in the family papers to which
he has been given a degree of access by his aunt. That bust is now for
sale in the antique shop down the road, so he zooms down there; nobody
knows that it is a Bernini bust and he buys it at a vastly discounted
rate&#151;it is the bargain of a lifetime. He does not tell his aunt;
he just takes it home and puts it in his house.</div>
<a name="06062050000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Did that
person abuse his position? After all, his aunt allowed him access to
her papers. He took advantage of the information that he gleaned from
those papers and made use of it for his own benefit. Hon. Members must
understand that the aunt was not ga-ga; she just asked him to help her.
To what extent would he be caught by clause 4? One might consider what
he did to be morally reprehensible, but was it a crime?</div>
<a name="06062050000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have picked
one example; we could pick dozens of others. Mine illustrates my slight
anxiety that we might be casting our net too wide on the waters, the
consequence of which is to create uncertainty. Of course, Parliament
might wish to modify the behaviour of human beings, which is not
necessarily an undesirable objective, but we must be careful about
making sure that the scope of the criminal law in such an area is
properly restricted. Otherwise, as always happens, we encounter the law
of unintended consequences.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 13</div><a name="06062050000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given an illustration,
and I hope that the Solicitor-General will discuss the issues that it
raises so that the matter can be explored further. It is one thing for
somebody to be entrusted formally with something, but are we really
going to say that taking advantage of information gleaned in the course
of a relationship of friendship, without any formalised trust being
involved, is a criminal act and that we wish it to fall within the
scope of clause 4? That is the difficult dividing line about which we
must think.</div> <a name="06062050000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
emphasise to the Solicitor-General that I have not reached a conclusion
on the subject; I am feeling my way. I suspect that the Bill, having
gone through the other place, will probably go on to the statute book
in its present form. However, I hope that we can reflect on the serious
and difficult issues that I have raised through my amendment before we
simply rubber-stamp clause
4.</div><a name="06062050000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000303"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I support amendment No. 2, but I shall speak to
amendment No. 7, which is on similar
lines.</div><a name="06062050000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I concur with
the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve). I do not think that, in
its present form, the clause is likely to cause a massive injustice,
but I have a nagging feeling that it is sufficiently loosely worded to
allow for ambiguity. I draw attention again to the fact that the
wording in clause 3 is precise. It mentions</div>
<a name="06062050000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;a legal duty to
disclose&#148;,</div> <a name="06062050000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">whereas
clause 4 uses less precise language, referring
to</div><a name="06062050000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;a position in which
he is expected to
safeguard&#148;</div><a name="06062050000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">another&#146;s
interests. That opens up questions, which I expressed on Second
Reading, about who is doing the expecting. Is it to be the judge, the
jury or the person who has a form of relationship with the person
indicted? Is the view of the man on the Clapham omnibus to be taken on
what constitutes a reasonable expectation?</div>
<a name="06062050000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we intervened on the
Solicitor-General on Second Reading, he was anxious to put our minds at
rest, but he came close to saying that the phrase &#147;is expected
to safeguard&#148; comes close to &#147;what he is under a
fiduciary duty to do&#148;. I do not think I am putting words in the
Solicitor-General&#146;s mouth by saying that, in his view, there was
little difference between an expectation and what formed a duty. He was
also at pains to say that, at the end of the day, the courts must
decide the matter and that the prosecution has the responsibility of
establishing that relationship and that expectation&#151;or, as I
prefer it, that duty.</div>
<a name="06062050000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I still do not understand what
advantage there is in framing the offence as the Solicitor-General has
in the Bill. What circumstances that do not fall within
&#147;duty&#148;, but do fall within &#147;expectation&#148;
does he expect to catch? I have read carefully at what the
Solicitor-General said, which is why I framed my amendment in a perhaps
more lax way than it would have been framed had I used the precise term
&#147;fiduciary duty&#148;. On Second Reading, the
Solicitor-General
said</div><a name="06062050000238"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Of
course, the duty may well go beyond a mere fiduciary one; other duties
could be encompassed. We can deal with such detail in
Committee.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 12 June 2006; Vol.
447, c. 537.]</div><a name="06062050000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Well, here we are

am</div><a name="06062050000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I really
need from the Solicitor-General is some illustrations what duties might
be encompassed. Because I have an expectation and he has a duty to
provide such illustrations to the Committee, that is why I have used
the phrase &#147;has a duty&#148; in my amendment, so that it could
encompass other duties that the Solicitor-General brings forward for
our consideration.
</div><a name="06062050000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000304"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I understood that that was what the hon. Gentleman
was trying to achieve in proposing the mere word &#147;duty&#148;.
Of course, the problem with the mere word &#147;duty&#148; is that,
unless the sort of duties one is talking about are defined, it is
capable of being as loose as an &#147;expectation&#148;, because
what one person regards as a duty another person might not. We shall
still have the same problem unless we produce a comprehensive list of
expectations or duties.</div>
<a name="06062050000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000305"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> That is probably true. My expectation is that the
Solicitor-General will perform his duty in giving us that list in
Committee so that the courts have something to work on. That is a firm
expectation and one that I expect to see met in a few
moments.</div> <a name="06062050000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support
the purpose of the clause. I do not want it not to work. There must be
a reason behind using that loose and ambiguous term without stating a
clear view on in whose mind the expectation has formed that there is
some requirement for one individual to safeguard another&#146;s
financial interests. If it cannot reasonably be argued that the person
who is accused of fraud under the clause should be aware of that
expectation, it seems that we have a slightly dangerous instrument
before us. If there is a legal duty, a fiduciary duty, it is reasonable
to assume that the person should know that they are in that
relationship and they should be aware of that in legal terms. However,
the present wording of the clause falls short of that. There are
circumstances in which a jury, judge or court might form the view that
there was an expectation but there is no reason to suppose that the
person who committed the act was, or could be, aware of that
expectation because they had not entered into any form of contractual
or professional relationship that implied that expectation. That is my
concern and that is what I hope that the Minister will be able to
satisfy us on when he replies to the
debate.</div>
<a name="06062050000113"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062050000306"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Geoffrey Cox</b> (Torridge and West Devon) (Con): I should
declare an interest in that I have been a practising lawyer,
particularly in the field of fraud, for well over 20 years. I appeared
in the case of Regina <i class="I">v.</i> Preddy, to which I believe the Minister
referred, in which some of the shortcomings of the Theft Act were
illuminated by the House of Lords in 1996. I also appeared recently in
a case of some notoriety that collapsed after two years called the
Jubilee line extension fraud. I therefore have some considerable
experience in the field of the practice of fraud in the criminal
courts.</div> <a name="06062050000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have to say
that although I usually appear on the defence side I often wonder,
sometimes aloud and sometimes silently, at the difficulties&#151;the
mire&#151;into which prosecutions appear to get themselves when they
are confronted with prosecuting major frauds. I have no doubt that the
offence in the clause will make it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 15</div>easier for the prosecution to bring their case and to explain it to a
jury, which is why I broadly support it. However, I believe that
particularity and precision are vital components of the criminal law
and that when the ambit of the criminal offence is broadened and
relaxed, one runs into a fundamental problem whereby, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Beaconsfield said, forms of conduct are criminalised
which, on reflection, no responsible legislature would wish to
criminalise. Clause 4 crystallises that
concern.</div><a name="06062050000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
invite Government Members to consider the position of employees, which
may be of substantial concern to them. There is no doubt that, whatever
the nature of the employment, an employee is bound by implied, if not
expressed, terms of the contract, to a duty of confidentiality. There
are certain necessary responsibilities that go with any contract of
employment, whether one works in the humblest capacity in the mailroom
or at directorial level. On closer examination, it becomes apparent
that the clause may become a stick with which to beat employees whom
the employers regard as having breached their terms of confidentiality
or otherwise breached their expectations.</div>
<a name="06062050000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give one example. The
employee who, in the hope of a job with a rival firm or company,
decides in the pub to let a rival window cleaning firm know that his
firm is seeking to extend its business in another part of the
geographical area in which they live. On the face of it, that situation
would be covered by the offence in the clause&#151;it would be fraud.
There would be an expectation on the part of the employer that the
employee would not disclose even relatively dilute and unimportant
detail of the future plans of his employer.
</div><a name="06062050000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The employee would
have acted in the hope that perhaps one day&#151;particularly if he
anticipated that in the shake-up of the company&#146;s organisation,
he might be made redundant&#151;he might gain a job with the rival
employer at some future date. However, I respectfully submit that it
would be hard to contend that that employee ought to be found guilty of
the crime of fraud set out in clauses 1 and 4, even though he occupied
a position in which he was expected by his employer not to act against
the financial interests of another person&#151;his
employer.</div>
<a name="06062050000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">If an
employee disclosed details, even fairly minor and minimal details such
as, &#147;I know that a window-cleaning firm is going to expand in
Bideford,&#148; that disclosure could be interpreted by a jury as
being contrary to the financial interests of the employer. However, the
provision would expose thousands of employees the length and breadth of
this country to the risk of a complaint of fraud being made to the
police by their employers, and given that the offence is so broadly
defined, the employees would potentially face conviction.</div>
<a name="06062050000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06062050000307"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Greg Hands</b> (Hammersmith and Fulham) (Con): Does my hon.
Friend agree that that may become a particular problem in the City of
London where such discussions happen all the time between employees,
current employers and future employers? Might not the measure imperil
London&#146;s position as the No. 1 financial centre in
Europe?</div><a name="06062050000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000308"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> I did not want to draw in such vulgar realms as the
City of London. I wanted to bring it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column15" />Column number: 16</div>down to the level of the ordinary person&#146;s experience. I am
genuinely concerned about this clause. There is a real problem with it.
What on earth does &#147;occupies a position&#148; mean? The
Minister says that the clause and the Bill in general are designed to
remove from defence advocates the rich harvest of opportunity to argue
over the terms and definitions of criminal offences, but I have to tell
him that I can see a very broad realm for my colleagues at the Bar to
explore. They may ask questions such as: what is &#147;a
position&#148;? It seems to have some kind of formal connotation.
Does it mean a position of employment, a position of trust, or simply a
type of position in some informal relationship, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Beaconsfield
said?</div><a name="06062050000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
refers to a person being &#147;expected to safeguard&#148;, but
expected by whom? By the employer, in the case that I just suggested?
The clause continues:</div>
<a name="06062050000239"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or not to act against, the
financial interests&#148;.</div>
<a name="06062050000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does that mean the
immediate financial interests, or would it be a defence to say,
&#147;Well, it may not have been in his short-term financial
interests, but in the long term, what I did was definitely in the
interests of my employer, for the following reasons&#148;? We will
have endless debates in the courts of law on whether something was in
the financial interests of the person who is said to be the victim,
because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr.
Hands) pointed out, we are not always looking at auntie and nephew; we
are often looking at vast multinational organisations, where it is not
easy to judge whether a particular act by a director or employee may
have jeopardised those financial interests. The argument may well be
advanced: &#147;I did it in the best interests of the firm.&#148;
Thus the court will become bogged down in examining the economic status
of the entire company or economic enterprise concerned when trying to
decide whether an action was in its financial interests.</div>
<a name="06062050000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
may regard my argument with a degree of scepticism, but let me assure
hon. Members that that is precisely what will happen. It is precisely
what happened in the Jubilee line case to which I referred. The charge
in that case was conspiracy to defraud, but it was at the ultimate
frontier of what had in the past been considered conspiracy to defraud.
The passing of very low-level commercial intelligence&#151;similar to
the information that I mentioned on whether a window cleaning firm
should extend its activities into the town of Bideford&#151;was
regarded as a conspiracy to defraud. The question was bound to arise
whether it could be proven that passing that intelligence had a
damaging effect on London Underground&#146;s financial
interests.</div><a name="06062050000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I submit
that that is a question that the Committee ought to consider with
extreme care. Any precision that we can bring to the clause,
particularly along the lines suggested in the amendment proposed by my
hon. Friends, would have something to commend it. The amendment would
insert &#147;a fiduciary duty&#148;, rather than leaving the
offence to rely on an expectation. We would like more precision. Let me
explain the reasons why. To go back to my employment law example, not
every employee is in a fiduciary relationship with his employer. A
fiduciary relationship is a precise legal term; the law defines it
well, and it applies in a range of relationships. The law understands
it, and it is not difficult to interpret to a jury. Inserting that
phrase 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 17</div>would remove the great mass of employees from the
risk of prosecution for what the employer regards as an abuse of the
employee&#146;s
position.</div><a name="06062050000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I urge the
Committee to consider extremely carefully whether the amendment should
be made. It would further define the offence and make it more precise.
It would assist, because there would be no question of the ordinary
employee being caught by the offence, whereas under the current
drafting there is a real risk that we will get bogged down. I assure
the Minister, although I am sure that he does not need assuring, of the
ingenuity of defence advocates, who will find much to be pleased by in
the Bill. However, by the insertion of the phrase proposed by my hon.
Friends, some greater precision could be brought and some of those
arguments will be
avoided.</div>

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): Mr. Amess,
may I also welcome you to the Chair this morning? It is a delight to
follow my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox),
although I suspect a disadvantage, but I will do my best. I want to
make a couple of points about the clause and to support amendment No.
2.</div> <a name="06062050000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
there are two difficulties with the use of the phrase &#147;expected
to&#148; in relation to the position that the clause describes. We
must be clear&#151;other hon. Members have already made reference to
it&#151;who has the expectation and how realistic that should
be.</div> <a name="06062050000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not every
expectation is realistic or reasonable. As Members of Parliament, we
know that. The Solicitor-General, as a Minister, knows that. The public
sometimes have expectations of their Government, which he may regard as
unrealistic or unreasonable. If that word is to be used, we must be
clear about how realistic or reasonable any expectation should
be.</div><a name="06062050000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is another
difficulty. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) indicated that the
advantage of language such as &#147;expected to&#148; is that the
public will readily understand it, whereas &#147;a fiduciary
duty&#148; is something that must be interpreted by lawyers. We must
look at paragraph 7.38 of the Law Commission&#146;s report, which is
reported in paragraph 20 of the explanatory notes. I accept,
incidentally, that the Law Commission says that it does not believe
that fiduciary duties should be the limitation of the clause. However,
it goes on to
say:</div><a name="06062050000240"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This does
not of course mean that it would be entirely a matter for the
fact-finders whether the necessary relationship exists. The question
whether the particular facts alleged can properly be described as
giving rise to that relationship will be an issue capable of being
ruled upon by the judge and, if the case goes to the jury, of being the
subject of
directions.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems clear that, in the Law Commission&#146;s view, lawyers would
have to be involved in the definition of &#147;expected to&#148; in
respect of the relationship that it describes. If that is so, the
legislation does not provide the clarity for which the hon. Member for
Wrexham is looking. It ought to be this Committee&#146;s task to give
as much clarity to the law as we can at this stage and to save the
courts the job of doing so at a later date.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000310"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was much taken with the question
posed by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, as to whether a
Minister is in a fiduciary relationship in dealing with questions in
Committee. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 18</div>is debatable, in that my duty is to the Crown as a Minister and
secondarily, probably, to Parliament as a whole. Am I in a fiduciary
relationship with the hon. Gentleman? Those questions are perhaps
academic.</div>
<a name="06062050000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important that we are clear about what the law says. The law has to
cope with a vast array of different circumstances which arise from time
to time. The danger that we have seen with the 1968 and 1978 Acts is
precisely the problem that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon
appeared to be anxious to repeat here. He said that particularity is
vital. However, the Law Commission defines the problem with the law on
deception as over-particularisation of the definitions that are
imposed. The world has moved on&#151;there have been technological
developments and changes in the way in which our society behaves. The
legislation was not able to cope with that because it was
over-particular. We need to avoid that. Those amendments aim to reduce
the scope of clause 4. They would go against the recommendations of the
Law Commission, which have already been mentioned by the hon. Member
for Rugby and Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright).</div>
<a name="06062050000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000311"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="06062050000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000312"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me make the point and then I will
give way to the hon. Gentleman. Let us look at the whole paragraph. The
hon. Gentleman quite fairly looked at the final part of that paragraph.
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome asked, &#147;So who is he and
where does the relationship arise?&#148; The hon. Member for
Beaconsfield asked &#147;Is it all in order?&#148; It is more than
that. It is also more than a mere fiduciary
relationship.</div><a name="06062050000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Commission
states:</div><a name="06062050000241"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
necessary relationship will be present between trustee and beneficiary,
director and company, professional person and client, agent and
principal, employee and employer, or between partners. It may arise
otherwise, for example within a family, or in the context of voluntary
work, or in any context where the parties are not at arm&#146;s
length. In nearly all cases where it arises, it will be recognised by
the civil law as importing fiduciary duties, and any relationship that
is so recognised will suffice. We see no reason, however, why the
existence of such duties should be essential. This does not of course
mean that it would be entirely a matter for the fact-finders whether
the necessary relationship exists. The question whether the particular
facts alleged can properly be described as giving rise to that
relationship will be an issue capable of being ruled upon by the judge
and, if the case goes to the jury, of being the subject of
directions.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Conservative amendment seeks to provide that clause 4 will apply only
if a person has a fiduciary relationship to safeguard the interests of
another. The Liberal Democrat amendment refers only to a duty. By that
I assume that it means some kind of legal duty, which may or may not go
wider than a fiduciary duty. I assume from how the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome put it that he was referring merely to a fiduciary
duty.</div><a name="06062050000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
that the criticism made of the Government&#151;that the measures will
lead to legal wrangling&#151;is the very issue that might arise if
the amendments were accepted. Lawyers would have the opportunity for a
lot of discussion about precisely where a fiduciary relationship
arises. We should remind ourselves&#151;</div>

way?</div><a name="06062050000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000314"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Let me first quote Lord Justice Millet,
because what he said about fiduciary relationships is
important:</div> <a name="06062050000242"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;He
is not subject to fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it
is because he is subject to them that he is a
fiduciary.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The duties
create the nature of the relationship; the relationship is not of
itself the cause of the fiduciary
duties.</div><a name="06062050000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000315"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Will the Solicitor-General give
way?</div><a name="06062050000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000316"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I shall give way to the hon. Member for
Torridge and West Devon first and then to the hon. Gentleman, but I
want to develop my
argument.</div><a name="06062050000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000317"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> Will the Solicitor-General incorporate into the
development of his argument his understanding that the concept of
fiduciary duty is flexible in law? The categories of fiduciary duty are
not closed. At its heart is the concept of trust. The law will extend
fiduciary duties where it recognises the hallmarks and characteristics
of a relationship based fundamentally on trust, specifically trust
relating to the management of property and
finance.</div><a name="06062050000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would give greater soundness and solidity to the question of what
relationship the accused party should have, and would exclude&#151;I
ask the Solicitor-General to incorporate this question into his
argument&#151;employees who would otherwise be faced with exposure to
abuse. The concept is flexible. I am sure that he understands
that.</div><a name="06062050000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000318"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The concept of a fiduciary was set out
in 1996 by Lord Justice Millet in the Court of Appeal, in Bristol West
building society <i class="I">v. </i>Mothew. He
said:</div><a name="06062050000243"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for or on behalf of
another in a particular matter in circumstances that give rise to a
relationship of trust and confidence. The distinguishing obligation of
a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty. The principal is entitled to
the single-minded
loyalty&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06062050000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
phrase is
important&#151;</div><a name="06062050000244"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;of his
fiduciary. This core liability has several facets. A fiduciary must act
in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not
put himself in a position where his duty and interest may conflict; he
may not act for his own benefit or that of third person without the
informed consent of his
principal&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
goes on to make the point that I referred to earlier:</div>
<a name="06062050000245"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;He is not subject to
fiduciary obligations because he is a fiduciary; it is because he is
subject to them that he is a
fiduciary.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
obligations may not be present in a range of informal personal
relationships and it would be difficult for the prosecution to prove
the existence of fiduciary relationships in certain informal
circumstances, even though it would be clear to the man on the Clapham
omnibus or the man in the street&#151;however the hon. Gentleman
wants to describe it&#151;that one person occupied a position in
which he was expected to safeguard the interests of another. We do not
want to get ourselves into a situation where a complex legal argument
about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 20</div>the nature of a fiduciary relationship and whether it exists is the
subject of the case, rather than the court and jury looking at the
relationship as a whole and taking a view as to whether those
circumstances produced a relationship where there is a legitimate and
proper expectation that there was a duty owed and someone was expected
to safeguard or not to act against the financial interests of another
person, and that position was dishonestly
abused.</div><a name="06062050000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will take
interventions from the hon. Members for Rugby and Kenilworth and for
Beaconsfield, but I still have to develop the argument and it might be
easier if they waited until then before they intervened. However, I
will happily give
way.</div><a name="06062050000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000319"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I shall try not to intervene too much, but we are
having a good dialogue. What I found rather odd was that the
Solicitor-General developed the argument about fiduciary duties and
read out Lord Justice Millet&#146;s judgment, but in fact that
precisely encapsulated the sort of behaviour and person we wanted to
cover. The hon. and learned Gentleman emphasised that fiduciary
relationships are not fixed and that the category can be expanded, but
that again provides me with greater reassurance that that is the
correct
definition.</div><a name="06062050000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that once we start moving into such informal relationships
we get into an area where things become indefinable. I gave an example
earlier. I would be interested how the Solicitor-General would respond
to the young man who takes advantage of his aunt&#146;s benevolence
but does not owe or is not specifically being asked to safeguard her
financial affairs, even though he takes advantage of the trust she
places in him to get a financial advantage for himself. Is that
intended to be covered by the
legislation?</div><a name="06062050000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000320"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman only
to some extent. In my view, a fiduciary relationship includes those
relationships that we wish to see part of the clause, but does not
encapsulate&#151;to use his word&#151;the whole of the nature of
those relationships. I will come to the auntie and employees in a
moment, if I
can.</div><a name="06062050000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000321"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I rise to reinforce the point of my hon. Friend
the Member for Beaconsfield. From the Solicitor-General reading out
that definition, it already seems clear that the inherent advantage of
the amendment is that we can clearly define a fiduciary duty. As far as
I am aware, there is no comparable definition of a person who is
expected to safeguard the interests of
another.</div><a name="06062050000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000322"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> If the hon. Gentlemen had waited, they
would have seen how the argument has developed and why it has developed
as a result of the consultation. It would be difficult in some
circumstances for prosecutors to argue that a particular relationship,
which members of the public may well see as a relationship where
someone is expected to safeguard the interests of another, was
necessarily a fiduciary relationship. While in most cases the measure
would apply to circumstances where a duty clearly exists, there would
be some cases where a formal legal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 21</div>duty may not exist. Those cases will arise particularly in personal and
family relationships. The great majority of those who responded to the
consultations in 2004 supported clause 4 and some made comments that
were pertinent to the debate. For example, in welcoming clause 4, the
Institute of Legacy Management referred to the need to tackle the
financial abuse of the elderly, an issue that was increasingly causing
it concern. It said
that</div><a name="06062050000246"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;charities have
noticed an alarming rise in estates where the testator&#146;s funds
had been misappropriated prior to
death&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">It cited the case
of a tradesman who, having helped an old lady with odd jobs, gained
increasing influence over her and misappropriated funds from her
account.</div><a name="06062050000260"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06062050000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The North of
England trading standards group also said that, in most cases when
vulnerable elderly people were deprived of property unlawfully, the
perpetrators were either relatives or workers who were supposed to be
supporting the victims&#146; independent lifestyle. Many elderly
people are looked after by helpers who do not have formal power of
attorney, but take various degrees of responsibility for their
finances. Few abuse their position, but it would not be right that
those who do so should escape prosecution for fraud just because they
have no full legal or fiduciary duty to that elderly person or because
the Crown Prosecution Service has a difficulty proving that fiduciary
duty beyond reasonable
doubt.</div><a name="06062050000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">We see no
problem in a jury determining when one person is in a position to
safeguard the interests of another. Furthermore, in most cases the
crucial issue will not be the relationship between the defendant and
the victim, but whether the defendant&#146;s actions were, in its
sum, dishonest.</div><a name="06062050000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of questions and examples have been put to me. As for the auntie
and the nephew to whom the hon. Member for Beaconsfield referred, that
depends on the nature of the relationship and what has been taken. If,
of course, the nephew had stolen a bust there would be no doubt about
what had happened. However, difficult cases always make for an
interesting analysis. On the face of it, the particular item was no
longer in the aunt&#146;s possession. She had dispensed with it. He
obtained information about its value, so he decided to buy it. If there
were a relationship in which he was supposed to be looking after her
interests in a particular way, that relationship might produce a
expectation, but it does not seem on the face of it that that is likely
to happen if it were merely the case that he happens to come across the
information, purchases the bust and makes some money on it. That is
just a receipt of information that results in his becoming slightly
wealthier. It may be immoral; perhaps he should have shared it, but I
do not think that it would be unlawful unless the relationship was a
more particular relationship than the one that he
described.</div><a name="06062050000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraphs
21 to 23 of the notes on clauses cite several examples involving
employees. One is
about</div><a name="06062050000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an employee who
fails to take up the chance of a crucial contract in order that an
associate or rival company can take it up instead at the expense of the
employer, commits an offence under this
clause.&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 22</div><a name="06062050000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another example concerns an</div>
<a name="06062050000248"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;employee of a software company
who uses his position to clone software products with the intention of
selling the products on would commit an offence under this
clause.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">The notes also
refer to an
example</div><a name="06062050000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;where a person
who is employed to care for an elderly or disabled person has access to
that person&#146;s bank account and abuses his position by removing
funds for his own personal
use.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000323"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> It is impossible to understand why that last
example, from paragraph 23, was included, because the person would
simply have committed theft. That highlights my anxiety that this will
turn into the catch-all provision to get round the need to charge other
perfectly clear offences. It is not needed in the context that is
claimed in the explanatory
notes.</div><a name="06062050000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000324"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It may be theft, but the individual may
also have the right to remove items from the account and only later
take them for his personal use. Whether that were so would depend on
the precise circumstances that might
arise.</div><a name="06062050000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon gave an example of an employee
disclosing commercial information to another potential employer. The
question arises about whether that employee is acting dishonestly. The
prosecution would have to prove that there was a particular
relationship, that the information was the subject of that
relationship, that the employee ought to have known that and that the
employee acted dishonestly to better himself. I was surprised by the
intervention by the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham, who took
the view that that would virtually bring down the whole City and the
clause would bring the financial set-up in the UK crashing down around
us. I do not think that it will do
so.</div><a name="06062050000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause says
that a relationship, which can and in most cases will be fiduciary, may
sometimes&#151;as we have seen from our consultation&#151;go beyond
a fiduciary relationship and may involve a relationship where there is
a legitimate expectation on the part of a potential victim that the
person who has access to their money, or whatever, should not behave in
a way that abuses that position. That may go beyond a fiduciary
relationship. I do not want to end up with the problem of the
over-particularisation of a clause, from which we are trying to extract
ourselves with the
Bill.</div><a name="06062050000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
enables us to deal with the fiduciary problems that hon. Gentlemen have
suggested exist, and it goes beyond that. A number of those who replied
to the consultation indicated that there are issues beyond fiduciary
relationships&#151;so, too, has the Law Commission. In view of the
fact that both the Law Commission and those consultees have put to us
strong points to the effect that a fiduciary relationship is important
but not adequate, we should enable the clause to go beyond that. I hope
that, in view of that explanation, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield
will ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06062050000167"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000325"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> There is another issue that only
occurred to me as I read the clause again. The clause makes it clear
that it applies to a person who occupies a position, not somebody who
occupied a position. Will the Solicitor-General comment on that? As it
is drafted, the clause creates the interesting consequence that it
would apply 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 23</div>to a person who was still in employment as an employee, but if he abused
his position of trust after he had ceased to occupy that position he
would not be caught by it. Is that what the Government
intended?</div><a name="06062050000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000326"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It is an interesting proposition. A
person can occupy a position where they owe a duty that goes beyond the
performance of a job. A contract that is entered into that obliges a
person to have duties of confidentiality, perhaps, can go well beyond
the time when that employment ceases. The duty may, however, still
arise. The person entered into the duty at the beginning of the
employment and it exists indefinitely. Therefore a person may still
occupy a position in which there is a legitimate expectation. That may
well, by virtue of a contract and the agreement that the employee
entered into voluntarily, go beyond redundancy or the point when he
leaves the
post.</div><a name="06062050000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000327"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I found the last point raised by the hon. Member
for Beaconsfield interesting and disturbing because it seems to me that
my amendment would have been better if it had required the omission of
the words </div><a name="06062050000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;occupies a
position in which he is
expected&#148;</div><a name="06062050000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">instead
of merely the words &#147;is expected&#148; so that the clause
would have described someone simply as having a duty to safeguard the
relevant interests. That is something that we may need to explore again
on
Report.</div><a name="06062050000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely respect the Solicitor-General&#146;s argument, but I am a
little alarmed by the paucity of examples of matters that fall outside
the concept of a duty, whether that is narrowly defined, in relation to
the fiduciary duty&#151;we have already had an explanation about
that&#151;or viewed as a wide, expandable and mutable definition and
nevertheless coming within the definition of expectation. This is one
of the rare occasions when I can criticise the Law Commission, because
its report also fails to deal with the matter. It baldly says that
there may be cases and that it will be for the court to determine them
and for the prosecution to demonstrate its case, but it gives no
examples of what those instances might be, and why they would be of
such import as to require a redefinition of what is a stand-alone
offence in the provision. Someone would be required to have done
nothing else besides being subject to the ill-defined expectation and,
in that context, to have acted in the dishonest way
specified.</div><a name="06062050000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am still concerned, although as I said at the beginning I do not think
that if the clause is not amended grave injustices will result.
However, there will be an ambiguity in the law, which will be
susceptible to argument, and could have the reverse effect to the one
intended by the Minister of tightening the legislation. It provides an
alternative legal argument, whereas a crisp and clear definition would
not enable such ambiguity to arise. I am interested in what the hon.
Member for Beaconsfield has to say, but if he intends to press his
amendment I am inclined still to support it. I am not yet persuaded,
despite my best intentions to be so, by what the Solicitor-General has
had to
say.</div><a name="06062050000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000328"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I have listened carefully to the Solicitor-General
and am mindful of the point that he has made, which was restated by the
Law Commission, that fiduciary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 24</div>duties on their own may be too restrictive a definition
because of the nature of informal relationships.
That seems a valid point, which the Committee must consider. If we do
not succeed in considering it properly here, perhaps we need to return
to it on
Report.</div><a name="06062069000081"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="06062069000003"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remain
troubled, however, and the last question that I asked, about what it
means to occupy a position and whether the wording covers
&#147;occupied&#148; as well as &#147;occupies&#148;, seems to
go to the heart of the issue. As the reply came back, I heard my hon.
Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon say sotto voce exactly
what was coming into to my mind: the provision covers every breach of
confidence.</div>
<a name="06062069000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give
an example that goes back to my childhood. In her memoirs, the
Queen&#146;s nanny told some entirely innocuous, but nevertheless
revelatory stories about the time when she looked after the Queen. I
have no doubt that nannies who take their charges out, once those
charges are at toddler age, have a responsibility to safeguard them and
not to act against the financial interests of another person. Apart
from anything else, they should make sure that the shilling is not
dropped in the gutter, but actually used to pay for the ice cream,
although they are clearly unlikely to have responsibility for the
detailed finances of the person concerned. Given the
Solicitor-General&#146;s comments, however, it seems to me that,
quite apart from a potential breach of confidence and a civil
liability, the way in which the clause is drafted means that such a
person is potentially subject to a criminal responsibility. That may be
what the Government intend. It may be what the Law Commission intended.
However, reluctant though I am to enter into a difference with the Law
Commission, which is a body of learned people, I wonder whether it has
fully thought through the consequences of the way in which clause 4 is
drafted.</div>
<a name="06062069000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
possible that the tabloid press have missed the point and that clause 4
is the dynamite that the Government intend to use to bring to an end to
the frequent breaches of confidence that appear in the tabloid press.
That might be a good thing. I often think that people who publish the
kind of books that I have described are acting in a dubious way and in
accordance with a dubious morality, but it has never crossed my mind
that that was an appropriate area for criminal sanctions, yet that is
what the Bill would introduce. Of course, such a case would have to get
past a jury, and juries, with their robust viewpoint, may decide that
they are not happy with this developing area of the law and simply
refuse to convict people, as we have seen them do on other occasions.
Indeed, those of us who have been barristers have come across juries
who have refused to convict a person on clear evidence that an offence
has been committed, because their own moral sense tells them that the
person was in some way entitled to commit the offence. On the whole,
those of us who draft law should try to avoid provoking such problems,
but, in the clause, we are creating them.</div>
<a name="06062069000006"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
might well be too restrictive, but in the absence of anything else, I
am inclined to press it to a vote, if only to register with the
Solicitor-General the desire&#151;I do not suppose that we will carry
the vote&#151;that the Government go away and think again. I am
prepared to help, to co-operate and, if a better formula is produced,
to go along with it. As things stand, however, I have an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 25</div>underlying anxiety that the clause is too widely drafted and covers a
vast range of behaviour, some of which should undoubtedly be subject to
criminal sanction, but some of which should not. We are in danger of
creating a catch-all provision that will be a nightmare of judicial
interpretation and which could ultimately help to bring the law into
disrepute, which is undesirable. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i>
The Solicitor-General wishes to intervene, so I shall give way to
him.</div>
<a name="06062069000007"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000084"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was going to
respond.</div>
<a name="06062069000008"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000085"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I am grateful. In that case, I shall bring my
remarks to a close. I shall listen to what the Solicitor-General has to
say and then perhaps say one or two words about whether I shall
withdraw my amendment or press it to a
Division.</div><a name="06062069000009"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000086"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
the way in which he put things, so let me see whether I can assist
him.</div>
<a name="06062069000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
points to make. First, I fear that if we go along with the approach
that the hon. Gentleman suggests and restrict the ambit of the clause,
we shall leave elderly people as the Institute of Legacy Management and
the north of England trading standards group suggested. Both
organisations were concerned that elderly people were being exposed, in
effect, to fraud by relatives or workers who would not be covered by
the ambit of a fiduciary relationship. It is for the hon. Gentleman to
decide whether he feels that it is right to leave elderly people
exposed in this way. A number of people who feel that they should not
be left exposed in this way have made representations to the
Government.</div> <a name="06062069000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
I fear that the hon. Gentleman exaggerates the effect that he expects
the clause to have far too much. He exaggerated a small point about
whether we should use the word &#147;occupies&#148; rather than
&#147;occupied&#148; into a massive point. Let me read out the
provision, which refers to a person
who</div><a name="06062069000070"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
&#147;occupies a financial position in which he is expected to
safeguard, or not to act against, the financial interests of another
person,</div><a name="06062069000071"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
Dishonestly abuses that position,
and</div><a name="06062069000072"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) Intends, by
means of the abuse of that
position&#151;</div><a name="06062069000073"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i)
to make a gain for himself or another,
or</div><a name="06062069000074"></a><div class="hs_brev">(ii) to cause loss
to another&#148;.</div><a name="06062069000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
drafting provides several additional safeguards, so we do not have the
massive expansion of imprecision that the hon. Gentleman fears. Many of
the examples to which he referred of breaches of confidentiality and so
on would properly be the subject of civil law, and the civil court is
where they would normally be dealt with. There may well be
circumstances in which a person can generally have fulfilled all the
conditions of the clause: that is, they occupy a position in which they
are expected to safeguard another&#146;s interests, they act
dishonesty and they intend by means of abuse of that
position&#151;that is the additional safeguard included in the
clause&#151;to gain thereby.</div>
<a name="06062069000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 is therefore limited
to cases where individuals have a position of some kind of trust. A
person who is no longer in such a position&#151;for example someone
who no longer occupies the position of trustee&#151;is not caught by
the clause, provided that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 26</div>the abuse takes place subsequently. One can abuse a position only if one
has one or if one has created one by the nature of one&#146;s
contractual relationships. There are safeguards in the
provision.</div>
<a name="06062069000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will feel, on reading the clause as a whole, that
those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that we are not creating
some sort of, as he put it, catch-all. We do not wish to create one. We
want to provide the basis on which to deal with circumstances that
arise not only in fiduciary relationships, but in the sorts of cases
that the Institute of Legacy Management and the north of England
trading standards group have identified&#151;cases in which all of us
would want the elderly to be safeguarded.</div>
<a name="06062069000015"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000087"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I certainly want the elderly to be safeguarded and
I do not wish to restrict the scope of the clause to prevent that from
happening. Clearly, the elderly and the vulnerable are categories of
person whom I would assume were specifically in mind when the clause
was drafted.</div> <a name="06062069000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
another question. I shall allow the Solicitor-General to intervene
again if necessary, because we have time to debate this matter fully.
He read out Lord Justice Millet&#146;s judgment. A carer employed by
a person who is vulnerable might be given their credit or bank card and
their PIN and might try to extract money from a cash machine; leaving
aside the question of theft if they appropriate some of that money for
their own use rather than giving it to or using it for the benefit of
the person concerned, that carer has a fiduciary duty. I would find it
difficult, on the basis of Lord Justice Millet&#146;s cogent
definition, to say that such a relationship did not exist.</div>
<a name="06062069000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fiduciary, by its nature, means
a relationship of trust wherein someone is imparted information that
can be abused. That is why I am by no means certain that if we were to
restrict the definition to a fiduciary one, all the people whom the
Solicitor-General thinks would thereby be excluded would in fact drop
out of the picture. If he thinks that I am wrong about that, I would be
happy to hear why, because, on the basis of the judgment that he quoted
and the definition that he read out, it seems to me that such people
would in all probability be
caught.</div><a name="06062069000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000088"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Lord Justice Millett said
that</div><a name="06062069000075"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principal is entitled to the single-minded loyalty of his
fiduciary.&#148;</div><a name="06062069000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the hon.
Gentleman suggesting that a fiduciary duty is owed by a worker who
comes on behalf of meals on wheels to supply food to an elderly lady at
lunch time and in the evening, and who takes advantage of that
position? Clearly there is an expectation that that worker should not
take advantage of her position, but does she owe a fiduciary duty and a
single-minded loyalty? I think not. Do relatives who come in from time
to time to help have a legal fiduciary relationship? The hon. Gentleman
may well be able to argue in court that such a relationship exists, but
I suspect that the lawyer for the other side would argue strongly that
it does not, and if the latter argument were accepted, the hon.
Gentleman would leave that elderly lady exposed to such
behaviour.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 27</div><a name="06062069000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000089"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I understand what the Solicitor-General is saying,
but it seems to me that he is referring to a completely separate
category of offence. It frequently happens that individuals take
advantage of a degree of trust and to abuse that trust in order to
steal from another person. A carer who is given access to a house and
who, instead of preparing or serving the meal, steals money from the
mantelpiece commits theft. I had assumed that fraud by abuse of
position was designed to deal with individuals who were entrusted with
information that could be dishonestly abused to make a gain or to cause
loss. The obvious example is the one I gave, where one gives
one&#146;s PIN and card to someone, saying, &#147;Could you please
go down to the bank and extract the money?&#148; Such an individual
is in a completely different category, because the point at which one
has given them all the elements to carry out a financial transaction on
one&#146;s behalf is the point at which those elements can be abused.
That is a different category from the one in which carers
fall.</div><a name="06062069000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
surprised if the Solicitor-General was really saying that clause 4 was
intended to try to provide an easy way of prosecuting individuals such
as informal carers who gain access to property and then steal it. There
is plenty in the armoury of the criminal law to deal with that
problem.</div><a name="06062069000022"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000090"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that if
someone goes into an elderly person&#146;s home and steals some
money, that situation is covered elsewhere in the criminal law. Nobody
is suggesting otherwise. The new provision is meant to catch other
circumstances. It may cover that situation too, but one would not
choose to prosecute such a theft as a
fraud.</div><a name="06062069000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
considering circumstances in which people may have the key to
someone&#146;s house, or their pension card or pension book, and may
collect their pension, or obtain information as a result of documents
that may be in the house. The situations about which those who made
representations to us were concerned were those in which someone has a
relationship with such a person that supports their level of
independence&#151;situations in which there is an element of trust,
but that does not extend to what Lord Justice Millett described as the
&#147;single-minded loyalty&#148; of the fiduciary. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument that the provision be restricted to
fiduciary relationships would leave a vulnerable group of people
exposed, and I do not think he wants that. We do not, and we have had
representations from others that they do not, either. It is on that
basis that we put the wording in the clause,</div>

say to the Solicitor-General that I am not wholly satisfied with his
use of that single-mindedness. To me, a person who is handed a benefit
book is in a fiduciary relationship with the person who has entrusted
it to him. &#147;Fides&#148;&#151;that is where the word comes
from.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000092"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I am glad that the hon. Gentleman said that. It
seems to me that the example the Solicitor-General uses is most
peculiar. The element of trust that has been given to that meals on
wheels lady implies a single-minded duty and a single-minded loyalty.
There is a fiduciary relationship. That may not apply to everything
that person does in her capacity as a meals on wheels lady, but in
respect of that position of trust which has been formed, it seems to me
as a layman that a fiduciary duty does exist. It also seems that if it
does not exist, there is no reasonable expectation that could be
demonstrated in a court of law that that person has a duty to safeguard
the financial interests.</div>

remove the elderly and vulnerable that he describes from the proper
protection they ought to have from people who abuse positions of trust.
However, I do not think that my amendment would do that. It would

<a name="06062069000048"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000108"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I shall be brief. I would like the
Solicitor-General to put on record why it was felt that it was not
necessary to accede to the original recommendation of the Law
Commission in respect of a secrecy element to the offence in the
clause. The Law Commission took the view that one of the necessary
requirements of the offence was that the person against whom the fraud
was committed should not be aware of the fact that the person was
acting in the way that they did; if they were aware, it negated the
offence. That has not been incorporated into the Bill, and it would be
helpful if the Solicitor-General explained
why.</div><a name="06062069000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000109"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Although the Law Commission recommended
that there should be an offence of fraud only if the abuse of a
person&#146;s position is both dishonest 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 29</div>and secret, after considering the arguments advanced during the
consultation, the Government decided not to make secrecy part of the
offence. It is difficult to define exactly when something is secret and
when it is not. How many people have to know about it? What if people
can say, &#147;It was secret from me, but it may not have been secret
from my colleague at work.&#148;? It difficult to define exactly what
secrecy means, and it becomes an unnecessary complication and an
over-particularisation. We felt that an offence may well be committed
even if the information or the circumstances in which the abuse takes
place are not secret. On that basis, and to avoid a lot of technical
and legalistic arguments, as well as the problem of
over-particularisation, we took the view that we would not include
secrecy as an element of the
offence.</div><a name="06062069000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000110"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in clause 5, page

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000111"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 4, in clause 5, page 2, line 40, leave out
subsection (4).</div><a name="06062069000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 8,

&#145;reasonably and
lawfully&#146;.</div><a name="06062069000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000112"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> The first two amendments in the group are probing
amendments, but through them we seek to engage in debate on the
definition of gain and loss.The Solicitor-General may well be
able to reassure me, but my concern is that the definition of gain in
subsection (3) specifically
includes</div><a name="06062069000077"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a gain by
keeping what one has, as well as a gain by getting what one does not
have.&#148;</div><a name="06062069000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">In ordinary
parlance, a gain is normally obtaining something to add to what one
already has. Saying that it actually means keeping what one already has
raises a number of issues on which I would like further clarification
from the
Solicitor-General.</div><a name="06062069000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that it is possible by dishonesty to avoid paying something
to somebody else, thereby retaining it for oneself, but if one is doing
that, one is causing the other person a loss. In what circumstances
does the Solicitor-General envisage that a gain by keeping what one
already has would not include causing a loss to someone else by not
paying them what is their due? I simply ask whether subsections (3) and
(4) are not in fact otiose and unnecessary.</div>
<a name="06062069000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (4) does the reverse
of subsection (3). It
states:</div><a name="06062069000078"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Loss&#146;
includes a loss by not getting what one might get, as well as a loss by
parting with what one has.&#148;</div>
<a name="06062069000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">That fits precisely with my earlier
point: if one prevents someone from getting something that they are
entitled to, that is clearly a loss to that person; but what are the
Government trying to cover by referring to a person not getting
something that they might get? It refers, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 30</div>suppose, to the chance of getting something. Perhaps that is what the
Solicitor-General is aiming at. Iam slightly happier with the
definition of loss in subsection (4) than with the need to
particularise gain in the manner specified in subsection (3). The
central issue is the circumstances in which one might gain by keeping
something that one already has when that does not cause a loss to
another person.</div>
<a name="06062069000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000113"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> My amendment in the group is No. 8, and it probes a
point similar to that raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. The
definitions of gain and loss are imported from the Theft Act 1968, but
when we deal with fraud we deal with slightly more mutable subject
matter.</div> <a name="06062069000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is
about the phrase</div> <a name="06062069000079"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not
getting what one might
get&#148;.</div><a name="06062069000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">One &#147;might
get&#148; all sorts of things. One might get things illegally,
through serendipity or in a number of ways that should not be
encompassed by the definition in the clause. My amendment would insert
the words &#147;reasonably and lawfully&#148;, which would at least
provide a concept of entitlement&#151;the word used by the hon.
Gentleman. It would provide the concept of someone having a reasonable
and lawful expectation to receive something. That would narrow the
scope a little, without in any way destroying the essential element in
the definition or what the Government are trying to
achieve.</div><a name="06062069000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000114"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the
part-definition of loss as</div>
<a name="06062069000080"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not getting what one might
get&#148;</div><a name="06062069000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">is exactly the same
as being exposed to &#147;a risk of loss&#148;, which is already
explicitly covered in clauses 2, 3 and 4, which deal with the types of
fraud that may be
committed?</div><a name="06062069000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000115"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly valid point,
and I would welcome the Solicitor-General&#146;s comments on
it.</div><a name="06062069000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000116"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> The Bill is based on the Law
Commission&#146;s thorough review, which started way back in 1998, of
the deception offences in the Theft Acts. It recommended that the Theft
Act definitions of gain and loss should be applied to the new offences
because they are well understood in the courts and have caused no great
difficulty.</div> <a name="06062069000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
5(3) fulfils the policy that gain should include keeping what one has.
That means that the avoidance of payment may, in certain circumstances,
amount to fraud. Section 2 of the Theft Act 1978 has a special offence
of evading by deception a liability to make a payment. An example would
be when a man borrows money from a neighbour and, when a payment is
due, tells a false story about a family bereavement or tragedy, which
persuades the neighbour to cancel the debt. That may be the example
that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked
for.</div><a name="06062069000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000117"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> But that would cause loss to the neighbour, would
it not?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 31</div><a name="06062069000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062069000118"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> It would, in the sense that the
neighbour would not receive the payment back in a particular way. The
payment might not involve the exact same sum as was lent, or there
might a different arrangement whereby something else was to be paid
back. That might mean that the neighbour had lost not what he had
given, but something else that he might have hoped to get. A person may
wish to receive payment of a debt in a number of ways; we need to
ensure that the law does not create a gap or lacuna that would result
in our not taking proper account of all such
circumstances.</div>
<a name="06062050000261"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06062050000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Insider
training is an example of a situation in which there is a gain but no
loss or it is difficult to show loss and any loss may be indirect or
diffuse. That would include trading to keep what one has. Let me turn
to subsection (4) because it is the obverse of this. It derives from
paragraph 7.45 of the Law Commission&#146;s 2002 report in which it
said that loss in the sense
of:</div><a name="06062050000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not getting what one
might get should be sufficient for the new fraud
offence.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">They
added:</div><a name="06062050000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;thus, it could be
fraud to prevent another person from receiving money or other property,
which that person might otherwise have
received.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
example might be where an employee is entitled to some special payment
from his employer. The employer wrongly informs him that he is not so
entitled. Such cases may also involve gain to the defendant, but the
gain may not always be so easy to prove as the loss.</div>
<a name="06062050000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">In our 2004 consultations, we
asked stakeholders specifically if they agreed with the commission that
gain and loss should be defined equally under the Theft Act. More than
70 stakeholders took the trouble to reply and the vast majority agreed
with the proposal. In so far as there was any disagreement, it was on
the question of whether the definition should go wider. A few
respondents did not believe that fraud should be tied to gains or
losses in property.</div>
<a name="06062050000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
agreed with the majority and with the Law Commission that fraud must be
defined as an economic crime, if it is not to become too unhelpfully
wide a concept. The vast majority of stakeholders thought that the Bill
definitions should be aligned with those of the Theft Act 1968, which
apply, for example, to the offence of false accounting. Changes, under
both the Theft Act and the Bill, may appear in the same indictment. We
therefore consider that it is important that the definitions in the
Bill should be consistent with those that apply to the Theft Act
offences. If we amend it, we are going to create a real problem of
confusion in court with judges having to explain different
definitions.</div> <a name="06062050000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
aware that Justice, which sadly failed to reply to our invitation to
comment in 2004, has provided a briefing argument against the policy,
to which the vast majority of stakeholders have agreed. We do not agree
with the points in its briefing. It gives an example of a case, which
someone raised in the
course&#151;</div><a name="06062050000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000329"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I think it was the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant
Conwy (Mr. Llwyd).</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 32</div><a name="06062050000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000330"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> Ah yes, it was. The hon. Gentleman
reminds me that it was the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy who
raised that example, but I will not go into it because it was more than
a little confusing and more algebraic than legal. We will avoid that.
However, I had assumed that the Liberal Democrats had used the Justice
amendment.</div><a name="06062050000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000331"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> I, too, found that example more confusing than
illuminating. My reading of the provision is that the loss of a gain
which might be expected by an illegal act, would
still be a loss which the offence could apply to. For example, if
someone was intending to supply cocaine and, by fraud, a person
substituted flour for the cocaine, so that person would no longer be
able to occasion the gain that he would otherwise have done by selling
that cocaine, that would be a fraud under this definition, would it
not? I ask the Solicitor-General whether that is a reasonable
interpretation or one that we should
avoid?</div><a name="06062050000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000332"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I suspect that anyone engaging in such
a report to the police would find themselves quickly arrested
themselves. There are all types of circumstances in which criminals can
claim that some confederate had breached the criminal law. Nonetheless,
I do not find them regularly going to the police to complain. I suspect
that I they did, the police would welcome them with open arms and open
cell doors as well.</div>
<a name="06062050000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000333"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> But the supplier who had been defrauded would not
be guilty of any criminal offence in that he had not supplied a
controlled substance; he would have supplied
flour.</div><a name="06062050000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000334"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> He may well have committed a different
kind of offence, unless he was acting as an agent provocateur for the
police or something, in which case he may have committed no offence at
all. That people would start to report such things to the police is
unlikely. He need not worry that those are the sorts of things we are
intending to catch. If we do catch them, that would be entirely
accidental and fortuitous perhaps, because it would expose other
crimes.</div><a name="06062050000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also referred to amendmentNo. 8. The amendment
seeks to clarify what constitutes &#147;loss&#148; for the purpose
of the new offences. As discussed, the offences apply only if there was
an intention to make a gain or loss. The amendment seeks to provide
that to be a loss the property that the victim might have received had
he not been defrauded should be limited to that that he might have
reasonably and lawfully
received.</div><a name="06062050000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the intention is to provide greater clarity to the definition of
&#147;loss&#148;, I do not consider the amendment necessary. As I
have made clear, the clause as it stands follows the definitions in
section 34 of the TheftAct 1968. The Government&#146;s view
is that implicit in the reading of the section 34 definition is that
the property lost should be the type that the person ought to have had.
Cases are difficult to imagine, but perhaps the hon. Member for
Somerton and Frome has described one where we could get ourselves into
a position where we need to be sure of the lawfulness of a particular
relationship. However, in the real world we need to make sure that we
have circumstances that the courts can understand and which the police
can deal with straightforwardly. The definitions put into clause 5 of
the legislation enable the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 33</div>courts and police to know what they are dealing with, because they have
dealt with them over a long period of time in the Theft Act. The Act
has not caused a great deal of difficulty, but amending it in any way
might produce a lot of difficulty for the courts. I hope, if on no
other basis than that and to avoid such difficulties, that the hon.
Gentlemen feel they can withdraw their
amendment.</div><a name="06062050000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000335"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> May I raise a possibility with the Solicitor-General?
Section 34 of the Theft Act 1968 defines gain and
loss, but defines them against a specific set of statutory-defined
offences&#151;theft. He described them as over-particularised,
although I do not accept the characterisation of all of the Theft Act
as
over-particularised.</div><a name="06062050000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
troubles me is in subsection
(4)&#151;</div><a name="06062050000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;&#145;Loss&#146;
includes a loss by not getting what one might
get&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is a definition as in the Theft Act, one can steal something that
&#147;one might get&#148;&#151;I suppose one understands
that&#151;meaning the loss of a benefit to which one is entitled but
has not yet come into possession of. My worry is that that seems to
incorporate the loss of chance. That seems to suggest that one can be
convicted if all one deprived somebody of is a chance, something I
might get. It is not necessarily something I would get and not
necessarily something to which I am entitled, which is maybe what the
hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has been getting at; not necessarily
something to which I am entitled, but something I might have come
into.</div><a name="06062050000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
what if I fail to place a bet? Let us suppose that the
Solicitor-General asked me to pop down the road and make a bet on the
next election. I do not know which side he would bet on, but let us
suppose that he asked me to make such a bet and I decided, because I
did not think that he would make a gain in that way, not to place the
bet. I could be guilty under the measures if I fulfilled the other
criteria. I was expected to safeguard his interests, I ought to have
placed the bet and I dishonestly did not do so because I did not want
him to gain. All that I have deprived the Solicitor-General of is the
chance that he might be right; a rather remote chance, depending on
whom he put his money on.</div>
<a name="06062050000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is that what is
intended&#151;that the loss of a chance, perhaps a fairly fragile and
implausible chance, should be sufficient? I raise the point in the hope
that the Solicitor-General can answer, although I realise that it is
rather difficult to answer some questions on the
hoof.</div><a name="06062050000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000336"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am looking at a copy of the Theft Act
1968 and of the Fraud Bill. The definitions have not produced such
technical problems up to now. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s example is
perhaps not a good one, although I realise that he is doing it on the
hoof, as am I, because we are discussing a wager. There is no
obligation to pay, only a relationship.</div>
<a name="06062050000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certain
circumstances might arise in which a chance of getting something was
frustrated. The courts, police and prosecutors would have to consider
whether the other circumstances under the clauses had produced
sufficient dishonesty and other elements to lead to a charge. The other
elements would be key in those circumstances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 34</div><a name="06062050000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 4.6
of the Law Commission report points out that conspiracy to defraud can
apply to cases that put another&#146;s financial interests at risk,
and considers that a new fraud offence should apply to exposing another
to a risk of loss. One of the key questions that Opposition Members
raised on Second Reading was whether conspiracy to defraud should be
removed from the Bill or should be included in the Bill so as to remove
it from law. Their view has strong arguments, and indeed our view does
too.</div>
<a name="06062050000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conspiracy to
defraud is a common law development that has quite a broad ambit and is
very youthful. We feel that we ought to maintain it for the time being,
but we hope that at some point in the future we
will be able to remove it. To do so, we will have to create new
legislation in the Bill to ensure that we cover the circumstances
previously covered by conspiracy to
defraud.</div><a name="06062050000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 34 of
the Theft Act 1968 and clause 5 of the Fraud Bill will produce the
coverage that will enable that. We hope to be able to consider the
Fraud Bill&#146;s effects once it has been passed and the way that it
is being used in the context of the guidance that the Attorney General
will issue shortly&#151;I have distributed the drafts to Committee
members&#151;and decide whether we can remove conspiracy to defraud.
If we removed the wording in question, we would restrict the
clause&#146;s ambit, knowingly failing to cover some of the area now
covered by conspiracy to
defraud.</div><a name="06062050000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000337"></a>Mr.
Cox:</b> I understand the Solicitor-General, but it has long
seemed to me that there is a serious terminological inexactitude used
when talking about the risk of loss. Fraud law discusses risk of
loss&#151;the loss of the chance that one might get something, or the
remote prospect when betting on a horse that it might come
home&#151;but if one examines the case law behind it, one finds that
when it talks about exposure to the risk of loss, it always means that
a director or somebody in a fiduciary position has taken a risk with a
specific, identifiable and tangible asset.</div>
<a name="06062050000262"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06062050000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give the
Committee a classic example. A director takes money from the company
that he is director of, invests it in the overnight market in Tokyo but
returns it to the company bank account the following morning. He says
that he had no intention of causing loss, because he was going to
return the money and he wanted to make a profit for the company whose
money it was He was just going to cream off part of the profit that was
made over the 24-hour period. The danger is that in moving it in that
24 hours and putting it on the market in Tokyo he exposed that sum of
money&#151;that identified asset&#151;to loss. That is the meaning
that the law of fraud attributes to the phrase &#147;risk of
loss&#148;.</div> <a name="06062050000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fully
accept that there has been a confusion for many years, but clause 5
adopts the loss of a chance as being sufficient. It will be enough if
the betting ticket is not submitted and the horse comes home first or
third. That is so remote in terms of causation&#151;there is such a
lack of proximity between the act done and the potential
loss&#151;that there is a real risk that people will be indicted for
forms of losses of a chance or risk that are remote. That is a genuine
concern and we must not get foxed in respect of the idea of the risk of
loss; it really means exposing something to a risk that depreciates its
value.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 35</div><a name="06062050000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me give the
Solicitor-General another example. Often the case law on risk of loss
refers to a deception in a mortgage case. The mortgage company will
have advanced a loan based on a detail that is false; someone will have
exaggerated their net worth or some such thing. That loan is an asset
and it is less valuable because, on any credit analysis of it, it is a
less secure loan. Thus, the risk of loss that is created by the
deception&#151;someone has failed to produce honest details about
their net worth&#151;impacts on the value of the
asset. If the truth were known, its value as an asset would be less
than it would otherwise have been. That is the context in which the law
refers to risk of loss.</div>
<a name="06062050000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The danger of this phraseology
is simply that one can expose somebody to the chance that he might, if
happenstance had happened in a particular way, have gained something.
That is very vague and has an attendant danger. I invite the Minister
at least to reflect on that.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000338"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I simply make the point to the Committee
that there is traditionally a difference between speeches and
interventions, but I did not want to spoil the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
flow.</div>
<a name="06062050000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000339"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I was so lost in the example that I
also thought it was a speech.</div>
<a name="06062050000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our objective is to deal with
circumstances in which there is an exposure to risk of financial loss.
It is also the case that any prosecutor, and, in due course, any court,
would have to examine the remoteness of any chance in determining
whether there had been an element of dishonesty and the other elements
necessary to prove the case. I am not sufficiently aware of the case
law to say whether this has produced a lot of difficulty in terms of
definition.</div><a name="06062050000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not proposing to rewrite the whole of the Theft Act 1968. As I
pointed out on Second Reading, when it was originally drafted it was
regarded as a model of clarity and of showing the particular
circumstances in which the criminal law applied. In some, but not all,
of its sections, we have had to deal with the problem of
over-particularity because society has changed. That is what we are
trying to deal with in the clause.</div>
<a name="06062050000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any court and prosecutor will
have to consider the element of remoteness in deciding whether the
other elements of the case are proved, and whether the provisions of
clause 5(4) are sufficiently met. I suspect that, if it is too remote,
it will not be prosecuted. We cannot here deal with all the details of
the various cases; we have to do our best to set out the intentions of
Parliament in the wording of a clause, in a way that does not produce
unnecessary confusion in the courts. That is what we have tried to
arrive at in the clause. In view of the fact that we use the definition
in the clause in other clauses, I hope that we can stick to it. It may
well be that the Law Commission later decides to change it and to deal
with some of the points raised, but I do not think that this is the
point at which to change it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000340"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> This has been a fascinating debate, and I am
particularly grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and
West Devon for his contribution on the issue of loss. Our two
amendments sought to delete subsections (3) and (4). The Minister has
persuaded me that we should leave in subsection (3). It may be a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 36</div>belt-and-braces job, but I certainly do not think that there is any
mischief in it. It may be otiose, but let it
remain.</div><a name="06062050000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I certainly
will not press our amendment to delete subsection (4), and I shall ask
to withdraw it, but I shall think about the matter a little further,
because as I listened to the interesting exchanges between the
Solicitor-General and my hon. Friend, it became apparent to me that
there was an issue at stake that I had perhaps not
originally looked into or fully understood when I drafted the
amendment. Could one not re-word subsection (4) so that it said
&#147;&#145;loss&#146; includes the risk of loss, as well as a
loss by parting with what one has&#148;? If one did that, it would
entirely cover the important point of the risk of being put at a
disadvantage because one has not been given the full facts, and it is
quite right that that should be criminalised. The example that my hon.
Friend gave was not being given the full facts on which one is lending
for a mortgage. That wording would also remove the thing that caused me
slight anxiety, and that originally led me to table my
amendment&#151;it clearly causes my hon. Friend a great deal of
anxiety, too&#151;namely the matter of the loss of chance, which I
think is a separate issue. I remain unpersuaded that it needs to be
covered by the definition of loss. My wording would separate the two
out.</div> <a name="06062050000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say that to
the Solicitor-General because he may like to reflect on the matter
before Report. He might even wish to write to us, when he has taken
that opportunity to reflect, and tell us whether there is another way
of approaching the matter. We could then potentially return to the
subject on Report. I simply highlight it because the rewording that I
put forward meets the Government&#146;s objectives in defining loss,
whereas there is something unhappy about the expression,</div>
<a name="06062050000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;includes a loss by not getting
what one might
get&#148;.</div><a name="06062050000211"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000341"></a>The
Solicitor-General:</b> I am happy to look into that, and to
write to the hon. Gentleman on the point, but how does he deal with the
issue of section 34 of the Theft Act? We might end up with a situation
in which there were two charges with two different definitions on the
indictment, which the judge would then have to explain to a jury. The
assumption is that if Parliament changes the wording, it intends to
make a change in the substance. What change in substance is he making?
It seems that he is not seeking to make any such change, in which case
it is a recipe for confusion in
court.</div><a name="06062050000212"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000342"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> Perhaps I should say that I shall go away and
reflect on that. Perhaps we may have come up with a better definition
than the draftsmen of the Theft Act did. However, the Solicitor-General
makes a perfectly good point and I shall think about it as well. I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div><a name="06062050000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000344"></a>The

following
amendments:</div><a name="06062050000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">No. 9, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000345"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> In clauses 6 and 7 we deal with an issue of detail
that is of some importance and althoughit may be of greater
importance in the context ofclause 7, clause 6 is the right
place to tackle the
matter.</div><a name="06062050000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
difficulty with the clause, which
says:</div><a name="06062050000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A person
is guilty of an offence if he has in his possession or under his
control any article for use in the course of or in connection with any
fraud.&#148;</div><a name="06062050000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we discussed on Second Reading&#151;going back to the old Theft
Act&#151;this is a mixture of IT fraud and the old offence of going
equipped to cheat and covers both areas; that is, having in
one&#146;s possession something that could be used in connection with
fraud. What does &#147;for use&#148; mean? Does it mean that the
prosecution has to prove that the article was for use with a
fraud or merely that it can be used in a fraud? If it is the
latter, the clause is too widely drawn. The specific intent must be
proved. As I said on Second Reading, I am anxious about that because
articles that could be used in fraud could also be put to innocent
uses. I am concerned to ensure that the person who we criminalise and
prosecute successfully is the person who intends to use an article in
fraud, not just the one who has it in his
possession.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div><a name="06062050000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000346"></a>Mr.
Heath:</b> Both of us want to incorporate that intent into the
clause. May I suggest that his formulation does not quite do that? It
provides for the object or article to be intended for use, but that
intent does not fall on the person who is judged to be guilty of the
offence. There might be a flaw in his drafting in the use of the
passive rather than the active mood of the
verb.</div><a name="06062050000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000347"></a>Mr.
Grieve:</b> I intended that my amendment should refer to the
intent of the person when he had the article in his possession. Perhaps
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is better than mine. We shall
discuss that with the Solicitor-General and if the matter is pressed to
the vote and I prefer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment, I shall
support his and ask leave to withdraw
mine.</div><a name="06062050000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are both
looking at the same issue. Perhaps the Solicitor-General is in a
position to provide us with reassurance. However, I am anxious, because
as I have said it seems possible to have in one&#146;s possession an
article that could be used for a fraud but have it for use in a
conjuring trick or to manufacture it for the purpose of using it in a
conjuring trick. I am sure that one could find numerous examples. It is
important that we ensure that we are not suddenly outlawing the
possession of all sorts of devices or gadgets that may have a lawful
application as well as a potentially unlawful
one.</div><a name="06062050000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06062050000348"></a>Mr.

support of the basic intention of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendment.</div><a name="06062050000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
