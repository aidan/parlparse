<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I draw hon. Members' attention to the revised selection list to the end of clause 88, which is available in the Room, as many hon. Members have noted.

<H4><center>Schedule 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``research and development''</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 91, in page 398, line 14, leave out from ``development'' to end of line 32 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`has the meaning given in paragraph 21 of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 13'.-[Mr. Ottaway.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson) rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): On a point of order, Mr. Clark. This is a genuine point of order, for once.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to make any admissions in relation to earlier points of order that he has raised?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> No.

<P>
I fear that we are remorselessly advancing towards the point next week at which we will encounter the dreaded schedules 30 and 31. It would greatly assist the Committee if the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 were available in the Room. It is almost impossible to make head nor tail of those schedules without them.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I agree with your definition of the word ``genuine''. It is a fair point that those papers should be in the Room. I shall refer the matter to the authorities and do my best to ensure that the documents are here for the benefit of the Committee.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) asked about definitions of research and development before we adjourned for lunch. I could discuss such definitions extensively, but I shall try to summarise a little.

<P>
It is worthwhile to give notice to the Committee that the original approach was based on an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development definition of R and D, in what is called the Frascati manual. I do not believe that that has anything to do with wine, although I am not sure how it got its title. It is the internationally recognised standard for statistical reporting of R and D activity. The manual is updated periodically, is 250 pages long, and includes detailed examples and boundaries of R and D activities. We considered using the Frascati definition, but that was rejected by most consultees, who had neither heard of nor seen the manual. They preferred to use statement of standard accounting practice 13, to which the hon. Member for Croydon, South referred.

<P>
Commercial and product development, which the hon. Gentleman also mentioned, do not come within the accepted meaning of research and development. The new definition and guidelines clarify what is meant by R and D for tax purposes. They do not change the meaning that has been applied in the past by the Inland Revenue and the Department of Trade and Industry. Instead, they explain it and put it on a clear statutory basis. The term R and D has a specialised meaning, and the definition for tax purposes is based on and has the same scope as the definition used generally for other purposes. It is based on the international standard in the Frascati manual and is aligned with the definition for accounting purposes, which is also based on the international standard-SSAP 13. The DTI uses the same definition for programmes to support and promote R and D. The accepted meaning of R and D is distinguished from non-research activity by the presence or absence of an appreciable element of innovation. It includes experimental research and development, but not commercial and product development.

<P>
It is worth pointing out that we consulted on the revised proposal in March, following the Budget. We received many comments from representative bodies on the proposed guidelines on the meaning of the term ``R and D''. The clause and the amendments are concerned with that term-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> A representative of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said of the guidelines that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in general, I think they provide a very useful tool for the resolution of the difficult borderline issues which arise in this area.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Scotland stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Within the guidelines, the R&D boundary examples are particularly helpful.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The guidelines appear to provide a comprehensive summary of the distinction between qualifying and non-qualifying activities sought.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I hope that hon. Members accept that we are offering the definition that will be most helpful to the various accounting bodies and others who need to be clear about whether something constitutes R and D.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): The mind boggles about the nature of the Frascati manual.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I agree.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> What year is it?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I think it is 1993 or 1994.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure whether that was a good year for Frascati. I appreciate the way in which the Economic Secretary spelled out her explanation, which was the one that I wanted-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There has been a lot of noise in Committee on two occasions, and on both it has come from hon. Members on the same side as the hon. Member who was speaking. It is disconcerting for speakers if people are noisy behind them, so I ask members of the Committee to have some respect for their colleagues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I think that, in effect, I tabled the wrong amendment. Instead of calling for the accounting definition, I should have tabled an amendment that used the definition ``research and some development''. At least the Economic Secretary was good enough to acknowledge that development relates only to scientific research. Despite the new headline definition of research and development, it is still limited in the same way as it was before. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Schedule 19 agreed to.

<P>
Clause 68 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Schedule 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Tax Relief for expenditure on research and development</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 92, in page 401, line 21, leave out ``£25,000'' and insert ``£24,000''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 93, in page 401, line 22, leave out ``£25,000'' and insert ``£24,000''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We have moved on a schedule and are now dealing with the detail of tax relief for expenditure on research and development. The amendment is designed to probe the issue of why the Government have adopted for R and D a threshold of £25,000, which will be deductible in insurance terms. Most of us could find plenty of small firms in our constituencies to which £25,000 is a substantial sum to spend on R and D. Such firms will be precluded by the threshold from the fairly generous relief of 150 per cent. tax relief for R and D, which is worth having and worth aspiring to.

<P>
The thrust of the Budget has been to help smaller firms, which is not something that we want to obstruct or oppose. We could think of other ways to do it, but, given that that is the Government's intention, the Economic Secretary should explain why she has set the relatively high threshold of £25,000.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The threshold was set at £25,000 following consultation. I am a little confused about what the hon. Gentleman meant when he referred to setting such a high threshold. We originally proposed a threshold of £50,000, a figure that most businesses responding to the consultation thought was reasonable. However, several representative bodies said that it might be too high for some fledgling businesses, so we lowered it to £25,000, as had been suggested.

<P>
I can give the hon. Gentleman details of the figures suggested by various representative bodies. The British Chambers of Commerce suggested £25,000, and the Chartered Institute of Taxation £10,000; the Confederation of British Industry said that the figure should certainly not be higher than £25,000; the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was not convinced that there should be a limit, but that view seemed out of kilter with everyone else's; and the Law Society of Scotland thought that it should be between £10,000 and £20,000. The range of figures was wide, but they tended to be lower than the £50,000 with which we began. Therefore, we arrived at the best compromise figure of £25,000, which strikes a sensible balance between the need to keep administrative and compliance costs down and our desire to encourage businesses to carry out R and D. To go any lower would have made nonsense of the measure, but we have substantially reduced the figure in response to the views expressed in consultation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I tend to agree with the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which said that there should be no threshold. Will the Economic Secretary explain why there should be a threshold at all? Is she concerned about the Government's administrative costs, or about the burden on companies? The choice should be for the company to make, if the latter is the case. I remain puzzled.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Without a minimum sum for R and D, the measure would make no sense. The ICA suggested that there should be no limit, but it was unusual in that; everyone else suggested a limit, for the reasons I have given. We are trying to encourage R and D. To have a proposal that does not set a minimum level of activity that must be reached before the whole thing engages would be ridiculous. The threshold will encourage businesses to increase their R and D activities to a certain level, help to target tax credits on those businesses carrying out real R and D, and keep administrative and Exchequer costs within reasonable bounds. It is a trade-off between setting a threshold and the administration that goes with the measure. To set no threshold would tie an awful lot of people up in unnecessary paperwork and would not fulfil our overall aim for the economy.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I do not understand how setting a threshold encourages R and D. A manufacturer of measuring equipment in Welwyn Hatfield, for example, who wants to commit £10,000 to a research project-that could be sub-contracted, so it is a feasible idea-will be discouraged by the £25,000 threshold. How will the limit encourage people? Is it not really a revenue-saving measure by the Government, who do not want to commit too much relief? Like the small deductible set by insurance companies, the limit makes a difference to the figures. None of the small businesses across the country that want to spend £10,000 on R and D will qualify, which will result in a saving for the Treasury. Is that not the real reason behind the measure?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have already said that setting such a figure, which is very modest, for any business putting money into R and D will bring more companies into the net. The changes will increase the number of qualifying companies by 1,000, from 3,500 to 4,500. People will be encouraged to extend their R and D to levels at which they will gain greater benefits both from getting more R and D input and from reaching the threshold and therefore qualifying for benefits under the scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I said at the outset that the amendment is a probing one and I do not wish to press it, but I want to place on record our view that the Government's position is unsatisfactory and that the Minister has not fully addressed the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 94, in page 401, line 40, after ``1996'', insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>, subject to sub-paragraph (1A).

<P>
(1A) The definition of a ``small or medium-sized enterprise'' shall have effect as if, for every reference to an amount in Euros, there were substituted the equivalent amount in sterling, calculated on 21st March 2000.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment relates to companies that may or may not qualify for R and D tax relief. One has to start with the definition of a small or medium-sized enterprise. Paragraph 2(1) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the purposes of this Schedule a ``small or medium-sized enterprise'' means a small or medium-sized enterprise as defined in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3rd April 1996.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That document, in turn, states clearly that a small or medium-sized enterprise is one with fewer than 250 employees, which has either an annual turnover not exceeding 40 million euros, or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 27 million euros.

<P>
The amendment would use the sterling-euro exchange rate prevailing on Budget day this year, when the measure was announced. We chose that system because it is highly unsatisfactory to have a fluctuating threshold on what does or does not qualify for R and D relief. A turnover of £25 million on Budget day, for example, would have converted under the exchange rate prevailing on that day into £24,633,000. In other words, the business would have qualified for relief. However, because of exchange rate risks and fluctuations, it would not qualify under the rate prevailing today. What basis is that on which to run a business? It is bizarre that the Government do not want to set a fixed rate. The Minister may say that we will have a fixed rate for the euro, but I very much doubt that that will happen. I hope that she will recognise the merit of our argument and accept the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The R and D tax credits are a generous new relief for small and medium-sized companies that undertake R and D. The tax credits are notifiable state aid, which means that they have to be notified to and approved by the European Commission before they can be brought into effect. That has been done.

<P>
As R and D tax credits are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises, they must conform to the definition of SME in the EC rules on state aids. To ensure as wide a coverage as possible, we have imported the EC definition directly into the eligibility criteria for R and D tax credits-a point that the hon. Gentleman might not have appreciated. The EC definition includes limits on the turnover and balance sheet total of the company for the periods of accounts expressed in euros. In applying the definition in the United Kingdom, those amounts must be converted into sterling at the appropriate conversion rates for the period of the accounts.

<P>
The amendment would fix the limit on the turnover of the balance sheet total in sterling using the conversion rate on Budget day, 21 March 2000, as the hon. Gentleman said. To keep within the EC state aid rules, the limits would then need to be amended from time to time to take account of changes in the exchange rate. That could be done in regulations, as provided for in the rules but, depending on the volatility of the exchange rates, frequent changes might be required. It is therefore simpler to use the EC definition as proposed in the new rules and allow companies to convert the limits using the prevailing exchange rate, especially as that will only be material for a small number of the larger companies. The majority of companies will not need to check it, as it will be clear that they fall well within the limits. For those reasons, I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have not been convinced.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Well, I said only that I hope that I have convinced the hon. Gentleman. He is free to say more about the amendment, but I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> I was waiting for the Economic Secretary to reply to my hon. Friend before I spoke, because I assumed that she would give him a simple answer to his question. However, my hon. Friend has put his finger on an important issue, to which the hon. Lady has not responded adequately. In the real business world-which is certainly not inhabited by Ministers-certainty is important. People need to plan ahead, especially if they are committing capital sums to R and D. It is no good the Minister saying that the exchange rate between euros and pounds will be adjusted from time to time and that that does not affect companies.

<P>
The fact is that such an adjustment will affect companies-and more than a few, because many companies will be spread out on either side of the euro definition and may be captured or excluded by further fluctuations in the euro-pound rate. No one anticipated that the euro would depreciate as spectacularly as it has in the past year or so. That would have had a big effect on the number of firms that were caught, or not caught, by the definition. There may be further fluctuations in future.

<P>
Furthermore, no more than a handful of small firms account in euros or have real exposure to the euro. The majority of such companies trade exclusively within the United Kingdom and do not trade in foreign currencies. Their mindset is in sterling. It is a new departure to import, not only a definition in words from a Commission document, but a financial definition. Will the Economic Secretary explain in more detail her statement about ``amending from time to time''?

<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): I am a bit curious about the right hon. Gentleman's point. If he does not like the definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise as defined in Commission recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996, why did he not do something about it when he was a Minister?

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> As usual, I rather regret having given way to the hon. Gentleman. I apologise to the Committee for allowing its time to be wasted by trivia. The provision was not introduced by the previous Government. The Bill is the most recent in a series of Finance Bills introduced by the current Government: it is their definition and their schedule that we are contemplating. As a Minister, I had nothing to do with the Finance Bill 2000, as the Conservatives left office more than three years ago-a fact that has obviously escaped the hon. Gentleman. At no time would we have considered disadvantaging small businesses and the people who run them, as the clause will.

<P>
Above all, people in business need certainty in order to plan ahead. Planning capital expenditure on the basis that they will receive a particular relief when a fluctuation in the euro exchange rate can suddenly deny them that relief is hard enough, but the difficulty will now be compounded by further uncertainty: such relief will now depend on whether the Treasury introduces an amendment to adjust the exchange rate, which doubles the uncertainty. The Economic Secretary owes the Committee and the wider business community a more detailed explanation of her assertion that everything will be all right because the Treasury will deal with the matter when circumstances change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): My interest was aroused by the Economic Secretary's reference to the EC definition of a small and medium-sized enterprise. What is the legal status or standing of a Commission recommendation, as opposed to a regulation or directive? I want to explore that to make it clear in my mind whether the Government have alighted on the definition as a convenient one, or whether they could have complied with state aid rules without having to follow that particular recommendation and could have used another definition. I should like a little background on the provision.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am always delighted to help the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends. It may help the right hon. Members for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and for Fylde (Mr. Jack) to realise that, contrary to what the right hon. Member for Fylde alleged, the Government originally proposed using the same turnover and balance sheet limits to determine entitlement as in the Companies Acts definitions of SMEs. Those definitions are set at about half the limits expressed in the EC definition of an SME. Following consultation, we switched to the EC limits, because they are so much greater. Under EC rules, an SME must have fewer than 250 employees, which allows a fair size, and either or both an annual turnover of no more than £25 million or an annual balance sheet total of no more than £17 million.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Twenty-five million what?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Pounds sterling. In fact, therefore, such an enterprise could be fairly sizeable by the standards of many of our small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why I said that a large majority of companies will be under the limits to such an extent that the limits will not interest or worry them, and that only a fairly small number of larger companies might be worried.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): Will the Economic Secretary answer the question asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde? What is the legal status of a Commission recommendation?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The Commission has advised us that recommendations should be adopted to ensure compatibility with state aid rules. I am sure that I do not need to point out to the hon. Gentleman or to his right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde that we are bound by EU state aid rules; we must follow such limits. If the amendment were accepted, businesses would face a great deal of uncertainty and would still need to consider the financial limits in the EU definition if they were near the borderline. As I said, not many companies would be affected.

<P>
Fixing the sterling equivalent of the euro limits could reduce the number of companies that qualify. The sterling equivalent would need to be lower than the maximum permitted in euros to cater for exchange rate movements. Giving R and D tax credits to companies that exceed EU SME financial limits would amount to illegal aid. Clearly, we could not do that.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> With respect to the Economic Secretary, that last remark was absolute tosh. How can the British threshold be different from the European one when the threshold is affected by the exchange rate prevailing on any given day?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The first point, which I am not sure whether Opposition Members are taking on board, is that two definitions are available. One appears in the Companies Act and the other in EU rules.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman had finished speaking. Is he seeking to make an intervention?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Ottaway gave way to you, Miss Johnson.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I gave way because I had picked up on a specific point, which I thought that the Minister was going to address. She now seems to be addressing matters to which I have not referred.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I was endeavouring to clarify the issue. Whatever happens, the need to comply with state aid rules means that we must make reference to the definition. If it were expressed as the hon. Gentlemen are suggesting, people would have to convert back and have regard to any changes in the EU definition as a result of changes in the exchange rate, because it would not be expressed in compatible terms. We have expressed it in compatible terms, which bring it in line with the scheme and make the definition clear for companies considering what they must do.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention. I clearly heard Mr. Ottaway say that he was giving way on what I thought was a specific point. I imagine that the Economic Secretary has now answered it. Mr. Ottaway should now conclude his comments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have got the Economic Secretary's drift. I shall ask two more questions, and she can finish her remarks by answering them.

<P>
First, when the measure was drafted, did it cross the Economic Secretary's mind-or the minds of those advising her-that there might be a huge exchange rate fluctuation in a short period? When we are considering firms near the edge, the figure involved is about £500,000. Secondly, is the definition applicable throughout the Bill?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is the definition in use in a number of contexts in relation to tax credits and SMEs. Clearly, it is not in use in every context, as other definitions exist. It is certainly the definition that we propose to use in the context that we are discussing.

<P>
The Revenue will interpret the limits and there is no prescribed method of calculating the euro equivalent of a company's turnover-the Revenue will accept computations on any reasonable basis. For example, turnover could be calculated using the average exchange rate for the period of the accounts, if that would produce a fairer result. The balance sheet total should be calculated by reference to the sterling-euro exchange rate on the accounting date. Those are the means whereby people will find certainty.

<P>
The vast majority of companies will not be near the margin. Had we used an alternative definition, the threshold would have been at half its current amount. We propose a scheme that is more generous and will give people the maximum possible under definitions of SMEs. It will also give them the greatest degree of certainty possible about where the boundaries are, given changes in the exchange rate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Not only has the debate become a little ragged, the Economic Secretary's argument has as well. She invites us to accept that there are only two choices: the Companies Act definition of a small or medium-sized company in sterling, with which we are all familiar, and a new definition for the purposes of state aids, which she insists has to be in euros. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South suggested, the state aid definition could be used with the euro limit converted into sterling for the convenience of business men; the businesses concerned could then build certainty into their calculations.

<P>
Following a 15 per cent. devaluation of the euro, large numbers of companies that planned their research and development a year or so ago on the basis of the euro limit would now not be found eligible, and the development in question would not be tax relieved at all. That illustrates the fact that the Bill has been drafted for the benefit of administrators and bureaucrats, not business men. It would have been easy for the Government to discuss the matter with the European Commission and make it understand that this country's businesses would prefer such matters to be defined in their own currency, in which they account and with which they are familiar.

<P>
Apparently, the Economic Secretary did not even think of that. It did not occur to her that the proposal would create problems for small or medium-sized businesses. She was reduced to saying that not many of them would be affected, but that is simply not true. There are large numbers on either side of the boundary that may be caught by being either unexpectedly included in the definition, or-worse-excluded from it. The fluctuations in the sterling-euro exchange rate are not over.

<P>
I suggest that the Economic Secretary goes back to the Commission and starts to stand up for the business community that she seeks to help. She should stop running her system for the benefit of the tax authorities. If she is not willing to do so, we shall press the amendment.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I refute the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. The Government have done nothing but consider the best way to help business, and that is no different on this subject. The EC definition includes the limits on turnover and balance sheet totals of companies for the period of account expressed in euros. In applying the definition in the United Kingdom, those sums must be converted into sterling at the appropriate conversion rate for the period of accounts.

<P>
The EU rules set limits for the period of accounts. The amendment would fix the limits on the turnover and balance sheets using the conversion rate on Budget day. The limits would have to be altered from time to time to take account of changes in the exchange rate. I fail to see how that would help business. It could be done by regulations, but frequent changes might be required, depending on the volatility of exchange rates. It seems altogether simpler to use the EC definition and allow companies to convert the limits using the prevailing exchange rate. That is much less difficult for all parties, not least for business.

<P>
The proposal is generous in terms of its definition of SMEs. It would give many more companies scope to take advantage of the deal on offer. The R and D tax credits form a generous relief, which has been designed with business very much in mind.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We will bring this matter to a resolution. The Economic Secretary is now straying into a world of fantasy. She invites us to believe that it is easier for businesses to be faced with the uncertainty of what the sterling-euro exchange will be when they claim the relief, which may be several years later, than when they undertake it. She suggests that that is easier than adding to the legislation a limit in sterling, the currency with which businesses are familiar and which they use for their accounts. That is bizarre, and shows how administrative systems or bureaucracies can drift so far away from the realities of business life that they apparently convince themselves that they are doing something for the benefit of business when they clearly are not.

We can adduce no further arguments, and have clearly won this argument. I urge my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to press the matter to a Division.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 95, in page 403, line 12, leave out from ``means'' to end of line 15 and insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(a) additional overheads incurred directly as a result of the research activity, or

<P>
(b) other operating expenses, such as costs of materials, supplies and similar products, incurred directly as a result of the research activity.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am optimistic that the Economic Secretary will be able to accept this amendment, based on what she said in the previous debate, as it adopts the EU guidelines as to qualifying expenditure for R and D tax relief. The Bill allows only expenditure on staffing costs and consumable stores to qualify for relief; the amendment would extend that qualification. Annexe II of a document called ``Community framework for state aid for research and development'', from which the amendment is drawn, sets out what can be taken into account. I hope that the Economic Secretary will say something helpful on the subject.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The amendment would broaden the types of expenditure that would qualify for R and D tax credits, but make the system less fair and simple. It would cost approximately £100 million in a full year, introduce distortions and increase the opportunities artificially to inflate claims.

<P>
The tax credits are given on spending on staff who carry out R and D and on consumable stores used in R and D activity. The costs have been adopted because they provide a clear and simple measurement of the amount of R and D being done. They form a direct link between the level of investment in R and D and the tax credit itself.

<P>
The amendment would widen the expenditure qualifying for R and D tax credits to include all overheads and operating expenditure. That would break the direct link to the level of R and D activity and replace a simple, direct and easily identifiable measure by one that is ill defined, arbitrary and open to manipulation. The level of tax credit would depend on the way in which the business was organised, which would be distorting and unfair because it would encourage tax planners to arrange the business to increase the relief artificially. The tax credit system would be more complicated, uncertain and unfair. The amendment would increase compliance, administrative and Exchequer costs.

<P>
It is better to base the tax credits on wages and consumable stores, as that is an objective and transparent measure of R and D activity, and is certain, simple and fair. For those reasons, I recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Economic Secretary explain why, under the previous amendment, it was in order to accept a European recommendation for a ceiling when the Government cannot accept a European guideline under this amendment? The Economic Secretary says that the Bill aids transparency. However, the EU guidelines that set out the level of expenditure in the amendment state that the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Commission aims to achieve the highest possible degree of transparency in the application of aid schemes. This means that there must be a clear statement of the objectives to be achieved, the beneficiaries, etc. The different categories of costs which the aid is designed to reduce must be specified and the aid must be granted in such a form that the intensity of the aid in relation to these costs, as listed in Annex II, can be calculated.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Is the Economic Secretary saying that the Commission has got it wrong and that there is a fall-off of transparency? If so, the EU does not agree with her; it says that our amendment is transparent. Finally, will she say where on earth she gets the figure of £100 million from?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The figure of £100 million is the costing for the full-year implications of the amendment. If he is asking whether I have the precise arithmetic to hand, the answer is no. That does not change the fact that the costing would be in the order of £100 million. I have explained why the amendment is not a good one. I mentioned the fact that the definition would widen the expenditure to include all overheads and operating expenditure. That does not have any link with a level of R and D activity; it is a way of passing costs across as though they were connected with R and D activity when they have nothing to do with it. That is why the amendment should be rejected.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Economic Secretary answer my fundamental question? Why was it in order in the previous debate an EU recommendation was acceptable, whereas it is not in order to accept an EU guideline in this case?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I crave your indulgence, Dr. Clark, because I shall have to mention the previous debate, which was about what qualified as a state aid and what would be acceptable within the state aid rules. For those purposes, we must have due consideration for the EU state aid rules and the way in which definitions work. We have chosen a definition that will work best for the British economy and I hope that the hon. Member for Croydon, South is not questioning our motivation. Our proposal is the best way in which to achieve that aim.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am intrigued by the Minister again plucking a number out of the ether, with no justification. Will she describe in more detail some of the real-world examples to which she alluded in her broad-brush comments? Furthermore, the Government made it clear that the schedule, as drafted originally, would be satisfied by an adherence to normal accounting practices. Making a claim for help to include the costs that the amendment referred to would require the use of an accountant to identify those expenses.

<P>
The Minister seems to be saying that, if a company employed a firm of professional bona fide accountants, the accountants would immediately indulge in some great activity of tax avoidance, thus ramping up the costs to £100 million. I do not understand the reasoning behind that statement. If my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South had added some words to the amendment about accountants, would the Economic Secretary have been satisfied? It seems that the self-same people who would have satisfied her under the original words of the schedule would also be responsible for making the claim and doing the necessary analysis-under the amendment. In one instance, it is satisfactory for the Government to accept such action as they define it, but when it is carried out without being mentioned expressly in the amendment, such a measure suddenly becomes a £100 million tax avoidance mechanism. That defies logic. Will the hon. Lady explain where the figure of £100 million came from and why accountants cannot be trusted?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I am always pleased to respond to the remarks of the right hon. Gentleman, not least because he does not like sums of money being quoted in respect of amendments proposed by the Opposition because they add to the great big black hole that the Tories have in their spending plans, under which they propose to spend, spend, spend, although with a tax pledge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Answer the point.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall answer the right hon. Gentleman's point at the speed that I choose. He can make whatever remarks he wants, because if I wish to go on at length about the cost resulting from amendments that have been tabled in Committee, I am free-subject to your discretion, Dr. Clark-to do so.

<P>
I have given the Committee examples of the problems that I foresee with the amendment. A company that rents its R and D premises would receive more R and D tax credit than a company that owns its premises, as the rents would be included in the overheads under the amendment. That is why the amendment would be unfair and distorting. It would encourage companies to enter into artificial agreements such as sale and leaseback arrangements to increase the tax credit.

<P>
Similarly, a company that funds R and D through debt would be subject to more R and D tax credit than a company that funds R and D out of income, savings or equity, as interest would be included in the overhead costs. Again, that is unfair and distorting. It would encourage companies to enter into artificial arrangements to increase the tax credit. For those reasons and those that I gave earlier, I urge members of the Committee to oppose the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Now we are getting to the point. I am sure that the Minister is well aware that the example to which she referred is defined in annexe 2 to the new guidelines. We did not include it in the amendment precisely because of the cost. We have taken only the last two heads. As the Minister is aware, the item on land premises is an earlier one. At least we have an acknowledgement that the figure is wrong and that it is nothing like £100 million. The Minister shakes her head; perhaps she will look at annexe 2 to the new guidelines and say where the example that she just gave fits into our amendment?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I stick to the figure of £100 million. I was shaking my head at the hon. Gentleman's assertion that there was something wrong with the figure. The additional costs of heating, lighting, rent on property and so on account for the excess cost of £100 million. That is the basis on which we devised the figure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Our amendment does not say that. That is why the figure is deceptive and wrong. The Economic Secretary talks about the need to clarify. We adopted a set of EU guidelines that are meant to enhance prosperity, but as the Economic Secretary said earlier, she wants what works best for the British economy. I certainly agree with her about that. Why then did we have to go through, on the previous amendment, all that wah-wah about sterling-euro exchange rates? Our proposal on that is what is best for the British economy. The two amendments are completely inconsistent and it is ironic that they should sit alongside each other. The Minister has ably demonstrated that she can argue both sides of the case: for and against incorporating European guidelines. She can, as ever, sit on the fence. There is no point in continuing the argument. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendments.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the amendment is withdrawn, I point out that a technical lexicon is coming into the Committee that I find difficult to understand-``tosh'' and ``wah-wah'' are words that I have not come across. If we go down that route further, perhaps a definition of the words could be placed on the Table so that we all know what they mean.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 96, in page 403, line 34, after ``project;'' insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, except that, if the circumstances have been notified to and approved by the European Commission, then this sub-paragraph shall have effect as if, for the words ``if a notified State aid'' there were substituted ``to the extent that a notified State aid.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I bow to your clear ruling on parliamentary language, Mr. Clark.

<P>
The amendment is another probing amendment on the role of notified and non-notified state aid. If a research programme receives notified state aid, the expenditure met by the grant is disqualified from the R and D credit. Let us suppose that a company spends £1 million on R and D and receives a grant of £100,000. If the grant is not notified state aid, £900,000 of the expenditure could still qualify for the relief, but if it were notified state aid, none of the expenditure would qualify for the relief. Notified state aid therefore taints all expenditure on the same project. I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify the Government's thinking on that.

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I shall briefly outline my understanding of the amendment. It would provide that if the circumstances have been notified and approved by the Commission, R and D tax credits will be available, except in so far as R and D expenditure is met by the aid. It is not clear how that is intended to work, but it may not be appreciated that the Government would need to notify and obtain EC approval to the individual claim if R and D tax credits were to be combined with another source of funding that is a notified state aid. That would ensure that the claim is compatible with the EC rules for state aid and, in particular, does not exceed the permitted maximum aid. The amendment would therefore make it necessary for the Government to notify the Commission and obtain its approval for the claim as a notified state aid before ``a company''-the term is singular, for good reasons-could claim R and D tax credits for a project that benefits from other notified state aid. Each and every claim would have to be notified and approved individually, and the company and the Government would need to establish to the Commission's satisfaction that the total aid that would be given was acceptable.

<P>
That would obviously be costly, complex and time-consuming for both the Government and the company. At least several hundred claims might be made; it is not practical to ask for individual approvals for so many. The result would be a disproportionate administrative burden on business and the Government and even on the Commission. I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Croydon, South is aware of the difficulties that his amendment would create, but I hope that in the light of my remarks he will withdraw it.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We are back to our old friend administrative burdens. The matter is for companies to decide. I appreciate that the Economic Secretary is trying to protect the poor company-I use the singular, as did she-from administrative burdens, but are such somersaults necessary in order to do so? Although the notified state aid might be entirely unrelated to the rest of the R and D, the rest of the R and D will be disqualified. We are placing a hurdle in front of our own people who want R and D relief. Does the Economic Secretary understand my point? Why are we placing a hurdle in front of our own people?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> We believe that the amendment would place a hurdle in front of people. We do not believe that we are placing a hurdle. The extra bureaucracy to which I refer would be unnecessary without the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If that is so, all that I can say is that the Economic Secretary's reply is to be welcomed. Many people have a different interpretation of the implications of the paragraph from hers. I intend to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I should be grateful if she and her officials would double-check that point, because some anxiety has been expressed about it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page 405, line 11, leave out ``65%.'' and insert ``100%.''

<P>
This amendment relates to another technical point. Why, when R and D is subcontracted, will only 65
per cent. qualify for relief, while 100 per cent. will qualify when companies are responsible for their own R and D?

<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> The 65 per cent. threshold is a rough, rule-of-thumb measure of the part of the contract fee that relates to wages and consumable stores. It will keep down compliance costs and avoid forcing subcontractors to break commercial confidentiality and reveal details of their costs to contractors. Consultees thought that, on balance, it was pitched about right, but it was important to test it. It is one of several proposals on which we consulted fully before presenting them for consideration by the Committee. If it is out of kilter, and if the sub-contractor is content to provide the contractor with a breakdown of costs, the contractor and the subcontractor may elect to use the actual wage costs and consumable stores of the subcontractor instead.

<P>
We consulted on the various options available. A few people thought that the threshold was too low, and others thought that it was too high, but it seemed to be about in the middle. On that basis, we picked a figure that we believe will be practical for companies operating the system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for that helpful reply, but as a result of the threshold, few people will be likely to subcontract if by doing so they receive much less relief. It will, in effect, drive people into trying to do everything in-house rather than using the superior skills of outside subcontractors. Does she agree?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> No, I do not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps the Economic Secretary will say why not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps the Economic Secretary will say why not.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> R and D activities can be carried out in-house or subcontracted to a third party. Work might be subcontracted to a connected person-a definition that could include another company in the same group. Contracts with unconnected persons are commonly referred to as being at arm's length, and can generally be expected to be on genuine commercial terms. When R and D is conducted in-house, the R and D tax credit is given on the direct wage costs and the costs of consumable stores used. When it is contracted out, the tax credit goes to the contractor rather than the contractee.

<P>
If the contractor and the contractee are connected, the tax credits will be given on the direct wage costs and the costs of consumable stores of the contractee, who will need to provide details of those to the contractor. That ensures complete neutrality in respect of in-house R and D. It also avoids the manipulation that would be possible if the tax credit were based on the contract fee, which could easily be inflated to boost the tax credit. If the contractor and the contractee were not connected persons, the contractee might be unwilling to provide such details to the contractor. Therefore, the simple rule of thumb would come in at 65 per cent. of the contract fee.

<P>
The rules also allow a contractor and contractee to elect to use the same basis as for a connected person. In that case, the tax credit would be given on the direct wage costs and the costs of consumable stores of the contractee. That ensures complete neutrality for the in-house or connected person, and avoids any distortion from the 65 per cent. rule, providing that the contractee is willing to reveal details of its costs to the contractor. That is a commercial matter, and a judgment for those engaged in the individual contracts.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am obviously not going to receive answers to my questions, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Schedule 20 agreed to.

<P>
Schedule 21 agreed to.

<H4><center>Clause 69</center></H4>

<H4><center>First year allowances for small or medium-sized enterprises</center></H4>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause makes the 40 per cent. first-year allowances for small and medium-sized enterprises permanent, which is to be welcomed. It is fortunate that the Financial Secretary was in Committee a few minutes ago for our debate about the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises. The rules for this definition are totally different, as it is expressed in sterling. Can he not see the problems of hopping from the way of working out what small and medium-sized enterprises are for capital allowances purposes to the totally different definition for research and development purposes? That is bound to cause problems, and certainly does not reduce the administrative burdens to which the Economic Secretary has alluded.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> As the hon. Gentleman said, the clause makes the existing first-year allowances for small and medium-sized businesses buying machinery or plant from 2 July 2000 permanent. The allowances were introduced for a year by the Government in 1997 and subsequently extended. More than 99 per cent. of businesses in the United Kingdom will qualify for the enhanced allowances. The announcement has been widely welcomed. The British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers Federation both pressed for permanent first-year allowances in the run up to the Budget and the measure was especially welcomed by the Confederation of British Industry, which said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are very pleased to see the 40 per cent. first year capital allowances for SMEs have now been made permanent, a change we have recommended for several years. This will allow companies to make longer-term investment plans.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The CBI is absolutely right. It is a welcome move and particularly good news for small and medium-sized manufacturing businesses. I am sure that it is also welcomed by all members of the Committee.

<P>
I understand what the hon. Member for Croydon, South said about different definitions. We are using the Companies Act definition, which is well established and most appropriate. When dealing with EU state aids, we must be careful to couch the definitions in terms of what are appropriate in that context, but we have clearly used the correct one in the clause.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I hope that I shall not be out of order if I refer to capital allowances in so far as they affect the shipbuilding industry. The Minister will recall that, in 1997, the then Conservative Government introduced long-life and a short-life allowances. Short-life assets qualified for 25 per cent. per year capital allowances on a reducing balance basis and long-life assets qualified for 4 per cent. per year capital allowances, again on a reducing balance basis.

<P>
I wish to declare a constituency interest, Dr. Clark, because I have a shipyard in my constituency. However, my point is relevant to all shipyards in the country. To assist the shipbuilding industry, ships were deemed to be short-life assets and qualified for the more generous capital allowances regime. Unfortunately, at present there is a dearth of shipbuilding orders and life for British and other shipyards is difficult, especially in the merchant marine sector.

<P>
Unfortunately maritime structures such as drill ships and floating production, storage and offtake vessels-FPSOs-are still treated by the Inland Revenue as long-life assets. They therefore qualify only for the less generous capital allowances. It would help the British shipbuilding industry and its financiers to treat those vessels in the same way as ships-in other words, let them have the benefit of a more generous capital allowances system. That is especially important for shipping companies now, when orders are hard to come by. I tabled an amendment to that effect when the 1998 Finance Bill was discussed on Report. Considerable sympathy was felt for it throughout the House and I hope that the Minister will consider it now and let the Committee have his views.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> In the absence of an amendment on the subject, I have not considered it very closely. Long-life assets are excluded because they qualify for a lower rate of writing-down allowance, of 6 per cent. a year. However, the practical effect of that is limited, as the special rate for long-life assets does not normally apply to smaller businesses. I am not clear about the circumstances in which the hon. Gentleman feels that that would be helpful.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to you, Dr. Clark, but also to the Financial Secretary for addressing the point, because it does not strictly relate to the amendment. I would like the Financial Secretary to assure the Committee that he will at least reconsider-

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman, because I try to be helpful, that we are discussing a clause and not an amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Financial Secretary consider the matter, which was considered in 1998, bearing in mind the difficulties facing shipbuilders? Other businesses require capital allowances and relief-especially shipyards. There is great support throughout the House for the change.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will write to me, setting out the case for the changes that he proposes.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 69 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>

<H4><center>First year allowances for small or medium-sized enterprises</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 48, line 1, leave out ``small enterprise'' and insert ``small or medium-sized enterprise''.

<P>
This is a probing amendment, which queries why the 100 per cent. capital allowance is restricted to small enterprises alone. Yet again, we are hopping around in search of a definition of what is available to whom. The allowance is given in sterling, but only to small enterprises. There is some merit in making 100 per cent. available to small enterprises and 40 per cent. to small and medium-sized enterprises, but it begs the question why only 40 per cent. is given to medium-sized enterprises. As I speak, I find the answer to my own question: the 100 per cent. allowance relates to high-tech equipment, whereas the 40 per cent. relates to non high-tech equipment.

<P>
However, the Financial Secretary might explain why the measure is limited to small enterprises. The turnover for a small business is limited to £2.8 million, assets to £1.4 million and employees to fewer than 50. The hon. Member for somewhere in Devon-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Torridge and West Devon.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon mentioned shipbuilding. I should not think that many ship builders would fall into the definition of a medium enterprise under the previous clause, and they would certainly not fall into the definition in this one. Will the Financial Secretary explain why the capital allowances are so tightly defined?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clause 70 allows small businesses to claim 100 per cent. first-year allowances on their investment in information and communications technology, including computers. That is an important initiative that reflects the Government's commitment to making the United Kingdom the best environment in the world for e-commerce, and marks a significant step towards that goal.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has asked to explain why the measure is targeted on small businesses. It is because they show much greater under-investment in new technologies such as the internet and e-commerce, and require the greatest encouragement to exploit those opportunities. That was vividly shown in a report published by the performance and innovation unit, entitled ``ecommerce@its.best.uk'', which was published last September. It contains some interesting figures in relation to businesses of different sizes. Of UK companies that employ more than 100 people, the percentage that have a website or make frequent use of electronic data interchange or external e-mail compares well with the percentage elsewhere in the world. However, the proportion of small companies-those with 10 to 99 employees, and especially those with one to nine employees-which engage in e-commerce is significantly less in the UK than elsewhere in the European Union and other advanced countries. Fifteen per cent. of UK companies of one to nine employees have their own website, make use of electronic data interchange or external e-mail, compared with 42 per cent. in the United States, 28 per cent. in Canada, 32 per cent. in Japan and 28 per cent. in Germany. The UK has therefore lagged behind in terms of its smallest companies. That is why we have focused extra help, through 100 per cent. allowances, precisely on those companies.

<P>
Extending 100 per cent. first-year allowances to medium-sized businesses, as suggested in the amendment-which I accept is probing-would not offer good value for money. Of course, those firms will still be able to claim first-year allowances at 40 per cent. on their investments under the existing rules for SMEs, which will be made permanent by clause 69.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for that explanation, which seems perfectly rational. He dwelled briefly on companies that employ 10 to 99 people; however, the definition of a small enterprise is one with 50 employees. There is demand for such equipment in companies that are above that fairly low ceiling.

<P>
We tabled the amendment because the internet revolution is being driven by medium-sized businesses, and start-ups quickly exceed the given thresholds. As the Financial Secretary will know, the growth in turnover of such companies is explosive. No sooner have they qualified than they exceed the threshold-sometimes in a matter of months. The answer might be to reconsider the definition of a small enterprise in relation to high-tech companies. There may be-perish the phrase-a middle way between the small and medium-sized enterprise definition.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I emphasise that the data shows that the biggest problem is with the smallest companies-those with fewer than nine employees. There is also a problem with companies that employ 10 to 50 people, so it is appropriate to make the allowances available to all companies with up to 50 employees. However, it is in relation to the smallest companies that we are at the greatest disadvantage compared with other parts of the EU, the USA, Canada and Japan.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for that reply. Will he answer one final question, for which, I am sure, all Committee members have been waiting? Do Members of Parliament come within his definition of a small enterprise? Do we therefore qualify for the 100 per cent. allowances? I would be interested to have that on the record.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Am I intervening on the hon. Member for Croydon, South?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No, you are making a speech.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Thank you, Dr. Clark.

<P>
On the question of Members of Parliament, perhaps I might issue a cri de coeur in relation to capital allowances, small businesses and those who are known as office holders. Members of Parliament are not unique in that respect, because the category of office holders includes judges. When a change is made to the capital allowances regime, it would help if the Inland Revenue made it clear in its press releases and so on whether the reliefs announced for businesses are to be available to office holders.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am happy to answer the issue raised by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Torridge and West Devon. The allowances are available to office holders in general, and to Members of Parliament in particular.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I was aware of that fact, but the Budget speech is followed by a series of press releases and announcements in which, invariably, the position of office holders in relation to capital allowances is left unsaid. I hope that, in future years, their position can be made clear in such announcements.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can tell the hon. Gentleman that there is a high degree of awareness of such matters in the Tea Room not long after the Chancellor's announcement, but we shall certainly consider the way in which such matters are covered in future press releases.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We are grateful for the Minister's response. It is useful to have in black and white details of what has been said in the Tea Room. On that high note, I shall cut my losses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 48, line 11, after ``computers'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, including components of computers such as memory chips,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 145, in page 48, line 18, at end insert `or,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) between a computer and a peripheral device.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 146, in page 48, line 27, leave out ``third generation''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The three amendments probe the Government about what is, and is not, included in expenditure. Will the Minister confirm whether the clause extends the allowances to computer components, such as memory chips? Amendment
No. 145 refers to the cabling
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>between a computer and a peripheral device<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and was recommended by the Institute of Directors. I should clarify that amendment No. 144 was recommended by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

<P>
Amendment No. 146 would extend 100 per cent. capital allowances to purchases of all mobile telephones, rather than only third-generation mobile telephones. The Minister may say that the amendment would add up to a phenomenal sum of money, bearing in mind the recent auction for third-generation telephones, but the amendment relates to first and second-generation telephones, so perhaps it would not involve such a great sum. I look forward to hearing the Minister's thinking on why only third-generation mobile telephones have been included.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I support amendments Nos. 144, 145 and 146. Given certain examples in my constituency, it is important that such issues are clarified either by the Government tabling an amendment to the Bill, or by the Minister giving the Committee an assurance.

<P>
Three successful firms in my constituency are well placed to assist small firms that want to exploit the new allowances as the Government intend. On the Chessington business park, off the Jubilee way in Hook Rise South in my constituency, two large firms, Ideal and Northamber, are involved in the distribution and marketing of computer components. They are high up the supply chain and distribute in the main to large retail chains and businesses. I must emphasise that they do not sell computers, which those who exploit allowances might want to purchase. They basically market components. EquaNet, another firm in my constituency, based at the Red Lion Road business centre in Tolworth, is further down the supply chain and sells directly to small businesses and to business wholesalers. It has won awards for its exports and is extremely well thought of in the sector. All those companies have great expertise and good links to the world's major suppliers of IT components and are therefore well placed to assist UK firms in upgrading their IT equipment.

<P>
The amendments raise an important issue. In considering their tax position, such firms, and their customers, need clarity. Although I do not pretend to be a computer expert, my reading is that the provision is not set out as clearly as it could be in proposed new subsections (3G)A, B and C. The Government want to include almost all types of computer hardware, particularly in proposed new paragraph A(a); the question is whether they successfully do so. It is not clear whether the computer components referred to in amendment No. 144 are included. It is not just a question of memory chips, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, but of processors, cache pipes and other such intricate components. There is confusion about whether external hardware components would attract the allowance. Would a monitor screen count as a computer peripheral, for example, as defined in proposed new subsection (3G)A(b), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>peripheral devices designed to be used by being connected to or inserted in a computer?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nowadays, many peripheral devices communicate with computers by infra-red technology and other wireless technologies. Under the proposed new paragraph, they would not attract those allowances, yet such IT components and pieces of hardware are at the cutting edge of technology-in which the Government presumably want small companies to invest.

<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I may be ignorant of the detailed tax legislation that lies behind the clause, but it is not clear to me, as a layman, whether a fax machine linked to a computer counts as a peripheral device. Does a palmtop computer or an electronic organiser count as a computer. I hope that the Financial Secretary can assist the Committee and those reading the report of our proceedings by giving greater clarification of those points.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I wonder whether it would aid clarification if the Financial Secretary told us what the Inland Revenue defines as a computer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I can give hon. Members the assurances that they seek on amendments Nos. 144 and 145. Computer components, connections between computer peripherals and computers can qualify for the 100 per cent. first-year allowances under the clause. That is particularly clear in the case of cabling, as is made clear in proposed new paragraph (c). There is a general rule, which will apply in this case, that any reference to a machine includes any part of that machine. Members of the Committee can be reassured that the clause meets their concerns.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde asked what a computer is. The term ``computer'' is used, like other terms in the Bill, in the normal sense. I can give the assurance that Psion and equivalent palmtops are included-[
Interruption.]-indeed, the term includes everything from large mainframes, if people are still buying those, to personal computers, laptops and palmtops.

<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) asked about fax machines. Fax peripherals, or copiers, which are purchased to be used as a peripheral to a computer will qualify, but a stand-alone fax machine will not. The term ``connected'' would certainly include devices connected by infra-red technology.

<P>
I hope that we have covered everything. It is a generous and important allowance.

Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Amendment No. 146 suggests that the 100 per cent. allowance be extended to all types of mobile telephone. That would work against the object of the clause. The amendment would extend the allowances to older types of mobile phones with limited or, in most cases, no internet capability. Therefore, they could not be described as helping businesses to get on-line or to take advantage of the opportunities offered by e-commerce.

<P>
The clause is about promoting the e-commerce capability of UK small firms on the basis of the data that we talked about earlier, which show that they have a problem with the extent of their e-commerce access. That is why we are tightly focused on e-commerce, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said. We need to encourage third-generation technology if we are to extend e-commerce access through mobile phones. To give the allowances for other types of equipment would discourage the technology that will help us be equipped for the e-commerce era. Again, the 40 per cent. first-year allowances that clause 69 made permanent will cover other types of mobile phone. I recommend that the Committee does not adopt the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful for the Financial Secretary's response on amendments Nos. 144 and 145. Our thinking behind amendment No. 146 was our old friend the administrative burden. Vendors of telephones will now have to distinguish between third-generation and non-third-generation phones. We wanted to help the Government achieve one of their objectives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I challenge the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the provision will impose a burden. It is clear that what constitutes third-generation equipment is internet-enabled and WAP-wireless application protocol-phones. We want people to take advantage of such equipment. I do not agree that a significant burden is being imposed by targeting help on that particular type of equipment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Financial Secretary and I differ, but whichever one of us is right, the vast majority of sales will involve third generation phones. It is not a major point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I realise that I have made a mistake. I suggested a moment ago that WAP phones count as third generation equipment. They do not.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> What phones?

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> WAP-wireless application protocol-phones, which are now on sale. They do not count for this purpose. We want to encourage equipment that can access the new services that will follow the recent spectrum auction. I apologise for having inadvertently misled the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I had not realised that I was misled. My notes tell me that the provision applies to WAP phones.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Oh, I am sorry. We have had a slight breakdown in communication. Indeed, it does.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I had no intention of intervening, and declare the usual interest. If the provision applies to WAP phones, it should not. WAP phones are not in any proper sense internet-enabled, although the universal mobile telephone service 3-G phones will be. The Financial Secretary's instinct was right in overriding the text. All WAP phones-[
Interruption.] We are doubly embarrassed if my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South is saying that our amendment suggests that WAP phones should be included. We were wrong, the Financial Secretary is wrong, and the Bill is wrong. As everyone is wrong, we should find someone who will give the right speech.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that someone might be withdrawing the amendment. Is that a possibility?

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> To end the confusion of a moment ago, in which I participated, the clause refers separately, in proposed new subsection (3G)B(a), to WAP phones, as well as to third generation mobile phones, which will be used with the new services. Both are explicitly covered separately in the clause.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Financial Secretary confirm that the clause abolishes the distinction between cars that cost more or less than £12,000? As he will know, a different tax treatment applies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The clause abolishes the requirement to put expenditure on cars that cost less than £12,000 into a separate pool for the purposes of calculating capital allowances. It simplifies and deregulates the capital allowance system. I believe that that is the information that the hon. Gentleman wanted.

</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I wish to declare an interest as a lawyer who has specialised in shipping for the past 25 years and as a consultant for Davenport Taylor Sidhu, which currently has no shipping clients who are seeking advice on tonnage tax. We are not broadly in opposition to the introduction of the tonnage tax. We are entering into a unique situation in finance law. There is no obvious problem with shipping, nor is there a shortage of ships to deliver cars or bananas to the United Kingdom. We do not have an obvious and overt problem that needs to be rectified.

<P>
However, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions stated that, on balance, there might be a problem some time in the future and, as a result, we are introducing this tax. That is why the tax is unique. Most proposals that are considered by the Finance Committees relate to problems that have arisen or will arise rather than matters that are regarded as being on balance. We all recognise the right hon. Gentleman's emotional commitment to British shipping and, if he can persuade the Cabinet and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to go down that road, the Conservative party will not stand in his way.

<P>
Clearly, a big battle has taken place about the matter within the Government, because it is an unprecedented and serious development in finance law. As long ago as 1998, the Deputy Prime Minister's paper, ``British Shipping-Charting a new course'' stated that the Government would discuss fiscal options with the shipping industry in the context of the pre-Budget consultation, without any commitment on implementation. Well, the 1999 Budget did not advance matters very much and we had to wait until the year 2000. It should come as no surprise that the Transport Select Committee, which is, after all, dominated by members of the Labour party, criticised the fact that the Treasury was not ready for tonnage tax, and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One ``national issue'' is concern about the tax avoidance, since companies might seek to exploit the lower rate. Clearly such a situation would be unacceptable, but we do not believe that the Treasury would find any particular difficulty in framing such a tax, and we believe that the Treasury should have been ready at the time of the Budget to put forward proper proposals. It evidently was unable to do so: nor was it able to assist us in our inquiry. One of the reasons it was unprepared was the fact that neither the Treasury nor the Inland Revenue participated in the Shipping Working Group, which, given the subjects discussed in the Group, we find extraordinary. We regard the fact that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue did not participate in the Shipping Working Group deplorable, and believe that their failure to do so has unnecessarily delayed the proper consideration of the tonnage tax. We also believe that the evidence given to us by the Treasury was ill-prepared and inadequate.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
One would be hard-pushed to hear stronger language than that from a Select Committee about a Department. It was heavy language indeed, and the least that the Minister can do is to explain why there has been a delay. Will she confirm that there has been a difference of opinion between the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister on such a radical and exceptional problem?

<P>
I said at the outset that there was no inherent problem, but there might be one in the future, about which the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is worried. The problem is manpower. The British maritime industry, especially maritime London, requires a substantial number of mariners to fill the jobs. Anxiety exists that mariners are ageing, that insufficient numbers of British cadets are entering the profession, and, that slowly but surely, mariners who have the necessary expertise will begin to retire and manpower levels will fall. If that is the problem, we are considering a unique job training scheme. If the Government believe that that is the only way to achieve the objective, the Conservative party will not stand in its way. We will debate the proposals constructively.

<P>
The important thing to remember is that the tonnage tax-the short name for tonnage-based corporation tax-will be unrelated to profits or losses. In a nutshell, a ship's carrying capacity is the basis of a formula that assumes a very low profit. The figure is £2,000 for every 1,000 tonnes of deadweight or net registered tonnage. It applies regardless of whether there are profits or losses. Clearly, such a favourable tax regime is the inherent attraction for shipowners who are currently offshore, and who may be attracted back to these shores. The quid pro quo is that they must take on a number of trainees under a minimum training requirement.

<P>
The interesting aspect of the proposal is that it is flagblind. We have tabled an amendment on the matter, on which I shall not dwell now. Although, the proposal has been described as a measure to help British shipping, it is available to any shipping company. Paragraph 17 of the Alexander report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is also important to note that the target of the proposed new fiscal regime is, in the first instance, to increase the direct ownership of shipping by companies within the UK.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
However, one cannot have a rational debate on the subject without acknowledging that it ranges more widely. Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, who is a former chairman of NatWest Bank, was asked by the Deputy Prime Minister to consider the feasibility of introducing a tonnage tax regime. He is a much respected figure in the City and in legal circles, and we welcome his report and its contents. Interestingly, the Inland Revenue estimates that the average effective tax for British shipping is currently 1.5 per cent., compared with 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. for other industries. It is therefore even more remarkable that a completely new tax has been introduced when shipowners are finding the current effective rate of 1.5 per cent. onerous.

<P>
In a press release of 23 December, which is when the draft legislation was published, the Paymaster General said that one of its purposes was to prevent ``a tax avoidance bonanza''. Who am I to quarrel with that effort? However, with a current effective rate of only 1.5 per cent., I am not sure what sort of bonanza she has in mind. Perhaps the Government are trying to squeak the rate under the 1 per cent. barrier.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): Does my hon. Friend know what tax yield in pounds is represented by 1.5 per cent. of shipping profits? What would be the potential tax avoidance bonanza if the shipping industry's entire tax revenue were lost? He may well not know the answer to those questions, because they are not to be found in any of the Budget figures that I have read.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am sure that the Paymaster General will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that it is in the region of £20 million. That is less than an accounting adjustment, and not in fact a significant sum of money.

<P>
In paragraph 27 of the report, Lord Alexander of Weedon describes the tonnage taxes. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mechanism seems to be an ingenious device for obtaining virtual tax exemption compatible with international tax treaty obligations. It departs from normal corporation tax principles of taxing actual profits to introduce a notional basis which bears no relationship to actual profits earned.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have a very low effective rate of tax that will be replaced with a virtual tax-exempt regime.

<P>
I wonder whether the Paymaster General could deal with a point that is raised in paragraph 44 of Lord Alexander's report. It describes the EU code of conduct committee, of which, according to Lord Alexander, the Paymaster General is chair. That committee was invited to consider whether the proposed tonnage tax regimes in this country, Greece and two other countries were in breach of the EU code of conduct, or harmful according to the code's criteria. Lord Alexander said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It could be argued that this country should defer introducing a tonnage tax regime until it is known what the Group will advise.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that the report was published in the summer of last year, the Paymaster General may have reached a conclusion on that point.

<P>
My second point is about the central fund for training schemes. There is a minimum training requirement for any company that enters the tonnage tax regime, and we have seen the relevant draft regulation. By and large, the number of cadets hired must be in proportion to the number of officers that are currently retained, but one can opt to pay money into a central fund, rather than adhere to the minimum training requirement. What use will be made of that fund? Will it be used to set up a Government-funded training scheme?

<P>
My third point relates to capital allowances. The Paymaster General will know that Lord Alexander actively considered the abolition of the capital allowance regime for the shipping industry if a tonnage tax regime were to be introduced. If such a generous regime is to be introduced, the argument for altering the position of capital allowances is quite strong. Capital allowances are permitted for companies leasing vessels into the tonnage tax regime. What is more, the allowances are higher than those that Lord Alexander considered likely, were the Government to go down that road. Can the Paymaster General explain why they are so generous, and what such a regime is expected to achieve?

<P>
How many vessels does the Paymaster General think will return to the British flag? Lord Sterling, the chairman of P&O, has said that it will bring back up to 50 vessels, but will she confirm that those vessels are already managed in the United Kingdom and probably sailing under a UK dependency flag, and that the only visible difference will be that the little logo on the red ensign indicating Cayman islands, Bermuda or wherever it may be, will be removed?

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
We welcome the announcement by P&O that it will nearly double the number of cadets that it hires. There are 170 in training and P&O says that it will introduce 310. That is still a relatively small number, considering the number of ships that it has. None the less, it is an important development and part of the main thrust of this radical scheme.

<P>
Does the Paymaster General accept that in paragraph 74 Lord Alexander of Weedon said that it was impossible to be certain what percentage of the industry would opt to enter the tonnage tax? Again that was a year ago. Does she have further evidence about what is likely to happen and whether we can be more certain? Can she give us her views on the way in which the immigration laws will apply to foreign vessels coming under the tonnage tax regime? An important point is whether there will be any waiver of the immigration rules, although a substantial number of vessels will possibly now sail under a British flag, which, as she knows, invokes British jurisdiction. Finally, can she say whether the minimum wage will apply to foreign vessels coming into the tonnage tax regime and, if so, what effect she thinks it will have?

<P>
In conclusion, this provision is an important development. We treat it very seriously and we wish it well.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, Lord Alexander's committee pointed out in its report that the current effective rate of corporation tax paid by shipping companies is not high. The Inland Revenue estimates that the average rate of corporation tax is 1.5 per cent. of their profits, largely because of the effects of the capital allowances system. The proposed tonnage tax is an even more benign system. Some unkind souls may wonder whether that is possible. I should warn the Government that other industries will look with envy on this precedent.

<P>
We understand the importance of at least trying to re-establish the merchant marine in this country. The tax system is one means of doing so. Shipping is very important for this country and a benign tax system, including capital allowances, will encourage shipowners to run their businesses from this country. UK shipowners are more likely to give our shipyards opportunities to tender for the construction of new ships if they are located in this country. As I said in an earlier intervention, Appledore in my constituency is an outstanding and world-renowned shipyard. It is one of only two remaining medium-sized shipyards in Great Britain and the only one with a covered yard. It employs about 600 individuals directly and at least 400 indirectly. Appledore has tendered to the Ministry of Defence for two new alternative landing ships logistics, or ALSLs. Those contracts are vital to it, because there is a worldwide dearth of contracts for merchant shipping. I hope that the tonnage tax will encourage shipping companies to run their affairs from the United Kingdom, thus helping the British shipbuilding industry.

<P>
Will the Paymaster General assist the shipping industry, its financiers and the Committee by explaining the impact of the capital allowances and balancing charges regimes as they relate to tonnage tax companies? Will she also tell me whether the tonnage tax will count as corporation tax for the purposes of the double tax treaties with most of our important trading partners?

<P>
Re-establishing shipping companies in the UK is of great importance. That is true in relation not only to shipyards, but to employment-we have the finest seafarers in the world, as well as the finest shipyards-defence, finance, banking, insurance and other City organisations such as the Baltic exchange. I hope that the tonnage tax is successful in re-establishing the British Merchant Navy. There can be few more environmentally benign methods of moving goods round the world than by well-constructed ships crewed by high-calibre seamen.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): Perhaps I should begin by saying that I-probably unlike any other member of the Committee-was once a member of the British Merchant Navy. I served as a supernumerary officer cadet on the Clan line. My time there was short in duration but rich in experience, and I commend it to anyone who is offered a similar opportunity. Although the experience left me with a fondness for the Merchant Navy, I gasp in wonder at its success in persuading the Government to take on board a tax regime that is unique in the UK and is based on principles that are flatly contradicted by later schedules to the Bill. Before the clause is allowed to pass, Ministers must tell us how they can support this regime for the British shipping industry and then do a 180-degree reversal to take a diametrically opposed point of view in respect of other major British businesses-as we shall see when we reach schedules 30 and 31.

<P>
I am grateful to the Chartered Institute of Taxation for its comments on the clause and the schedule. It criticises the Government for introducing the regime
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>without proper consultation outside of the industry itself.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps if the Government had consulted more widely, they would have realised that the underlying principles of their new regime for shipping apply equally to many other aspects of the UK economy. The report of the Chartered Institute of Taxation mentions the Alexander report, which was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it seems to advocate that the government should abandon all the normal rules and principles in order to give a particular, and rather narrowly based, business sector a favourable tax regime.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that user-friendly regime is justified for shipping, why will other provisions, which we shall discuss later, take away such a regime from other major multinational companies in this country?

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman's argument. Is he criticising the Government for being helpful to the shipping industry or for not being equally helpful, at an appropriate cost to the taxpayer, to other industries-or is he simply making a rhetorical point?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am sure that you would call me to order, Dr. Clark, if I were simply making a rhetorical point. I am attacking the gross inconsistency of the Government's position. If gross inconsistencies enter into our tax system, we will have taxation by favours-a tax system that was run by the early monarchs and that one would not expect to find in a modern economy. Our tax system should be run on consistent principles and apply to this country's citizens and to the companies that they set up, regardless of the legitimate areas in which they do business. There is much to be said for the tonnage tax-we should recognise the international competition, in tax terms, and the situation in which the shipping industry has to survive. If such arguments are relevant to the shipping industry, why do the Government refuse to recognise their relevance to later schedules, and in particular to schedules 30 and 31?

<P>
The Chartered Institute of Taxation report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is difficult to see how<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the regime could be endorsed by the Government, who have set their face against ``harmful tax competition''. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If ``uncompetitive'' is used in the sense of competing tax regimes, then the Alexander report runs head on into the issue of harmful tax competition. By implication, the report is suggesting that the issue can be ignored.<P>

By accepting the report's relevance to the clause and the schedule, the Government are saying that in this case they will ignore the issue of harmful tax competition, although they are concerned about it in relation to other provisions. Before we agree to the clause, the Government should explain why they think that it is appropriate for one regime to apply to shipping and for the diametrically opposed regime to apply to other sectors.

<P>
I represent a constituency that does not have many shipping interests but has many thriving companies that evolved in the new economy and in the world of e-commerce and computer games. The computer games sector is growing and has a turnover of more than £10 billion a year. It has as much, if not more, potential than the shipping industry. Like the shipping industry, those businesses exist in a world of intense tax competition. Computer games that are sold outside the European or mainstream tax jurisdictions can be downloaded by people and bought off the net. Businesses that are based outside the United Kingdom will face low tax regimes, but those that are based in the UK will face the imposition of the full panoply of corporation tax and value added tax on the services that they sell.

<P>
When that development takes place-it is widely predicted that it will-will the Government adopt the same pliant approach towards the computer games industry in this country as the clause adopts towards the shipping industry? Businesses in this country need to know whether that approach applies only to shipping-if so, why?-or whether the Government would be prepared to extend it to other sectors that face intense tax competition.
 
<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> Has the hon. Gentleman estimated the total cost to the Treasury of his proposed programme of introducing the equivalent to a tonnage tax in other sectors? I sympathise with his view on computer games, as a former editor of a computer games magazine. However, we all have different areas of expertise. Has he assessed the impact of his programme as a whole?

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I have assessed the impact. Hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs and valuable businesses will leave the country if we create hostile tax regimes under which they cannot survive. That is why we are debating this clause. A hostile tax regime for British shipping will drive it to other centres. A hostile tax regime for other businesses will mean that those businesses will not remain here. This is not a question of how much tax the Exchequer can take. It will lose the tax because the businesses simply will not be based here.

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall give the hon. Gentleman another example. We shall consider the example of the double taxation clauses under schedule 30. It is now widely accepted that those clauses will be tax neutral not because they do not bite on existing businesses but because so many existing and prospective businesses will simply move out of the country. The Treasury will be destroying the tax base.

<P>
In the instance of the shipping industry, and of the clause, the Treasury seems to be alert to the danger of destroying the tax base by driving business away. Will it be equally alert to the danger of destroying the tax base when we consider schedules 30 and 31, and when virtual businesses such as those dealing in computer games find themselves operating in a new, highly competitive, international taxation environment?

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): May I request that the Committee adjourn for an hour for dinner, resuming at 8 o'clock?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> May I make a counter-suggestion, Mr. Allen? I was going to propose that we break for dinner at either 
<P>
<H5>7.15 pm</h5>
 or at the end of our debate on clause 81, whichever is the sooner.
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Allen:</B> I think that that is very sensible, and I hope that by 7.15 the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) will have concluded his remarks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> We are agreed that we shall break for dinner at 7.15, or at the end of this debate, whichever is the sooner.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I thank you, Dr. Clark, for extending the time available so that my train of thought will not be interrupted too much by the Government Whip.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that other right hon. and hon. Members want to speak on clause 81, so he does not have the full 14 minutes to himself.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I would not presume as much, Dr. Clark, and I also look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
I would like to raise one other small point. What will happen to the deferred tax provisions on the shipping company accounts? I understand that, under the proposed changes in the accountancy rules, these would have to be made more prominent in the shipping accounts. If they make a 10-year election under the provisions of the schedule, is the Chartered Institute of Taxation right to presume that provisions for deferred taxation will simply disappear from the accounts?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I have a great deal of sympathy with the comments of my hon. Friend, and I want to enlarge on them, if I may. He is right to say that it sits ill in the mouths of Conservative Members to argue the case for a higher tax burden, when the whole burden of our argument on a wide range of tax measures is to look for ways of reducing the tax burden, especially for internationally mobile businesses.

<P>
My hon. Friend is right to point out the contrast between his tonnage tax proposal-which is designed, apparently, to encourage shipping businesses to locate their head office functions in the United Kingdom-and the Government's proposals on dividend tax. One must assume, because the result of the dividend tax proposals will be to encourage companies to locate their headquarters outside the United Kingdom, that that is also the intention behind them. My hon. Friend is on to an important point when he contrasts the effect of this measure with the effect of others later in the Bill.

<P>
When the Paymaster General responds to the debate, will she be specific about the underlying policy purpose of the tonnage tax? I am not against the proposal, but the Committee and, more importantly, people outside, must be clear about what is likely to be delivered as a consequence of the changes that it will introduce.

<P>
The conventional argument for reducing the tax burden on the shipping industry-which I heard in my former capacity as Financial Secretary, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde-stresses the opportunity for attracting shipping businesses here to create jobs in the shipbuilding industry. That was mentioned by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. The other argument that was most frequently employed was that it would create jobs for British seafarers.

<P>
The problem with the tonnage tax proposal is that, for a series of good reasons, the Government are unable to link it to the delivery of either of those policy objectives. In the schedule, the proposal is linked to two concepts: first, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford pointed out, the location of strategic and commercial management of ships in the United Kingdom and, secondly, a very vague and undesirably broad power-in the hands, presumably, of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment-to make regulations defining a training obligation. That broad drafting would empower the Secretary of State to decide which companies fell within or outside the tonnage proposals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> As my right hon. Friend develops his interesting point, would he agree that the proposal sets an important precedent by linking a behavioural requirement of a United Kingdom company to the receipt of a tax benefit?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My right hon. Friend is right. The training paragraphs contain no reference to the market value of the training that is given, but simply delegate a power to the Secretary of State to define a set of training obligations that are required to qualify for tonnage tax treatment.

<P>
My key point is that the arguments for the shipping industry have always been linked to the creation of jobs for British seafarers and of demand for British shipyards. The tonnage tax proposals are seriously objectionable: in effect, a rewriting into British tax law of the old Navigation Acts, which would introduce into the shipping industry the principle of protection for the jobs of British seafarers and the commercial activities of British shipyards. The Government are, rightly prevented by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development obligations from putting into effect either of the two principal policy objectives that motivate most of the people who argue in favour of tax concessions for the shipping industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My right hon. Friend may not be aware that the minimum training requirement is not confined to British seafarers. It is entirely possible to meet the requirement by deploying European Union nationals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend must be right, because otherwise the proposal would contravene not only OEDC but treaty of Rome obligations.

<P>
I seek from the Paymaster General a clearly worded statement of the policy objective of the tonnage tax. It seems to me that the Government's only policy objective in respect of these 40 pages of tax legislation for £20 million-at £500,000 a page it must be one of the more expensive pieces of drafting in the tax code-is to attract the management of ships to the United Kingdom. That is not a disagreeable policy objective, but it is a limited one. It is interesting to note that the Paymaster General has devoted a substantial chunk of the Bill to delivering that objective for shipping management, while introducing legislation that will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said, say goodbye to the activities of multi-billion pound companies.

<P>
Like anyone with a sense of history who understands where this country's interest lie, I am a strong supporter of the British shipping industry. However, and with due respect to it, it is a relatively minor contributor to the British economy, compared with the multi-million pound companies to which the Government are apparently prepared to say goodbye through their dividend proposals, which we shall consider in due course.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, Mr. Ottaway. You have a prettier face than back.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is what my mother used to say.

<P>
My right hon Friend referred to the desire to attract strategically and commercially managed vessels back to the United Kingdom, but he may not be aware that most P&O vessels that are returning are already managed in the United Kingdom-it is simply their flag that is offshore. There is nothing new, other than the colour of the flag.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> And of course the changing of the flag, as my hon. Friend will know, requires no more than minimal changes in respect of the country of origin of those who work on the ships. It will not create jobs for British seafarers or work in British shipyards, as is often claimed for such tax concessions. I am simply asking the Paymaster General to make an explicit statement confirming that this tax proposal will not deliver jobs for British seafarers or work for British shipyards, for the very good reason that the Government's international obligations under the treaty of Rome and the OECD will prevent them-in my view, rightly-from intervening to deliver those objectives.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I just want to ask the Paymaster General whether she can throw some light on the formulation of paragraph 54 of the schedule. The explanatory notes state that in the context of the legislation, paragraph 54 will establish that a controlled foreign company
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is deemed to be resident in the UK for the purposes of computing chargeable profits.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This formulation will, in effect, bring onshore a controlled foreign company. Why is that deemed to be a good idea in this context, given the proposals that the Government espouse, as we shall see, in later clauses that deal with controlled foreign companies?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that it might be convenient for Committee members if we were to break for dinner now, rather than interrupt the Paymaster General after only 90 seconds. We have a lot of work still to do, so I shall suspend the Committee until 
<P>
<H5>8.15 pm.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<H5>7.13 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Sitting suspended.
