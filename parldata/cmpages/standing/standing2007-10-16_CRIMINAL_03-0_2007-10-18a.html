								Graham
Robb:

						</i> We broadly welcome the Bill. The starting point
for the Youth Justice Board is that you look at the whole child.
Children have multiple needs and it looks as though the generic order
allows courts to deal with those multiple needs, as long as it is based
adequately on clear identification through the assessment routine that
youth offending teams use, and as long as the pre-sentence report
guidance from youth offending teams to sentencers is sufficiently
robust and clearly required by the Bill. We are broadly content that
the Bill provides opportunities to meet the needs of youngsters in a
more flexible
way.</div>

								Graham
Robb:

						</i> Our assessment is that it looks as though there
will be a modest reduction, but that takes into account the provisions
in the Bill for other developments in the criminal justice
field&#151;policing strategy and so on. It looks as though there will
be a modest reduction in the under-18 numbers. That will depend on, for
example, the way in which local authorities take up the intensive
fostering opportunities and the other alternatives to custody, but a
key element in that take-up will be the funding that is available at
the local
level.</div>

							<a name="07101825000280"></a>Mr.
Garnier:
						</b> While we are on the matter of intensive
fostering, you will notice that the schedule dealing with the
availability of these answers to the cases that will be imposed upon
youth courts states that such solutions will not happen unless the
Secretary of State certifies that a particular resource is available.
This may look nice on paper, but how do you anticipate it working in
practice?</div>

						</i> On intensive fostering, a lot of local
authorities are interested in intensive fostering and they may make a
local decision that that is the route that they want to take. We have
been supporting a pilot on intensive fostering for three years, and the
early results are encouraging in terms of the reducing re-offending

something for the Children&#146;s Society to deal with, is that we
already know that 27 per cent. of people currently in custody, both
adults and young offenders, have been through the care system. I am
concerned that compulsory fostering, which some have described as the
nationalisation of children, could amount to a further catalyst towards
keeping people within the criminal justice system and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>instead of getting them out of trouble, persuading them to stay in
trouble. Is that a fear that we need to concern ourselves with or is it

						</i> Are we confident that the Bill will lead
to a decrease in custody, leading to the intensive nature of
intervention? We want to stress to the Committee that we must look at
the Bill in the context of the current political opportunity, in which
there is joint accountability for youth justice by the Department for
Children, Schools and Families and the Ministry of Justice. For that
opportunity to be made real in a way that changes custody levels, the
courts and the youth justice system must work closely and formally with
the social services and the Department for Children, Schools and
Families, through the children&#146;s services directorates at local
authority level. We should not anticipate a decrease in custody levels
unless the youth justice system takes into account the welfare and the
well-being of children in its determination of sentences and orders.
That must take effect.</div>
					<a name="07101825000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard
to intensive fostering, I would focus on the word
&#147;intensive.&#148; We all seek to change the behaviour of these
young people and to reintegrate them into society in a productive way,
and we know that that requires intensive engagement. Whether that is
fostering or an intensive relationship through another order, such as
an intensive supervision and surveillance programme, the intensive
nature of treatment for prolific offenders&#151;people with
significant welfare and well-being needs&#151;must be part of the
system. If we do it properly, we will have an opportunity significantly
to decrease the numbers of young people in

						</b> Do you not think that one of the problems that
many of you are concerned with, both as members of the Youth Justice
Board and as directors of the Children&#146;s Society, is that these
young teenagers&#151;we are predominantly talking about young
teenagers&#151;are the children of very young parents? Obviously, to
me both the children and the parents seem quite young. By taking
children away from their parents, albeit young parents or parents who
may not live very organised lives, are you not increasing the
irresponsibility&#151;I mean that not in a pejorative sense, but as a
factual description&#151;of parents for their children? Surely we
should try to encourage parents to take responsibility for their
children rather than passing those children over to the
state.</div>

impugning the motives of people who work for local authorities and deal

						</i> You make a fair point. The intensive
fostering element is built upon the presumption that children will
return to their families. If a young person&#146;s offending is
caused by the nature of their family circumstances, the content of the
order effectively gives them some time out and requires them to live
with a set of trained and specialist adolescent foster parents. That is
supported by a daily activity programme that helps the person to
adjust, meets their needs and reduces their likely harm to the
community.</div>

circumstances and replacing those with the state, but the intention is
for the state to work with the child and its family to repair the harm,
fix the issues and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. It is a
holistic system that requires regular contact by the child and the
family with trained and specific adolescent foster parents together
with a team of support workers.</div>

and families in their community. The issue of resources is tricky, but
we already have measures for that in the Act and we will encourage
local areas to decide how to spend their resources in the best way. For

From our perspective, there is a crucial need to look at the criteria
for custody and the Bill presents an opportunity to do so. There is an
opportunity to move to something of a virtuous circle, by tightening
the criteria for custody and using the intensive supervision and

become too difficult, even for special people. This model is rigorous
in its selection processes, so you do get the right people, but it also

central Government budget or the local authority budget? I ask
this&#151;it is not a party political point&#151;because
historically Governments are good at imposing duties on local
authorities but not at sending money along the tunnel to enable them to
pay for it. So you get at county hall or borough hall the age old

						</i> The starting point for this is that a lot of
money is being spent on these young people anyway, through various
parts of the system, whether it is on care, social work or various
services. This looks as if it is a more effective way of spending some
of that resource to get much better results. If we manage to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div>reduce the numbers in custody, the Youth Justice Board would be able to
invest more of the money that we currently spend on custody. Simon
Hickson quoted the amount for custody. In some sectors it is much
higher than that. Some of the beds that we pay for cost up to
&#163;200,000 a year. A lot of money is being spent anyway,
particularly on the secure children&#146;s homes. There are issues
about how local authorities identify the children who are most in need
and who are already costing a lot of money, and how they spend the
money that is already being invested in them. There is also for us a
challenge in terms of getting kids out of custody so that we can spend
the money spent on custody in other
ways.</div>

Reitemeier:

						</i> I should like to encourage the Committee
to take a long-term view in addressing this question of finances.
Reoffending rates hover between 75 and 80 per cent. for offenders who
go to custody. It is not just, as Simon Hickson pointed out,
&#163;100,000 a year, because you multiply that every time the young
person comes back into the system. So what some of the interventions,
such as intensive fostering or intensive engagement with young people,
are trying to combat is the reoffending rate. It is working in a way
that prevents these young people from coming back into the system. So
when you look at finances and the long term, it sounds crude, but it is
pay now or pay later, or pay now or continue to pay. We need to take a
long-term view of that.</div>
					<a name="07101825000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">On intensive fostering, you
said that we need the right people with both the right approach and the
right skills, and I completely agree. Our evidence, over many years of
the Children&#146;s Society, is that the most important factor that
changes a young person&#146;s behaviour is a relationship. Without
that relationship, we have little chance of making headway. It is not
just intensive fostering. Working with children&#146;s services and
working with the voluntary sector in other ways, we can establish those
relationships.</div>
					<a name="07101825000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">But
again, I would remind you of the point that you made at the very
beginning: in custody you are looking at a very significant percentage
of young people who have been in the care system, so the state had
already made what is one of the most important decisions it could ever
make, which is to separate that child from the family. Once they are in
custody and once they leave the youth justice system, if they go back
into an environment that brought them there in the first place, we have
little chance of changing their behaviour. So we need to look at those
relationships. The thing that young people tell us is that they when
they finally come across someone who actually cares whether they
succeed or fail it makes all the difference in the world. Unfortunately
they do not get that until we engage with this intensive relationship
building much later in their
life.</div>

There has been a growth over time of such a process. That is how we
would approach intensive fostering. As Ellie said, it will be as much a
matter of choosing to make different allocation decisions locally and
growing the process around intensive fostering as a matter of replacing
one old behaviour with a new behaviour. Fostering, as a standard

with magistrates last year and other sentences says to us that the key
issue here is about the training and sentencing guidelines that go
alongside the Bill, to make clear the tariffs and support that are
available to the young person. The feedback that we had from sentencers
was that they want to know that the best resources are available to
support the individual young person that they are dealing with.
Therefore, we have to ensure that youth offending teams have the right
assessment tools and the right support agencies to deliver those
support mechanisms. I will ask Ellie to talk about the

						</i> Graham Robb has already talked about some of the
mechanisms that will safeguard the processes here. I think that what is
crucial is the advice of the youth offending team to courts. We know
that courts depend on the youth offending team for advice on how they
can begin to address, and decide what should happen to, a young person
who appears before them. That advice will continue to be
crucial.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div>
					<a name="07101825000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the YRO allows the
courts to look at a young person at a point in time and say,
&#147;These are the needs. If the young person arrives again, then it
is for the YOT to say whether the deterioration in behaviour has been
so far that custody is the only alternative, or indeed whether there
are other things that need to be done with this young person.&#148;
Certainly, we know that with young people you have to continue over a
long period to work on their issues and problems and to encourage them
to change their
behaviour.</div>

with the sentencing guidance and advice, with the guidance that will go
to YOTs and with the relationship that YOTs have with courts and the
advice that they can give to them, I would be confident that there
should not be sentence inflation. Indeed, in the Youth Justice Board,
one of our central tenets is that we should not lock up any child who
does not absolutely have to be in custody. If we thought that there was
any risk of that happening, we would not have supported the Bill coming

it accounts for the largest number of the orders made. It also has the
greatest success rate in reducing reoffending, so the board takes great

electronic monitoring requirement. We think the referral order could

immediate disposal in terms of referral to drug or alcohol treatment,
whether through more availability of youth drug courts or more
immediate treatment? To back up that point, there is a concern that
referral orders do not necessarily lead to immediate action and

regarding the requirements of the referral order being fair in that
process. In terms of a young person&#146;s first appearance and
pleading guilty, we would expect youth 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>offending teams to work with the panels and the courts to build a
contract. Our current view is that the referral order allows for that
contract to be built. That differentiates it and other community
orders.</div>
					<a name="07101825000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
willingness of a young person and their family to engage with services
is somewhat constrained by the ability of local partners to meet the
requirement for those services immediately, but that does not stop the
referral order contract from saying that those services ought to be
engaged with. Our advice to youth offending teams is that they will
work with their local partners to ensure that those services are
delivered. Part of the arrangement through youth offending teams and
their multi-agency partnership in the local area is to meet the
requirements of court
orders.</div>

						</i> Yes. I should like to add one or two points
on referral orders. It is absolutely right to say that sometimes it
takes a while for the referral order to bite, but that is because of
the underlying problems in the young people&#146;s lives. They may be
sofa surfing, on drugs or whatever. It can be quite difficult to get a
contract working quickly. Nevertheless, as Brendan said, the overall
evidence in terms of the reconviction rates&#151;that is the ultimate
benchmark&#151;is actually very good. It is by far the best of all
the court disposals, lower tier and higher
tier.</div>
					<a name="07101825000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should like
to see a bit more flexibility in the use of the referral order. We
would like, first of all, to see the option to extend it by three
months where the process of restoration has kicked in, but a bit late.
We would also like to see discretion, if a youth offending team has
recommended it, to have a second one where the circumstances are
different.</div>
					<a name="07101825000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 was mentioned. We would also argue
that, for minor and non-repetitive offences, there should be a cut-off

requirements vary in their robustness and, essentially, their severity
and would perhaps be treated by the court in that manner, so there is a
hierarchy within the order. Why then, in your evidence, does the Youth
Justice Board make the point that it is important to have the
reparation order separate from the rehabilitation order, and to have
that hierarchy, if there is indeed a hierarchy inbuilt within the
rehabilitation order? In one sense, that hierarchy has already gone by
the removal and attendance centre order through to a supervision order.
I do not see the logic of that argument.</div>

						</i> The level of the hierarchy is critical for
those young people who may not need the continued
supervision&#151;the superstructure of the youth rehabilitation
order&#151;in terms of continued community action. We wish to
continue to allow a reparation order to sit alongside the referral.
There may be occasions when young people are required to do between 12
and 20 hours of work, and when the court feels that that would complete
their whole repayment back to society and make amends to the victim. We
have added through the activity requirement the ability of the youth
rehabilitation order to add reparation within that order as well. It
has become a tiered approach to referral orders for first-time guilty
pleas with those contacts; the opportunity for reparation order for
somebody who may not need continuing contact&#151;and needs just to
pay back those hours of work and contribution to their
community&#151;is necessary; and then the youth rehabilitation order,
which again is tiered to ensure that we deliver a robust response to
the risks that they pose to the community, and also to their needs.
Within that there will be an element of reparation.</div>

that, in principle, custody is a last resort, which is already

has been built up within other community sentences, and there is no
barrier to a court moving straight to custody if it thinks fit. It is
also the case that, at the moment, IS is sometimes used where actually
another community sentence ought to have been used. That is not very
desirable in terms of resources. We are arguing that the Bill should be
a lot clearer about the status of the ISS scheme&#151;because it is a
bigger, much more intensive disposal anyway&#151;and that there
should be much clearer criteria pointing away from custody unless it

sequential.&#148; A young person is only with the justice system for
a very brief period in most cases, and we see it as an opportunity for
a number of the problems and difficulties that they may have to be
addressed.</div>
					<a name="07101825000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rather than
other agencies stepping away, they should be stepping up to the table
to say, &#147;This is a young person at a time of crisis in their
lives; they need more medical assistance; they need services on mental
health; they need services on substance misuse; they need support to
get them back into education.&#148; The requirements in the YRO, if
based on a careful assessment of the child&#146;s needs and of what
is possible and feasible for that child, coupled with the work being
done on children&#146;s services, gives us a real opportunity to
focus on these children and young people at a point of crisis in their
lives and to build services that encourage behaviour that will last
well beyond the period in which such people are engaged in
justice.</div>

						</i> In the context out of which this legislation
is emerging, as Graham and Ellie have said and Bob has acknowledged,
there are huge opportunities with regard to the arrangements that we
see emerging around the local authorities performance framework and the
new arrangements for local authorities. The public service agreement
and the arrangement between Departments give us strong optimism that
there will be a requirement that issues regarding young people who are
in trouble, excluded 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>and involved in crime be managed together&#151;collectively. We had
complained previously that often targets fought each other. We now see
a possibility that targets will support each other.</div>
					<a name="07101825000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tackling crime will also
contribute to reducing the failure of looked-after children. The
potential is there for that to be gained. We are very confident, in
terms of the PSAs that we see have been negotiated and the local area
indicators, that they will support the efforts of crime, social
services and education in working together to tackle not just young
people in trouble, but young people who are likely to get into trouble.
That gives me optimism.</div>

justice, I do not like too much legislation either, because it makes
the job much harder on the ground. However, the reality is that this

exist.</div>

I think that it is a matter, certainly, of using the new mechanisms,
but also of having one or two selective mechanisms in the Bill to
ensure that courts can call local authorities to account where there
are big issues such as a child appearing to be at risk, or a child
facing custody. So, a little bit of each is what we are arguing

more exposure of the rationale, the risks and the issues considered,
and they can be brought before the court, that would help to
concentrate minds. I am not saying that that will solve all the
problems, but it would be a step

the other parts of the Bill? I have seen the submissions that have been
made, both from the Youth Justice Board and the Children&#146;s
Society, on a number of issues. I would just like some general comment
on the points that you have made about violent offender orders, on the
street offences with respect to prostitution, the antisocial behaviour
element and closure of premises, where you have made some points,
particularly as those measures obviously refer to young

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div>

balances the needs of children as victims, in terms of being victims of
crime, and children in the sense of being offenders? I ask that because
there is a real issue here. I absolutely take the point that sometimes,
particularly from the point of view of the Children&#146;s Society,
the perspective is of the child who may be an offender, to look at them
in terms of them being a victim. That is absolutely right, and we have
to identify and understand those children&#146;s needs and do
everything that we can to support them. However, for many of us as
Members of Parliament, representing people, we also have a huge number
of young people and children who demand that we take much tougher
action than we actually do against some of these very young people who
are causing considerable problems. It is the issue of balance. I wonder
whether you would like to comment on all of that, both from a youth
justice perspective and from a Children&#146;s Society

								Graham
Robb:
							</b>
						</i> Let us start with the individual perspective
first of all, Minister. That is saying that one of the balance points
that we want to make is about the responsibility of safeguarding
authorities at local level for many of these issues. For example,
regarding the prostitution measure that you were discussing, we have
very low numbers of youngsters coming into the youth justice system for
prostitution charges. Where they do come in, our feeling is that those
charges ought to be key as a safeguarding strategy, and that should be
the first requirement; it is the welfare of the young
person.</div>
					<a name="07101825000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">In terms of
violent offender orders and the other measures, there are measures at
local level already, through the multi-agency public protection
arrangements particularly and all those other strategies, that give a
good structure for dealing with individual need.</div>
					<a name="07101825000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now, let us leave the
individuals aside and look at the other young people in an area. We are
doing a lot of work about gangs, guns and weapons and young people at
the moment. It seems to us that what you have to do is, first, to help
young people to feel safe in their communities&#151;all young people.
Secondly, you have to help the communities feel safe with their young
people. That is about the wider social policy and about where young
people who might get into trouble go to and how they are supported and
how they are challenged. It is those two strands. It is the individual
safeguarding as well as the criminal justice measures, and then it is
helping communities feel safe with their young people which are really
important developments that we need to drive forward as the social
partners.</div>

								Bob
Reitemeier:
							</b>
						</i> Thank you very much for the question. I
would agree with the view that children can be looked at as victims,
not just as perpetrators, but I would take a step back and argue that
children should be looked at as children first, not as criminals,
victims, perpetrators or any other label. The question is: what should
the youth justice system do as opposed to the criminal justice system
as a whole? That is a very important point. As everyone has said so
far, we need to ensure in this Bill that we are addressing the welfare
and well-being of children when addressing their needs. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07101825000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">You raise the
important point about public perception, which includes the perception
of children and young people themselves. I agree with you that a strong
component of the public and of children and young people want to see
punishment. They feel that that has to be part of the picture. What we
would say is that there is a real educational component to our work
that needs to be brought to the forefront. On the one hand we have to
address the inconsistencies, where we are looking at increases in
custody beyond points of any reasonableness, while in terms of youth
crime, the overall crime rates are not that alarming. However, there is
a particular issue with violent crime. Graham talked about guns and
knives. You have not said this, but I would agree with the point that
we have a culture of fear right now in the UK where people are
increasingly afraid of young people. Perceptions and reality are coming
together there.</div>
					<a name="07101825000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
terms of the educational component, we have to look strongly at the
persistent and violent offender. We can use the rule that people
understand&#151;the 20:80 rule&#151;which says that 20 per cent. of
the population has an impact on 80 per cent of what we understand is
happening. It is not 20:80, but a small minority of children and young
people are involved in this kind of very violent behaviour and there
are alarming indications that this is increasing and moving across the
country. Some concentrated effort is required there but the whole of
the youth justice system should not be wrapped up into one category. We
have to segment out the young people we are working with. Custody does
not work. It just does not work in terms of trying to address
reoffending. The public do not quite understand that. Children and
young people themselves do not quite understand that, so there is a big
educational component that has to be part of
this.</div>

							<a name="07101825000327"></a>Mr.
Coaker:
						</b> This is a very interesting discussion because it
drives where you go to with the Bill and the points about the Bill. It
is this question of balance. I take the point about confidence. Let me
give you an example of the problem that we all wrestle with. Take the
premises closure orders, and this is the point that Mr. Robb
made about the need to have safeguards. It could be that you close down
premises with some children in it. In those circumstances clear
safeguards would be needed for those children.</div>
					<a name="07101825000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a big supporter of
premises closure orders, but there are those who would argue that
because children are involved under no circumstance should any premises
ever be closed. I know that that is not what is being said. I am merely
setting the Bill in context. In my view the fact that such bad
antisocial behaviour has attached to premises over a persistent period
of time has an immense impact on other children in the area. Secondly,
if we get the safeguards that Mr. Robb and Mr.
Reitemeier were talking about, it will force the system to address the
needs of those young people in those premises, which sometimes appear
simply to bumble along without anyone saying, &#147;This is now a
crisis. We are going to get hold of
this.&#148;</div>

taken. In terms of premises closure, you are absolutely right, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>the challenge is for the Government and for local authorities to ensure
that they live up to the provisions in regard to places to go and
things to do for children. If we are to provide places to go and things
to do for young people&#151;and premises will be around that
location&#151;it behoves us to ensure that those premises are safe,
do not create antisocial behaviour and are pro-social rather than

question for the panel. You mentioned that child violence&#151;youth
violence&#151;was on the increase. First, why do you feel that that
is so? Why do you feel that, increasingly, we are hearing of young
people maiming and killing each other in society? What do you think is

								Graham
Robb:
							</b>
						</i> The answer to that is different in different
parts of the country. First, you have a different pattern of that
activity in Manchester compared with parts of London. That is usually
about the nature of the weapons being used. Secondly, it is to do with
young people&#146;s perception of fear, as Bob was indicating. Young
people, as we know, are the most common group to be the victims of
crime committed by other people&#151;that is the stats. So what is
happening to address that has also got to be based on what is happening
at local level, and that is about schools and their teaching youngsters
to relate to other people in a pro-social way and agencies working
together, and about communities making clear stands about what is
acceptable and what is not acceptable in their communities. That goes
back to the safe places argument that we were rehearsing a moment
ago.</div>
					<a name="07101825000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">A combination of

						</i> You ask a huge question and I think it
was very appropriately put. The answers do not lie in the criminal
justice system; the answers lie in society. When you look at what is
leading to the violence that exists and the movement from fisticuffs to
other weapons&#151;to knives and guns&#151;to murder, there are
some factors that we would want to highlight. There is a cultural, real
difference between the Anglophone societies, including the United
States, and other parts of Europe, where you do not see the same rates
of violence increasing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>
					<a name="07101825000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">If you look at the family and
the development of an understanding of a moral compass or a value
system for a child&#151;however you want to describe it&#151;that
has deteriorated and needs to be addressed. If you look at the
intergenerational disconnect in our society compared with other
societies, you will see that part of the fear culture is because a
large percentage of the older population is not in contact in any real
way with the younger population, and vice versa. If you look at
community and community cohesion, these are the factors. The overriding
factor for a lot of the young people that end up at the hard end of
criminal justice is poverty. Child poverty in this country, as we know,
is unacceptable. All of these factors lead to the criminal justice
system having to pick up the
pieces.</div>

poverty, we do not talk only about material poverty but about poverty
of aspiration. Again, that comes back to those first few years in life.
A lot of the criminal justice system works with teenagers, because by
that point they are actually into criminal behaviour. But you have to
look at the early years, and that is why Sure Start was introduced to
try to address
that.</div>

not deal with what happens afterwards, it does not deal with the root
problem, and it could just move those problems to another
place.</div>

the need for safeguards. That is as far as it has
gone.</div>

asked me to say that he believes that crack house closures have been a
great success in terms of preventing drug abuse by young people, but
that is not the point. Given the time, I will respond quickly. We have
taken the decision to split the reparation order from the
rehabilitation order. I would like a short, one-word answer as to
whether both parties supported that split, and if they had any views
upon it.</div>

						</i> We support the split and we have referred
briefly to that at an earlier point. We think that there is value in
having reparation in its own right, and it adds an extra tier for the
court as well as being used within the YRO.</div>

separate from the other sentences. Our wider concern is about the risk
of escalation up the shorter tariff. There is additional reason for
having that extra step early on.</div>

that was mentioned previously. In general, we support the drafting of
amendment No. 106. However, we have an issue with the minimum level of
requirement because children are different from adults. We would be
happy to have a more detailed discussion on the guidance around that
matter. That would be the sticking point, but in general it was
okay.</div>
