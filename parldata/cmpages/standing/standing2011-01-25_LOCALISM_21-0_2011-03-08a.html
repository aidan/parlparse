clause is short, but it could have a significant impact on the way in
which registered providers of social housing will operate. It gives yet
another power to the Secretary of State, adding to his powers of
direction the power to set a standard on tenure. The National Housing
Federation, the representative body for housing associations, is
unhappy with the clause as it stands and has set out in its notes to me
the reasons

                           </div>why. I shall read them to the Committee as it will be helpful to have
the Minister’s response to the federation’s concerns. It
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
clause creates a new power for the Secretary of State to direct the
regulator about the contents of a standard covering tenure. This is not
needed. The direction powers of the Secretary of State under the 2008
Housing &amp; Regeneration Act already cover standards governing
quality of accommodation, rents and tenant involvement. In addition,
the Secretary of State must be consulted by the regulator about the
contents of all
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000347">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 128 gives the Secretary of State the power
to direct the social housing regulator on the content of the standard
under the terms of tenancies, as the hon. Lady said. Such a power is
central to the delivery of our proposals on tenure reform because it is
through a revised tenancy standard that the detail of the additional
freedoms on tenancies available to registered providers and the
constraints on those freedoms will be determined. It is therefore right
that the Government can give a direction on the content of the tenancy
standard to the regulator. Ultimately, it will be for the regulator to
set those
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000037">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Equally,
it is right that what we propose to put in the direction should be
subject to close scrutiny by members of the Committee and a full
consultation process. Hon. Members will be well aware of the fact that
we held a consultation and that the Government’s responses to
that consultation are in section 8 of the consultation document, in
which we set out the broad policy aims that we expect a direction to
the regulator to
deliver.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000038">&#160;</a>

is part of the ongoing process of our taking account of views expressed
by members of the Committee, by other consultees and in feedback. We
intend to consult formally on a draft direction to the regulator on the
content of a revised tenancy standard in the spring—which is
now, I guess. Having taken account of responses to that consultation,
and subject to parliamentary approval of these provisions during the
passage of the Bill, we will direct the regulator on the content of
that revised tenancy standard. We propose to do that at the earliest
possible opportunity following Royal Assent. Although the clause is
short, it is therefore at the heart of the implementation of our
proposals on tenure
reform.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000039">&#160;</a>

have no major objections to the clause, so I will speak briefly to the
amendment, which is pretty self-explanatory. It would deal with the
relationship between tenancy strategies and homelessness strategies by
amending the Homelessness Act 2002 to add a requirement on local
authorities to have regard
to<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000043">&#160;</a>

                        <p>when
formulating or modifying their homelessness strategies. That would be a
sensible addition to the legislative framework to ensure that local
authorities act in a co-operative manner and produce strategies that
work together, rather than causing problems or tensions between local
authorities, whose strategies might be in opposition to each another.
For example, a local authority’s strategy might be simply to
offload elsewhere anyone who presented as homeless. That would not be a
responsible attitude, but we know that some authorities have considered
and are considering taking
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000044">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 129 will require local housing
authorities, when formulating or modifying their homelessness
strategies, to have regard to the allocation scheme, the tenancy
strategy and, for London boroughs, the London housing strategy. The
sort of objectives that local housing authorities set out in tenancy
strategies will be for them to determine in the light of local needs
and circumstances, but ensuring that the new flexibilities do not lead
to increased homelessness is likely to be an important
aspect.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000046">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would require that, when formulating its homelessness
strategy, a local authority must have regard to the homelessness
strategies of neighbouring authorities. The Government already
encourage local authorities to work together to prevent and tackle
homelessness, and many authorities already do so, either informally or
through sub-regional partnerships, for example. Making such practice a
legislative requirement would be bureaucratic and could give rise to
practical problems. For instance, a local authority often has multiple
neighbouring authorities—four or five in some London
boroughs—and each might review its homelessness strategy at a
different time. It seems impractical and unnecessary to legislate to
force authorities to have regard to others when formulating the
strategies.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000047">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady was concerned about offloading, but I am sure that
responsible local authorities will work hard to avoid that. We have
already debated their duty to have regard to the location of somebody
who is placed in accommodation as a result of the authority accepting a
homelessness duty. We all hope that best practice is always followed,
but if there were a rogue local authority, as the hon. Lady suggested,
it is not clear to me that the duty to co-operate with a neighbouring
authority would prevent an authority deciding to leapfrog its
neighbours. I do not think that her amendment would achieve the
objective she set out, and it would be unduly
bureaucratic.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000048">&#160;</a>

issue was drawn to my attention by Andrew Arden QC, one of the
country’s foremost housing lawyers, and it arises from two
significant judgments in the Supreme Court, to which I will refer in
due course. First, a bit of background. Clause 130 creates flexible
tenancies, which are in essence local authority tenancies that are
secure for up to two years, but which subsequently are subject to
mandatory possession hearings. The wording of proposed new section 107D
of the Housing Act 1985, which will be inserted into the Act by this
clause, reads as
follows:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000057">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Subject
as follows, on or after the coming to an end of a flexible tenancy a

                        <p>I
will not go into details, but “the following conditions”
are procedural. If the procedures are satisfied, the wording of the
legislation is such that the court has no discretion and must grant
possession. I think I am right in saying that that is clearly the
Government’s policy objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000058">&#160;</a>

subsequent judgment was on three cases that were heard together: London
borough of Hounslow <em>v. </em>Powell, Leeds city council <em>v. </em>Hall
and Birmingham city council <em>v. </em>Frisby. The Supreme
Court’s conclusion was similar to its conclusion on Pinnock, but
it was helpful in making it clear that the remit of the judgment did
not apply only to a particular type of tenancy. The Pinnock judgment
was specifically on a demoted tenancy, whereas the subsequent Powell,
Hall and Frisby judgment was on introductory tenancies and other such
circumstances. My reading of the second judgement is that it reinforces
the first judgment, but it also makes it clear that it applies as a
general principle to local authority possession actions in cases in
which legislation provides for mandatory
possession.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p>If
the Supreme Court judgment is to be considered, however, the court has
to have the option of exercising discretion in deciding whether to
grant possession. In other words, the Secretary of State has signed a
declaration of compatibility with the convention, which can be right
only if the court acts in a way contrary to that prescribed by the
Bill. The Bill states that, in the circumstances set out, the court
must grant
possession.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000063">&#160;</a>

readily accept that the second judgment—the Powell
judgment—was delivered after the Bill was published and the
first judgment, the Pinnock judgment, was delivered only a month before
the Bill appeared, so the Secretary of State may not have had much time
to consider the implications of those judgments before making his
statement on compatibility, but we have now had adequate time and
opportunity to digest those implications. It is clear that the Supreme
Court is adamant that the English courts must have discretion to
consider the proportionality of a possession order brought by a local
authority in the light of the article 8
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000064">&#160;</a>

agree to the amendment, we would essentially be agreeing to a Bill that
makes a mockery of the Secretary of State’s declaration of
compatibility on its front page. As I said at the outset, the amendment
is designed to help get the Government off a hook that they have
created themselves by asking the courts to act in a way that is
inconsistent not only with the Supreme Court’s judgment, but
with the Secretary of State’s statement on the Bill’s
front page. I hope,

amendment on this occasion. If he chooses not to do so, I must say that
many people not only in this place or the other place, but in the

therefore to hearing his

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman comes bearing gifts, and
one should be careful about that. Amendment 254 seeks to make it more
difficult, if they decide not to extend the tenancy to a particular
tenant, for local authorities to recover possession of a social
property at the end of a flexible tenancy. The amendment does that by
giving the court the discretion not to make a possession order if it
considers the order disproportionate. That will have the effect of
placing an obligation on the court to consider proportionality in all
possession applications on the expiry of a flexible tenancy. If the
amendment were accepted, that would be the case even if the tenant does
not defend the application for possession. The amendment effectively
changes the order for possession from being mandatory to being
discretionary and would, of course, completely undermine the purpose of
the clause, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman fully
intends.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment reintroduces grounds for possession by the back door, when
our flexible tenancy proposals are fundamentally about moving away from
fault-based grounds for possession to a clearer and more
straightforward deal between landlords and tenants. It is important
that proper protection is in place for tenants where a landlord decides
not to renew a flexible tenancy, and we expect that landlords will
discuss housing options with tenants well in advance of the fixed term
of their tenancy coming to an end. In many cases, we would expect the
tenancy to be renewed when that was
done.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000067">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to draw attention to one of the right hon. Gentleman’s
remarks, which I am sure was made inadvertently, when he said that a
tenancy could be given for up to two years. That is absolutely not the
proposition. The proposition is that the shortest period of a flexible
tenancy that could be offered is two years, and he will see from the
Government’s response that we have accepted the view of
consultees that that should be an exceptional minimum period for
special circumstances. We would normally expect the shortest period of
tenancy to be five years, and that will come up again in the stand part
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000068">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Where
a landlord decides that a tenancy should not be extended, however, the
tenant will be given the opportunity to challenge that decision as well
as sufficient time to find alternative accommodation following advice
and support from their landlord. Local authority landlords are required
to serve a notice on the tenant six months before the end of the
flexible tenancy when they are minded not to reissue it at the end of
the fixed term. In addition to that, the landlord, having had to give
the early warning, is then required to serve a second notice two months
before seeking possession. Taken together, those are important
protections for tenants to set alongside the new freedoms that we are
giving to
landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000069">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Gentleman referred to the Supreme Court judgments—the
Pinnock case and the Powell, Hall and Frisby cases—which
established that local authority landlords seeking to recover a
property to which they have an unqualified right of possession, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 829<a class="bkMark" name="Column829">&#160;</a>
                           </div>which certainly will include expired flexible tenancies, will need to
consider the tenant’s rights under article 8 of the European
convention on human rights in those cases where the tenant raises a
defence based on the proportionality of the landlord’s decision.
The right hon. Gentleman did not, however, provide all of the
Court’s judgments in those cases, because if he had, it would
have emphasised the strong presumption that if landlords have followed
proper procedures—for example, giving tenants a right to review
decisions—it will normally be proportionate to make a possession
order. It is right that landlords should, in light of their tenancy
policy, be able to make policy decisions about renewing tenancies
without routinely having the basis for such decisions challenged in the
courts. Landlords, rather than the courts, are best placed to make
decisions about the best use of the housing stock in light of the local
community’s
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000070">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister’s defence is that the
Supreme Court made it clear that the exercise of discretion, in light
of article 8, would not apply across the board, which is, of course,
true. He made the point—and again, this was in the judgment,
which I am glad that he has read—that the court’s
exercise of discretion would depend on the individual tenant seeking to
refer to article 8. He claimed that it will, to quote his word,
“normally” be proportionate for the court to grant
possession in cases of flexible tenures that have come to the end of
their fixed period—and I accept that the wording is, as the
Minister has said, a minimum of two years, and the Government are now
saying that they hope that five years would be the norm. However, at
the end of that period when that tenancy has elapsed, if the
court seeks possession, it will still be the case that if the tenant
says, “This exercise of a mandatory possession order is
disproportionate in the circumstances,” the court will have the
discretion to decide whether it is proportionate to grant it. That is
my point, which the Minister has simply not
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000072">&#160;</a>

compatible with the wording of the statute that we have been asked to

suggesting that my amendment is necessarily the right one. I am happy
to consider alternative wordings, but we cannot put ourselves in the
position where we are asked to agree a wording that is clearly
incompatible with judgments in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has
made it quite clear that even if there is a mandatory possession order,
in such cases the court must have the discretion to decide whether to
grant an order in light of article 8 of the European convention on
human rights.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000076">&#160;</a>

State on the Bill’s front page about the European convention on

“It’s only going to be occasionally that such
circumstances will arise” can possibly justify his position. It

                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden spoke with real passion
in the debate on clause 121 about people who set an example, who hold
communities together on estates and who get ahead. We had a submission
this week from a young woman called Jessica Sim setting out her
concerns about the abolition of security of tenure. She was divorced,
had difficulty paying her mortgage and was luckily offered social
housing. She writes:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“To
get an affordable secure home was a great incentive to pursue my
career. I also spent a great deal of time and money improving my
council home and garden (all in a shockingly derelict state on arrival)
and getting involved in my community association to improve the area,
knowing that we could
stay.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000361">&#160;</a>

if the people who are kicked out lose their job or get fed up being
hardly better off working? Back on housing benefit, back in the queue,
the bill will be enormous. Families have a better chance if they have a

housing.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
think her comments are extremely apt and absolutely to the point. The
clause will bring an end to mixed communities on estates and bring an
end to aspiration. It will sideline estates as nothing more than
transitional areas, hallmarked not by long-standing communities, many
of which stretch back across generations, but by alienation and
deprivation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000115">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We might have
hoped, after the consultation and evidence from witnesses, and after we
have asked again and again for the Government to consider this, that we
might have seen Government amendments to the clause. Many housing
professionals are deeply uncomfortable with the idea of asking someone
to leave their home because their circumstances have changed in a
positive way. Did the Minister consider the approach whereby, if a
person’s circumstances changed positively, other elements of the
tenancy could be reviewed—perhaps rent level, because that would
fit in with the wider policy around “affordable” rents,
or assistance into intermediate ownership? I am sure the Committee
would be interested to hear the thinking behind
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000116">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Housing
associations are working frantically to try to work out the
implications of the policy for them. There are still questions about
human rights legislation and the implications for flexible tenancy
policy. Under current legislation, landlords are not allowed to end
tenancies on the basis of time, and we have heard a very well argued
case from my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich.
The Minister could not give an assurance that the measures would not
result in a legal challenge in the
courts.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000117">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New
flexible tenancies set at 80% of market rate are seen as likely to
increase instability and insecurity. They will increase pressure on the
housing benefit bill and drive families out of certain areas. Good
evidence published by Mark Lupton for Family Mosaic supports that
argument and further supports the concerns raised by my hon. Friend the
Member for Mitcham and Morden about incentives. Instead we have
Ministers pressing ahead with the coalition’s plans to scrap
security of tenure, a policy on which nobody voted in May 2010. Indeed,
we might have expected something rather different from this Minister.
It is not very long—sorry, I am going to do this
again—since he put his name to an early-day motion calling
for:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“'the
urgent need to boost the economy by a massive programme of public
investment to improve existing council homes and estates and build a
new generation of first-class council housing to provide secure
tenancies and low
rents”.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>I
do not understand how that sits with the policy that he is now putting
forward. I find it difficult to square that
circle.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000119">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">But
times and positions change, and we now have a Liberal Democrat Minister
supporting the clause to end security of tenure for social housing
tenants. We do not claim that a reform agenda should not be considered.
We claim that the Government are taking the wrong course—a
damaging course. The consequences will not improve the social or
economic condition of people who depend on social housing, nor develop
any sense of
community.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Minister wanted flexibility in tenure while offering protections to
tenants— I am sure he talked about that in previous speeches in
the House when he was not a Minister and was signing early-day
motions—why did he not revisit the 2006 Law Commission report on
a single form of tenancy? It was a far more considered piece of work
than the policies for which the Government are now legislating, and it
was widely supported. A number of colleagues pressed the previous
Labour Government to add that to their housing
legislation,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 833<a class="bkMark" name="Column833">&#160;</a>
                           </div>but the legislation was deemed not to be the right vehicle. The Bill,
however, with its clear focus on tenure and tenancy change, could well
have adopted the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000121">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
want this and the next clause deleted because the measure simply
proposes another tenancy agreement in addition to those already in
existence. The proposal will add confusion and consequent management
problems for social landlords, and it does nothing to address the
anomalies highlighted in the Law Commission report. And that is before
we come to the impact on tenants and the potential problems that they
will face of possibly having to move home within two years if their
income increases. I will return to that issue
later.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">A
great deal of work has been carried out over the years on tenure
reform. In 1997, the Chartered Institute of Housing commissioned an
independent adviser to produce a report with proposals for a single
form of tenancy, and intended for general consultation throughout the
housing world. In June 1998, the report “One for All: A Single
Tenancy for Social Housing?” was published as a discussion
paper. Its proposals were developed following consultation by the
author with 11 leading lenders to housing organisations, 21 housing
associations, 20 local authorities of different sizes in different
parts—urban and rural—of England, Scotland and Wales, and
29 tenants organisations, including the Tenants and Residents
Organisations of England, which represents tenants throughout the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
context of the original study has relevance for today—continuing
Government emphasis on plurality and partnership in the social housing
sector, and multi-agency and partnership approaches to delivering
housing and housing services to make the best use of stock and to

little disagreement in the

                        <p class="tabbed">Throughout
the social housing sector, there are many differences between
landlords’ and tenants’ rights and obligations, not only
between local authorities and housing associations, but within the
housing association sector and even within individual housing
associations. Those variations are caused by the different legal
regimes under which local authorities and housing associations operate,
and they have an adverse effect on the mobility and development of
mobility schemes, the development of common housing registers and other
initiatives aimed at breaking down barriers across the social housing
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
did the Government opt for this particular flexible tenure option, with
all its destabilising qualities, when the basis for a scheme with much
broader support was sitting on the shelf—a scheme which ran
across the rented sector, was landlord-neutral and might have replaced
the complex existing letting arrangements? Many organisations have said
that some flexibility in the system would be beneficial, but they all
agree that the emphasis must be on offering tenants positive, supported
choices to improve their housing options, rather than forcing change on
them simply because their circumstances have changed over a short
period. The proposals made by the Law Commission would also have helped
to do away with the stigma attached to being a social tenant, by
introducing two forms of tenure under which people would, in effect,
become renter-occupiers, whether in the private or social sector.
Lenders also felt that the clarity offered by that proposal was good
for them.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Uncertainty
surrounds the impact of the measures in the clause, because of its
potential impact on revenue streams. There is likely to be greater
churn and variation in the system. Why is this option worth
considering? If the Minister does not feel able to rethink this and
subsequent clauses, perhaps the other place, with all its expertise in
such matters, will want to explore whether the Law Commission proposal
would achieve a degree of flexibility, without some of the unintended
consequences and unfairnesses inherent in the Bill. Its option would
facilitate moves to increase stable communities by mixing tenure,
income groups and levels of housing need in the same neighbourhoods. It
would also assist in blurring tenure demarcations and our place in the
social hierarchy, as reflected by the housing spectrum that stretches
from outright home ownership, long leases, existing tenancy and
landlord types, to those in temporary accommodation. Indeed, it might
also facilitate stock transfer by enabling tenants to retain the same
tenancy
agreement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000127">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are arguments why the clause is the wrong one to deliver tenure reform.
It is important to tackle the myth that the Government’s
proposals are the only show in town, and to point out that careful and
considered work has already been done on which reform might have been
built, and which would have benefited from further exploration to see
whether there was a less destabilising option than the one that we
currently
face.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are told that people will be offered a flexible tenancy at the higher
affordable—a bit of a misnomer—rent, after what one has
to assume will be a pretty detailed examination of their personal
circumstances, the need for which was set out in the debate on an
earlier clause. After a minimum of only 18 months, perhaps having got
their child into a local school, people’s circumstances will
have to be re-examined. In the interests of transparency and fairness,
that examination will have to be assiduously carried out by the
landlord. If people’s income has risen over a certain level,
they might be asked to leave their
house.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
does that do for aspiration? Why would anyone risk losing their home,
particularly in an area of high demand and with their child settled in
a school, by taking a promotion? We will see people covering up what
they are actually earning. We will see a single parent perhaps hiding
the fact that they have a new partner living with them. What pressure
is that going to put on housing managers who have to undertake the
investigative work? Two years—I know that it is the
minimum—is far too short a period. During the debate on clause
124, the Minister described three years in temporary accommodation as
not giving families any security, so why is a two-year tenancy
acceptable in any way, shape or
form?<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000130">&#160;</a>

124, the hon. Member for Croydon Central expressed a view that two
years was, in the main, too short. It is difficult to put a figure on,

years or that a limited and fixed percentage of all new lettings could
be let for a shorter period, but none of that has appeared. We are
still stuck with what we have in the Bill, which is wholly
unacceptable. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has said that its members
are anxious about the risks involved in both affordable rents and the
flexible tenancy scheme, because of the uncertainty in the system. The
Minister needs to explain to the Committee exactly how he sees that
working. Does he envisage a whole range of different-length tenancies
spreading out across the social rented sector? If so, what discussions
has he had with lenders about their assessment of the risks involved in
their lending to, in particular, housing associations? We have deep

support my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View and the
points that she has made. The clause could have serious implications
for people and communities. As my hon. Friend has said, there is no
mandate for what is being proposed, and, if handled in the way that we
fear it might, it will have an impact on individuals’
aspirations and on cohesion in communities. I want to draw attention to
the submission from Age UK, which mentions the dangers for older new
tenants:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000135">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Most
evidence demonstrates that older people require the security and
stability of a lifetime tenancy to protect both their physical and
mental well being. Older people consider security of tenure to be
essential to both quality of life and well being in retirement. Over
the years many tenants build up local support networks and use nearby
services that enable them to remain independent. At the same time older
tenants make a huge contribution to the health and vitality of their
local community. A forced move under a flexible tenancy could undermine
this position for
many.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000364">&#160;</a>

UK has picked up some of the themes of concern expressed in discussions
on housing, such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
Mitcham and Morden about what tenants with aspiration give to their
community and how they enhance it, as well as the way in which
prospering in the community saves the state money when it comes to
supporting people in difficulty. The points made by Age UK about older
people echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View said
in drawing on the submission on the young woman’s testimony. It
illustrates the need to be very careful in proceeding down such a route
with a massive stick, when it is an area where we should be using
carrots. There is no mandate. I hope that the Government will think
carefully before progressing in that way.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000136">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will make only a few brief remarks on the
clause. Looking around the Committee, I wonder how many of us have
lived in private rented accommodation at some point or how many of us
are doing so now. I am fortunate at the moment. I live in a flat with a
mortgage. Ten years ago, I lived in rented accommodation. I was quite
lucky. The flat was nice. I had a one-year tenancy, with the
possibility of renewal. I remember how that position affected me, and
my need for stability and to be able to paint walls and do the garden.
I desperately wanted to own my own home. That was partly to do with the
sense of being rooted and not having the fear, each time the tenancy
came up for review, that I would have to move on. I was in work. I did
not have children. I was a single woman, who had moved to London. If
that security was important to me then, it is much more important for
the individuals and families whom I see time and again at my surgeries.
I regard the provisions under the Bill as dangerous for the reasons
outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor
View.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000137">&#160;</a>

introduction of flexible/short-term tenancies will condemn many to a

understanding of this part of the Bill is linked to the
Government’s desire to introduce an affordable rent model that
might sit alongside flexible tenancies. I wish to put on record my
concern about the ability of my constituents, and the people in the
communities I represent, to pay rents on short-term flexible tenancies
of up to 80% of market rents. I see people in my surgeries who cannot
afford to buy a washing machine; the idea that they could afford 80% of
the market rent in zone 2 of London is quite ludicrous. Although there
may be some people for whom it might offer a solution to their housing
situation, I am not convinced that it will address the big problems
that I see in my constituency, so I have deep concerns about the

accommodation for such families. I did not live in the world of policy

who can least support themselves and who have the greatest
difficulties. Such families might have to move every two years while
another Department is encouraging them to take risks, to go to work, to
go to evening classes and to take day release. All the time that
Department is trying to encourage such families, we are pushing them in

is a great man and is the least cynical public servant I have ever met,
given his pressurised job as head of lettings in a London borough. He
discharges those 10 families because he gets them out of the
department, out of the council and into a home. The consequences for
the families, whether they can get work and get on in life, are not
part of his consideration. He is a great man, but if one is dealing
with such a number of families looking for accommodation, one often
makes decisions that are not in their long-term interests. We are

                        <p class="tabbed">If
housing benefit changes are brought in that are punitive on
under-occupation, families moving out, children going off to
university, there will be a huge gap between what people can pay in
rent and their actual rent. Housing associations which apply for money
from lenders to charge those rents will have to get rid of those
people. That is not what anybody wants. Housing association staff are
not bad people but they will be desperate to keep their housing float
and to keep on developing. Developing is the glamorous part of a
housing association’s work. It is what draws in the brightest,
the best and the risk takers and getting rid of that will rid these
organisations of their life
blood.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000150">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Croydon Central said that he was a special adviser to
David Curry, the former Housing Minister. I went up before David Curry
as a young councillor and chair of my housing committee and we
discussed under-occupation, particularly by the elderly ladies who live
on the St Helier estate. At no point did he suggest that moving them
out was the answer. We all know that in order to move people out of
accommodation we must provide a better alternative. If we want people
to work and to study, we need to do the things that make that more
possible. I am not against forcing people to do things. I completely
agreed with the introduction of the introductory tenancies so that if
people acted in an antisocial manner they could be moved on. I have no
problem with that, but I have a problem with using a stick against a
family that is doing its best. That will not work for
anyone.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000151">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
80% market rents on new housing association properties will simply
shift the costs somewhere else. The Department for Communities and
Local Government is shifting its cuts on to the Department for Work and
Pensions. There is a lack of joined-up government. The report from
Family Mosaic says that its tenants’ dependence on housing
benefit will increase by 151%. That cost will go somewhere. We as
taxpayers will still bear it. It will not be in subsidy to the housing
associations, but in subsidies to individuals on housing benefits,
which disincentivise work. We should look at the bigger picture. We
should encourage good behaviour. We should not discourage people from
getting on in life, which is all that the two-year tenancies can be
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000152">&#160;</a>

rented accommodation. I was also on the chair of governors of a primary
school. The head teacher and I were increasingly

                           </div>concerned about the amount of churn in the local community due to the
uncertainty and short-term nature of private sector lets. We were often
confronted by parents who had no certainty about where they would be in
a month, let alone five months or a year.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
tried to bring parents into the family of the school and engage them in
helping their children to learn, but quite often they were with us for
three months, five months or a year, and then they were gone and they
became someone else’s problem. Where possible, parents would try
to let their children stay at a primary school. Quite often, however,
because of the nature of the turnover in their household circumstances,
additional travelling was involved. As other children came into the
family, different children were placed in different schools because of
where they now lived and the vacancies that were available. I am
concerned that clause 130 will add risk, for families in particular,
and that it will produce additional uncertainty, concern and worry in
the lives—often already chaotic—of people who find
themselves living such a churned lifestyle.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000154">&#160;</a>

advocate for education, and I certainly support the concept behind the
previous Government’s policy—Every Child Matters. For a
lot of families, and for an awful lot of children, school is one
constant. It is one oasis of calm in lives that are sometimes otherwise
chaotic. The additional pressure and uncertainty that the proposal will
create for families who face so many other pressures, uncertainties and
worries—including, sometimes, where the next family meal will
come from—cause me great concern. What will happen to the
children in those families? What will be their certainty? Where will be
their oasis of calm? Where will be their one constant, if they face the
prospect of being moved around because of the short-term tenancies with
which they are provided?<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000155">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This has been a revealing debate. A series of
powerful, persuasive and convincing points have been raised by the
Opposition. Apart from two interventions from the hon. Member for
Croydon Central, we have not heard a word from Government Back
Benchers, and I do not suppose we will hear anything from them. We will
get the ministerial statement, and the Minister will have to explain
why he has changed his mind. Clearly, he has done so, because what he
is proposing now is diametrically contrary to what he and his party
were saying as recently as a year ago, before the most recent general
election.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposal
that we are dealing with is a classic product of the coalition
Government. It has been cobbled together in a hurry. It is all about a
year zero mentality; everything must change, because everything that
went before is wrong. There is a total lack of willingness to learn
from the experience of the past and to talk to the people who
understand the issue most clearly. The arrogant assumption is made that
the new Government know best, and they will simply impose their
proposals. They do not have the guts to stand up and defend those
proposals in Committee, because ultimately they know that they are
ill-considered and will not have the consequences that Ministers like
to pretend they will.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000157">&#160;</a>

say, “It cannot be that bad, because it will not happen, so
please do not blame us for doing it.” I do blame them. I blame
them for what they are doing to damage the self-esteem, confidence and
security of large numbers of people who will no longer have confidence
that—providing they pay the rent and abide by the tenancy
conditions—they can treat the place where they live as their
home and continue to live there if they want to. That is a pretty
important principle that most of us take for granted. Most of us would
not want to live in a place where we did not have the security that if
we behaved properly, paid our housing costs and did not cause a
nuisance we could continue to live there.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000158">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend the Member for Lewisham East asked an interesting question about
how many of us have lived in the private rented sector. I spent four
years living in the private rented sector, at the end of which my
landlord decided that he wanted to gain possession of the property and
was able to do so. That was long before the era of shorthold tenancies,
but I was in an insecure furnished letting back in the late 1960s.
There was a simple reason. My landlord, with whom I got on perfectly
well, was a rational man. He noticed that the area was coming up in the
world, that prices were rising and that it would be sensible for him to
clear out the tenants, from whom he was receiving a reasonable income,
to cash in on the gentrification of that area of Fulham. Believe it or
not, he proposed that the basement flat, which I had occupied for four
years, be converted into an indoor swimming pool as part of the
gentrification of the property. That gave me a wonderful gag: I said,
“At last, he’s found a solution to the rising
damp.” That situation was, however, an indication of what can
happen. I lived there, looked after the place and paid the rent. I did
not cause a nuisance to anyone, but I had to go at the say-so of the
landlord.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000159">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I accept that
it is probably reasonable, certainly in the majority of the private
rented sector, for that kind of ethos to exist. It is a very different
matter, however, for social tenancies. Ever since the Housing Act
1980—passed by a Conservative Government, though they took up
the previous Government’s Housing Bill, which fell at the 1979
general election—there has been a bipartisan, or tripartisan,
view that tenants of social landlords should have security. Now that is
being removed. A whole category of new lettings are being created where
tenants will not have that security. They will not have the ability to
feel that, if they behave properly and do the right thing, they can
treat the property as their home.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000160">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">These
proposals are not being introduced on the basis of any manifesto
commitments. As my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View,
rightly pointed out from the Front Bench in her powerful opening speech
in this debate, there was no manifesto commitment. The proposals are
not being introduced on the basis of evidence from the sector, because
there has not been evidence from the sector telling the Government to
do that. There has been a lot of interesting debate in the sector about
how to provide for flexibility in the context of building communities
and helping people to feel confident in their homes. That is absolutely
right and proper. There is no support, however, across the sector for
the proposals. They have been cobbled together in a hurry. They are
being introduced for effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000161">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The most
telling thing is how the proposals were announced. They did not come
from any review; they came from a throwaway remark by the Prime
Minister in a question and answer session in August. That bounced the
Government—to the shame of the Liberal Democrat party, it
allowed itself to be bounced, in contravention of everything they had
ever said previously—into this ill-conceived and damaging set of
proposals. We have heard quite enough from other Members, so I will not
say any more about the inappropriateness of the solution and the
damaging consequences that it would have.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
would like to reinforce the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Plymouth, Moor View, about the Law Commission. That expert body looked
at the issue and produced a series of proposals designed to give a
degree of flexibility, a point on which we would probably reach
agreement if we were to sit down in a room, work at it and find a
solution. It had a way of doing that while also creating greater
consistency in lettings in the social housing sector and maintaining
the principle of security. The issue has been looked at and worked on;
there are proposals that have been gathering dust for many years. As
the Minister who asked the Law Commission to do that, I thought it was
an excellent piece of work. I regretted my successors’ failure
to implement it when we were in Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I put it to
the current Government, however, that there is a fine piece of work
that could be the basis of sensible legislative proposals to give
flexibility and to maintain the basic principles that have been so
important for security in social lettings. That could have been done in
a consensual way. The way that the coalition Government have acted is
an appalling comment on them. They have not based their decisions on
evidence. They have not based them on manifesto commitments. They have
not based them on logic. I am afraid to say that we are being asked to
pass something that has very little support other than among silent
Members on the Government Benches.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000164">&#160;</a>

addressing a point that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View, made
in her speech opposing the clause. She referred back to
amendment 254 and suggested that we had failed to answer the
charge  of the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. In
fact, that is not the case. Provisions in the Bill of any shape or form
clearly still require authorities to comply with common law, and
nothing that we do could overcome that. There is a perfect defence for
local authorities based on article 8 of the European convention on
human rights, and tenants would also be able to rely on that as a
defence.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000165">&#160;</a>

word “must” in relation to giving possession, I believe
that it is in order for me to say that the Minister must recognise that
the Supreme Court judgments are subsequent to all previous legislation.
It seems a nonsense to fall back on the argument that because there are
existing mandatory possession grounds, they must be interpreted in
light of the Supreme Court decision, but that does not in any way
invalidate the new legislation. If we are to produce wording that means
anything, it must be accurate in the light of recent Supreme Court
judgments. I am sorry that the Minister did not feel that that
necessitated an amendment, but I will move on; otherwise, I will incur

gives local authorities the power to offer flexible tenancies to new
social tenants—I stress that the power is for local authorities.
A flexible tenancy is a secure tenancy of a fixed term of not less than
two years. I have already drawn attention to the Government’s
consultation response, and paragraph 8.6 on page 47 includes the
following statement:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
think, for example, that two-year tenancies should be an available
option for landlords, though we would expect, and responses to the
consultation suggest, the vast majority of tenancies to be provided on
longer terms, particularly for vulnerable households or those with
children.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Subsequently,
in paragraphs 8.10 and 8.11, we set out the policy aims and the factors
that we believe should be taken into account. In response to an earlier
debate, I said that it was the Secretary of State’s intention to
publish a draft direction including those elements set in paragraphs
8.10 to 8.12. The document will be available for debate, so we will
come back to the precise nature of the limitations on the power, which
will provide an opportunity for further discussion.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000173">&#160;</a>

mind some of the misrepresentations that have flown around—and
not only during this sitting—I want to make it absolutely clear
that this is not a compulsory requirement for local authorities. A
local authority can decide to make no change at all to the way in which
it allocates tenancies, or it can decide that it will apply to a
certain category or type of tenants. It might, for instance,
specifically exclude older people. In many cases, one assumes that that
would be the case. If a bungalow is allocated to a lady of retirement
age, it would not be likely that there were any grounds for her having
a flexible
tenancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000174">&#160;</a>

be transparent and open. The direction that we will give will be
designed to make it absolutely clear what the boundaries of their

that public, and

the passage of the Bill, a family has presented itself at my surgery,
as happens to all of us all the time. The family members currently have
a social tenancy, with three teenage children, not all of the same
gender, living in a two-bedroom house. That is a very unsuitable
circumstance, and they are desperate for a three-bedroom house. On the
same estate, there are several three-bedroom houses that are occupied
by a single, retired person—frequently a widow whose family has
left. It would make great sense for the family I have seen to be
allocated a three-bedroom home for 10 years. In 10
years’ time, the youngest child will be 22, and that will be the
time to have a reappraisal of whether they should continue to have a
three-bedroom home or should be offered a two-bedroom home. Otherwise,
we will simply build in the misuse of the stock, with families in
overcrowded and unsatisfactory situations on one the hand, and
underused stock on the other.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000184">&#160;</a>

Helier estate in the three-bedroom houses in which they brought up
their children and from which their husbands went to war are not
misusing their council properties. They have a right to be there, and
they should be there. If they need to be moved, we should provide
accommodation to which we can encourage them to

is the impact of the two-year rule on people who wish to accrue a
discount on their property to use their right to buy or their right to

not intend to—that those people were “misusing”
the home. They are under-occupying it; that was the phrase I used. The
situation will not arise for any tenant with an existing tenancy, but
if someone were in a flexible tenancy with a defined end, there would
be an opportunity at the moment of that end for the landlord and the
tenant to appraise future accommodation need. Of course, the hon. Lady
is right that it makes no sense—it would never make any
sense—to terminate the tenancy of a single individual in a
three-bedroom home without providing them with appropriate alternative
accommodation, but there is nothing in the proposals that even hints
that that is the direction in which we wish to
go.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000191">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister will know that the extent of
under-occupation is far greater in the owner-occupied sector than in
any other sector. I am sure that he would not think it appropriate to
try to force under-occupying owner-occupiers to move into smaller
accommodation, even though there is a chronic shortage of
owner-occupied housing available for first-time buyers, for example.
Will he please justify why he is doing this exclusively for social
tenants? Secondly, why has he not paid heed to the Law Commission
report to which my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View and I

extensive and complex rewrite of housing law that would have left a
confusing picture on the ground for many years to come. I understand
that he was unsuccessful in persuading his successors in the Department
to move ahead with it, and clearly his lack of success has gone forward
for another

                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the points that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View raised was
about the linkage between tenancies and income. Clearly, that is tied
into housing benefit. She postulated that there might be a temptation
to conceal income and matters of that sort. There is nothing in the
Government’s response—I refer again to paragraphs 8.10 to
8.12—that talks about income as the driving force for a tenancy
change. I agree with the hon. Lady that it could be a good option to
have a linkage of that sort, but I agree with her also that it would be
important not to create perverse incentives in doing so. The suggestion
in some of the talk that seems to be floating around, that “if
you get a job, you’ll lose your council house,” is
absolutely not contained in the policy aims that we have published in
response to the consultation, and is absolutely not part of the
framework of our
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause provides for the circumstances in which a new tenancy will be a
flexible tenancy. It provides for the process by which a landlord may
offer and terminate a flexible tenancy, and it provides for a
tenant’s right to terminate a tenancy or to request a review of
the landlord’s decision with regard to the offer of the
termination process. It removes the rule that requires a landlord,
without exception, to provide lifetime tenancies regardless of what
sort of tenancy is best suited to the needs of the
household.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000195">&#160;</a>

hon. Members have rightly said, freedom needs to have boundaries, and
we propose to direct the regulator on the content of a new tenancy
standard, which will set the parameters within which landlords can
exercise the additional flexibility available to them. We have
published our broad policy proposals, to which I have already referred
extensively, and we are proposing that the tenancy standard places a
requirement on landlords to publish a tenancy policy, which sets out
the kinds and lengths of tenancies that they will grant, and the
circumstances in which they will grant a particular tenancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000196">&#160;</a>

make it clear that a local authority that decides to move towards
flexible tenancies is not thereby obliged to make every tenancy
flexible. It is not obliged to apply that to every part of its area. It
might take a geographically based view about where flexibility was
better and where it was not, or about the category of tenants. However,
local authorities will be required to publish that, it must be clearly
in the public domain and, of course, any tenancy will be let in a
transparent way to the tenant, who will be fully aware of the
terms.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000197">&#160;</a>

are important protections for tenants that we propose directing the
regulator to set. We shall consult on the draft direction later in the
spring. The clause itself provides important statutory protections for
those who are granted a flexible tenancy. A person who is offered a
flexible tenancy by a prospective landlord may request a review of the
landlord’s decision on the length of term offered. The landlord
will be required to look at their decision again and explain how it was
reached in light of their published tenancy policy. Tenants will
usually be able to terminate their tenancy at any stage, as we would
expect, but they will still enjoy the same protections from eviction as
a secure tenant during the flexible term. The local authority will need
to demonstrate to the court that one or more of the usual grounds for
possession is proven, and that it is acting reasonably in seeking
possession before the end of the tenancy
period.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000200">&#160;</a>

underlined is the fact that, in many cases, we would expect the tenancy
to be renewed. If we take the example of the family that I mentioned
earlier moving into the three-bedroom home with a tenure period, it
might be worth while to report that the youngest child would then be 22
years old. There might be good reasons why the family still required
their three-bedroom home, and a good reason to extend their tenancy for
a further period. I am sure that there are other
examples.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000201">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I wonder, in the modern-day context, about the
likelihood of the 22-year-old’s moving out of the tenancy. If
they are one of the young people who are lucky enough to inherit
£27,000 of tuition fees and go off to university, even at the
end of that stage they might have to go back to the family home. We are
seeing a growing social trend throughout the country of young people
staying at home until their early 30s. The Minister’s example is
good, but I am not sure that it well reflects the modern-day society in
which we

10 years’ time, the landscape might be different. I fully

the landlord decides that the tenancy should not be extended, it is
essential that the tenant is given the opportunity to challenge that
decision as well as sufficient time to find alternative accommodation
following advice and support from the landlord. Local authority
landlords will be required to serve a notice on the tenant six months
before the end of the flexible tenancy. I can perhaps describe that as
stage 1 of coming to the 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>end of a flexible tenancy. That will tell the tenant that they are
minded not to reissue the tenancy at the end of the fixed
term.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000204">&#160;</a>

notice will set out the reasons for the decision, which should reflect
the landlord’s published policy and give the tenant the
opportunity to seek an internal review. When that review upholds the
landlord’s original decision, the tenant will have a right to
challenge the landlord’s right of possession as part of the
possession proceedings in the county court. That will be on the grounds
that the landlord has failed to conduct the review properly or made an
error in
law.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000205">&#160;</a>

about maximising the efficiency of plant. I fully understand that that
is an issue, but these are people’s homes. My hon. Friend the

communities, which people have committed to. There is a big difference

concern. It is absolutely right that people should feel that they have
secured possession of their home. They will know what length of time
they have their secure possession for, and they will know that at the
end of that period, if their circumstances require it, they can
continue to have that home. The hon. Member for Gateshead drew my
attention to the possibility that older children might still be living
in the house. In such circumstances, it would be absolutely appropriate
for the tenancy to be
extended.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000207">&#160;</a>

is reasonable for the Committee to look at the way in which social

list? That is the key

                           </strong> Yes. That is correct. I want to pick up on
another point that was made earlier when I was awaiting inspiration.
The right to buy will be available for a tenant who has spent five
years or more in social housing—even if they move to different
social housing—and that also applies to the right to acquire in
the registered social sector. I hope that reassures the hon. Member for
Lewisham East that we will not be dispossessing those tenants from
their rights to buy and to acquire under existing
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000209">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
was saying that the first step is that notice will be served six months
before the landlord seeks possession, and there is the possibility of a
tenant challenging that intention in the county court. Step 2 is that
the landlord will be required to serve a second notice two months
before seeking possession. The court must make a

debate that the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and I had,
which I am sure that you do not want us to repeat, Mr Bayley, dealt
with the circumstances that might arise there. Taken together, there
are important protections for tenants to set alongside the new freedoms
that we are providing for landlords.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000210">&#160;</a>

respond to some of the points that arose in the debate that I have not
dealt with so far. I have dealt with the significant points that the
hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View made from the Front Bench; I am
sure that she will advise me if that is not the case. The hon. Member
for Scunthorpe said that the proposals would be a particular problem
for older people, and he quoted extensively from a submission from Age
UK. I hope that I have said enough to make it clear that it is hard to
see how any responsible landlord would see any need, in giving a
tenancy in specialist accommodation, or even just a bungalow or a flat,
to an older single person, to do anything other than provide a lifetime
tenancy.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000211">&#160;</a>

in mind that we are discussing the social landlord sector, some of the
fears that have been expressed have seriously undervalued both the
spirit and the integrity of social landlords. Under clause 129 we
discussed the duty of the Secretary of State to set out those matters,
and I have lingered perhaps slightly too long on the direction and what
is in there, but I invite hon. Members with real concerns to look at
pages 48 and 49 of the document dealing with the consultation
responses, so that Members are fully aware of the Government’s
intention.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000212">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Lewisham East asked whether we had experience of the
private rented sector. I wondered whether it was a bit of a revivalist
meeting where we were supposed to put our hands up, but I put my hands
up and say that I spent four years in the private rented sector at
three different addresses, so if that qualifies me to know anything
about it, I want to claim my
badge.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000213">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In asking that question, I was making the point
that members of the Committee, if they have lived in rented
accommodation of any sort—private or social—will probably
recognise the feelings of insecurity and instability that come
alongside having a short tenancy, where one does not know what will
happen after the one or two years is up. Did the Minister’s
experience in rented accommodation lead him to feel that way in any
respect?<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000214">&#160;</a>

to the revivalist feel. However, I would say that a tenancy that was
given for only two years would be exceptional. My right hon. Friend the
Minister for Housing and Local Government has cited an example from his
own constituency on a couple of occasions in debate. That example
concerns a gentleman who suffered serious injuries and disability, and
who clearly needed short-term accommodation to get his life back on
track. There will be special cases for which a two-year tenancy is
appropriate but, as we have explicitly said, it would not be
appropriate for vulnerable households, and particularly those with
children. I hope that that addresses the point made by the hon. Member
for Lewisham East.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000215">&#160;</a>

practical experience of them, which I certainly do not discount. I
shall read her words in <em>Hansard </em>because she made some important
points that we must not overlook. What we aim to provide is a framework
for this new proposal that will reassure vulnerable families that their
future homes are not being put at risk. The Government well understand
the points that have been made about the need to preserve the stability
in a community, and to preserve people’s motivation to look
after their homes and to play an active part in what we might rather
grandly call civic society. They will certainly be considerations that
should be taken into account, and if they do not appear in suitable
words in the direction that the Secretary of State publishes, I am sure
that plenty of Opposition Members will point to my words now and
question whether we achieved

communities while drawing on his experience of churn in the private

with significant numbers of private rented property, and I recognise
that that can be a problem. London is an outstanding example of that.
Our proposal clearly will not make a difference to the private rented
sector, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I hope my response to the

properties in the private rented sector. There were about 2,500 that
were owner-occupied and about 450 in the local authority sector, which
was relatively low for my borough. The small estates containing the
local authority housing were made up of high-demand, low turnover
properties, but outside my ward, where the local authority properties
were at a much higher density, there were particular estates in which
there was high turnover and relatively low demand. We always want to
strike a balance in housing management by not destabilising very stable
communities while at the same time bringing some stability to the areas
in which there is not such high demand. At the moment, I fail to see
how these provisions would help us to achieve

flexibility, but some authorities will. That brings me to the right

flexibility was available. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman has

quality of the debate on the clause simply due to their vast
experience, including from working in and around the housing sector for

do nothing to support families or communities, and add further churn,
risk and worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000221">&#160;</a>

where I talked to young people who were living in the private rented
sector. I heard repeatedly that those people did not have any sense of
community because they lived somewhere for a short period—six
months or a year—and then moved on. Sadly, the introduction of
flexible tenancies and the possible increase in their use will do
nothing to help to make communities sustainable.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000222">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Given that
housing is a scarce resource and tenants will be presenting in need,
does the Minister not have any worries that there will be a sort of
“take it or leave it” situation with people saying,
“We are going to offer you a shorter tenancy; sorry, if you do
not like it, tough”? I know tenants who have concerns along
those lines and we are certainly not happy with the way in which the
provision is written. The Minister has not persuaded Labour Members
that any of his proposals will do any more than move the pieces around
more frequently. The hon. Member for Croydon Central talked about the
need to move people around different parts of the waiting list in the
interests of fairness. Unfortunately, unless there is stock, all that
happens is that people are moved from one place to another and there is
no stability in the system. The supply must be
increased.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000227">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady raises the point about a
“take it or leave it” situation. My presentation was
diverted several times, so let me point out that the first step is the
requirement to give tenants notification six months before the end of
their flexible tenancy that the landlord is minded not to reissue it.
At that point, the tenant has the right to challenge the
decision—first, internally with the landlord and, secondly, if
necessary, in the court. That is prior to the second notice two months
before seeking
possession.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000228">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is not quite the end of the process that I
was discussing. I was talking about the up-front process where people
are, in the first instance, offered tenancies but told that they can
have only two years or five years when they might feel that they need,
or are likely to need, a more secure form of tenancy. That puts them in
a difficult
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000229">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister says that the Law Commission report would have required major
changes. That is the case, but he cannot seriously be suggesting that
the measures that the Government are introducing, whether in health,
education or housing—it is certainly the case for
housing—are not major changes that will not be more disruptive
than something that has been talked about, thought through and
discussed with every sector of the housing world. His argument does not
stand
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000230">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman talked about information around tenancy strategies and
the length of tenancies going into the strategies, but what discussions
has he had with lenders about how they would view different areas of
the country with different strategies and tenancy lengths? Would they
view those that had a smaller number of options as a better bet for
investment because there would be more certainty in the system? Is he
saying that he expects the market indirectly to influence the type of
tenancies that are offered? Lenders might have expressed a view that
they would prefer tenancies of certain lengths and certain types of
security.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think I speak for all Opposition members of the
Committee when I express my regret at the decision to keep clause 130
in the Bill. Clause 131 is linked to that clause and prescribes the
circumstances in which an introductory tenancy, on coming to an end,
becomes a flexible tenancy. It also sets out the compensation
arrangements available to secure tenants of local authorities and how
that will not apply to the new
tenancies.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
is largely a technical clause, but it raises a number of concerns. I
would welcome clarification from the Minister on introductory tenancies
that are to become flexible tenancies, which is the change to the
Housing Act 1996 outlined in proposed new section 137A. Will
the new tenancy be for two years, or will it take account of the year
already spent in a home, meaning that a family will, in effect, have
only six months’ tenure before their position is reconsidered
and they may have to move
on?<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
demoted tenancies, proposed new section 143MA seems to suggest that a
family who previously earned themselves a demotion because of their
behaviour will be re-offered not a secure tenancy, but only a flexible
one. Is that interpretation correct? We understand the need for demoted
tenancies as a means of encouraging improved behaviour, but equally, we
know that some families are dysfunctional—for want of a better
word—for only a short period and, with appropriate support and
intervention, can get themselves back on track as good members of their
community. An incidence of mental health problems may have caused
behavioural issues that led to the demotion, but with care and
treatment that might be managed. Those are exactly the type of people
who need a sense of security in their lives, so if they are further
penalised and lose their right to a secure tenancy, that may well not
have a positive long-term outcome. Is that the effect that the proposed
new section will have, or will it allow people to revert to their
secure tenancy? That is not clear, and I would welcome the
Minister’s
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government have taken their position on compensation for work
undertaken on cost grounds; that is understood. However, a great deal
of evidence suggests that people living in short-term lettings do not,
in general, worry about the upkeep of either the property or the wider
area. I am concerned about how properties will be maintained, and I
hope that the Minister can reassure us. I remember very well the
appalling state of disrepair of social housing that was inherited by
Labour in 1997 after 18 years of Tory neglect. Some of the stock was in
such a poor state of disrepair that it was not possible to refurbish
it, and some of it had to be demolished. Moreover, a significant sum of
money that could have been put into building new homes went instead
into the decent homes programme to deal with the backlog and to keep
homes available for rent. I hope that the Minister can tell us that the
clause will not risk a slow slip back towards those levels of disrepair
after all the work of the past 13 years, which enabled so many local
authorities to return much of their stock to a decent standard suitable
for letting.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000267">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That
brings me back to the issue of suitability. Another good reason for the
Government to reconsider the two-year period—I touched on this
earlier—is that there is less buy-in from the community where
short-term tenancies of two years or perhaps a little longer are the
norm. I would welcome the Minister’s view on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that you will rule this out of order if it falls outside the
clause’s remit, Mr Bayley, but will the Minister confirm that
housing associations with assured tenants are already able to use the
ground 9 provision to manage stock as long as there is suitable
accommodation to move tenants to? How does that fit in with this clause
and the previous
one?<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000269">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the hon. Lady says, this is largely a
technical clause. To clarify, the introductory tenancy period is in
addition to the flexible tenancy period, and not deducted from it.
Although I understand her perplexity at the clause’s
language—I also sought clarification on it—I am reliably
informed that its wording achieves our intention, which is that when
demoted tenants come to the end of their demotion period, they get back
whatever they had
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000270">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sorry to raise the issue, but can the
Minister say why, at the termination of a flexible tenancy, a demoted
tenancy would be created? At the termination of a flexible tenancy, the
landlord has the right of possession, subject to the matters that we
debated earlier. If the landlord were unsatisfied with the conduct of
the tenant, what on earth is the logic of offering a demoted tenancy? I
cannot see the
purpose.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a really good question. I shall wait for
the answer. I do not want to speculate before receiving divine
inspiration, but probably both of us have slightly misunderstood the
text. By way of introduction, I said that the clause was highly
technical, and I have certainly found it problematic to
interpret.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The intention
is to make sure that demoted tenancies are essentially in the same
position at the end as they were immediately before the commencement.
The hon. Lady asked about the use of ground 9 to manage stock; both
statistical evidence and feedback from landlords suggest strongly that
that is not effective and that, in fact, landlords do have to offer
suitable alternative housing in any
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Why
demote a flexible tenancy? I can now answer the right hon. Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich. A landlord could demote a tenancy during a
flexible tenancy. It might make sense if there was a long, fixed-term
period in the same way as for a secure tenancy. Once the demotion
period has been served, the provision allows the position to be
reinstated. As I strongly suspected, both he and I were slightly misled
by the technical phraseology of the
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000274">&#160;</a>

tenancy when they have the right of possession? I still remain
absolutely mystified. Perhaps the problem is the wording of the Bill,
and if so, I should be grateful to know whether the Government will
have a further look at it. It certainly implies something other than

other point: I may have given a misleading impression about the
termination of tenancies. The court challenge by a tenant would be at
the six-month stage against possession action, when the landlord seeks
possession on an error-of-law basis; that would be the same as for any
possession proceedings. With that, I hope that members of the Committee

welcome the provision to enable people to keep their rights, as that is
the only way to maintain some flexibility in the system. That issue has
informed debates, including those prompted by the Hills review and
those on how social mobility, specifically in the social housing
sector, affects and restricts employment opportunities. We know from
evidence that families are reluctant to move, and to sever local and
family ties, if jobs are low paid and insecure. However, for those who
want to transfer, a national scheme should be
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000283">&#160;</a>

are absolutely protected; if they choose to move to one of the new
affordable rent homes, there is not a floor that requires that to be
the case. A landlord could easily determine to offer that continued

that the guarantee that the Minister for Housing and Local Government

difficulty finding options for people who need to transfer into
alternative secure tenancies. If they are in a position to say,
“If you move into an affordable rent tenancy, you lose your
security,” many tenants will feel that it is Hobson’s
choice—either they have to move to get a decent home, or they
have to stay in grossly overcrowded conditions to retain their
security. That was not the pledge that the Minister for Housing and
Local Government gave, which was that all existing tenants would retain

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman has made his point, but
we are talking about the preservation of those rights in socially
rented accommodation; that is the pledge made by both the Minister for
Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State. I am taking
stock of what the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich and the
hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View, have said, and I will take stock
of the precise nature of what we have announced. I certainly do not
want to contradict anything that the Secretary of State has said on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000290">&#160;</a>

everything that we have introduced, we have been clear that existing
social tenants are protected while they continue to have social

to another tenancy. That applies to the arrangements for flexible

                           </strong> This is extremely important. The Minister has
just said that existing secure tenants will continue to enjoy security
if they remain in their existing tenancies or transfer to another
tenancy. Those are the words that he used. That is not compatible with
the passage in the response to the consultation paper that my hon.
Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View highlighted. If tenants lose
their security as a result of accepting a

                           </strong> Yes, I certainly will. I do not think we are
talking about two different situations. The guarantee always applies if
existing secure tenants or existing assured tenants are required to
move by the landlord. But if a tenant chooses to move to an affordable
rent property, it is reasonable that discretion should be available to
the landlord as to whether that remains in place in that particular
case. A tenant’s decision to choose to do that might be linked
to what offer he or she thought the landlord was making about
longer-term security. In a situation in which there is a requirement to
move, the guarantee continues without exception. In a situation where a
tenant chooses to move to affordable rent, it could be maintained by
the landlord, but it is not part of what I have described as the floor
requirement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000293">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think the Minister is saying that there is no
assurance to tenants in overcrowded conditions who need to move for
personal reasons. They might have to choose to take a less secure
tenancy to address those needs. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Greenwich and Woolwich is clearly saying that there is no assurance to
such people in that situation, which is
disgraceful.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000294">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have already given the example of my family
with their three teenage children. Their route to getting a suitable
home would be to take out a 10-year tenancy agreement on a
three-bedroom house, which would be subject to review at the end of
that time. That would be one option. They could choose not to do so.
They could choose to remain and wait for another option to become
available. I do not want to speculate too far how a local authority
might arrange its flexibility, but they might go to part of the borough
where the local authority had a different tenancy
arrangement.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000295">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When I stood up to speak on the clause, it was
not my intention to press it to a vote. I thought I was going to
receive reassurance from the Minister. In fact, he dug himself into an
even bigger hole. To his credit, he said that he would go away and take
stock of the comments made by my hon. Friends, and I hope that he will
do so, but I have deep misgivings about the discretion of the landlord.
If someone chooses to take a tenancy, they could lose the security that
they were enjoying. It is still not clear what would happen in the case
of a mutual exchange which, by default, is a choice that someone has
made. Will all the people on mutual exchange registers find themselves
in a position where they could move but lose their existing
tenants’ rights? I am afraid that we are going to put the clause
to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000296">&#160;</a>

amendment will no doubt seem familiar to the Committee, as it is
broadly similar to amendment 220, which we debated on 1 March as part
of our consideration of clause 121. The Minister criticised that
amendment as badly drafted, which is a pity, because it used the same
language as clause 134, courtesy of his parliamentary
draftsman.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000330">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">With
the amendment, we are again seeking to extend protection to
carers—something on which I am sure my hon. Friend the Member
for Worsley and Eccles South will have a view—to live-in
siblings and to people who are in a relationship but are not married.
Following from our debate on amendment 220, I am sure that the Minister
will say that there is no need for the amendment, that there is
provision for local flexibility and that therefore he is not minded to
accept the amendment. However, I would like to draw the
Committee’s attention to subsection (5), which states that the
provisions apply
if<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000331">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>Under the clause, two
or more people can be considered the spouse or civil partner of the
tenant and have statutory succession rights, but carers or siblings
cannot. There may be Liberals in the Government, some of whom are even
still liberal-minded, but even I cannot believe that the Minister
intends to legislate for bigamists’ rights ahead of those of
live-in carers.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000333">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am not alone
in being concerned about the way in which the Government are seeking to
remove succession rights for carers. Age UK said in its
submission:<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000334">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Given
the contribution of carers, they deserve to succeed to a tenancy or
have an offer of alternative social housing with a lifetime
tenancy.”<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000372">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Our
amendment would do that and give succession rights to carers. I
appreciate that the Minister will say that there is provision for local
councils to do so on a discretionary basis, but carers deserve better.
Clearly, organisations with experience such as Age UK believe that the
Bill as it stands offers inadequate protection, which is why we tabled
the amendment. We would like to hear the Minister say that he will make
his one acceptance of an amendment in this
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000335">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">

                           </strong> Clause 154 is needed, because at the moment
different rules exist for secure tenants of arm’s length
management organisations and councils, and for assured tenants of
registered social landlords. Both types of tenants can be succeeded by
a spouse or a partner, but secure tenants can also be succeeded by
another family member. Importantly, there can be only one succession to
a tenancy, so if the existing tenant was a successor they cannot by law
be succeeded by anyone else, regardless of the circumstances. We
propose an equalisation of rights for new social tenants with secure,
assured, flexible or assured shorthold tenancies, with one mandatory
succession for spouses and partners. I must say for the sake of
completeness that we are looking at the case for a technical amendment
to clauses 134 and 135, because there may be some confusion or
ambiguity in the wording. It is not clear that a non-spouse or partner
can succeed where there has not already been a succession, and we
intend to correct that in due course.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000336">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We propose to
give landlords the power to vary tenancy agreements to give whatever
further succession rights they choose, which is a move in the direction
that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View is seeking. At the moment,
the succession rights are clear and absolute, but giving landlords the
ability to vary tenancy agreements means that they can, at their
discretion, have a tenancy policy that covers the point that the hon.
Lady has made. That will happen for the first time. This new freedom
will allow landlords to act on a case-by-case basis; if they believe
that the individual circumstances of the household merit a further
succession, they can vary the tenancy agreement accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000337">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The proposed
changes in the clause will bring flexibility to landlords and certainty
to tenants. The ability of a landlord to customise succession rights
means that before they move in, prospective residents such as adult
children seeking to care for elderly parents will be aware of their
position, and landlords can exercise more control over their stock.
Landlords will not be limited by the one succession rule, nor will they
be required to allow family members who would not otherwise qualify for
social housing to take over a tenancy that they do not need. That seems
to me to be the right position; it gives landlords flexibility to
accommodate the cases to which the hon. Lady has drawn attention, but
it does not impose a legal obligation on them to do so and perhaps to
become involved in considerable discussions about whether the carer is
in an appropriate relationship with the household, which is always an
area of risk for a housing authority.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000338">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the hon. Lady will accept my assurances that the proposal
gives landlords the opportunity for the first time to exercise their
discretion in exactly the direction that she is requesting, and that
that flexibility is better than having a legislative requirement that
might result in local authorities giving succession rights in
inappropriate cases.<a class="bkMark" name="11030854000339">&#160;</a>

this being a tidying-up process, and I understand that clauses 134 and
135 need further tidying up. I also heard him say, “This is a
