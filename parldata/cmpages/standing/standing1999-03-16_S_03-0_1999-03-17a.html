<H4><center>Memorandum from the Immigration Advisory Scheme</center></H4>
<P>
The Immigration Advisory Service is the largest national charitable organisation in the country providing representation at immigration and asylum appeals. We, and our predecessor organisation UKIAS, have been undertaking appeals work since the system itself was set up in 1970.
<P>
Apart from our dealings with the independent Appellate Authorities and the Presenting Officers who represent the Secretary of State's interests at appeals, we are also in daily contact with the Home Office, Immigration Officers and Entry Clearance Officers, and have compendious knowledge of how the whole system of control works.
<P>
IAS has responded to the Government's consultation papers last year on detention, review of appeals, regulation of unscrupulous immigration advisers and the White Paper Fairer, Faster and Firmer. With nearly thirty years' experience behind us, we are particularly well placed to assist the Committee in those aspects of the Bill which propose to change the structure of our immigration controls and appeal system. We can also comment usefully, if more briefly, on other aspects which impinge upon our area of expertise. We will focus particularly in these submissions on:
<P>
1. abolition of deportation appeals;
<P>
2. re-introduction of visitor appeals;
<P>
3. financial bonds for visitors,
<P>
4. bail for immigration detainees;
<P>
5. "one-stop" appeals;
<P>
6. "Human Rights" appeals.
<H4><center>The Bill generally</center></H4>
<P>
IAS welcomes certain aspects of the Bill, such as the simplification of immigration control, reintroduction of a right of appeal for family visitors, regular bail hearings and the regulation of immigration advisers but feels that the provisions relating to these need improvement if they are not to lead to difficulties. IAS considers that an opportunity has been missed in the Bill to consolidate existing legislation in a more comprehensive way and to give it the same lasting effect as the Immigration Act 1971, There are some provisions which are potentially pernicious.
<H4><center>Part I: changing the system?</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 1. Pre-entry and on-entry control
<P>
Government seeks to "modernise" the way that passengers are issued with visas before they travel, and the procedures that they go through on arrival. It would certainly simplify matters if an entry clearance counted as leave to enter, but passengers must still have endorsed on their passports the date that their leave to enter commences, how long it is for, and the conditions that it is subject to. Otherwise they will not be able to prove that they are here lawfully. Once people have been given leave to enter or remain here, it is anomalous that this leave automatically lapses once they leave the British Isles, even if they just go for a day trip to France, and that they need to seek leave to enter from an Immigration Officer on their return. The proposal that leave should not lapse in this way is sensible, but we are concerned that an Immigration Officer may still have power to bar admission to a returning passenger. Paragraph 38 of Schedule 12 states that a passenger who arrives with leave to enter which was given to him before his arrival, may have that leave cancelled by an Immigration Officer in certain circumstances, and will have no in-country right of appeal against that cancellation. It is not clear whether this paragraph is intended to cover only those passengers coming with an entry clearance which also counts as leave to enter, or whether it extends to people who are already here with leave and who go away and come back during the currency of that leave.
<H4><center>Amendment to Sch. 12, para 38</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Examination of persons who arrive with combined entry clearance and leave to enter"
<P>
2A.--(1) This paragraph applies to a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with a current entry clearance which includes leave to enter which was given to him before his arrival."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 3. Charging for applications
<P>
Charges are already levied for visas and for citizenship applications, so it is not surprising that applications to vary or extend one's leave should also be subject to a fee. With the current shambles at the Home Office, however, now is not the time to introduce this. Only when the Integrated Casework Directorate is working properly and the long-delayed computer system is functioning, should the IND be even thinking of charging people for this service. There must be quality assurance standards and a "customers' charter", with fees refunded in full if those standards are not met. Fees must not be so high as to cause hardship. The statement at paragraph 41 of the "Explanatory Notes" to the Bill that fees "will reflect the full cost of processing the application" needs to be amplified, What level of fees is the Government thinking of?
<P>
Clause 6. Abolition of deportation appeals
<P>
This is a clause in the Bill to which we are wholly opposed. It is wrong in principle, and it will not work in practice. A person may in future be removed if "he does not observe a condition attached to his leave" and will have no opportunity before removal, as he has now, to challenge this allegation at an appeal, where he might prove that he was not, for example, working in breach of his conditions as alleged. A person may also be removed if "he remains beyond the time limited by his leave", but this can happen quite inadvertently, for example when somebody with an existing leave applies to the Home Office for an extension of that leave and, because of some minor omission, the application form is returned to him as invalid. By the time he resubmits his application, his leave may have run out, and he will have become an overstayer, subject to immediate removal. Other people presently entrust their immigration affairs to incompetent or unscrupulous advisers, who do not tell them their true situation, while still others are brought here as children and are left in the care of others for many years, with no knowledge of their status or of the need for it to be regularised.
<P>
But there are also people who overstay deliberately, and they seem to be at the root of the Government"s distinction between people who are here lawfully, and will retain a right of appeal, and those who are here unlawfully, and will lose their right of appeal against deportation. This distinction is fundamentally flawed. Although we deplore the flouting of our immigration laws, many such people have been here for many years and have committed no other offence, indeed have married and started families, have children who are at school here, have jobs and their own houses, in short have put down roots. They should have an opportunity to let an independent judicial officer assess the merits of their case before being removed. Absent such an appeal, people facing removal will either seek judicial review, invoke the human rights appeal envisaged by clause 47, or claim asylum. Speedy removals--the desideratum of this clause--will not be effected. Rather than amending parts of this clause we would therefore suggest:
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
delete clause 6 and para. 30(2) of Sch. 12<P>
<P>
Clauses 7 & 8. Financial bonds
<P>
The Government has responded to widespread calls from the minority communities in this country that people sponsoring visitors from abroad should be able to back that up by giving a financial guarantee that the visitor will leave the UK. We applaud this example of the Government's willingness to listen, but we would enter certain caveats. There should be no requirement for security to be given, as in cl. 7(1); it should be voluntary in every case. While obviously the giving of a security will count in the applicant's favour, we must not get to a situation where applicants are refused just because they do not proffer a guarantee, or where guarantees are routinely expected at some British posts and not at all at others. Lastly, the amount of security being suggested--between £5,000 and £10,000--would disqualify the less well-to-do. While we recognise that the amount would have to be sufficient to deter people from staying on as "economic migrants", it should be geared to the applicant's, or the sponsor's, ability to pay: a kind of "unit fine".
<P>
On Thursday, 4 March 1999 at the IAS conference, the Minister, Mike O'Brien MP, indicated that in the pilot scheme a bond would be required only after an initial refusal. If this is to be the case, it will be seen that those who would otherwise be excluded from the UK can "buy" their way in--thereby discriminating against those who cannot pay. This also throws in doubt whether an appeal can be made against the refusal of entry clearance as a family visitor on the grounds that no bond should have been demanded at all, or that the amount demanded was unreasonably large. The pilot scheme adumbrated in the White Paper must be run at a representative sample of British posts overseas so that any serious problems with the proposal can be identified and, if it turns out to be working unfairly or inefficiently, consideration can be given to the merits of proceeding with the full-blown scheme. Paragraph 51 of the Explanatory Notes makes it clear that the financial bond scheme is intended for visitors only, but the wording of clauses 7 & 8 is not so restricted, and should be clarified accordingly. As drafted, the Bill would enable the Government to extend the requirement for bond or financial security to any application for entry clearance and subsequent leave to remain, not just visits.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>

</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 13. Code of practice for employers
<P>
We are disappointed that the Government has gone back on a clear commitment to repeal section 8 of the 1996 Act. Employers, like most people, are bewildered by the complexity of our immigration law, and rather than trying to understand the numerous ways in which they might establish a defence against prosecution for employing people who are not entitled to work (listed in the Secretary of State's order made under section 8), many have been playing safe by not considering applicants who look like immigrants. Their confusion will only be compounded by making them apply a code of practice that tells them not to discriminate, and an Act of Parliament that tells them to discriminate (although in a different way). Employers have enough on their plate without all this. Anti-racist measures are likely to be increased anyway in the wake of the Lawrence Inquiry. There have been no prosecutions to date under section 8, although Mr O'Brien has indicated that some prosecutions are now being contemplated against employers who knowingly employ illegal sweated labour. But in fact, the criminal sanctions available against such people in the 1971 Act would be an effective alternative if only they were used. Both section 8 and the code or practice should be dropped.
<P>
Clause 14. Entry clearance monitor
<P>
There seems to be a mistake in cl. 14(l), where it refers to section 42(5). To make sense, this should be section 42(4). Apart from that, we would only comment that, despite the valiant efforts of the peripatetic Dame Elizabeth Anson, one person cannot, by occasional checks upon a small sample of our posts overseas--and only about 3% of refusals where there is no right of appeal have been monitored--remedy the loss of the appeal rights taken away by the 1993 Act. The most significant and contentious of those rights, namely for "family visits", is to be restored anyway, so it would make sense to restore the right of appeal for the remaining visitors and for the students who have enrolled on short courses, or wish to look around for courses when they get here. Visitors and students do bring money into the country and create jobs, a fact which should not be lost sight of in the anxiety to prevent overstaying and illegal working. Restoring their appeal rights would do away with the need for a monitor.
<P>
Clause 15. Reporting suspicious marriages
<P>
There already exists a procedure whereby a marriage registrar can report his suspicions about a particular couple to the Registrar General, who can contact the Home Office if he thinks these suspicions have substance. To go beyond this and impose a statutory duty upon marriage registrars to report their suspicions to the Secretary of State, is a novel and unacceptable extension of state intrusion into private lives that cannot, in the words of the European Convention, be "necessary in a democratic society", The duty would be unenforceable anyway. What if a registrar has suspicions which he keeps to himself? Unlike a priest or minister who will normally ascertain by lengthy discussion whether a couple are ready to undertake the obligations of marriage before marrying them in a church, a civil registrar will have minimal contact with a couple. Even the extra requirements imposed by Part IX of the Bill--that each party must give notice to the registrar and fumish particulars of their name, age, marital status and nationality--can hardly afford a registrar the opportunity to form "reasonable grounds for suspecting that the marriage will be a sham marriage". Besides, the definition of "sham marriage" at cl. 15(5)(b) is defective: "entered into . . . for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of immigration law" should read "sole purpose". We would add our concern about the provision in cl. 133 where "the superintendent registrar is not satisfied that there is no lawful impediment to the issue of the certificate". It is notoriously difficult to prove a negative, as the Govement acknowledged when it abolished the "primary purpose" rule, under which one had to prove that one had not got married primarily to come to the UK. How is a person who has never been married to prove that?
<P>
Part III: bail
<P>
We welcome the right to two "routine" bail hearings in addition to the pre-existing scheme in the 1971 Act (as amended by the 1996 Act) for applying for bail to an appellate authority or to a Chief Immigration Officer. In the absence of any limit to the length of detention, or of any judicial scrutiny of the legality of detention (save by way of habeas corpus), we fear, however, that the purpose of these routine bail hearings is more cosmetic than substantial, There is, for example, no penalty imposed upon the Secretary of State if he fails to refer a detainee to the court within the time limits laid down in cl. 29, nor are there criteria laid down to guide magistrates, such as in the Bail Act. At present representatives frequently have no time in which to acquaint themselves with the Secretary of State's arguments against bail which are often produced only minutes before the bail hearing. Either the legislation or the procedural rules should specify that either the bail summary or the new reasons for refusal of bail should be made available'to the representative at least 48 hours before the hearing. To ameliorate the shortcomings of the new scheme, we recommend that certain amendments be made to Part III.
<P>
The location of bail hearings in cl. 30 should not include prisons or detention centres. The process would not be seen to be independent and, fair, public access would be difficult, and the only possible justification would be to save the cost of providing escorts to detainees. The same goes for the use of live television links at cl. 35, which would make it impossible for a representative to take instructions in private. At bail hearings before magistrates or a sheriff, cl. 34(6) provides that the Secretary of State may be represented by a Presenting Officer who is not a barrister or solicitor, but does not state whether a detainee may be represented by someone who is not a barrister or solicitor. Cl. 37 envisages voluntary organisations like the IAS representing detainees at bail hearings, but not all of our caseworkers are members of the legal professions.
<H4><center>amendments</center></H4>

At the end of cl 29(9) add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The court may take such failure into account when determining whether the detained person should be released on bail."<P>

In cl. 30, delete (2)(c) & (d) and in (2)(e) replace "(d)" with "(b).
<P>
Replace the first two lines of cl. 34(6) with:

At the end of cl. 35(3)(a) delete "and", and at the end of (3)(b) add:

"; and
(c) the detailed person's representative is able to take instructions from him in private."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<H4><center>Part IV: appeals</center></H4>
<P>
Part IV largely re-enacts Part 11 of the 1971 Act, which is repealed at Schedule 14 of the Bill, but makes some important chances. Clause 51 in Part IV also repeats most of section 8 of the 1993 Act, but the latter section is not repealed--a surprising omission.
<P>
Clause 42(4) & (5). Visit appeals
<P>
A "family visitor" will be able to appeal against the refusal of entry clearance. We certainly welcome this, but one associated matter needs clarification, and another needs to be changed. A "family visitor" is to have "such meaning as may be prescribed". We hope this will be wide enough to take account of the "extended" family which is normal in non-Western societies, and to take account of the non-marital relationships which are now recognised in the Home Office concession of October 1997. No fee should be payable for the appeal. Even though the fee is to be refunded if the appeal is successful, it is wrong in principle that a person aggrieved at a decision of the executive should pay for exercising a statutory right of appeal against that decision. None of the numerous administrative tribunals which hear appeals against the DSS, the Inland Revenue, the Child Support Agency and numerous other government bodies charge for this service, which has become a hallmark of the rule of law in our democratic society.
<H4><center>amendments</center></H4>
<P>
We would prefer to delete cl. 42(3)-(5) so as to restore rights of appeal to the categories of person outlined in (3)(a)-(d)
. Failing that, we would delete (5), so that a fee would not be payable for a "family visitor" appeal.
<P>
Replace cl. 42(9) with:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(9) 'Family visitor' means a person who intends to visit another person who is related to him by blood or marriage or associated with him by a relationship akin to marriage and who is present or settled in the United Kingdom."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 43. Variation of limited leave
<P>
This clause seems to make a distinction between "further leave" at (1) and variation of leave at (2). A person who has a limited leave may appeal against a refusal to grant further leave, but (1) is silent about what happens when his limited leave runs out. On the other hand, a person who is refused variation of leave at (2) "may appeal against the refusal even though the limited period has ended". (2) is silent about the Variation of Leave Order ("VOLO"), which in 1976 laid down that a person's leave is automatically extended for as long as it takes for the Home Office to process his application, and for a further 28 days after that if his application is turned down. All this needs clarification. Presumably the proposal in the appeals consultation document last summer, that there would be no appeal against the refusal to vary leave if that refusal did not require the applicant to leave the United Kingdom, has been dropped, although the reference at (1) to "a limited leave under the 1971 Act" might imply that exceptional leave to remain is excluded.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
Replace cl. 43 with:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"43.--(1) A person who has a limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom may appeal to an adjudicator against any decision of the Secretary of State to vary, or to refuse to vary or extend, his leave.
<P>
(2) The Secretary of State must by order provide that if a person with a limited leave applies for a variation or extension of his leave, that leave continues until such time as the application has been decided and, if it has been refused, for a period of 28 days thereafter."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 47. Human rights
<P>
This appeal is framed very widely, against "any decision" by an immigration officer or the Secretary of State affecting a person's "entitlement to enter or remain in the United Kingdom", which is in breach of s.6(1) of the Human Rights Act. It is quite unclear how and when this appeal is to be lodged, and with whom, save for the specification at (3) that a human rights point may be taken at other proceedings which are already pending before an adjudicator or the Tribunal. Presumably a human rights appeal can be made at any other time. The Human Rights Act 1998 is actually not expected to come into force until autumn 2000, so adjudicators and the Tribunal, who are authorised at (5) to allow an appeal if the appellant's human rights have been breached, will be the first among the judiciary in Britain to be interpreting the 1998 Act and the jurisprudence of the European Court at Strasbourg. They may also find themselves considering evidence of changed circumstances since the date of the decision appealed against, and other evidence which was not before the original decision-maker. The appellate authorities have in non-asylum cases been confined to reviewing whether the decision was correct at the time when it was made, and it is unclear whether clause 47 is intended to preserve that retrospective approach or to give adjudicators jurisdiction to decide, in the light of fresh evidence, that the appellant's human rights will be breached if the decision is allowed to stand. Arguably, if the appellant's situation has changed, the Home Office should be given an opportunity to change their minds rather than leaving it to the appellate authorities, who would become in a sense the initial decision--makers.
<P>
Whilst clause 47 establishes an appellant's rights under the Human Rights Act and recognises the decision-maker's responsibilities to conform to standards set by the European Convention on Human Rights, it is a matter of concern that overseas applicants are excluded from these provisions. Where an overseas applicant is seeking family reunion under one of the provisions for this under the rules they are excluded, for jurisdictional reasons, from raising any ECHR issues. The UK sponsor in such cases should, we believe, be included as a party to the appeal where such a human rights issue is raised--as the most likely claim in these circumstances would be a breach of Article 8--right to family life, Omission of such a provision will only result in litigation by sponsors through the higher courts (even up to Strasbourg) where they may have a valid claim which would be costly and time-consuming for all concerned.
<H4><center>amendments</center></H4>
<P>
At the end of cl. 47(1) add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If evidence which could materially affect that decision is produced to the adjudicator, but has not been produced to the immigration officer or the Secretary of State, the adjudicator may refer such evidence to him for reconsideration of his decision before proceeding with the appeal."<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the adjudicator, or the Tribunal, decides that the action of the immigration officer or the Secretary of State has resulted, or will result, in a breach of the appellant's human rights, the appeal may be allowed on that ground."<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A person who alleges that an Entry Clearance Officer has, in taking a decision relating to an application for entry clearance, acted in breach of his human rights may become a party to any appeal to an adjudicator or the Tribunal against that decision and the appeal may be allowed on that ground.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 48. Removal directions
<P>
Overstayers as well as illegal entrants are to have no right of appeal according to (3) until they have been removed from the UK, unless they lodge a human rights appeal or claim asylum. As most people are likely to do one or other of those, the whole point of abolishing deportation appeals is nugatory. It would be far better if overstayers and illegal entrants had a final "one stop" appeal before removal, like the one at cl. 55 for those whose leave has not expired, at which all the issues can be canvassed. There is a saving provision at paragraph 3 of Schedule 13, whereby people who have had a decision to deport them made before the abolition of deportation appeals, will still be able to appeal. But this saving is only for those whose appeal rights are "restricted" because they have been here for fewer than seven years. There is no equivalent saving provision for those with "full" rights of appeal, who have been here for longer than seven years.
<H4><center>amendments</center></H4>

Delete cl. 48(b)

At the beginning of Sch. 13, para. 3 add:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"3. Section 15 of the 1971 Act,"<P>

Clause 50(2)
<P>
There is an error in the present clause in that the reference should be to section 48 or 49 whereas the current reference is to section 41 or 49.
<P>
Clause 54(2). Removal to "safe third country"
<P>
An asylum seeker who is to be removed to a third country designated as "safe" "is not entitled to appeal under this Act as respects any matter arising before his removal from the United Kingdom". This contradicts cl.47, which would allow him to appeal against "any decision" affecting his entitlement to remain in the UK on human rights grounds.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
At the end of cl. 54(2) add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>", save under section 47."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 55. "One-stop"procedure
<P>
This compendious appeal would be appropriate for persons facing removal from the UK, when all the arguments why they should be allowed to remain could be aired. It is not appropriate for people who have sought further limited leave and been unsuccessful. Many will still have to show on appeal that they intend to leave the UK at the end of their stay as students or whatever, but at the same time they will now be expected to bring up any reasons why they should not leave the UK. It would require extraordinary mental gymnastics for an adjudicator to determine whether, at the date of the decision to refuse further leave to remain, the requirement of the Immigration Rules about intention to leave the UK in the future was satisfied, when he knows that the appellant is also saying that he should not have to leave at the present time.
<P>
Further gymnastics will be needed because, in non-asylum appeals, an adjudicator is limited to reviewing the correctness of the decision being appealed against, no matter how long ago that was made, and he cannot as a rule take account of developments since then. But now he will, in the same appeal, have to look to the present and the future if the appellant raises "additional grounds ... for wishing to remain in the United Kingdom".
<P>
These additional grounds may well raise compassionate factors, but it is not clear, although cl.58(2) implies this, that an adjudicator could allow the appeal on any such additional grounds as he thinks are sufficiently compassionate. Paragraph 10(l) of Schedule 4
 only lets an adjudicator allow an appeal if the decision appealed against "was not in accordance with the law (which now includes published Home Office concessions) or with any immigration rules applicable to the case." Presumably the adjudicator's jurisdiction would still be limited in this way. The appellant will be required by notice to include among his additional grounds any asylum claim, human rights issue or "prescribed concession" from which he may benefit. This last is particularly surprising, as by definition "concessions" are outside the statutes and the rules, and only lawyers specialising in immigration work might be expected to know them. It will be imperative therefore for an appellant to have competent legal advice, access to which will not be enhanced by this Bill. Such access is the more crucial because, if he misses the time limit set under cl.55(4)(b), he may not rely on any of these grounds if they have not already appeared among his additional grounds. Clause 56(9) does disapply this restriction "if the Secretary of State considers that the applicant had a reasonable excuse for the omission", which would include under (2)(b) the fact that he was not aware of it at the material time. But it should be possible for the appellant to ask the adjudicator to consider these matters even if the Secretary of State is not satisfied that there was a reasonable excuse for not mentioning them earlier. There already exists a "preliminary issue" procedure whereby an adjudicator can accept jurisdiction to hear an appeal if he is satisfied that the appellant had a good excuse for not lodging his appeal in time, even if the Secretary of State is not, This procedure should be extended to any dispute over "additional grounds".
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If the applicant contends before an appellate authority that his claim or appeal, as the case may be, has been wrongly certified under subsection (4) or (6), or that he should be able to rely on such ground or concession as is precluded by subsection (2) or (4), the appellate authority may set aside the certificate and give leave to rely on the ground or concession concerned."<P>

<B>Clause 56(3)-(6)</B><P>
<P>
 This introduces yet another certification procedure whereby an appellant would be prevented from raising an out-of-time asylum or human rights ground. The latter would seem to contradict cl.47(3), which permits human rights to be raised during any pending proceedings before an adjudicator or the Tribunal. The appellate authorities should have power to set aside this certificate if they do not agree with it, by analogy with their power under paragraph 9(2) of Schedule 4 to set aside a certificate which would prevent an asylum appeal being, taken to the Tribunal. But it is in principle odd that the appellate authorities should be taking the initial decision on these additional matters, without the Home Office deciding them first. It goes against the established case-law that the appellate authorities are not an extension of the decision-making process, but are there to review the decisions taken by the executive.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
At the end of cl.56 add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(11) If in the opinion of an appellate authority additional ground raised by the appellant, whether or not included in such a statement as is required under section 55(4), should be referred to the Secretary of State for consideration by him, the appellate authority concerned may defer the appellant's appeal pending such consideration."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Clause 57
<P>
This indicates that a special adjudicator will have to hear a "one-stop" appeal if it includes an asylum claim, while an ordinary adjudicator may hear an appeal under clause 58. Potentially, a "one-stop" appeal could develop an asylum aspect after it has already been allotted to an ordinary adjudicator.
<P>
Clause 58(5)
<P>
This should be deleted, as it makes no provision for any change of circumstances between the raising of an additional ground at one appeal, and the raising of that ground at another appeal, which could be years later.
<P>
Clause 59. Appeals without merit
<P>
The reference to paragraph 15 of Schedule 4 must be wrong, as there is no such paragraph. But the rules to be made by the Lord Chancellor must provide an opportunity to challenge the notice that an appeal has no merit. At present, the majority of applications for leave to appeal to the Tribunal are refused, impliedly because the appeal has no merit, but many such refusals are quashed by the High Court on judicial review. This clause seems designed to replace the present requirement for leave to appeal, the refusal of which can trigger judicial review, with a "no merit" notice which may deter appellants from pursuing their appeals. Procedure rules could disapply the requirement of leave which is currently imposed on most appeals from adjudicators, thus putting an end to the current practice of seeking judicial review of the refusal of leave, but by threatening to penalise those who persist with their appeals, limiting the number of cases that actually get heard by the Tribunal. But there is a risk that, with the number of appeals in the system and the scant judicial resources at the Tribunal, hasty decisions may be made that an appeal has no merit, decisions which will deter impecunious appellants even though they do in fact have an arguable case.

<P>
Cl.63
<P>
While the regulation of immigration advisers is welcome, considerable concern has been expressed at the provision that community groups and others who give basic advice incidental to their main activity will commit a criminal offence by giving any such advice unless they seek exemption or become a "qualified person". Cl. 61 could be regarded as ambiguous as to the scope of the meaning of "course of a business" and this should be made more specific.

<P>
Cl.65
<P>
It is the view of IAS that the legal profession should be included in a regulation scheme. The regulation by professional bodies is carried out essentially through responses to complaints yet this is an uncertain measure of competency when so many of those who seek legal advice on immigration matters will be unlikely to complain or not be in a position to do so or will not know the standards by which the advice they have been given should be judged. It is to be hoped that the Immigration Services Commissioner will be more proactive in respect of those who have to register, such as setting standards requiring, inter alia, regular training akin to continuing professional development etc. It would be bizarre if the standards imposed on non-legally qualified practitioners were to be greater than those expected of the legal professions themselves.

<P>
Cl. 76
<P>
 There is widespread concern that requiring asylum seekers to move to locations for accommodation to 259 260 where they are reluctant to go, because of the absence of community support or other facilities or where the local community is resentful of them, will lead to potential conflict and racial tension in those localities. In such circumstances it seems wrong in principle that the Secretary of State is precluded from having regard to any preference expressed by the supported person (even if the Secretary of State does not act on that preference).

<H4><center>Cl. 85</center></H4>
<P>
Bearing in mind that provision of support will be critical to the welfare of asylum seekers who are also likely to be vulnerable and in need of competent advice and representation it is essential that provision for this should be made under the regulations.

Part: VIII
<P>
Cl.124
<P>
It is important that detainees should have access to competent legal advice and representation in addition to that in respect of bail hearings and appeals. Voluntary organisations currently funded under section 23 of the 1971 Act can assist only those who have rights of appeal ie after an initial application has been refused whereas often the most critical time for such advice is before any application is made.

<H4><center>Schedule 2. The Tribunal</center></H4>
<P>
Although getting rid of the lay members and creating a new post of Deputy President, this replacement for Part II of Schedule 5 to the 1971 Act gives no hint that the status of the Tribunal is to change, for example to become a "court of record". Indeed, paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 13
 indicates that the legally-qualified members of the Tribunal are to stay on as before. Yet a press notice released by the Lord Chancellor's Department on 21st February announced that the next President would be a High Court judge. What effect will this have on the status of the Tribunal?
<H4><center>Schedule 3.</center></H4>
<P>
In the Government consultation paper Review of Appeals at para 3.2 it was pointed out that as a matter of policy since 1986 the seven year professional qualification applying to legal members of the IAT has also been applied to appointments of Immigration Adjudicators. This, no doubt, has been in recognition of the increasing legal complexity of immigration/asylum appeals. Yet there is no provision in the Bill to regularise this.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
In paragraph 1 add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"1(A) A person is qualified for appointment only if--
<P>
(a) he has a 7 year general qualification, within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990;
<P>
(b) he is an advocate or solicitor in Scotland of at least 7 years' standing; or
<P>
(c) he is a member of the Bar of Northern Ireland or solicitor of the Supreme Court of Northern Ireland of at least 7 years' standing."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<H4><center>Schedule 4. Appeals</center></H4>
<P>
Tucked into this Schedule are a number of technical but not unimportant changes that give cause for concern.
<H4><center>(1)(1). Pending proceedings</center></H4>
<P>
This paragraph refers to the period while an appeal against the refusal of entry clearance (the reference to cl.41(5) must be an error for 41(2)) or of leave to enter or remain is pending. "The leave to which the appeal relates . . . continues to have effect". This does not make sense. Someone who has been refused entry clearance does not have any leave which could "continue", while for someone appealing against the refusal of further leave, it is not clear whether "the leave to which the appeal relates" is the leave he had before (say as a student) or the leave which he has asked for and been refused (which could be different, say as a husband). This is also inconsistent with the Variation of Leave Order 1976 ("VOLO"), which states that when someone applies for further leave and is refused, his existing leave automatically expires 28 days after the refusal, regardless of whether he is appealing. Paragraph 1(1) also contradicts clause 43(2), and should be deleted.
<H4><center>4(1)(a). Appeals without a hearing</center></H4>
<P>
Rules may enable appeals to be determined without a hearing. This laconic statement is elaborated in the Lord Chancellor's press release of 21 February, which states that the rules will "introduce a presumption in favour of paper disposals at Tribunal level". This contradicts the statement in the same press notice that "For the future, the Government wants the IAT to focus as far as possible on the complex legal issues which arise in immigration and asylum cases and to continue to develop as the central authoritative source of judicial guidance and leadership in this area of law in the United Kingdom." Such a role presupposes that complex legal issues will have to be canvassed orally, as they are before the High Court and the Court of Appeal, so that the guidance which emerges is of the highest quality.
<H4><center>4(1)(b). Failure to attend or comply with directions</center></H4>
<P>
 There must be provision to appeal against the determination of an appeal without considering its merits, or for an appellate authority to set aside such a determination. The failure to attend the hearing or to comply with directions given beforehand may have a perfectly good explanation, which would justify a further opportunity for the merits to be considered.
<H4><center>9. Convention cases</center></H4>
<P>
Apart from abolishing the "White List", the Government wishes to keep the certification procedure for certain asylum seekers which it deplored while in Opposition. This procedure is neither fair nor efficient, being productive of judicial review in the absence of any appeal to the Tribunal. Section 1 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 is not repealed at Sch. 14: this contains the certification procedure including the "White List". This must be an oversight.
<H4><center>10(6). Determination of appeals</center></H4>
<P>
This paragraph largely repeats section 19 of the 1971 Act, but it omits the provision in s.19(3) that "it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and of any officer to whom directions are given . . . to comply with them." Presumably this has been ornitted in error.
<P>
But a deliberate omission must be that of s.21 of the 1971 Act. This provides for the situation where an appeal has been dismissed, but evidence has since come to light which shows that the appeal might have been allowed if this evidence had been before the appellate authority. The Secretary of State can refer the matter to the adjudicator or Tribunal for consideration of this fresh evidence. There is provision at paragraph 4(1)(d) of Schedule 4 for the Tribunal to set aside its own decision, which would give an opportunity for the Tribunal to take account of such a situation, as well as preventing unnecessary proceedings before the High Court or Court of Appeal. But there should be provision for an adjudicator to set aside his own decision also. The opportunity should also be taken for the informal practice of "repromulgating" an adjudicator's determination (for example, when an appellant through no fault of his own is out of time for appealing to the Tribunal), to be put on a statutory footing.
<H4><center>13(3). Appeals which must be dismissed</center></H4>
<P>
 The reference to cl.48(1)(d) must be an error for 48(1)(c).
<H4><center>Schedule 12</center></H4>
<P>
The Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 Schedule 2 para. 4(2) amended s.3.3 of the 1971 Act to include a provision whereby an appeal would be abandoned by reason of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom. This has caused hardship to appellants who may have valid urgent reasons for leaving the United Kingdom, however briefly, before their appeal has been determined and difficulty for adjudicators who are unsure as to whether or not there is any requirement for the appellant to have an intention to abandon an appeal. In addition this discriminates against those who have sought a short period of leave to enter and who leave the United Kingdom in accordance with this but before their appeal has been determined (often due to delays beyond their control) as under this provision the appeal will have been deemed to have been abandoned. This should be remedied. Moreover, not to do so would be contrary to the spirit of the provision in the current Bill under Cl.2(2) which would mean that leave would not lapse on departure from the Common Travel Area.
<H4><center>amendment</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In section 33(4) of the 1971 Act delete the words "or is abandoned by reason of the appellant leaving the United Kingdom."</font></ul>
<P>
Schedule 14 repeals Part II of the 1971 Act, but this will have repercussions on the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, which makes extensive reference to Part II eg s.2 of the 1997 Act.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Refugee Legal Centre</center></H4>
<H4><center>SECTION I -- APPEALS</center></H4>
<H4><center>The European Convention -- Clause 47</center></H4>
<P>
We welcome the extension of the immigration courts' jurisdiction so that they can consider rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. We assume that, where the Home Office seeks to remove someone on "safe third country" grounds, that person will nevertheless have an in-country appeal if he or she claims that removal will breach the European Convention. Clause 54(3) should therefore be amended to make it clear that it is subject to Clause 47.
<P>
Inconsistencies will arise under the proposals for the one-stop appeal. It appears that where someone claims that their removal would breach the European Convention and the 1951 Convention, the adjudicator will be required to consider the facts as they exist at the date of hearing. However, where someone only claims that their removal would breach the European Convention, the adjudicator will only be able to consider the facts in existence at the date the Secretary of State made his decision (see Clauses 57(3)(a) and 58).
<H4><center>The One-stop Appeal -- Clauses 55 to 58</center></H4>
<P>
The Government's proposals are based on the notion of a single, one-stop appeal. Initially, it was stated that this would provide a comprehensive review of all reasons why a person should not be removed from the UK. Ministers indicated that this would include compassionate circumstances, such as ties with the local community and family reasons. However, the scope of the appeal proposed by the Bill is much narrower than that (see Clause 55(5)). This will prevent all relevant matters from being dealt with as effectively and early as possible, and increase the number of applications for judicial review.
<P>
We recommend that the adjudicator's jurisdiction in the "one-stop" appeal should be expanded to allow consideration of whether there are compassionate factors which outweigh the public interest in removal. This is the test currently applied in unrestricted deportation appeals.
<P>
Provision is made for "one-stop" appeals at Clauses 57 and 58 of the Bill. The first Clause purports to deal with asylum claims and the second to other claims. Different procedures appear to be contemplated under each clause, although what those procedures are and why they should be different is not at all clear. As both Clauses apply to asylum seekers who have been refused leave to enter or remain, the picture is further confused.
<P>
As drafted, it appears that under Clause 57 the adjudicator could consider the facts in existence at the date of hearing in relation to all grounds of appeal. Under Clause 58, it appears that the adjudicator is confined to considering the facts in existence at the date of the relevant decision. Under the procedure, there may be more than one decision taken at different times. This is bound to create inconsistencies and anomalies.
<P>
On a general point, we believe the process mapped out in Clauses 55 to 58 is too cumbersome. So far as is possible, when a decision is made, it should be a final decision. The Home Office should therefore adopt a 263 264 more proactive decision making process. This would be assisted by giving asylum seekers the opportunity to comment on draft refusal letters, correct inaccuracies, respond to adverse credibility findings and raise all matters which may not previously have been before the Home Office. The Home Office and asylum seeker's representative could thus ensure that all issues relevant to the case had been fully aired prior to decision. It should assist in defining and limiting the issues should the Home Office decide to refuse the application. This would facilitate an efficient and fair appeals process.
Overstayers -- Clause 6
<P>
A person who overstays his leave (an overstayer) will not be able to appeal against removal unless it is claimed that it would be in breach of the 1951 Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human Rights. However, in many cases, the real reason for overstaying may involve compelling, compassionate factors or the strength of a person's ties with the United Kingdom. These are matters which may not easily be characterised as breaches of either Convention, but cannot be raised at appeal. The appeals system should focus on the real issues in each case.
<P>
As drafted, the Bill will promote manifest injustice. If a representative negligently fails to make an application to extend leave in time, his or her client would be deprived of any possibility of appeal.
Late Claims -- Clause 56
<P>
An appellant will not be able to appeal against refusal of a late claim for asylum or for protection under the European Convention if the Secretary of State has certified that, in his opinion, the claim was made solely for the purpose of delaying removal from the UK (see Clause 56(4) and (6)). This test, which is similar to the much criticised "primary purpose" test, will be extremely difficult to apply. Such certificates should be appealable to adjudicators.
Certification Under the 1996 Act and the Immigration and Asylum Bill -- Schedule 4, paragraph 9
<P>
The present scheme for the certification of cases which are alleged to be manifestly unfounded is governed by the 1996 Act. Certified appeals are subject to a "fast track" procedure under which not only must adjudicators decide the appeal, but must also hear argument on the certificate, lengthening the hearing. If the adjudicator agrees with the certificate, an appellant cannot appeal to the lmmigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT), leaving an application for Judicial Review as the only remedy.
<P>
A case may be certified on various grounds, including that the asylum seeker comes from a country which has been designated in the so-called "white list". The Bill proposes abolition of the "white list", but retains all other grounds on which a case may be certified as manifestly unfounded (Schedule 4, paragraph 9). Since April 1998, adjudicators have overturned certificates in 43% of the RLC's appeals certified on these other grounds.
<P>
The other grounds for certifying appeals should be repealed purely on the basis that they have been improperly applied to and unfairly prejudiced so many appellants. However, there are a number of other reasons as to why they should be repealed.
<P>
The abolition of the "white list" may create unofficial "white lists" of designated countries which will not be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. Slovak Roma cases are subject to blanket certification notwithstanding that the Slovak Republic is not a "white list" country. In the RLC's Slovak Roma appeals decided since April 1998, adjudicators overturned certificates in 78% of cases.
<P>
The Home Office and Lord Chancellor's Department's Consultation Paper on the Review of Appeals highlighted the importance of the IAT setting consistent standards. The objective is to remedy inconsistent decision making by adjudicators which the Home Office rightly identifies as a problem. But leaving many appellants outside the IAT's jurisdiction undermines its ability to set consistent standards and increases the use of judicial review.
<P>
In many cases, the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) will have jurisdiction to consider three grounds of appeal: asylum, the ECHR and compliance with Home Office Concessions. However, only the asylum claim will be susceptible to certification. Where an adjudicator upholds a certificate, the asylum seeker will not be able to appeal to the IAT on asylum grounds, but will be able to do so on, for example, European Convention grounds. This ignores the fact that there may be considerable overlap between the three categories. We understand the Home Office's intention was to simplify the law and procedure, but in this, as in many other provisions, they have only managed to complicate it.
<P>
This problem is particularly acute in "no Convention Reason" cases. One of the grounds under which a case may be certified is that, although the claim shows a fear of persecution, the persecution feared is not for a 1951 Convention Reason (ie political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group). While an appellant may not have a 1951 Convention Reason, he or she may have a very good case under the European Convention. As the law stands, the Bill may enable the Secretary of State to certify the case of a woman who fears being stoned to death because she has transgressed the social mores in her country. Her appeal may be subjected to a fast track procedure notwithstanding that she has a very strong case under the European Convention.
<P>
"No Convention Reason" certification is also particularly pernicious in that it stifles the development of law in some of its most complex areas, for example, women facing gender-related persecution. In so doing, cases of some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers are prejudiced by subjection to fast-track procedures.
<P>
Determining Appeals Without Hearing Oral Evidence or Considering Their Merits (Schedule 4, paragraph 4)
<P>
The Home Office's Consultation Paper on the Review of Appeals highlighted the importance the courts attach to oral evidence where credibility is an issue. This is almost always the case in asylum appeals, where the appellant is the only witness. Any move to restrict the right to lead oral evidence in these circumstances may promote manifest injustice and can only increase the number of applications to the High Court. We therefore strongly oppose any provision which might undermine an appellant's ability to give oral evidence in any but the most exceptional of circumstances. Similarly, any provision to enable an adjudicator to decide a case without considering its merits, particularly where asylum or rights under the European Convention are concerned, must only be exercised in exceptional circumstances, if at all.
<P>
The Role of the Immigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT)
<P>
We understand that the intention is that the Tribunal should move away from its wider role to concentrate on complex legal issues. The Lord Chancellor's Department should exercise caution in this regard. In particular, consistent guidance from the Tribunal as to findings of fact relating to credibility will continue to be of great importance. Credibility is often one of the central issues in asylum appeals and, as such, it is quite proper that the Tribunal should be able to set aside perverse and unreasonable findings of fact. Properly used, these powers act as a check against inconsistent decision making which the Consultation Paper on the Review of Appeals quite rightly identified as a problem.
<P>
The Tribunal Merits Test
<P>
The Bill proposes the imposition of financial penalties by the Immigration Appeals Tribunal in cases where the TAT considers the appeal to be without merit, and where leave is not required. As the basis on which leave may or not be required for an appeal to the TAT is to be governed solely by secondary legislation, there will be no scrutiny of the type of appeals in which such penalties may be imposed. The RLC is opposed to such a procedure and its possible application to asylum appeals. We do not consider that the imposition of financial penalties is appropriate in disputes concerned with the protection of the human rights of the appellant.
<P>
Further, the bill allows the IAT to threaten to impose such penalties without either party being able to make representations, or have the benefit of an oral hearing on this issue.
<P>
We recommend that asylum appellants should continue to be required to obtain leave to appeal to the Tribunal. However, the rigid time limits for applying for leave to appeal (5 days) and for the Tribunal to determine applications (10 days) promote inefficiency. Representatives have little time to advise clients as to the merits of appealing and the Tribunal has insufficient time in cases where leave is refused to produce a well reasoned, case specific determination. Indeed, many determinations are produced by word processor in standard format. Such determinations may well encourage applications for judicial review and have been the subject of much criticism in the higher courts. More realistic time limits should be set and the Tribunal should apply more resources to the application for leave to appeal stage. Well reasoned decisions setting out the circumstances in which leave may or may not be granted will assist representatives in advising clients whether or not to apply for leave to appeal and should reduce the number of such applications.
<H4><center>SECTION 2 -- DETENTION, JUDICIAL SUPERVISION AND BAIL</center></H4>
<P>
The Decision to Detain
<P>
The wide powers of the Immigration Service to detain are set out in Schedules 2 and 3 of the 1971 Immigration Act

<P>
1. At the time the 1971 Act was passed, it was not envisaged that so many people would be detained, sometimes for prolonged periods. Generally, the power is to detain a person pending the making of a decision, be it to allow the person to stay, or to remove or deport him from the UK, all of which can apply to asylum-seekers. There is no legal limit on the length of time a person can be held in detention nor on the time taken by the Home Office to make the decisions on which the power to detain is founded. In almost all cases, the Home Office and the Immigration Service retain a wide discretion to decide who is and who is not to be detained. There are no statutory criteria for detention, but criteria are set out in an instruction to Immigration Officers dated 20 September 1994. This document has no legal basis.
<P>
The Refugee Legal Centre's concern is that the criteria to detain are so wide as to be almost an invitation to arbitrary detention. The Home Office admits that "Many more people fit the criteria for detention than are currently held". By definition, then, the decision to detain an individual is a matter of the exercise of discretion.
<P>
1 Paragraphs 16(1) and 16(2) of Schedule 2, and Paragraphs 2(2) and 2(3) of Schedule 3
<P>
Judicial Supervision and Bail
<P>
For independent judicial supervision of detention to be effective, the powers to detain should be narrowed and these and the exercise of discretion must be open to review. The criteria for detention must be tightened and put on a statutory basis. There should then be a hearing at which the decision to detain is examined as to not only whether there is a power in law, but whether the decision to detain was a proper exercise of the discretion.
<P>
Unlike criminal bail in the UK, there is no presumption in favour of granting bail. The Refugee Legal Centre strongly believes that such a presumption should apply, and that immigration detainees should have the right to two "full" bail hearings, in line with the rights afforded to those facing criminal charges.
<P>
The Bill makes provision for routine bail hearings, after one week and after five weeks. This system is superimposed on the already over-complicated existing provisions for bail set out in Schedules 2 and 3 of the Immigration Act 1971, as amended by the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, and again by the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, The RLC believes that the whole system should be brought under the Bill, by amending this bill and the existing legislation, to create a simpler, more comprehensible and coherent system. The RLC does not believe that the Bail hearings as exist, or as proposed, provide an adequate safeguard against arbitrary detention.
<P>
As drafted, the Bill gives certain powers to the Secretary of State to regulate bail hearings and their procedure (Clause 36). This is inconsistent with the separation of powers between the executive and the b)that the Home Office may not be able to remove an asylum seeker due, for example, to conditions in his country of origin (as is currently the case with people from Sierra Leone, DRC (former Zaire) and Angola).
<P>
A logical consequence of discontinuing the provision of any support is that an asylum seeker will be left "destitute". In R v Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte JCWI [1996], Simon Brown LJ held that the withdrawal of support under the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Regulations 1996 rendered appeal rights nugatory. He further stated:--
<P>
... the 1996 Regulations necessarily contemplate for some a life so destitute that, to my mind, no civilised nation can tolerate it. So basic are the human rights here at issue, that it cannot be necessary to resort to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950 to take note of their violation".
<P>
In this, and in other respects, the statement of compatibility made under Section 19 of the Human Rights Act 1998 is at best misguided.
<P>
SECTION 4  ACCESS TO REPRESENTATION
<P>
We are concerned that, while the Bill proposes firm measures to deal with unscrupulous advisers, it does not appear to recognise the value of competent representation and makes no provision about access to such representation. Further, inadequate access to representation in the regions has not been considered under the dispersal proposals.
<P>
No thought appears to be given as to access to representation at any stage of the procedure. Port applicants will, presumably, continue to be interviewed so far as possible on the day of arrival. Those placed in accommodation outside the south-east seem likely to be moved within the five day period within which to make further submissions on their claims. As we have previously said, the five day period is meaningless even without the imposition of this further difficulty.
<P>
Any time limit for the submission of representations should run, not from the date of interview, but from the date a person is settled in or refused accommodation or, in the event of an appeal, from the date his or her appeal against a refusal to provide support is dismissed.
<P>
Of course, this assumes that people accommodated outside the south-east will have access to competent local legal representation. Urgent consideration needs to be given to developing a strategy for the provision of sufficient specialist legal advice in areas to which it is proposed to disperse asylum seekers.
<P>
In addition, provision must be made to enable asylum seekers to travel to their representatives an appeal hearings.
<P>
There is already a growing crisis of access to representation, Legal Aid is not available for representation at asylum appeals. The overwhelming majority of appellants who cannot afford to pay solicitors to assist them rely on organisations providing free advice and representation such as the RLC, but the resources of such organisations are limited. The RLC accepts instructions purely on a first-come-first-served basis and, yet, we are currently winning over 25% of appeals we present, However, the Immigration Appeals Authority is only allowing about 8% of appeals. This discrepancy strongly suggests that appellants are being prejudiced by having no representation or incompetent representation.
<P>
The RLC does not have the resources to represent all appellants who seek its assistance. Before the turmoil created by the reorganisation in the Home Office, the RLC was turning away up to 300 appellants a month. About 30% of people with appeals before the IAA are unrepresented. These appellants have little prospect of securing alternative representation and, in consequence, little chance of success at appeal.
<P>
A further problem stems from the lack of continuity in the provision of public funds for the representation of asylum seekers. Green Form Legal Aid is available for the representation of asylum seekers at the pre-decision stage. It is also available for the preparation of a case for hearing but not for representation at the hearing. Conversely, Section 23 funding is only available for preparation for and representation at hearing. As a result, solicitors have to transfer cases to the RLC or IAS after refusal. This, inevitably, results in duplication of work at the public expense. There can be no doubt that additional money has to be made available for the representation of asylum seekers. While we would clearly welcome additional funding to represent more asylum seekers, it would be inefficient to apply extra resources solely to an increase in Section 23 funding.
<P>
The Government should consider the provision of legal aid for representation at hearing. Without such provision, it is difficult to see how any strategy can be developed which will ensure that those dispersed to the regions will have access to representation.

SECTION 5  POWERS OF
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS
<P>
In its comments to the UK's last report, the Human Rights Committee established under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights expressed its grave concern at incidences of excessive force in the execution of deportation orders. The Bill proposes increased powers for immigration officers without any increase in accountability. It is proposed to extend immigration officers' existing powers of arrest and provide powers in the area of entry, search and seizure. The Immigration Service Union has expressed its concern at the prospect of the proposed increased powers. A spokesperson for the ISU has stated:--
<P>
"We have no experience of restraint techniques, effecting entry or how to search" (Observer, 26 July, 1998)
<P>
If representatives of the Immigration Service do not think they have the skills and experience to deal with increased powers, then one can have little confidence in the suggestion that they be given such powers. We are further concerned about the effect the exercise of such powers will have on refugee communities. Immigration Officers exercising such powers are also responsible for interviewing asylum applicants about their claims. In so doing, they are required by the UNHCR Handbook to create a climate of trust and confidence (paragraph 200). But how can such a climate be created when Immigration Officers are also exercising powers of entry, search, restraint and arrest? Finally, it cannot be right that Immigration Officers may be given additional powers without additional accountability. If their powers are to be brought in line with those of police officers, then should they not be subject to similar provisions to those established under PACE and to a complaints regime similar to that for the police?

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome witnesses to this Special Standing Committee sitting. I do not know whether you have one spokesman, or whether you are acting together, but will you introduce yourselves and your organisations, after which we will move to questions. As you have been informed, we will not hear opening statements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Best (Immigration Advisory Service):</B> We are two separate organisations, although we are commonly funded by the Home Office through section 23 of the Immigration Act 1971. I am the chief executive of the Immigration Advisory Service, and I am here with my colleagues, Mr. Richard McKee and Ms Gail Elliman, both of whom are tribunal counsellors, specialising in presenting cases to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. We are all members of the Bar.
<P>
<B>Mr. Barry Stoyle (Refugee Legal Centre):</B> I am the director of the Refugee Legal Centre, and I am here with Mr. Deri Hughes Roberts, who is our appeals manager.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We would like to hear from all of you, should more than one of you wish to answer our questions. However, I hope that you will not all answer every question, because that would take up a great deal of time.
<P>
You will be speaking into microphones, but the acoustics in this Room are not great, so it would help if you would speak up.
<P>
<B> The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I thank our guests for their comprehensive written evidence. I do not want to take them through that evidence, but I would like them to supplement it.
<P>
My first question is addressed to Keith Best. You wish clause 6 to be deleted from the Bill. Does that mean that you do not want any changes to current deportation procedures that apply to overstayers who have obtained leave to remain by deception? Should they all remain, despite the delays they cause? Or do you wish to see some changes to deportation procedures for overstayers? If so, what changes are you advocating?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> We are not saying that we do not want any changes. I will ask Ms Elliman to deal with that matter in greater detail in a moment.
<P>
We are deeply concerned, on compassionate grounds, about the proposal to remove any right of appeal for overstayers, whatever the circumstances of their overstaying. Those people will be placed before an independent tribunal. We often come across people who have over-stayed because they have been wrongly advised, and may be uncertain about their immigration status.
<P>
Only the other day, I met two Turkish people, who had been to someone whom they believed to be a solicitor, but who turned out to be an immigration adviser. That person took £3,000 from them, and told them that he would regularise their stay by getting them indefinite leave to remain. They were given a piece of paper, purportedly from the "Immigration and Nationality Department", that purported to give them indefinite leave to remain. It was not their fault that they were overstayers. Under the Bill, they would have no chance to explain any of those matters whatsoever before an independent tribunal. We believe that will lead to a great deal of injustice unless it is changed. I would like to ask Ms Elliman to deal with the matter in a more substantive way and explain the changes we would like to see.
<P>
<B>Gail Elliman (Immigration Advisory Service):</B> I can be brief. In principle, we do not object to maintaining the status quo as long as there are some changes. The idea of the Secretary of State having a power to deport can remain. As we said in our submissions, maintaining the distinction between deportation and removal is better than changing to a situation in which everyone is subject to summary removal.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As to changes, we would like to see the repeal of section 5 of the Immigration Act 1988, which introduced a false and, I must say, extremely unjust distinction between people who have been here for seven years and those here for less than seven years. That was related to the merits of the case that could he decided at the appeal. Of course, the injustice comes in, for example, when people who have been here for six years and 11 and a half months when a decision to deport is made are entirely disbarred from putting compassionate circumstances or the merits of their case to the adjudicators. So long as section 5 of the 1998 Act is abolished, we would be happy to see the power to deport remain.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The effect of that, though, is to cause substantial delay in procedures. As you know, we are seeking to get appeal procedures down to four months as part of the overall six-month time limit. Do you not recognise that your suggestion would make it much more difficult to meet the needs of a faster system?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> First, perhaps the Minister could tell us what proportion of appeals is represented by overstayers. We believe that it is not very great. Secondly, the Minister invalidates his own case. If we are going to reduce the time limits, it will not be a burden if these people have an opportunity of putting compassionate factors and such like before an independent adjudicator. The problem of overstayers and the appellate process is entirely due to the absence of resources within the process to deal with the requisite numbers.
<P>
We are deeply concerned about the removal of a right of appeal for these people because it will lead to injustice. The Minister asked what the consequence will be. I can say that I believe without fear of peradventure that there will be a whole mass of asylum applications and applications to the divisional courts by way of judicial review, because these people will have no other way of articulating their reasons as to why they should remain in this country.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does not the whole procedure involve a raft of appeals, one after the other? There is a right of appeal on initial application, a further appeal in relation to deportation orders and another appeal for the limitation of destination. You are therefore advocating retaining a system that produces substantial delays.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> We would be prepared to look at a system that moved towards the one-stop concept, so long as that could be done fairly. I understand fully the Minister's point about a successive series of appeals, but that situation is not remedied--if I may say, with respect--by taking away a right of appeal altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): I found the evidence very helpful and it is also helpful to have the benefit of the submissions from the Immigration Advisory Service and the Refugee Legal Centre in advance. I think that I know what is at issue but I would like to get it absolutely clear. We have entered a fairly detailed area of law quite quickly.
<P>
Clause 6 deals with people who have stayed too long and exceeded their leave to remain, not with illegal entrants in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> That is right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> People who have been dealt with by way of deportation have rights of appeal, but those are circumscribed where those concerned have been here for less than seven years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> By the 1988 Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> There was quite a lot of comment about it at the time, but that was the arrangement that was made: people who had overstayed here by more than seven years had the fuller rights of appeal under a deportation order. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> And the provision will remove the fuller right of appeal for someone who has stayed longer than seven years. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I suppose it could be argued that those cases are more likely to involve compassionate circumstances, because the people have been here longer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes. If I may say so, with respect, there seems to be some element of schizophrenia in the Government's thinking on this matter, because on the one hand it is proposed to remove, under the Bill, a right of appeal for those who might be subject to deportation because of overstaying; yet only recently the Minister introduced a further concession, which we welcomed, which was to reduce from 10 to seven years the time in which those with children, who had been here for that period of time, would not have enforcement action taken against them. We welcome that but it seems to fly entirely in the face of the proposal in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The argument has been put to you that the proposed change will streamline appeals and reduce delays, but would not someone who lost the right of appeal under clause 6 have a right to appeal if he or she wished by claiming asylum, or under clause 47, the human rights provisions? Instead of appealing against a deportation order such a person would appeal under, say, clause 47. You touched on that in your evidence.
<P>
<B>Ms Elliman:</B> What you are doing is to suggest that people will have to create claims under clause 47, or create asylum claims, when those might not necessarily be the appropriate arguments. They are very specific and people might be affected by other circumstances of a compassionate nature that did not necessarily fall under the clause or the tight limitations of an asylum claim. You are excluding all those people from the appeals process.
<P>
Going back to what you said earlier, you would exclude people from the power that they currently have in law to challenge a threat of deportation made on the basis that they have been working in breach of their conditions. They have a right of appeal and can tell the adjudicator that they were not working in breach of the conditions. We frequently prove such claims and that there is no power in law to deport. You will remove that, which is a basic legal right, as well as the compassionate element.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that. I am trying to explore the issues. When you say "you", you mean, in fact, that the Bill will do those things, in effect. The Bill will remove one right of appeal and create another that might not be appropriate. It will provide a wrong ground instead of the one that is now used.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Stoyle, do you wish to say something?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> May I add a supplementary thought? People who do not wish to claim asylum or who fall within the human rights convention will be forced to make a claim. To maintain their presence and argue their case, they will be forced to make a claim, as they will know that that is the only way to stop the immediate threat of removal.
<P>
If people happen to be overstayers or without valid entry clearance and are prevented from ventilating the full facts of their case, frustration will be built into the system for those who want to argue compassionate circumstances and those matters that do not fall within the prescribed concessions. Human nature being what it is, people will seek remedy elsewhere. The whole point,  as we understand it, of the Government's thrust in this policy is that there should be one appeal to deal with all matters. However, they have designed the process to restrict those matters. That is self-defeating.
<P>
If the intention is to put in place a humane system in which people can ventilate all the facts that they want to be considered by a judicial body and the administrative decision maker, and if those people are turned down on the basis of some of those issues, and are then told that they are not allowed to ventilate them before an adjudicator, they will look elsewhere to ventilate them. It seems to me absurd not just to permit the facts to be dealt with by the adjudicator, so that the adjudicator gives consideration to the full facts, takes a judicial decision on them, and then the matter rests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Patrick Hall </B>(Bedford): May I be clear about the principle of the one-stop procedure? Are the witnesses opposed to it in principle or do they acknowledge the possibility of its streamlining and speeding up the system while maintaining fairness?
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard McKee </B>(Immigration Advisory Service): It seems to be a good idea to have a one-stop appeal when people face removal so that all the issues as to why that person should not be removed can be put before a judicial body. That should apply, too, to overstayers and illegal entrants, who currently do not have any in-country right of appeal before being removed. However, the proposal is to give a one-stop appeal to people who are here with existing leave to remain. That will bring in its wake all sorts of problems for the appellate authorities who have to determine those appeals. Because of the way in which clause 55 and the following clauses are drafted, the adjudicator will have to decide, for example, at the date of the decision, whether to refuse a student application and whether that applicant met the requirements of the immigration rules at that time. That is really looking to the past, and at the same time considering whether in the future that person will have good reasons for not leaving this country; there will be additional grounds which the adjudicator will have to consider.
<P>
The adjudicator will have a difficult exercise, looking at the past and what the applicant's intentions were at the time; looking to the present, looking to the future and looking at a range of different issues. It would be more appropriate to look at the present and the future at the removal stage for overstayers and illegal entrants rather than when, for example, a student asks for leave to remain for further studies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> May I add one point? To heighten an example of the anomaly, people applying for an extension of leave need to satisfy the immigration nationality department that they will leave at the end of that extended period. However, the Bill proposes that at the same time as giving reasons at an appeal why their intention to leave at the conclusion of their period of leave is valid, they will also have to give compassionate reasons why they should not leave the country at all. That seems to my colleagues and me to require a degree of mental athleticism for both the adjudicator and the appellant that is beyond the reach of most people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> If the principle of a one-stop procedure is acceptable, what improvements do the witnesses have in mind to make it work? We have all agreed that there are great benefits to be achieved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> The appeal needs to deal with everything and not to exclude anything; in other words, all the factors that have a bearing on compassionate circumstances, whether they are asylum matters or European Convention on Human Rights matters, should be dealt with. At present, overstayers and people without valid entry clearance can ventilate only asylum or ECHR issues. Those with valid leave or valid EC can introduce what are called compassionate circumstances in the Home Office note; they are actually limited, but to lists of concessions that have been announced. What we would say is that the decision maker considers all the facts, including compassionate circumstances, which may or may not be within or without the prescribed concessions, and that the adjudicator has jurisdiction to consider the full decision taken by the decision maker. That would be a proper, comprehensive one-stop appeal. You would not stop factors being put before the adjudicator. In our view, that would simplify matters. Again, I come back to the point that if people are prevented by the drafting of the legislation from ventilating things that matter a lot to them, they will seek remedy elsewhere; they will go for judicial review and so on. They will make representations through their Members of Parliament and so on. You will not stop that with the mechanisms being proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> I understand that, but does Mr. Best agree? If the adjudicator took on everything, would not that require the mental gymnastics that Mr. Best is worried about?
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> In certain circumstances, it would. There is nothing wrong in principle in having, as Mr. Stoyle suggested, a one-stop appeal at which everything can be articulated. The trouble then comes with the situation that I described where someone is appealing against a refusal to extend leave, or vary it in some way, which necessarily means that it will come to an end and the person will leave the United Kingdom at the end of that time. If one is then also required to put in compassionate circumstances as a reason for not leaving the United Kingdom at that time, it will be very difficult for appellants to get to grips with it. There is a danger that certain compassionate circumstances will not be articulated at the time for fear of prejudicing the appeal on the substantive issue. In those circumstances, there may need to be a further occasion on which compassionate circumstances may be raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> Does that mean, Mr. Best, that although you agree in principle with the idea of the one-stop procedure, you do not think that in practice it will work? Others feel that it could--that it would be possible to design such a thing--but you are saying, are you not, that it would not work?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> It may not be universally applicable.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lock </B>(Wyre Forest): Coming back to the matter of appeals, do you agree in principle with the Immigration Law Practitioners Association that the most effective disincentive to people who do not qualify for asylum is the certainty of quick disposal?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> I am not sure that I followed that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hall:</B> What the the ILPA is saying is that what will deter people who do not qualify for asylum and are trying it on is the certainty of a quick disposal. Do you agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> I suppose that I would want to look at it the other way round and say that I think the most effective way of determining whether somebody should be entitled to stay or not is to have a just system for the consideration of their cases. If you want to put it in those terms, I suppose the most effective deterrent is a humane and just determination system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> That is an interesting statement, Mr. Stoyle, but it is not an answer to the question. Is a quick disposal of an application for asylum a deterrent to people who do not have a genuine case for asylum?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> In the sense that they have a vested interest in stringing out the procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The House of Commons Library has told us that of 62,000 decisions taken between 1993 and 1995, 6 per cent. were held to satisfy the primary test under the 1951 convention. That is one in 16 cases. We obviously want to deter the people who do not fit into the 1951 convention. One theory put forward by the ILPA is that a quick disposal is the most effective way of deterring those who are not within the convention. Do you agree?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> Yes, and it is certainly more effective to have a fair procedure to put in place rather than other deterrents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> We agree that the Government have a legitimate policy of trying to ensure that a quick disposal of cases is in accordance with their policy of seeking to deter the 15 out of 16 who do not come within the narrow gauge of the convention?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> I do not know about the figures but the Government certainly have a responsibility in international law to recognise those who need protection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> Yes, I appreciate that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> May I comment just briefly on that--and I think that one of my colleagues wishes to as well? The basis of your question presupposes that a large number of people who are seeking asylum know that they do not have a genuine asylum claim. That statement in itself must be challenged. There are certainly a lot of people who do not come within the strict definition of the 1951 convention. That does not mean that those people do not feel that they have a genuine claim for asylum. There are certain circumstances, and I will not go into great detail, in which people could be fleeing from tyranny or danger of some kind but not come within the strict definition of the 1951 convention. I suspect that if you were to ask the man in the street whether those people were regarded colloquially as refugees they would say that of course they are, although they may not come within the strict definition.
<P>
Mr. O'Brien helpfully gave us some figures recently that showed that the figures you quoted are rather out of date. Now it is 17 per cent. who are granted refugee status and a further 12.5 per cent. who are granted exceptional leave to remain. We are looking at something approaching a third of those who apply for asylum being allowed to remain in this country through the proper operation of law. That puts a different perspective on matters than the one that the earlier figures might indicate. One must bear in mind that there are a lot of people who are not just wandering around the world as economic migrants trying to find a better home to go to but are genuinely fleeing from some sort of fear who may nevertheless not come within the strict definition of the 1951 convention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have one more question, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. McKee wants to contribute.
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> You are right that the thrust of the Bill is to deter asylum seekers and to make this country a less attractive destination by not having cash benefits and to try to stop asylum seekers from, as it were, spinning out their appeals. But that is to lose sight of those who are not asylum seekers; their rights of appeal are going to be greatly reduced and jeopardised by the proposals in this Bill. It is necessary to look at the non-asylum appeals as well and to prevent from them being lost because of this desire to curtail or to speed up asylum appeals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> The problem I have with all of the answers is that, as I understand it, you accept as a principle that speedy determinations are in the interests of the genuine asylum seeker, the Government and the rest of the people in order weed out those who have no right to be here, whatever their economic circumstances. Yet whenever the Government put forward a proposal to speed up the procedure or to streamline appeal rights or to curtail rights to ensure a speedy appeal, it is met with a host of objections. How can we speed up appeals and ensure that cases are dealt with very swiftly if it is not as the Government propose? What is your alternative proposal for a speedy appeal, which you say is necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> With great respect, there is no opposition to speeding up the process. If that can be achieved, it is welcome. One of the failings of the system is that insufficient resources have been put in at the basic level to ensure that there is speed in the process. That is a criticism of all those who operate in the field. That has been levelled both at this Government and the previous Government: more resources need to be put in at that level. The point on which there is a universal view is that speed should not be at the expense of a denial of justice. That is the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Neil Gerrard </B>(Walthamstow): May I clarify precisely what your objections are? It seems to me from what you have been saying that you do not specifically object to the idea of an asylum claimant who has been rejected having all the issues concerned with his case dealt with in one process. Is that correct?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> In other words, your objections to the one-stop appeal relate not to the asylum issue but to the overstay immigration issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Thank you. That makes it clear.
<P>
On clause 55, which deals with one-stop appeals, the Refugee Legal Centre said that the scope of the appeal was narrow and referred specifically to subsection (5), which and refers specifically to grounds for making asylum claims, appeals under clause 47 and concessions. However, I am not clear about whether you are suggesting that nothing else can be considered. I do not read the clause in that way. It seems to be saying that if people want to make a claim on one of the grounds in subsection (5), they must say so. Is there anything to prevent claims on being made on other grounds?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> There are matters that will not be considered under the definition of prescribed concessions. In other words, if the Home Office considers the compassionate circumstances of a case in addition to asylum or ECHR matters, if they exist, the jurisdiction of the adjudicator will be limited to the prescribed concessions. We would say that the adjudicator's discretion should be broadened to consider all the matters, which would also speed up the process because everything will have been dealt with. People who are frustrated because they cannot argue their case before the adjudicator might seek remedy elsewhere, perhaps by means of judicial review or further representation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Deri Hughes Roberts (Refugee Legal Centre):</B> May I just add that there is an ambiguity in the drafting? Clause 55(3) seems to suggest that the grounds mentioned in clause 55(5) can be raised, but we understand from discussions with officials that compelling and compassionate circumstances can be dealt with only under prescribed concessions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> That is obviously something that we will have to clarify when we reach that part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The IAS used the expression "mental gymnastics" and the phrase appeared in its submission. I am afraid that my mental gymnastics are no better than my physcial gymnastics, and that is not saying much.
<P>
I would like to go back to the one-stop point. There is widespread agreement over the desirability of dealing with matters appropriately and at the same time, but is it really a one-stop shop if, instead of appealing under existing mechanisms, someone simply moves on to another appeals mechanism, relating to human rights or asylum?
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> Certainly from the way in which clause 55 is framed, it will be possible to raise human rights or asylum issues after an extension of stay as a student or whatever has been refused. The problem for the adjudicator is that he is still at the same hearing and has to decide whether the decision to refuse a further stay for the student was right on the basis of evidence relating to that period and time. At the same time, he has to decide whether, on the additional evidence available at that time, it would be wrong for that person to have to leave the United Kingdom.
<P>
We are concerned about the additional grounds for an appeal because it is not clear whether the Home office has any duty to consider those grounds or whether the whole affair will go straight to the adjudicator. In other words, if the appellant puts in a claim on the basis of the European convention or refugee convention, will the adjudicator be the first-instance decision taker on whether that person qualifies for asylum and should be protected under the European convention?
<P>
We are also concerned that the prescribed concessions are unlikely to be known to ordinary people. Only immigration lawyers are likely to know what the concessions are, which makes it very important that appellants have access to competent legal advice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If I may interrupt, that is a slightly different point, but an important one. You are saying that, unless they are immigration lawyers, the people who are asking whether they can enter as a concession will not know whether they can or cannot appeal.
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> Absolutely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I wanted to ask you whether there is a risk of generating additional claims for asylum under clause 47 and for asylum because of the withdrawal of the right to appeal a deportation order.
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> Many of the people who are currently able to appeal against deportation have family in this country. They may have been here for many years, have married and have had children. Such people would make a claim under article 8 of the European convention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That would be a new claim, would it not? It would not be part of the deportation proceedings, and would have to go through all the proceedings required for a new claim, which would create extra delay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes, indeed. I return to the point made earlier by Ms Elliman. Of course, one cannot compartmentalise all overstayers within the European convention on human rights or asylum claims. Such people will forced down one of those routes--regardless of whether it has merits--so as to overcome the absence of the ability to articulate other compassionate grounds. Such grounds may be articulated for those who have been here for seven years or more on deportation appeal.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> May I add to that? Members will be aware of the informal Home Office note that was circulated to the Committee. That note concerns proposals on how procedures are to be established for the two appeals, and clarifies how someone making a subsequent application will be dealt with.
<P>
Two levels of consideration will be given to an applicant. People who apply as students and are refused will be invited to provide all the reasons why they should be given consideration. That is the statement that is covered by the Bill. That is how they will put their case before the Home Office. The relevant information is in Home Office notes 16 and 17.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall ask Ms Abbott to put one further question on appeals, and I will then ask Mr. Allan to move the questioning on to another area.
<P>
<B>Ms Diane Abbott </B>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington): I have listened carefully and sympathetically to what you have said about appeals. In some ways, I am the Committee member with the least sympathy for the Bill.
<P>
I handle many immigration and asylum cases, and I see too many people working the appeals system. I do not mean that they are consciously doing the wrong thing. However, they come to me, and proudly tell me--directly, or through an interpreter--that they have put in an appeal. When I look at the paperwork, I can see that that appeal does not have the slightest hope of succeeding.
<P>
Most of those people are paying for endless appeals through legal aid. I get upset and angry when I see people who have been put up to groundless appeals and judicial review applications because they are paying cash that they can ill afford to spend to go through a legal rigmarole which--as I can tell them straight away--will get them nowhere. Their advisers must know that.
<P>
I am not uncritical of the Bill. Do you agree that, as the Government are seeking to simplify the system, and create a one-stop appeal system for proper, genuine appeals, we should move away from the endless rigmarole that creates unhappiness and uncertainty and results in immigrants and asylum seekers being milked by third-rate advisers and lawyers? Do you think that there is something to be said for that argument?
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> Clearly, the existing system must be replaced. None of us would say that it should continue. However, we are extremely concerned that it should not be replaced with a system that does not work effectively and that is open to the desperation of people trying to get before an adjudicator to argue their cases. We are anxious to remove abuse from the system, but we want to see a fair replacement.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Best:</B> We appplaud the principle of regulating immigration advisers, as we have asked for that ourselves. However, we have certain reservations about how provision for that is made the Bill.
<P>
In principle, regulation is a good thing, which--hopefully--will knock out some of those guys. Perhaps block contracting will have the effect of knocking out solicitors who are not especially competent in the field and who give bad advice. They sometimes do that, not through malice, but through inadvertence or ignorance.
<P>
However, we must not forget that many aspects of the present system lend themselves to such abuse. Mr. McKee has a particular point to make which has also been made by by the judiciary. Judge Pearl has made it repeatedly as current President of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> Yes, the point is the time limit in which people can lodge appeals. In particular, there is a very short time between the adjudicator in an asylum case promulgating his decision and the appellant making an appeal to the tribunal. Very often representatives put in standard protective grounds without having time to consider whether there is any merit in the appeal. That has the effect of clogging up the system. Longer time limits would allow time for a competent adviser to advise the client whether there was any merit in appealing.
<P>
I should like to add that although the Government want to simplify the appeal system by taking away certain appeal rights, it seems to me that they are also adding complexity. The one-stop appeal procedure is very complex. With the introduction of the human rights appeal as well, it seems that, overall, the Bill will not simplify and speed up appeals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I think that we have given that a fair hearing. Mr. Allan, you wish to take the debate on a little.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): May we move on to an item in the Immigration Advisory Service submission, in particular to where you discuss clause 13 on the code of practice for employers? You give a strong response in which you say that you are disappointed that the Government have gone back on their commitment to repeal section 8 of the 1996 Act, which effectively made employers act as checkers of immigration status, which you believe is discriminatory. You are opposed to both section 8 and the code of practice that the Bill would introduce. Am I right in assuming that you would effectively prefer the status quo, ante the 1996 Act, in respect of employers and immigration status?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes, but if there is to be a section 8 or something equivalent, it should pay much more regard to whether there is mens rea, whether there is an intent in applying, or whether it is done with knowledge. There are inadequate safeguards in section 8 for employers, so the likelihood there is that, faced with such draconian legislation--I appreciate that there have been no prosecutions so far, but I understand that some are in the pipeline--the likelihood is, and we have evidence to support this, that employers will just not employ people whom they think might fall within that category. They are not really interested in people proving whether or not they are able to work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Following that, you said that you believed that criminal sanctions were available in the 1971 Act which would be an alternative if section 8 were deleted by the Bill when enacted. Can you explain that and say why you think that they could be satisfactory?
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> There are provisions in the 1971 Act for the prosecution of those who facilitate or harbour people who have no right to be here. That would include employers. The sort of people that the Government want to target are the owners of sweatshops and agricultural organisations that employ sweated labour, and racketeers who supply them with labourers. Those people could be targeted under the existing criminal provisions of the 1971 Act. Really, they should have been used more often.
<P>
We certainly have evidence that employers are bewildered by, on the one hand, having a sanction in section 8 against employing people who have no right to work, and on the other, the complexity of working out whether or not people have the right to work. Now there is the prospect of a code of practice which will tell them not to discriminate when they will have to discriminate in order to find out who is entitled to work. There are two different kinds of discrimination. The whole process is so complicated for employers that the temptation will be simple not to employ people who look or sound like immigrants.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> So your clear view is that the Bill as drafted with a code of practice would create problems for people who come in as immigrants seeking employment in this country and who continue to cause problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Yes, unless section 8 of the 1996 Act were amended in some way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I share some of your concerns about the way in which section 8 operates, but I should find it difficult to come to the conclusion that you have reached.
<P>
The criminal law requires that intention be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That is basic criminal law. The fact is that some people pay £14,000 to come to this country as illegal immigrants and work. How do they do it? They bind themselves for a number of years to work for an employer. People also come in to work on the land for farmers at very cheap rates--illegals or people who have entered lawfully and have no right to work, but do. In both types of case, employers of the bound labour or illegal labour simply respond, "We did not know at the time that they were illegals." The criminal law does not enable us to deal with that. We must prove beyond reasonable doubt that they did know. The law places no obligation on employers to find out. I do have some concern about the element of discrimination--which is why we want a statutory code--but how should one deal with those employers, and prevent them from feeding illegal work and bound labour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> First, we all share the Minister's concern about those matters. I do not think that there is variance over the nature of the concern indeed, the previous Government were concerned--they enacted section 8. The means for dealing with the issue is the point in question. Without going into greater detail than I have done already about more normal safeguards with respect to the burden of what must be proved against an employer, perhaps the Committee would allow us to draft an alternative to section 8 and present that for consideration--assuming that the Government take the view that something like section 8 is needed. We stand by point in our submission that the better course would be to do away with it altogether.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have asked a variety of groups--and I thought that I had asked the IAS--to examine the issue of section 8, which perturbs us. We have examined it in some detail and it is difficult to deal with the mischief of employers who just deny knowledge given that the criminal law requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of their knowledge, but that there is no legal obligation on them to find out. At the same time, the Government have felt concern about the operation of section 8 and the discriminatory impulse that it could put into the mind of some employers.
<P>
We should like from you--I hoped that you could be a bit more forthcoming, but I welcome your suggestion that you will put your mind to the question--a way of dealing with both the mischief and the discrimination. We should be very interested that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> That is very helpful. We have drafted something--the Minister invited us to do that when he spoke to the conference on 4 March. I shall not read out what we have drafted, but it deals, basically, with a person's being knowingly concerned in employing someone or having a reasonable cause for believing what is specified.
<P>
We believe that that puts the right emphasis on safeguards for a potential defendant on such a charge.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Forgive me, Mr. Best, but that requires proof that a person knew. Employers immediately say that they did not ask and did not know.
<P>
<B> Mr. Best:</B> That is quite a common feature of the criminal law generally. If we are deliberately to treat employers in a way that disadvantages them in comparison with others under the criminal law, the Government should be upfront and say that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you wish to submit your draft to the Clerk after the meeting, it will become part of the formal evidence that you have submitted and be considered.
<P>
<B> Mr. David Maclean:</B> (Penrith and The Border) I want to ask Mr. Best--Mr. Stoyle may also wish to comment--about something that was not in the Immigration Advisory Service evidence, but which he mentioned at the begining of his remarks--children. The lady from the United Nations said yesterday that she thought that the Bill was "inhumane" to children. The evidence submitted by Save the Children expresses
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"an overriding concern about this Bill: the Bill omits specific provision in respect of asylum seeking children".<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The Children's Society, too, is of the opinion that the welfare and rights of asylum seeking children, whether dependents or unaccompanied minors, are compromised by many of the Bill's provisions, which fail to meet the Government's obligations under international and domestic human rights legislation. I ask both groups if you share those concerns, and, what impact do you as lawyers and practitioners, think the Bill will have on children?
<P>
5 pm
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes Roberts:</B>  We are aware of the concerns expressed. In addition, the Committee has not yet considered the detention of children about which we have grave anxieties. We understand that the Refugee Council is about to produce a report on the matter in which it will say that since 1994, 152 children between the ages of 13 and 17, including 24 children under the age of 16, who were in detention have been referred to the Refugee Council's panel of advisers. We very much hoped that the Bill would contain provisions safeguarding such children and ensuring that they were not subject to detention, but it is silent on the matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. McKee:</B> The IAS shares the views expressed by various organisations in Committee yesterday on the problems that families with children might face as a result of the new asylum support arrangements. We also share the anxieties of the Refugee Legal Centre about minors being detained; admittedly there is sometimes doubt about whether somebody is over 18, and that is difficult to determine. There are problems, but we share the anxieties of the other organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> Do you ever come across unaccompanied children--minors--seeking asylum?
<P>
<B> Mr. McKee:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Faber (Westbury):</B> On the broader issue of asylum support, the Refugee Council yesterday used the welfare of children as a reason for their objection to clause 76. In particular it objected to the fact that the Secretary of State not only should not but must not take any notice of the preference expressed by the asylum seekers. In your evidence you said that it seemed wrong in principle that the Secretary of State was precluded from having regard to any preference expressed. Could you please expand that view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> About 20 years ago, I was involved with the Vietnamese boat people. In those days, it was thought humane to disperse people around the country because they could better integrate within society. At that time, I represented Anglesey and three Vietnamese boat families came to Gwynedd, whichthen--and now--had an active bilingual education policy. The net effect was that the Vietnamese boat children who could not speak a word of English had to go to school and learn Welsh, which seemed somewhat anomalous. The experience with the Vietnamese boat people was that as soon as they were able to move back to the support of their communities they did so and congregated where those communities were. Our concern is that if you take people against their wishes to places to which they do not want to go, from which they cannot escape because they do not have the money to travel, and place them among communities that do not want them anyway, the capacity for racial tension is enormous. The capacity for human misery is very great indeed and the likelihood is that the whole policy will fail, just as it did some 20 years ago. It seems a shame that we have not learnt from history.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stoyle:</B> I certainly support Mr. Best's view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes Roberts:</B> I want to say something about the support proposals in relation to how they will affect detainees and the bail process outlined in the Bill. We agree with the evidence given yesterday by Justice and Amnesty International that the bail proposals do not represent adequate judicial supervision. They merely replicate what goes on at the moment in regard to elective bail under the 1971 Act. In those hearings, it is extremely rare for detainees to be released on bail unless one or more sureties have been provided. Under the support arrangements, an adjudicator will want to be sure that a surety can exercise proper control and influence over a detainee released on bail. However, if a detainee expresses a wish to be accommodated near the surety, the Secretary of State must disregard that preference. Under, the dispersal proposals, if a detainee is to be released he may well be living 100 or 200 miles away from a proposed surety. In effect, detainees will be denied any possibility of having a surety who will be acceptable to an adjudicator. As a result, the bail proposals will be completely ineffective, notwithstanding that it may well be the case that decisions to detain are not compliant with article 5 of the European Convention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I intend finishing this session at about 5.15 pm, as there are other witnesses this afternoon.
<P>
<B>Ms Gisela Stuart </B>(Birmingham, Edgbaston): I have a brief question about support for children. Some of the witnesses yesterday suggested that providing vouchers for children would be in breach of our international obligations. Do you support that notion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes Roberts:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> So, by analogy, you would also say that by giving school meal vouchers to our English children we are in breach of international obligations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes Roberts:</B> No, all-voucher support, with no access to cash, or to only minimal provision, will distinguish the children receiving those vouchers from all other children who have some state support. We agree with Justice's analysis in that regard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> Many members of the Committee have young children, including the Minister. I ask them to ask themselves whether it would be possible actually to look after and care for their children on what, effectively, would be a cashless system, with just a small amount of pocket money. The reality, as all those who have children know, is that you cannot do it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I want to press a point about the bail hearings. We heard yesterday that there was anxiety about two proposals that were lacking in the Bill. The first was that the reasons for detention be given a statutory footing and the second was that there should be a two-stage bail hearing, the first considering whether the reasons were correct and the second whether bail could be given based on a surety. Do you concur with that view and with the other judgment that if the Bill does not contain those provisions there is a risk of people bringing cases under the Human Rights Act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes Roberts:</B> I concur with that, very much so. In addition--a point that was made yesterday--there should be a presumption of liberty in such hearings. Yes, I do agree.
<P>
Another point with which I concur is that the hearings will be considering rather complex areas of law in terms of human rights requirements. It seems to me to be absolutely essential that there is access to representation, which is not confirmed by the Bill. We suggest that it could be achieved by the extension of legal aid to cover bail hearings and by appropriate provision in, I think, clause 39.
<P>
In addition, on clause 39 funding to organisations such as the RLC and the IAS, the Bill would also have to be amended to provide rights of audience to employees of such organisations who were not qualified solicitors or barristers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> May I briefly take the witnesses to schedule 2 to the Bill and the new proposals for the Immigration Appeal Tribunal? Will you expand on your fairly limited written evidence, in particular on the proposals to abolish lay membership of the IAT and its possible effect?
<P>
<B>Mr. McKee:</B> The Lord Chancellor's view of what the tribunal does seems a little lopsided. He talks about the tribunal as being the authoritative guide on complex legal issues, certainly it is and should be that. But it has another important function when it has full hearings before it, which is to deal with the credibility of witnesses and to deal with matters that are not so much legal but matters of common sense and fairness. If an appellant has failed to appear before an adjudicator for a good reason--for instance, if he was ill or did not receive notice of hearing, and is now appealing to the tribunal--the tribunal can agree to remit the matter to a different adjudicator or to hear it. A lay member can have just as good an input here as a qualified member of the tribunal. Having three members of the tribunal makes it more likely that fairness and common sense will prevail. For those reasons, we would prefer the lay membership to continue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Of course, many of the lay members are often magistrates who have great experience of dealing with similar types of people. I think I am right in saying that abolishing the lay membership would more or less wipe out any ethnic mix that currently exists in the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> What Mr. McKee has just said goes to the heart of schedule 4, too. This is the power that the Lord Chancellor will have to have rules enabling appeals to be determined without a hearing. That causes us grave concern. For a start, it could be extended to adjudicators. It is not exclusive to the IAT. But how can matters of fact or those raised by Mr. McKee a moment ago be articulated fully and properly where the hearing is on the papers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I turn to another point that we have not touched on yet--the arrangements for visitors, which the IAS commented on, and the possibility of financial bonds? You commented on the relationship between a bond being accepted or refused and an appeal. What are your concerns on that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Best:</B> We are somewhat confused because in the Bill, as drafted, it appears that a bond or a financial security could be required at any stage. Indeed, that is not just with visitors--it could be extended to all other matters of applications or entry clearance too. The Minister told us on 4 March at a conference to which I referred that it was intended that financial securities should apply only after a refusal. I see him nodding in agreement. We are somewhat confused about the Government's intention about when a bond or financial security might be taken.
<P>
We appreciate that it is a pilot scheme that is being looked at. That is welcome. However, although we endorse the concept of financial security, and indeed, it is something that the communities in this country have been calling for for a long time, we are concerned that if it is extended more widely so that it becomes the norm that a financial security is required, it will discriminate directly against those from less-developed countries and those of impecunious means who will not be able to afford to put that up. When you couple with that the requirement, which we also deprecate, to pay an administrative fee for appeals, which again would not necessarily he exclusively for visitors, appeals and could be extended elsewhere as well, it seems as though there is a conscious shift of immigration control on economic grounds. Those who can afford to pay the financial bond and the administrative fee for the appeal will be able to come into the country, and those who cannot, will not,

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I can deal with this briefly. It may seem strange to our witnesses, whose evidence we have appreciated, if I do not mention it. You were sent the draft guidance on registrars reporting suspicious marriages. I know that you were concerned about that in your submission. I, for one, would appreciate it if you could look at that draft guidance, which we have only just received, and let us have any additional thoughts on the subject. It would also be helpful if you could let us know whether you would like any other amendments relating to other parts of the Bill and indeed if you could send us any further submissions. We would appreciate that greatly.

<B>Mr. Best:</B> Indeed, we would be very happy to do that. May I reiterate that we wish to be of as much assistance to the Committee as we possibly can. If at any stage members of the Committee feel that we could be of further assistance, we would be happy to be so.

<P>
SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS IN ILPA'S EVIDENCE
<P>
<B>*  ILPA is very concerned that the Bill will not have the effect that all of us want -- fairer and quicker decisions in asylum applications with any removal only after full consideration and a comprehensive appeal. The denial of any right of appeal for those who have overstayed or who are treated as illegal entrants will mean that if they are refused, the only recourse to reconsideration of their case is an application for asylum or for consideration under the European Convention of Human Rights. Thus the "unfounded" cases will continue to clog the appeal system. If there were a full right of appeal, on all the relevant facts of a person's case and the legal and compassionate aspects, this would go towards creating a just system.</B><P>
<P>
* ILPA is concerned that the Home Office administrative systems will not be able to deliver the two-month decision-making target. We appreciate the problems caused by the office move and the malfunctioning computer system but see no reason to expect these to be resolved quickly or easily. If they are not, and if the "faster" part of the package cannot be delivered, we see no way to justify keeping people living below the poverty line and socially excluded for a longer period.
<P>
* ILPA believes that a policy of dispersal of asylum-seekers, if coupled with continuing delays and with inadequate means of support, will lead to increases in begging, streetselling, squeegee merchants etc, in areas of the country which have no or little experience of this and which are more racially and culturally homogenous than many larger cities. We fear that this will lead to a growth of racism, discrimination or even attacks on asylum-seekers, if they are particularly visible and are new to the area. ILPA continues to believe that its description of the system proposed as an "apartheid" one to be entirely accurate (see paragraph 48 of briefing for Second Reading debate). ILPA maintains profound concerns about these proposals which are further summarised in the introduction to Part VI.
<P>
* ILPA is extremely concerned about the increase in powers of immigration officers, with no corresponding code of practice, programme of training or system of accountability. We see this as unnecessary for enforcing immigration control and fear that it could lead to increased racial tension and discrimination. It is a retrograde step which will militate against non-discriminatory immigration control. Whilst ILPA welcomes the Home Secretary's announcement that the Race Relations Act will be amended to cover the immigration service, we fear that this will not have the desired impact. See further the concerns expressed in the introduction to Part VII of the Bill.
<P>
* ILPA believes that the extension of immigration criminal offences is unnecessary and misguided. There is no public policy aim to be served by charging and imprisoning failed asylum-seekers because they used "deception" in their cases or in delaying removal.
<P>
* ILPA is very concerned that no draft rules or regulations are yet available in respect of any of the extremely wide rule and regulation making powers contained throughout the Bill. It is essential that these are made available as soon as possible--and at worst by the time the Bill comes to be considered on a clause by clause basis. Otherwise it will be extremely difficult to give a proper and considered view of the ramifications of many of the Bill's provisions.
<P>
ILPA's detailed briefing follows. Different co-ordinators have been responsible for each part of the bill. ILPA's Briefing for the Second Reading debate is attached which at page 2 contains the names and contact numbers of the co-ordinators who would be happy to speak about any aspect of this briefing. ILPA will continue to undertake work on the Bill and it may well be this document will not prove to be ILPA's "final word" on any particular aspect or provision of the Bill.
<P>
PART I
IMMIGRATION: GENERAL
<P>
Clause 1
<P>
1. This clause allows the Secretary of State to make for provision for conditions of leave to enter to be set out in visas/entry clearance.
<P>
2. ILPA is concerned that additional duties will fall on Entry Clearance Officers [ECOs], making their work more complex. Given the commitment of the government to recover the cost of EC from fees, this will lead to a considerable increase in visa fees. What increase in ECO hours are anticipated as a result of these additional duties? What consequences is this likely to have for the level of visa fees?
<P>
3. The effect of the measure is to shift a higher proportion of immigration controls to ECOs and to reduce those exercised at ports of entry. As a result, visa nationals will shoulder a higher proportion of the costs of immigrations controls. Is it the government's intention that citizens of visa countries (mainly in low income brackets) should pay a higher proportion of the cost of immigration controls?
<P>
Clause 2
<P>
4. Clause 2 allows the SS to make further provision with respect the grant, etc, of leave to remain.
<P>
5. Sub-para (a) appears to relate to the use of IT innovations in grants of leave to remain [LTR] (machine-readable, bar codes, etc). (b) refers to "the imposition of conditions". Does this mean that conditions other than, length of time, employment restrictions/prohibitions/, public fund limitations, requirement to register with the police are envisaged? If so, what might these be?
<P>
Clause 3
<P>
6. This clause contains a new power to prescribe fees for applications. This has major implications for persons subject to control. Visa fees are already substantial. High levels of fees will deter many people from applying for variation.
<P>
Clause 4
<P>
7. This clause deals with exemption from controls for members of diplomatic missions. How would this be enforced? Does the Secretary of State envisage removing a member of a diplomatic mission who was recruited in the UK and whose LTR has expired?
<P>
Clause 5
<P>
8. Persons ceasing to be exempt. ILPA has no specific comments.
<P>
Clause 6: removal of certain persons unlawfully in the UK
<P>
9. This clause needs to be read with Schedule 12 paragraph 30(2). The effect of these provisions is to 20. If it is the intention of government that this provision should only apply in certain cases (the guidance notes make no mention of rules under clause 6(4) confining its effect) then the clause should be amended to make the intention clear.
<P>
Clauses 7 and 8: Financial Bonds
<P>
21. These clauses provide a mechanism for the Secretary of State to require security to be given in respect of people applying for entry clearance and applying for leave to remain in the UK, such security to be forfeit if the person does not leave the UK.
<P>
22. Many people living in the UK desperately want to be able to provide some security to show their integrity and support their relatives' visit applications. This could help to dispel people's feeling that their integrity is in question, rather than that an official abroad is not satisfied about their visitor's intentions. But there are serious drawbacks to this proposal and it should be considered very carefully, and amended, before any pilot project takes place. If the drawbacks outweigh any benefits it provides, it should not be implemented but further training and support to ECOs to help them make correct and unbiased decisions should be given. It is to be hoped that the reintroduction of appeal rights for refused visitors will help to ensure that refusals are correct in law.
<P>
23. The system must not be operated in certain parts of the world only, or mainly. According to the 1997 Control of Immigration: Statistics, 23 per cent. of refusals of visas for temporary purposes took place in the countries of the Indian subcontinent, whereas the number of applications there was 14 per cent. of the total. Thus there is the potential for this to be used in a discriminatory way, mainly against people from particular areas. ILPA welcomes the Home Secretary's announcement of 24 February that the Immigration Service is to become subject to the Race Relations Act, but hopes the Committee will receive assurances from the Minister, and draft immigration rules, about how and where any power to take bonds will be used.
<P>
24. The amount of any bond. ILPA was concerned to hear that the Minister had suggested an amount of £5000-£10,000. This is an unrealistic and unfair amount for people on even an average salary to raise, let alone those below. If instead a bond were to be related directly to the sponsor's ability to pay, for example 10% or 5% of the income shown for supporting the potential visitor, this would be much fairer between applicants.
<P>
25. If the money had to be paid up front in the UK, it will mainly affect the less wealthy. It could lead to the growth of unofficial moneylenders and loan sharks, exploiting people unable to offer the security needed for a reputable bank loan and charging extortionate interest rates for these loans. It would also mean either sponsors making these financial arrangements in advance of a visa application being made abroad, or the case being referred from the British post abroad to the Home Office to seek a bond. Either of these would mean further delays in dealing with applications, a serious matter when the reason for the visit is urgent, such as a funeral. A legally-binding commitment or undertaking to pay, rather than the deposit of money, would again be a more equitable system.
<P>
26. If the money were to be requested overseas, it would probably most often come from the sponsor in the UK, and have to be sent overseas. This could lead to another layer of exploitation by agents abroad, who could claim that they needed this money before making an application; if this were false, the money might then be requested again by the entry clearance staff. It could lead to another opportunity for corruption, when touts and agents know that money may be required and some applicants will not know to whom they have paid it. It is even more difficult to check whether this is happening overseas than in the UK, or for family members here to know what has happened.
<P>
27. These questions arise only because the Bill does not make the govemment's intentions clear and the immigration rules which will explain it have not been published, even in draft, with the Bill. ILPA finds this very disappointing, emphasised by the Home Secretary's admission on 22 February that "I cannot promise that drafts of all the regulations will be made available at this relatively early stage in the process". His refusal to do so means that it is impossible to debate many parts of the Bill in any sensible way, as the detail of what is intended cannot be known.
<P>
28. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill, and the debate about bonds outside, focus on visitors. But this is not what the Bill says, it refers to people "applying for entry clearance" (cl.7(2)(a) or "extend leave to enter or leave to remain for a limited period" (cl.8). Thus the proposal could also apply to students, to working holidaymakers, to those needing medical treatment. If so, money could be deposited with the Secretary of State for substantial periods, and accrue significant interest. Whose would this be? If it is intended only to apply the bonds to visitors, the Bill should say so.
<P>
29. The Bill (cl.7(3)) states that the bond is in order to secure that the person leaves the UK at the end of a period of limited leave given. Will the Minister confirm that this refers to the duration of the leave stamped on the passport (or given in any other way as provided by clause 1 or 2), rather than any shorter period which a person may have stated when applying for entry clearance? In the past, people who have stated they intend to stay for less than six months but whose plans change so they stay for longer than initially stated, but still leave within the six months period they were given, have been penalised.
<P>
30. If people are granted the leave for which they apply, under cl.8, any bond given on their initial entry which might have been forfeit should be refunded. This should definitely be done if the person applies for, and is granted asylum, or is granted exceptional leave on asylum grounds, or is granted further limited leave but goes before that time finishes.
<P>
31. The pilot project for bonds should take place in more than one British post, so that its use can be monitored. If a post in India is chosen, so should a post in Pakistan, and also in an area with fewer perceived problems.
<P>
32. The bond proposal must be considered in conjunction with the restored right of appeal for family visitors (clause 41(3) to (5)) and with the entry clearance monitor (clause 14). Appeals will cost; but it must be ensured that the cost is not received twice. Entry clearance fees are intended to cover the whole cost of the entry clearance operation, which includes preparatory work for appeals. If there is a fee for an appeal, the entry clearance fees should be lowered. ILPA considers that an appeal should be available against both the decision to require a bond and the amount (at least where the rules confer a discretion on these matters).
<P>
33. Clause 14 provides for the continuation of the monitor of refusals without right of appeal. It is not clear which appeals the monitor will consider; on the face of the Bill, it is family appeals where the appeal fee has not been paid, but this is bizarre. The Minister should give an assurance of what he means by this. It should include all entry clearance refusals where there is no right of appeal, and the monitor should have enhanced powers to call for papers on cases she or he selects and to make unannounced visits to British posts
<P>
34. Amendments In clause 7(l), line 13: insert after "entry clearance" "as a visitor".
<P>
In clause 7(2)(b) add at end, line 19: but if it is not taken into account, the Secretary of State must give reasons for declining to do so.
<P>
After sub-clause 7(4), line 32, add new subclause: (5) The Secretary of State will not realise the security, and will repay any security deposited, if the applicant is recognised as a refugee or is granted exceptional leave or leave to remain under the immigration rules.
<P>
Clause 7(6), line 45 add at end: Provided that such security may not be more than 10% of the income declared by the sponsor in supporting a visit if required from the sponsor, or of the visitor's income as declared to the British post, if required from the visitor.
<P>
Clause 8(2), line 13, add at end as 7(6).
<P>
Clause 8(3), line 19, add as in 7(4) above.
<P>
Clause 12
<P>
35. Clause 12 authorises the Secretary of State disclose information obtained by him in the exercise of his functions under the 1971 Immigration Act to a number of bodies connected with crime and law enforcement. However the final possibility is "any specified person". ILPA is concerned at the potential breadth of dissemination of material provided by asylum applicants. These matters which are provided on terms that are understood to be confidential are often highly sensitive and potentially dangerous for others who remain in the countries of origin and strict supervision ought to be exercised of the use made of such information.
<P>
Clause 13
<P>
36. This amends section of the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act by requiring the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice with a view to seeing that employers avoid unlawful race discrimination. When section 8 was debated ILPA and others warned of its potential for discriminatory practices. The Labour Party in opposition appeared to agree with such concerns and appeared to support the repeal of section 8. In ILPA's view this is still the right course to take. There are other offences created by the 1971 Act which are ample to deal with racketeering. Exploitation of unlawful immigrant labour is deplored by us. But there are laws of general application to all employees concerning health and safety at work and employment conditions and these should be used. Our fears that section 8 would promote race discrimination have been borne out and we and, we understand, the CRE have no confidence that this will be changed by the adoption of the proposed code of conduct. Consequently our view remains that section 8 of the 1996 should be repealed.
<P>
Clause 15 and Part IX, Registrars of marriage
<P>
37. The Bill proposes a number of changes to the law governing the conduct of civil marriages, some of which are directly related to questions of immigration control while others are not. It is extraordinary that such significant alterations are proposed to an institution so fundamental to civil society as the ceremony of marriage in a Bill concerned with immigration.
<P>
38. There are a number of concerns arising from these changes, most relating to clause 15, which seeks to introduce a duty for registrars to report to the Secretary of State on "suspicious" marriages, that is those which they suspect of being "sham".
<P>
39. It is objectionable that officials whose role and function is to assist in the celebration of the union of couples in marriage should simultaneously have to serve as immigration police (see Amendments 4 and 6 below
). Regulations are proposed (clause 15(3)) to stipulate the manner of reporting (although these are not to be subject to any parliamentary scrutiny--see clause 134(4)(b) --see Amendment 10 below), but the matter of what should constitute grounds for suspicion is left entirely to the discretion of the registrar. Ungoverned suspicions will tend to amount to no more than stereotyping, that is, to prejudice (see Amendments 1 and 2 below).
<P>
40. In an initiative unconnected with this Bill, the government has announced its intention to extend the scope of the Race Relations Act 1976 to cover public services. Giving registrars duties dependent on suspicions concerning immigration intentions puts them in a position where they will be open to claims of discrimination, whether or not well-founded. This is invidious, and will be unwelcome to many conscientious officers (see Amendments 4 and 7 below).
<P>
41. Registrars will be required to judge whether a marriage is "entered into by A for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of immigration law". Some provisions of immigration law are notoriously difficult for a non-specialist to determine. What level of training will registrars receive? How, if they are not regularly called upon to make assessments, will this knowledge be reinforced and updated? (see Amendment 5 below)
<P>
42. The test also involves assessing the purpose for which a person seeks to marry. All the iniquities of the discredited "primary purpose" test, abolished by this government soon after taking office, are thereby set to re-emerge in a new guise (see Amendment 3 below).
<P>
43. Checks are proposed only against marriages involving EEA nationals. Presumably it is thought that these provide a more ready means to evade immigration controls for those who wish to do so. It is not clear whether any intended guidance issued to registrars will include the UK as an EEA state for these purposes. If the UK is not included, this measure is highly likely to amount to unlawful discrimination contrary to the European Treaties. If the UK is included, however, what justification is there then for leaving out of account those marriages where neither party is British nor a national of an EEA state? (see Amendment 5 below)
<P>
44. The Bill also appears to intend an extension of the power to refuse to conduct a marriage on the ground of lack of satisfaction that the parties are free to marry. Clause 133 will insert a new s.31A in the Marriage Act 1949, envisaging refusal on the basis of any "representation" received, and although there is a right of appeal against such a decision, the damage will in many cases already be done, and a right of restitution against a person making a "frivolous" representation is unlikely to be an effective remedy (see Amendment 9 below).
<P>
45. A decision not to allow a marriage to go ahead is potentially very significant: its importance is underlined by the fact that a wrong decision would be likely to amount to a breach of Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the right to marry and found a family), and so may leave the registrar open to action under the Human Rights Act (see Amendments 8 and 9 below).
<P>
46. This provision will introduce an onus on a couple to prove their eligibility to marry. How is this to be done? Although such a provision already exists in some countries, in the UK no comprehensive scheme for registering civil status exists. If the guidance to be issued by the Registrar General (see clause 132(3)) applies different standards for evidence of marital status to persons of different nationality, this is likely to amount to discrimination contrary to the Race Relations Act (and probably the equivalent Northern Ireland provisions) (
see Amendments 8 and 9 below).
<P>
42. Amendments Amendment 1: Delete clause 15, and Part IX, and in clause 134(4)(b) delete "15(3) or". Re-number clauses 16 to 129, and 134 to 138 consequently.
<P>
43. Amendment 2: Delete clause 15; re-number consequently [this is ILPA's preferred option].
<P>
44. Amendment 3: In clause 15(l) for "has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the marriage will be a sham marriage" insert "receives evidence proving that the marriage will be void".
<P>
45. Amendment 4: For clause 15(3) insert
<P>
The registrar concerned must report his suspicion
(a) in the case of subsections (1)(a) and (b) to the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England,
(b) in the case of subsection (1)(c) to the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages for Scotland, and
(c) in the case of subsection (1)(d) to the Department of Finance and Personnel,
and in such manner and within such period as may be prescribed by regulations.
<P>
46. Amendment 5: For clause 15(5) substitute the following:
<P>
"Sham" marriage means a marriage which is
<P>
(a) entered into between a person who is
<P>
(i) British citizen,
<P>
(ii) an EEA national,
<P>
(iii) Commonwealth citizen with the right of abode in the UK, or
<P>
(iv) a stateless person, refugee, or person of any other nationality with indefinite leave to remain in the UK and a person who is not within (i) to (iv) above; and
<P>
(b) entered into by the parties to the marriage with the purpose of avoiding the effects of those provisions of immigration law which are concerned with marriage or the status of married persons.
<P>
47. Amendment 6: For side-note to clause 15 "Duty to report suspicious marriages" insert "Reporting suspicious marriages"; and in clause 15(3) delete "must" and insert "may".
<P>
48. Amendment 7: [This option is proposed as a second alternative to amendment 2 above.] In clause 15 insert new sub-clause (7) "Persons carrying out duties under subsections (1) and (3) above shall have regard to section 46, and the code issued in accordance with that section shall apply to all such decisions and actions as are authorised by those subsections."
<P>
AND insert the following new clause 16 (re-numbering all subsequent clauses consequently)
<P>
"Code of practice
<P>
16(1). The Secretary of State must issue a code of practice as to the measures which a registrar carrying out functions within section 15 of this Act is to be expected to take, or not to take, with a view to securing that, while fulfilling the duties imposed upon him by that section, he also avoids unlawful discrimination.
<P>
(2) "Unlawful discriminations" means--
<P>
(a) discrimination in contravention of section 4(l) of the Race Relations Act 1976 ("the 1976 Act"); or 1976 c. 74
<P>
(b) in relation to Northern Ireland, discrimination in contravention of Article 6(l) of the Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 ("the 1997 Order"). S.I. 1997/869 (N.I. 6).
<P>
(3) Before issuing the code, the Secretary of State must--
<P>
(a) prepare and publish a draft of the proposed code; and
<P>
(b) consider any representations about it which are made to him.
<P>
(4) In preparing the draft, the Secretary of State must consult--
<P>
(a) the Commission for Racial Equality;
<P>
(b) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland;
<P>
(c) the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England;
<P>
(d) the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages for Scotland;
<P>
(e) in relation to Northern Ireland, the Department of Finance and Personnel;
<P>
and
<P>
(f) such organisations and bodies (including organisations or associations representative of local authorities or employees) as he considers appropriate.
<P>
(5) If the Secretary of State decides to proceed with the code, he must lay a draft of the code before both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
(6) The draft code may contain modifications to the original proposals made in the light of representations to the Secretary of State.
<P>
(7) After laying the draft code before Parliament, the Secretary of State may bring the code into operation by an order made by statutory instrument.
<P>
(8) In order under subsection (7)--
<P>
(a) shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament;
<P>
(b) may contain such transitional provisions or savings as appear to the Secretary of State to be necessary or expedient in connection with the code.
<P>
(9) A failure on the part of any person to observe a provision of the code does not itself make him liable to any proceedings.
<P>
(10) But the code is admissible in evidence in any proceedings (including proceedings under section 31A of the Marriage Act 1949) brought by a person claiming to have been affected by any decision, action or failure to act to which the provisions of the code apply.
<P>
(11) The Secretary of State may from time to time revise the whole or any part of the code and issue the code as revised.
<P>
(12) The provisions of this section also apply (with appropriate modifications) to any revision, or proposed revision, of the code.
<P>
50. Amendment 8: In clause 132 insert new subclause (4):
<P>
"In preparing the guidance the Registrar General must consult --
<P>
(a) the Commission for Racial Equality;
<P>
(b) the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland."
<P>
51. Amendment 9: In clause 133(3)(a), for "representation made to him, and" insert "representation made to him (provided that he shall not take account of any representation where the person making it does not sufficiently identify himself), and";
<P>
AND in clause 133(4), for "the declaration of the Registrar General purporting to be sealed" insert "the declaration of Registrar General containing details of the representation made to the superintendent registrar and purporting to be sealed";
<P>
AND insert new subclause (5)--"For the purposes of subsection (3) a person sufficiently identifies himself if he provides a name and address which the superintendent registrar has reasonable grounds for believing to be genuine."
<P>
52. Amendment 10: In clause 134(3) insert "(b) section 15(3)", and re-number subsubciauses (b) to (d) consequently. In clause 134(4)(b) delete "15(3) or".
<P>
Clauses 16 and 17: extending the offence of deception
<P>
53. These clauses create a new immigration offence, of a person seeking or obtaining "the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action against him" by "means which include deception by him". The penalty, on summary conviction, could be six months imprisonment and/or a fine up to the statutory maximum or on indictment, two years and/or an unlimited fine. They also extend the crime of making a false statement to an immigration officer to cover anything said to an officer acting under any of the five major Immigration Acts.
<P>
54. The Home Office Explanatory Notes state that clause 16 is intended for use against asylum-seekers whose claims are unfounded and who seek to string them out by making further unfounded claims or applications to the courts. But it is phrased much more widely than this and ILPA has real fears that it will criminalise asylum seekers in a way that is wholly unwarranted. The breadth of the clause is quite staggering (far beyond its stated aim) making it an offence for any deception to be used either to obtain or seek to obtain leave to enter or remain or "the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action". It is of course only the latter category of case (in parenthesis) that reflects such stated aim. ILPA opposes the whole clause; alternatively, its scope should at the very least be narrowed so as to reflect the govemment's intention.
<P>
55. The definition of "deception" has been drawn very broadly in court cases, and can include failure to give information which was not known to the applicant. Cases have also hinged on the "credibility" of the person, always difficult to judge, particularly when there is no supporting evidence.
<P>
56. The concept of stopping people from leaving the country, when their immigration application has been refused and removal arrangements are in process, in order to arrest, prosecute, detain and sentence them, and then after all that make them leave, seems bizarre. This proposal, if implemented, will clog up the police's time, the courts and the prisons with people who will not be allowed to remain here and who will suffer particularly while in prison due to the unfamiliarity of their surroundings, language, culture, religion etc.
<P>
57. At present, conviction and sentence happens most frequently for people who have sought to enter the UK, or sought travel in transit here, and are then found to be travelling on false documents. They are frequently prosecuted under the Fraud Act rather than the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act, and are usually sentenced to some months imprisonment. This is neither a sensible use of resources nor consistent with international obligations: if people need to flee they can rarely obtain genuine documents and article 31 of the Refugee Convention makes clear that refugees must not be penalised on account of their illegal entry or presence
<P>
58. These clauses should be read in conjunction with clause 117, which allows immigration officers to "use reasonable force" in exercising any of their powers under the 1971 and 1999 Acts. If a person resists an officer, whether knowing that he is an immigration officer or not, and thus secures a delay in removal arrangements, is that an extra crime?
<P>
59. In conjunction with clause 59 on "appeals without merit"; if the Tribunal makes such a decision, and also suggests, or makes a finding, that deception was used, would that make a person liable to prosecution under s.16?
<P>
60. The complicated possibilities this section suggests makes the availability and funding for provision of good legal advice and representation even more vital.
<P>
61. Amendments Delete whole of clause 16, lines 15 to 42 -- the preferred choice.
<P>
62. Delete the whole of line 19 - sub-paragraph 24A(a)--and delete "(b)" in line 20 (to give effect to explanatory note's stated intention only).
<P>
63. In 24A(1), line 16, insert after "citizen" the phrase "and who has applied for asylum in the UK".
<P>
64. In clause 16(3), line 34, delete "to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or" and line 37, delete "to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or" and line 38, delete "or to both".
<H4><center>Part II Carriers' Liability</center></H4>
<P>
Clauses 18-20
<P>
1. This part of the Bill introduces a new kind of Carriers Liability sanction. It establishes a civil penalty able to be imposed on a wide range of people who are responsible for transporting clandestine entrants to the United Kingdom.
<P>
2. Whereas the existing Carriers Liability sanctions relate to the arrival of undocumented passengers to the UK on ships, trains and planes, these provisions are aimed at carriers who bring somebody who evades or attempts to evade immigration control, or who claims or intends to claim asylum, and who:
<P>
 as arrived concealed in a vehicle, ship or aircraft, or;
<P>
 has passed through or tried to pass through immigration control so concealed, or;
<P>
 arrives in the UK having embarked abroad when so concealed.
<P>
Clearly this is very widely drawn. And is aimed at those who never present themselves to immigration control at the port.
<P>
3. The penalty applies to each clandestine entrant. The clause sets out a range of responsible (i.e. liable) persons, including: the owner, operator or captain of the ship or aircraft; the owner or hirer of a vehicle; and the owner or hirer of a detached trailer. The meaning of "owner" includes; an operator of a ship, aircraft or vehicle; the agent of a ship or aircraft; and the holder of a vehicle under a hire purchase agreement. Once again, these provisions are widely drawn.
<P>
4. The clauses descend to some detail about the practicalities of who is responsible where a passenger is hidden in a trailer, (which may or may not be detached).
<P>
5. The clauses establish that it is immaterial whether the responsible person knew or suspected that the clandestine entrant was concealed, subject to 2 defences. Firstly there is a defence of duress. Secondly there is a defence if the carrier (1) had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the clandestine entrant might be concealed; (2) had in place an effective system in operation to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants; and (3) operated the system properly on the relevant occasion.
<P>
6. In relation to the second limb of defence, a code of practice, as yet unpublished, is provided for.
<P>
7. Comment The clauses are open to the general critique of carrier sanctions. They do not discriminate between asylum seekers and others--all suffer equally. The provisions effectively export and privatise UK immigration control.
<P>
8. Article 31(1) of the 1951 Refugee Convention prohibits penalties being imposed on refugees who arrive without documentation, if they travel directly to a country of safety. Whilst not imposing penalties directly upon refugees, this part of the Bill goes against the spirit of the Convention in that it applies penalties inter alia to those who bring refugees to the UK. If the refugees are not to be punished, why should the carriers be?
<P>
 9. Currently, a significant number of asylum seekers reach the United Kingdom to claim asylum by lorry or other commercial road vehicle. Often these people come from countries where escaping by airplane is not an option--a recent example would be Kosovo. These provisions extend carrier sanctions to such vehicles and will prevent many asylum seekers from being able to avail themselves of international protection at all. In doing so the provisions make no distinction between those who get refugee status, and asylum seekers generally, and clandestine migrants generally.
<P>
10. ILPA would wish the legislation to maintain a distinction between those passengers who claim asylum shortly or immediately upon arrival, and those who enter clandestinely, and bring themselves to the attention of 22. These provision are against the spirit of the Convention and should be opposed in their entirety. For this reason ILPA has not sought to temper the harshness of these new provisions (which build on the regime already in place) with detailed amendments.
<P>
Clause 24
<P>
23. Clause 24 (1) adds to the contents of s25(6) of the 1971 Act, which sets out the offences of assisting illegal entry. It thereby widens the enforcement powers in current legislation. It deals with the punishments available to those who are convicted under the section, and in particular adds to the scope of the powers of forfeiture available where someone is convicted under s25(l). It provides that, where a driver of a vehicle is convicted (in addition to the existing provisions about the convictions of owners, directors of the owning company, or captains), the court can order forfeiture of the vehicle used in certain circumstances. ILPA's concerns are reflected in the general comments above.
<P>
24. Amendments Delete all.
<P>
25. Add a section which prohibits forfeiture or allows for a refund where the passenger in respect of whom the charge was levied is eventually allowed to remain in the UK as a refugee or under the Human Rights Act.
<P>
26. Add a new clause making it a criminal offence to prevent a claim for asylum by someone who has already arrived at our border. This is a provisio in which ILPA has canvassed in the past.
<P>
 27. Further, ILPA would like to know how many prosecutions have there been under section 25 (1)(b) and (c), which were introduced by the 1996 Act?
<P>
 28. Clause 24 (2) provides for the detention of a ship aircraft or vehicle which might later be the subject of a forfeiture order under section 25(6), where someone has been arrested for an offence under section 25(1), but not yet charged.
<P>
29. See the general comments above. There is no doubt that these changes will make transporters more likely to check harder to detect asylum seekers and others to prevent them from travelling, for fear of the more effective fine and enforcement regime. ILPA proposes the deletion of the whole clause.
<P>
Clause 25
<P>
30. Clause 25 consolidates and amends the material in the 1987 Carriers' Liability Act about carrier sanctions, and in the later SI about arrival via the Channel Tunnel, both of which impose financial penalties on carriers bringing improperly documented passengers. The main change is a still minor one--the exclusion of taxis from the list of vehicles which can render the owner or operator liable to a fine in clause 25(8).
<P>
 31. ILPA repeats its objections in principle to this type of provision, for the reasons set out above in the introduction. It proposes the deletion of the whole clause.
<P>
Clause 26
<P>
32. Clause 26 reproduces the material in the 1987 Act about transit visas.
<P>
33. The provision reproduces at sub-cause 26(3)(a) the power for an order under the provision to specify a description of persons subject to a transit visa and in particular that it may be made by reference to, not just nationality and citizenship, but also to "origin or other connection with any particular country or territory, but not to reference to race, colour or religion". It is ILPA's view that the italicized reference should be deleted as tending to undermine the anti-discriminatory prohibitions which appear later in the clause.
<P>
34. Amendment Delete "origins" to "territory"
<P>
 Clause 27
<P>
 35. This clause allows for the detention of any vehicle ship or plane used to carry passengers which is owned by someone on whom a carriers' liability charge is pending, and for the sale of that item if there is no payment of the charge within 56 days.
<P>
34. We repeat our point that the more draconian the powers available against carriers who bring (inter alia) refugees, the more refugees will be prevented from arriving here at all.
<H4><center>PART III BAIL</center></H4>
<H4><center> Clause 29</center></H4>
<P>
1. This clause introduces a system of routine bail hearings for those detained under the 1971 Act or the 1993 Act, parallel to the existing bail structure under the 1971 Act (as amended).
<P>
2. Query The current procedures for bail are spread over several paragraphs of Schedule 2 of the 1971 Act. The Bill does not propose to alter these in any way. It seems sensible for the Bill to be amended so that the same rules, procedures and tests apply to all bail applications, whether elective or routine. This would need substantial redrafting of the Part III of the Bill and consequent amendment of the 1971 Act. Given the complexity of current provisions on bail the new regime can only compound the problems.
<P>
3. Sub-Clause 29(l): No Comment.
<P>
4. Sub-Clause 29(2): This clause appears to limit the Court's jurisdiction under Section 29 to consideration of release on bail. To ensure that the jurisdiction of the Court covers the legality of the decision to detain, it is suggest that the sub-clause be amended to omit the words "on bail".
<P>
5. Amendment In line 14, delete the words "on bail".
<P>
6. Sub-Clause 29(3): This subclause confines the operation of the routine bail hearings to those detained under the 1971 Act who have not notified the SSHD in writing that they do not want their case referred to a Court. It is not clear that a detainee can change his mind after stating that he does not want to be referred to Court on the first occasion. Also, the use of the present tense means that the written notice could be given after the hearing should have taken place.
<P>
7. Amendments In line 18, delete "notifies" and insert "has notified". In line 19, after "Court" insert "on a particular occasion"
<P>
8. Sub-Clause 29(4): No Comment
<P>
9. Sub-Clause 29(5): This sub-clause sets the time period within which the second reference to the Court is to be made. It does not provide for further Routine bail hearings if a person remains in detention. Although elective bail applications would usually be possible, those with no representatives, or bad representatives, would be vulnerable. It is therefore suggested that the routine bail hearings should continue at regular intervals. A consequential amendment of Sub-clause 29(7)(b)(ii)
<P>
10. Amendments In line 27, delete "second references" and insert "further references". After line 30, add "and again not less than every twenty eight days thereafter."
<P>
11. Sub-clause 29(6): This purpose of this sub-clause appears to be to put the burden on the detainee. Again the use of "bail" seems to confine the Court's jurisdiction.
<P>
12. Amendment In line 33, delete sub-clause (6) and insert:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) (a) A court hearing any case referred to it under this Section shall order the release of the detained person, if it considers
<P>
(i)that the decision to detain the person was not in accordance with the law or with the rules applicable to the case; or,
<P>
(ii) where the decision to detain involved the exercise of a discretion by the Secretary of State or an immigration officer, that the exercise of the discretion should have been exercised differently and in any other case, shall consider whether bail should be granted.
<P>
(b) In all applications for bail under the Immigration Acts it shall be for the Secretary of State to prove that continued detention is justified."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
12. Sub-clause 29(7): There are no sanctions for non compliance with this. Also, amendments consequential on those to sub-Clause 5(b) are needed
<P>
13. Amendments In line 41, delete "second" and substitute "further". In line 41, delete "before the thirty--eighth day of following that on which he was detained" and insert "within three days of receiving the reference".
<P>
14. Sub-Clause 29(8): No comment.
<P>
15. Sub-Clause 29(9): No penalty is imposed on the Secretary of State for a failure to refer a detainee to Court for a bail hearing. The use of the phrase "as soon as reasonably practicable" is just not acceptable when the liberty of the individual is at stake. Given the Home Office past history of being unable to comply with time limits in appeals, there must be an amendment to deem detention unlawful if the SSHD does not bring the detainee before a Court.
<P>
16. Sub-Clause 29(10): The same comments as above apply.
<P>
17. Sub-Clause 29(11): Definitions section. Sub sub clause (c) allows the SSHD to specify which magistrates court is appropriate
--should be Lord Chancellor, not the Home Secretary.
<P>
18. Sub-Clause 29(12): No Comment.
<P>
19. Sub-Clause 29(13): No Comment
<P>
20. Sub-Clause 29(14): The effect of this Clause is to limit its effect, and to exclude its provisions from the provisions for bail under the 1971 Act, etc. Bearing in mind the general comments above, this sub-clause really will need to be deleted as part of a wider redrafting of the provisions relating to bail.
<P>
Clause 30
<P>
21. This clause allows the Secretary of State to specify where a bail hearing under Clause 2 is to be heard.
<P>
22. As a matter of principle, ILPA believes that hearings relating to the freedom of the individual must be open to the public (unless privacy has been requested), and must be seen to constitute an independent review. This cannot be the case if a bail hearing takes place in a prison or a detention centre. For that reason, sub sub Clauses 30 (2) (c), (d) and (e) should be deleted.
<P>
23. Amendment In line 30, delete "(c) detention centres;" to end of line 33.
<P>
Clause 31
<P>
24. This Clause limits the power of a Court to release a detainee to cases where a recognizance is entered into.
<P>
25. Generally this clause is unobjectionable, but as the recognizance imposes restrictions on an individual, with consequences for non-compliance, it is important that the person released is aware of the conditions. For that reason, ILPA believes that notification of conditions must be in writing and in a language he understands; writing alone would not be sufficient to inform illiterate detainees.
<P>
26. Amendment At page 23, in line 3, insert after "place" "The conditions imposed under this section must be notified to the person bailed in writing and in a language he understands".
<P>
Clause 32
<P>
27. This Clause entitles a court to forfeit a recognizance or a bail bond. This power mirrors the powers to forfeit contained in paragraphs Paras 23 and 31, Schedule 2 , of the 1971 Act.
Clause 33
<P>
28. This Clause allows an immigration officer or police constable to arrest a person who has, or is about to break the terms of his bail. This Clause is effectively an updated version of the provisions at paras 24 and 33 of Schedule 2 of the 1971 Act. Sub-Clause (5) the use of "if need be by force" is new. ILPA believes that such force needs to be reasonable force. This is stated in clause 117 of this Bill. In the case of a constable, it is clear that force may often be necessary to execute a warrant, but there are considerable safeguards, and the police receive specialised training in how to handle such matters. None of that applies to immigration officers. An amendment may therefore be necessary.
<P>
29. There must be some judicial oversight of an immigration officer taking someone back into custody. It may be that there is a very good reason, such as administrative error, which led the Immigration Officer to believe that the individual had breached a condition of bail. An amendment may therefore be necessary.
<P>
Clause 34
<P>
30. This Clause requires the Lord Chancellor to make procedural rules for bail hearing held under Section 29. ILPA is concerned that the reference to rules of practice should not be used to introduce criteria for granting bail, these should be on a statutory basis.
<P>
31. Sub-Clause 34(2): As with the conditions of release, it is important that the detainee understands what is happening, even more so if he is not represented.
<P>
32. Amendment At page 24, in line 35, after "Section 29" insert in writing and in a language he understands".
<P>
33. Sub-Clause 34(3): Under the Bail Acts, a detainee is allowed two full bail hearings, before the restrictions as to what can be argued. Also, this restriction will not apply to elective bail hearings under the existing provisions in the 1971 Act.
<P>
34. Amendment In line 42, delete "first reference" and insert "first and second references".
<P>
35. Sub-Clause 34(5): ILPA is concerned that all bail hearings should in principle be open to the public. However, we are concerned that the anonymity of asylum-seekers should be protected for reasons of their own safety. Therefore we propose an amendment to achieve this. In principle, as the need for an open hearing is so that justice can be seen to be done, hearings should only be in private when this is required by the interests of justice. Mere administrative convenience should not be a reason to deny public access to a hearing.
<P>
36. Amendments In line 2, delete "administration" and substitute "interests". At end of line three add "or if the detainee requests that the hearing be heard in private".
<P>
37. Sub-clause 34(6) allows the Secretary of State to authorise his own officers to conduct hearings in Magistrates' Courts. It does not, however, give rights of audience in these courts those who are not qualified solicitors or barristers. Given that clause 34(2)(b) envisages non--qualified representatives representing detainees at routine bail hearings, amendments to this Bill are necessary, as are consequential amendments of the Magistrates Court Acts.
<P>
Clause 35
<P>
38. This Clause permits bail hearings to be conducted by live video link. ILPA is very concerned about this provision. It is of paramount concern in hearings relating to the liberty of the individual that the detainee be produced. It would also put the detainee at a great disadvantage in giving evidence, and it will lead to the objectification of the detainee. It will also make virtually impossible for the detainee to instruct his representative in confidence.
<P>
39. Amendment In line 10, delete Clause 35.
<P>
Clause 36 
<P>
40. This Clause allows the Home Secretary to make rules to allow immigration bail hearings to be heard by magistrates.
<P>
41. As a point of principle, we believe that one of the parties to a hearing should not be able to dictate when and where it is to take place. For that reason, we believe that it should be for the Lord Chancellor to make these rules.
<P>
42. Amendments In line 25, delete "Secretary of State" and insert "Lord Chancellor". In line 39, delete Sub--Clause 4 and renumber.
<P>
Clause 37
<P>
43. This Clause allows the Home Office to make grant to voluntary organisations to provide advice and assistance to detainees. ILPA believes that legal aid should be extended to cover bail hearings.
<H4><center>PART IV APPEALS</center></H4>
<P>
Introduction
<P>
1. ILPA's general concerns and comments about the appeals provisions were set out in the second reading briefing (paragraphs 24-35 refer). Detailed analysis of Part IV, together with relevant schedules, follows.
<P>
2. The corollary of the contents of Part IV is the complete repeal of Part II of the 1971 Immigration Act. It is clear however that all the ramifications of such repeal have not been appreciated. Thus for example the recently established Special Immigration Appeals Commission (1997 Act refers) will be deprived of much of its jurisdiction since appeals under 2(1)(a) to (c) of that Act are predicated on the existence of provisions in Part II to the 1997 Act. And similar concerns arise with various provisions of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Order which again rely on the existence of Part II provisions in the 1971 Act. No doubt the Government will give urgent consideration to such matters, in addition to all those raised below. Further, ILPA is concerned at the failure to replicate section 21 of the 1971 Act anywhere in the Bill. The power to refer matters back to the appellate authority is an important one--as was expressly recognised by Lord Bridge in Al Mehdawi [1990] Imm AR 140. If not an oversight ILPA fundamentally opposes such repeal which is a wholly unwarranted repeal of an important safeguard (for example in "fresh evidence" cases).
<P>
Clause 38
<P>
3. ILPA welcomes the retention of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. However, ILPA has concerns as to how the Tribunal will function. ILPA opposes the routine use of single member Tribunals in contested cases; and the idea that such appeals would be primarily "paper" ones it regards as profoundly objectionable and without parallel in any other jurisdiction. See schedule 2 comments below.
<P>
Clause 39
<P>
4. See schedule 3 comments below.
<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>
<P>
5. This clause reproduces the right of appeal contained in s. 13 Immigration Act 1971 against refusals to grant leave to enter, entry clearance, certificates of entitlement. ILPA makes no specific comments.
<P>
Clause 42
<P>
6. This clause imposes limitations on the rights of appeal contained in cl 41 above. The limitations are the same as the existing limitations in sl3(3)-(5) 1971 Act. However, the clause re-introduces the right of appeal against a refusal of entry clearance for family visitors subject to the appellant paying a fixed fee in order for the appeal to be entertained.
<P>
7. ILPA supports the restoration of appeals for family visitors. However, ILPA notes that "family visitor" is not defined and is to be given such meaning as may be prescribed (cl 42(9)) and would urge a definition which is sufficiently broad so as to include (for example) persons in same sex relationships. ILPA hopes that the term will not be defined so as to exclude prospective appellants based on the distance of their relation to the sponsor or indeed so as to preclude all but relationships through blood or marriage.
<P>
8. Insofar as the clause anticipates procedures for the exercise of the right of appeal, ILPA would urge that there ought to be a right to an oral appeal and, for that right of appeal to be meaningful.
<P>
9. ILPA is concerned at the introduction of fixed fees for appeals as we believe that, in principle, access to justice in this context should not be dependent on the payment of fees. ILPA would further suggest that the fees should not be fixed at such a level so as to be either prohibitive of or a disincentive to an appeal. It is further suggested that the fee ought to be refunded on a mandatory basis unless the adjudicator dismisses the appeal for the reasons given already by the entry clearance officer.
<P>
10. Amendment CL 42(5) add: "(d) and the Secretary of State shall in such regulations provide for the mandatory re-payment of such fees where an appeal is dismissed for the reasons given by the Entry Clearance Officer"
<P>
11. Questions ILPA has a number of concerns which are reflected by the following questions which it is hoped the government is able to answer. Is it possible for an indication to be given as to be given as to the width of the "family visitor" for the purposes of cl 42? Will the definition of "family visitor" be restricted to particular relations by virtue of blood/marriage and, if so, what will be the extent of any such restrictions? Will the definition be broad enough to cover those in same sex relationships? What will be the likely cost to appellants of bringing and appeal under this clause? Will appellants be entitled to an oral hearing with legal representation at their appeal?
<P>
Clause 43
<P>
12. The clause provides for a right of appeal against decisions of the SSHD to refuse to grant further leave and permitting such an appeal even though the limited period has ended.
<P>
13. ILPA would point out that the rights of appeal provided by cl 43 are not as extensive as those provided for by existing s 14(1) 1971 Act under which a person may appeal, in addition against refusals to vary leave, against any variation of leave, i.e. as regards the imposition or variance of conditions or duration (for example curtailment in relation to which the current immigration rules provide extensively). ILPA opposes the withdrawal of such important rights of appeal, in particular in circumstances where the SSHD is contemplating increasing the scope of the power to give/refuse/vary leave (see amendments to s3 1971 Act contained in clause 2 of the Bill).
<P>
14. ILPA is further particularly concerned that such this apparent restriction of appeal rights was not the subject of any consultation, nor do the explanatory notes indicate that there is any intended change to existing appeal rights in this way. If the adverse consequence identified is simply the result of a drafting error, then it should clearly be amended as indicated below. Quite apart from ILPA opposition to such change, the restriction appears in any event to be inconsistent with the terms of cl 43(2) which contemplates rights of appeal against a refusal to vary leave (which seems to include "conditions" as well as a refusal to grant further leave).
<P>
15. ILPA is further concerned to note that cl 43(2) anticipates the withdrawal of the Variation of Leave Order 1976. This appears to be inconsistent with para 1(1) schedule IV which suggests that leave will be "continued" while an appeal is pending. It would be wholly unfair for applicants for further leave to become bereft of their leave and the benefit thereof (for example the right to work lawfully in the UK if their leave so entitles) during the period of any delay in the first instance determination by SSHD as to their right to further leave.
<P>
16. Amendments In cl 43(1) delete "to refuse to grant further" and insert: "or against any variation of the leave (whether as regards duration or conditions) or against any refusal to vary it". (The effect here is to restore the right of appeal against any variation of leave or a refusal to vary leave as is the case at present under s 14 1971 Act).
<P>
17. In cl 43(2), delete "even though the limited period has ended".
<P>
18. Add new cl 43(3) "The leave of a person mentioned in cl 43(2) who makes an application as further mentioned in cl 43(2) continues to have effect by virtue of this section until such time as a decision is made upon the application to vary leave or, if the person appeals under this section against the decision relating to that application, until such time as that appeal ceases to be pending. Nothing in this sub-section is to be read as affecting the validity of any further leave that a person may be granted when a decision is made upon the application to vary leave".<P>
<P>
19. The effect here is to ensure that a person continues to have lawful leave to enter/remain in the UK during the time it takes to make a decision on an "in time" application to vary leave when leave would otherwise expire and for that leave to continue during any period that the appellant is appealing against a negative decision on that application. It places the 1976 Order (above) on a statutory footing and also renders effective the provisions of paragraph 1(1) of schedule IV which would otherwise only have effect in those cases in which a refusal was issued and an appeal initiated at a time when the applicant still had an extant grant of leave by the Secretary of State.
<P>
20. Questions Is it intended in cl 43 to restrict rights of appeal in "variation" cases to circumstances where the SSHD refuses to grant further leave as cl 43(1) states (notwithstanding the apparent contrary indication in cl 43(2)) and to thereby preclude appeals against other variations of leave as is presently provided for by sl4(l) 1971 Act? If so, what is the justification for this restriction especially in the light of the envisaged enhanced powers to vary leave as contained in cl 2 of the bill?
<P>
21. Does cl 43(2) anticipate the abolition of VOLO? If so, how is this consistent with the effect of paragraph 1(1) of schedule IV to the Bill?
<P>
22. If the Variation of Leave Order is to be abolished, does this mean that, for example, a person who applies for a variation of their leave who enjoys extant leave with no working restrictions, will cease to be working lawfully in the UK (and in respect of whose employment, an employer will fall foul of the illegal working sanctions in the 1993 Act) as a result of a delay in dealing with their application notwithstanding the fact that the application is subsequently successful without even the need to resort to an appeal?
<P>
Clause 45
<P>
23. This clause provides for the right of appeal for persons who are subject to the only two remaining categories of persons who may be subject to "deportation" (as opposed to administrative removal under cl 6). Paragraph 30 to schedule 12 of the Bill amends s3(5) 1971 Act to the effect that the power of deportation remains only in respect of those whom the Secretary of State determines that their presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good and in respect of those who have a family member who is being deported.
<P>
24. ILPA fundamentally opposes the abolition of in-country appeals on the merits of deportation in respect of those who have breached conditions of leave and/or overstayed (see comments in relation to cl 48 below). It is hoped that, in relation to "conducive" and family deportation cases, the wide ranging list of factors contained in the current immigration rules, which set out the matters which must be taken into account by the Secretary of State and also by the appellate authorities, will remain.
<P>
25. ILPA welcomes the apparent intention of the legislation to allow an appeal to the adjudicator in the first instance in deportation cases with an appeal thereafter to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. ILPA believes that there is no reason in principle why appeals under these provisions should enjoy only one tier of appeal in contradistinction to all other appeals before the Immigration Appellate Authority with the exception of certified appeals.
<P>
26. The explanatory notes say "under the Bill, deportation will be reserved for cases where removal is conducive to the public good or recommended by the Court; these cases will now all go to the adjudicator at first instance or to the Special Immigration Appeals commission". ILPA would have welcomed a provision in the Bill which did indeed give a right of an appeal to an adjudicator against a recommendation of deportation made by a criminal court. Unfortunately the Bill does not do this and so the unsatisfactory position remains that where criminal courts recommend deportation the only appeal is within the criminal system against such recommendation. But of course the effective decision is made by the Secretary of State and against this there is no appeal. ILPA would welcome an amendment to give effect to the terms of the explanatory note so as to avert this long unsatisfactory anomaly. Further the reference to the SIAC in the explanatory notes is also flawed: see "introduction" at paragraph 2 above.
<P>
27. Amendments Delete paragraph 30(2) of schedule IV; delete cl 48(1)b) of the Bill and; Delete cl 6. The effect is to restore the existing position as regards those persons who are to be enforced against by way of deportation and to enable the same to an in-country right of appeal on the merits of their cases.
<P>
Clause 47
<P>
28. Clause 47(1) confers a right of appeal against decisions on entry and stay on the ground that the decision breaches the person's human rights.
<P>
29. This clause creates a new ground of appeal against adverse decisions concerning entry and stay. The effect of sub-clause (1) is that the right of appeal is against decisions made by the Home Office or an immigration officer. But the clause does not provide any appeal on human rights grounds against decisions made by entry clearance officers in British posts overseas; it should do. Their decisions may well impinge on the human rights of family members who are in the UK and whose rights under the ECHR the government is committed to protect.
<P>
30. Sub-clause (2) defines what is meant by a breach of human rights in this context: it means any act or omission that is unlawful under section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998. Section 6(1) makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with any of those rights under the European Convention on Human Rights ("ECHR") incorporated into UK law.
<P>
31. In the context of immigration decisions the most relevant ECHR rights are:
<P>
a. The right to life guaranteed by Article 2 of the ECHR.
<P>
b. The prohibition on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment contained in Article 3.
<P>
c. The right to respect for private and family life contained in Article 8.
<P>
d. The right to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the ECHR without discrimination on grounds such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin--article 14.
<P>
32. In a number of cases the European Court of Human Rights has held the United Kingdom to be in breach of the ECHR in the area of immigration decision-making. For example, in 1985 the Court rules that the different rules on the admission of husbands and wives violated the ECHR's prohibition on discrimination and the rules on the admission of spouses had as a result of the ruling to be changed (Abdulaziz, Balkandali and Cabales case
). In 1996 the court rules that the proposed return of a Sikh activist to India would expose him to a risk of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 (Chahal case). In 1997 the Court ruled that the deportation of an AIDS sufferer to a country which lacked any treatment or other support for AIDS patients was a violation of the prohibition on inhuman and degrading treatment (D v United Kingdom
).
<P>
33. The introduction of this new right of appeal to an adjudicator is to be welcomed. Under the present law adjudicators and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal are not entitled to allow an appeal on the ground that the decision appealed against was made in breach of ECHR rights. The new appeal right will enable adjudicators and the Tribunal to consider the facts of the case and allow the appeal of satisfied that the decision violates the appellant's rights under the ECHR.
<P>
Issues of concern/possible amendments
<P>
34. It is unclear whether the omission of entry clearance officer decisions from the new human rights appeal framework is deliberate or accidental. Decisions to refuse entry clearance are as likely to violate human rights as Home Office or immigration officer decisions, particularly in cases involving applications by close family members to join their relatives in the United Kingdom. Current Home Office policy is to expect spouses (of British nationals) who are here illegally to go abroad and apply for entry clearance to join their British spouse. Persons who pursue this option and are then refused entry clearance would not, as the clause is presently drafted, be able to appeal against the refusal on human rights grounds.
<P>
35. Sub-clause (5) provides that an appeal "may" be allowed if the adjudicator or Tribunal decides that the decision appealed against is in breach of the appellant"s human rights. This appears to give a discretion not to allow the appeal even in cases where the decision violates the United Kingdom's human rights obligations. This is unacceptable. The substitution of "shall" for "may" in line 18 would cure this defect and ensure that an appeal will succeed in all cases where the decision appealed against has been shown to be in violation of the ECHR.
<P>
36. At present clause 47 contains no prohibition on removal or deportation in cases where a person exercises their right of appeal on human rights grounds. Where the person is appealing against removal as an illegal entrant or, for example, as an overstayer then clause 48(3) would entitle them to exercise their appeal right on human rights grounds before removal. However the new provisions do not prohibit removal of persons refused entry who seek to exercise their clause 47 appeal rights (save where the person arrived with entry clearance), on the ground that their removal would, for example, violate their right to enjoyment of family life.
<P>
37. Furthermore, it is of particular concern that cl. 47(1) contains an obvious lacuna. It needs to also include decisions which if carried out would constitute a breach of the Convention.
<P>
Clause 48
<P>
38. This clause creates a new framework of appeal rights for those liable to removal for being in breach of the immigration laws whether on the ground of entering illegally, overstaying the time-limit on their stay or breaching conditions of stay (for example, working illegally).
<P>
39. The clause confers a right of appeal against the giving of removal directions but only on the ground provided for in sub-clause (2) that "in the facts of his case there was in law no power to give them on the ground on which they were given". The effect of this limitation on the ground of appeal is that illegal entrants can only challenge removal on the ground that did not enter illegally. This adds nothing to present appeal rights. The clause gives a like power to remove overstayers; they, too, can only appeal on the ground that they are not, or were not overstayers. But far more important, such appeal right is of no practical significance whatsoever since it is exercisable only after removal. Given the "narrowness" of such appeals in any event and the removal of deportation appeal rights for overstayers ILPA proposes that sub-clause (3) be deleted so as to enable an in country appeal solely on "power in law". See further below.
<P>
40. The effect of sub-clause (3) the appeal against removal directions can only be appealed against from abroad after removal, save in cases where the person appeals on human rights grounds or an asylum grounds. This will have the effect of reducing present appeal rights available to persons being deported for overstaying or breach of conditions. At present such people may appeal against deportation--while in the United Kingdom--on the ground that on the facts of the case they are not liable to deportation: see section 15, Immigration Act 1971 and section 5 Immigration Act 1988.
<P>
41. The clause contains a further very substantial reduction in the appeal rights of overstayers or persons in breach of their conditions. At present, provided they have been in the United Kingdom for at least 7 years such people can appeal against deportation on the ground that discretion should be exercised differently. This involves an adjudicator or the Tribunal considering whether relevant criteria set out in the Immigration Rules (HC395, paragraph 364) have been weighed up correctly. These criteria include the person's length of residence, connections with the United Kingdom, employment record, domestic circumstances and any compassionate circumstances. If the clause is enacted then in future adjudicators and the Tribunal will have no power to review the way in which Home Office officials have exercised discretion, apart from the limited power to consider whether there has been a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>
42. The removal of a right of appeal on compassionate grounds is deeply objectionable and will mean that many decisions on expulsion from the United Kingdom are not subject to any effective independent review. There are many cases where a person's removal from the United Kingdom would not breach the European Convention on Human Rights but should nonetheless be regarded as wrong in principle because of the hardship that would result from expulsion.
<P>
43. During the passing of section 5 of the Immigration Act 1988 (which removed the right of appeal on compassionate grounds from persons here less than 7 years) Alun Michael said that: "It will harm people with humanitarian reasons for wishing to remain in the UK. They may have families here, they may have been here for many years and have no roots overseas, or they may be doing valuable jobs in the community, yet they will be prevented from challenging the decision to expel them from Britain. It also means there will be no opportunity for the independent appellate system to consider and decide on the compassionate circumstances of a person subject to immigration control who seeks to remain here. It must be wrong that people who are well rooted in the community should have their right of appeal removed..." [Standing Committee D, 12.1.88 col. 481]. These words are equally apt comment on the effect of clause 48.
<P>
44. The reduction in deportation appeal rights effected by the 1988, with the result that officials have no independent check on the quality of their decisions, largely accounts for a very substantial increase in the number of deportation decisions made from a figure of 860 in 1987 to 5240 in 1997. The system of immigration appeals was established in 1969 following the recommendations of the Wilson Committee in 1967 which concluded: "However well administered the present control may be, it is fundamentally wrong and inconsistent with the rule of law that power to take decisions affecting a man's whole future should be vested in officers of the executive, from whose findings there is no appeal.
<P>
45. Clause 48 goes considerably further than section 5 of the 1988 Act in reducing in-country rights of appeal: not only will there be no appeal at all on compassionate grounds but the present right of overstayers to challenge the legality of the decision to deport them by appealing to an adjudicator before deportation is implemented will be abolished. This can only increase the number of challenges to deportation by way of application for judicial review in the High Court. The appeal from abroad after removal is an ineffective remedy: the appellant cannot be present at the appeal hearing, has no opportunity to give live oral evidence and may have difficulty instructing competent representatives from overseas.
<P>
46. The Home Office has argued that "removal" is a less drastic measure than "deportation". But such distinction is illusory (see clause 6 commentary above).
<P>
Clauses 49-50
<P>
47. These clauses reproduce, with minor amendment provisions that already exist in the Immigration Act 1971, section 17. These provisions confer a right of appeal against the destination to which a person is to be removed or deported.
<P>
48. Although these clauses largely reproduce existing provisions of the 1971 Act, as a result of other changes in the Bill, the effect is that persons being removed under clause 6 as overstayers (or for breach of conditions) will no longer have a right of appeal against the destination to which they are to be removed. At present someone who is being deported will be able to object to their destination and an adjudicator can order deportation to a different country or territory if satisfied that the person will be admitted to that different country. By reason of clause 6 overstayers will in future not be subject to deportation but will instead be liable to removal. However clause 49 does not introduce any right of appeal against destination for those liable to removal for overstaying. This right to object to destination is limited to persons refused entry, persons being deported and those being removed for having entered illegally in breach of a deportation order. The removal of a right of appeal against right of appeal is a particular matter of concern in view of the removal of the night to appeal on compassionate grounds.
<P>
Clause 51
<P>
49.This clause gives rights of appeal in asylum cases in broadly similar terms to s. 8 1993 Act. It is however a cause for concern that cl. 51(2) refers to "a person who has limited leave". ILPA"s understanding of cl. 43 is that a person does not need to have a limited leave when refused a variation application in order to appeal (in other words "VOLO" is to become "redundant"). Assuming such analysis to be correct cl. 51(2) requires amendment so as to reflect the cl. 43 position.
<P>
50. Amendments Cl. 51(2) insert the phrase "and applies before the end of that period for his leave to be varied" after "United Kingdom" and before "may appeal" (line 34). See confusion as to inter-relationship with cl. 43 above.
<P>
51. Cl. 51(5) by addition at end of "... or the ECHR" (for the purposes of clarity arising on the present drafting of cl. 47).
<P>
52. Question Is ILPA's analysis of the "VOLO" position correct and/or intended?
<P>
Clause 52
<P>
53. Limits cl. 51 appeal rights in certain circumstances. Cl. 52(1)-(2) replicate "national security" limitations presently contained in para. 6, sch. 2 of 1993 Act. Note personal decision required of SSHD in all cases. 52(6) replicates para. 2, sch.2 1993 Act. ILPA opposes cl. 52(7); although it replicates s8(3A) of 1993 Act (as amended by para. 2, sch. 3 of 1996 Act) it could leave a persons without any right of appeal in deportation cases (where for example) through negligence of adviser the cl. 51(3)(a) appeal right was not exercised. The "old" s. 8(3) ("but a person may not bring an appeal under both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) above") was more than sufficient to prevent any duplication of appeals. Further, ILPA is concerned as to how persons who claim asylum after the making of a decision to make a deportation order (cl. 51(3)(a) (non cl. 6 "removal" type cases) and persons who claim asylum after refusal to revoke a deportation order (perhaps as refugees "sur place"). How is it intended that their 1951 Convention claim be appealed?
<P>
54. Amendment Cl. 52(7) omits words in brackets and substitute "and he has exercised it". This would deal with the aim of the 1996 amendment without leaving certain asylum seekers without an appeal right.
<P>
Clause 53
<P>
55. Appeals in "safe third country cases". ILPA has always opposed the withdrawal of "in-country" appeal rights in "safe third country" cases. This was an appeal right which the Government in opposition had promised to "give back". Cl. 53(2) replicates s 3(1) of the 1996 Act. But it must be read in the light of cl. 54(2) which prevents the exercise of such appeal right before removal from the UK. Since neither ss 2 or 3 of the 1996 Act are to be repealed there will be no change.
<P>
56. Amendments see cl. 54 below.
<P>
Clause 54
<P>
57. "Miscellaneous" limitations on appeal rights in cls. 51 and 53. The effect of cl. 54(1) is the same as the limitation on the exercise of appeal fights in third country cases (i.e. only under cl 51/s. 8 1993 Act). But it is unclear whether cl. 54(2) is intended to prevent an in-country appeal where the country of proposed destination is not designated under section 2(3) of the 1996 Act. If so this is a completely unjustified "tightening" which ILPA opposes. It would seem not to be the case from cl. 54(3) but cl./54(2) as drafted already precludes all persons from appealing before removal. Further, the phrase "as respects any matter arising" in cl. 54(2) is ambiguous: it cannot exclude any ECHR matter sought to be raised. Even although "certificated" cases under s.2 1996 Act apply only to the 1951 refugee Convention it is quite possible that such cases could raise ECHR matters.
<P>
58. Amendments Cl 54(2): substitute "is not entitled to" for "may" so as to revert to 1993 Act position. Cl. 54(3): omit. "In-country" third country appeals were a much more effective and efficient means of challenge. Now innumerable applications are made in third country cases for judicial review which is neither efficient nor cost effective--especially since the effect of the grant of leave to apply for judicial review in respect of any particular country is to frustrate all removals to such country.
<P>
59. Question Will the Government to confirm that there is no intention to withdraw "in-country" appeal rights in third country cases where "third country" is not designated. Why will not the Government fulfill its promise whilst in opposition of restoring third country appeal rights? It would plainly save the public purse given the cost to the legal aid fund of third country judicial reviews.
<P>
Clause 55
<P>
60. The "one stop" appeal procedure. ILPA opposes this procedure. It is the corollary of the withdrawal of deportation appeal rights provided for by cl. 6 of the Bill. ILPA believes that there should be a "full" deportation appeal right at which adjudicators could substitute their discretion for that of the Secretary of State. Such an appeal should also cover "illegal entrants" as well. ILPA's views are well known to the Government; indeed, they were consistently shared by them in opposition, in particular during the passage of the 1988 Act when deportation appeal rights were curtailed. It is ironic that even the Conservative Government at that time would likely not have got away with the complete withdrawal of deportation appeal rights. The increase in numbers of asylum applications is a reflection of a far more troubled world producing much greater numbers of asylum seekers; that this should be sued in justification of the compete withdrawal of appeal rights (so the "innocent") manifestly suffer) is indefensible.
<P>
61. It is entirely unclear how the "one stop" procedure will work in practice. If implemented it would be far more sensible to introduce some kind of "minded to refuse" procedure at which time the putative appellant could raise matters. Cl. 55 (1)(b): must such appeal right have been exercised? When will the "notice" under cl 53(3) be served (presumably when notice of refusal of ELE/R is given). How can a person be expected to know about all the "concessions", all the more so in an RLE case. If all is predicated on a refusal and service of notice of decision, what will happen to the "appeal" whilst the matters raised in the statement are considered. But it does seem that "any additional grounds" in cl. 55(3) is wide: note that the cl.55(5) matters are not exhaustive of cl.
 55(3), but sets down requirements in respect of three types of additional grounds (but not the only ones).
<P>
62. Amendments Cl. 55(1) Insert after "if" the following "the Secretary of State is minded to refuse an application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom and the applicant would have a right of appeal against such decision under this Act". Omit completely sub. cl. (1)(a) and (b) as drafted. See comments above: otherwise it is difficult to envisage how this will work in practice.
<P>
63. Cl. 55(3): substitute for "relevant" the word "dependant".
<P>
64. [Consequential amendment to sch, 4, part 1, para. 4(2) by addition of "or putative appellant within the meaning of cl. 55(1)" so as to make clear that the right to legal representation applies in such "one stop" cases.]
<P>
65. Question What is it anticipated might be covered by cl. 55(2)? ILPA would want to see the proposed definition of family in cl. 55(6). What are the notice requirements intended to be?
<P>
Clause 56
<P>
66. Penalties for failure to comply with the "statement" provisions. Broadly speaking grounds, concessions, asylum and ECHR issues only able to be raised on appeal if not in "statement" if SSHD considers that the applicant had a reasonable excuse for the omission.
<P>
67. Whether asylum/ECHR is raised solely as delaying tactic manifestly a matter which itself must be justiciable before the appellate authorities; no justification whatsoever for this to be simply a matter for SSHD. Ditto "reasonable" excuse under cl. 56(9) covering all matters.
<P>
68. Amendments Add at end of sub-cl. (9) "unless at the hearing of any appeal the adjudicator, special adjudicator or tribunal (as the case may be) considers that the applicant had a reasonable excuse for the omission". See comment for reason for amendment. The Secretary of state ought not be concerned that his view of "reasonable excuse" would be subject to scrutiny by the appellate authority. The consequences of not taking such approach would be absurd, since judicial review would be required to be sought on the sole issue of "reasonable excuse".
<P>
69. Add as new sub-cl. (11) "Subsection (9) above shall not apply where the adjudicator, special adjudicator or tribunal (as the case may be) considers that an appellant's human rights have been breached or where any removal would be a breach of the [1951 Refugee] Convention". This is crucial, lest the appellate authority will be completely powerless to stop any breach: even a person's who has no reasonable excuse could be at risk of (for example) treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR if removed.
<P>
Clause 57
<P>
70. Requires SA to consider "additional grounds" in asylum appeals. This would appear to make the asylum appeal with any element of "one-stop" a "mixed appeal".
<P>
71. Amendments Insert new sub-clause (3)(c) as follows "and may allow the appeal on any of the additional grounds raised". Without such amendment sub-cl. (3) is otiose.
<P>
72. Substitute the word "statement" for the word "notice": this is for the sake of consistency. The 55(3) obligation is on the applicant to "state" certain matters in a notice; Cl. 55(4) refers to the contents of the "statement".
<P>
73. Questions What is the appeal jurisdiction? No equivalent of 58(2) ("may allow an appeal on any one of them").
<P>
Clause 58
<P>
74. Requires adjudicator or Tribunal to consider "additional grounds" in relation to cl. 43 appeals.
<P>
75. This provision is very confusing. Cl. 58(2) would appear to contemplate a further decision to be taken by SSHD ("but the SSHD refuses the application for leave"). It is for precisely this reason that ILPA suggests the form of "minded" procedure referred to above. Further, ILPA considers that sub-cl. (5) is ill conceived. It should allow (at least) for the possibility of a person becoming a "refugee sur place" on account of recent changes in his/her country of origin.
<P>
76. Amendment Delete sub-cl. (5) because of "refugee sur place" point.
<P>
Clause 59
<P>
 77. Penalties for proceeding with an appeal to the Tribunal in cases considered by the Tribunal to have "no merit" if such appeal subsequently is dismissed. ILPA is fundamentally opposed to this provision. The explanatory notes make clear that the power will be exercised if no leave is required. [The present position is that leave is required.] Plainly this is with an eye to cutting out judicial review. ILPA's reasons for opposing this provision are at para. 33 of its second reading briefing. If there is to be such provision it should only bite where appeals are considered an abuse of the process of the court, and not merely when believed by the tribunal to be without merit.
<P>
78. Amendment Delete clause. Alternatively, amendments must ensure that the provision can only bite where appeals are pursued that are an abuse of the process of the Court. Furthermore, ILPA is particularly concerned at possibility of an appellant being personally liable.
<P>
Schedule 2
<P>
79. Schedule 2 makes provision for the Tribunal. The effect of paragraph 1(3) is to abolish lay members. Paragraph 6(3) provides that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal may be exercised by a single member and by direction of the President under 6(4), in circumstances specified by the President. Such circumstances may relate either to a category of cases or to a specific case.
<P>
80. ILPA is aware of discussion about the possibility of appeals to the Tribunal being "paper" appeals (without a right to an oral hearing). ILPA is fundamentally opposed to any such proposal which is virtually unheard of. It is unthinkable that the fact that there was a full civil trial prior to appeal to the Court of Appeal might be put forward as reason to support an argument that appeals to the Court of Appeal should be considered without a hearing. Whilst on occasions it is appropriate to dispense with oral hearings (for example where a case is to be remitted and such remittal is unopposed), this could never be appropriate where a party objects to such course. ILPA seeks confirmation from the Government that it has no such intention.
<P>
81. ILPA would oppose the routine use of single-member Tribunals in place of "lay members" who are to be abolished. Tribunal members tend to be recruited from among the ranks of Adjudicators. An appeal to the IAT could amount to no more than a second appeal to an Adjudicator, or a sort of "peer review"--especially given the practice of having adjudicators sit as part time Tribunal members and in view of the fact that under the Presidency of Pearl HHJ Tribunals are taking the view findings of fact by special adjudicators can be reviewed in an increasingly broad range of circumstances. ILPA does not believe that persons should be able to serve simultaneously as Adjudicator and as Tribunal member.
<P>
82. At the same time, it is clearly important that Tribunal members should have expert knowledge of immigration and asylum law and practice. A major problem at present is the poor quality and lack of experience of some members--and this cannot be said to apply simply to the lay members. There is no guarantee that such expertise will be obtained from persons legally qualified for seven years (paragraph 1(3) refers). Given in particular the wide ranging impact that cl. 47 will have on decision making it is desirable that the necessary expertise for appointment as a Tribunal member be more widely based than is provided for by paragraph 1(3). Academics with relevant experience would be another obvious candidate as might some lay practitioners with long experience in the field.
<P>
83. As for the composition of the Tribunal in "a specified case or category of case", ILPA would object to the use of directions by the President, which could be varied as and when he sees fit, rather than, as at present, the use of statutory instrument (the Procedure Rules). ILPA seeks clarification as to the intended use of such power, in particular in its reference to "a specified case". It would be objectionable if identical cases falling within the same category could be dealt with differently, and therefore there should be no power to vary the composition of the IAT from case to case, only (if at all) from category to category.
<P>
Amendments
<P>
 Replace 6(3) with wording of Sch 5, Part II, para 12 of the 1971 Act [provides for 3-member Tribunals], omitting the wording requiring one member to be legally qualified.
<P>
 Consequently, in 6(4) replace "But the President may direct that" with "Rules of procedure laid down by the LC under Sch 4, Part I, para 3 of this Act may provide that". Present 6(5) would then be deleted and 6(6) (which would become new 6(5)) would need to be amended to read "Specified" means specified in the Rules of procedure."
<P>
 Again in 6(4), omit "case or" (effect is to say that the Rules should apply to categories of case and not to individual cases).
<P>
Again in 6(4), insert "uneven" before "number" (presently there cannot be an even number of members hearing a case, for good reason, in that majority decisions would obviously be a little tricky if there were).
<P>
To prevent persons acting as both adjudicators and IAT members, in para 1, insert: "(4) No person holding office as an Adjudicator under Section 39 and Schedule 3 of this Act shall at the same time be qualified for appointment as a member of the Tribunal".
<P>
Add to qualifications for appointment that the person shall have had experience of immigration/asylum law and practice.
<P>
Insert, in para 1, a sub-para (5), allowing for the appointment of non-legal members of suitable professional or academic standing.
<P>
84. ILPA re affirms its insistence that draft rules of procedure should be available to the Committee. At the very least ILPA requires immediate clarification of the intended and/or anticipated use of single member Tribunals.
<P>
Schedule IV
<P>
Paragraph I
<P>
85. Paragraph 1(1) appears to "continue" an extant leave where a person appeals pursuant to cl.41 or cl.43 (on entry refusals and variation refusals) during the pendancy of the appeal.
<P>
86. See comments as to cl 43 above. It is noted however that this position appears to be inconsistent with cl 43(2) and also with paragraph 1(4) of schedule IV which appears to provide protection against being required to leave the UK where none would appear necessary pursuant to the terms of paragraph 1(1), schedule IV. As noted above there should be a uniform provision in all cases where a variation application has been made during the currency of existing leave. Whether the Home Office thereafter reaches a decision before that leave expires should be immaterial. ILPA proposes that in both cases the applicant should be treated as lawfully in the UK until that decision has been made and any appeal which the applicant is entitled to bring whilst in the UK is still pending.
<P>
87. Paragraph 1(2) reproduces the existing s14(5) (added by IA 1988 s10 schedule paragraph 3) to the effect that a variation appeal lapses when a deportation order is made. ILPA makes no comment.
<P>
88. Paragraph 1(3) reproduces existing s14(1) 1971 Act which prevent variations from taking effect so long as an appeal to which it relates is pending.
<P>
89. Paragraph 1(4) replicates the protection from removal while an appeal is pending under s14(1). The sub-para appears to be inconsistent with sub-para 1 (above) in that, if leave is continued during the pendancy of the appeal, this protection is otiose.
<P>
90. Amendment Delete sub-para 1(4).
<P>
Paragraph 2
<P>
90. This sub para replicates s18 1971 Act as also applied by para 4 sched 2 1993 Act and rules of procedure which provide for notice etc requirements.
<P>
Paragraph 3
<P>
91. This paragraph provides generally for rules of procedure governing appeals
<P>
Paragraph 4
<P>
92. This paragraph contains further general provisions as to procedure but, in addition, seeks to enable appeals to be determined without hearings and without consideration of the merits of the appeal in prescribed circumstances.
<P>
93. ILPA opposes the power provided to enable the IAA to dismiss appeals without consideration of the merits (paragraph 4(1)(b)). In particular, in cases involving applications for asylum/human rights issues, it cannot be right that an appeal may be dismissed without investigation of the merits by reason of a failure of a party to attend an appeal or to comply with (often onerous) directions for the further conduct of an appeal issued by the IAA. These failings may have nothing whatever to do with the merits of the case and to preclude the safeguard of independent review may result in removals contrary to article 33 1951 Convention and/or breaches of ECHR.
<P>
94. Paragraph 4(1)(d) allows the procedure rules to prescribe circumstances in which the Tribunal may seek to set aside a determination of the Tribunal. This is a new power and appears to contemplate the Tribunal setting aside earlier determinations in certain circumstances for example the production of fresh evidence not available to the IAA which might have effected the outcome of the appeal. ILPA would suggest that such power ought to be extended to Adjudicators/Special Adjudicators in cases where, for example, there is no right of appeal to the Tribunal and/or an appellant has not sought to appeal or leave to appeal was refused.
<P>
95. ILPA welcomes this additional avenue of redress but opposes the creation of this power as an alternative to request to references back to the IAA by the Secretary of State (s2l having been omitted along with the rest of part II 1971 Act: see paragraph 2 of introduction above). ILPA would urge that the s2l remedy co-exists with the right of the IAA to re-open issues. The rationale for this is that there are cases in which the Secretary of State, wholly aside from the view of the IAA, considers that the advice of a specialized independent review body in order to determine the case on the basis of the fresh material presented (see Khaldoun [1996] Imm AR 200 CA, Bello [1995] Imm AR 537 and the terms in which the Secretary of State at present responds to requests to make a reference pursuant to s21).
<P>
96. Amendment: Delete paragraph 4(l)(1).
<P>
97. ILPA is concerned that unrepresented appellants do not face the dismissal of their appeals without a hearing, particularly on the basis of a technical breach of directions. Even in these cases the material produced by the appellant in paper form may give cause for concern so that they cannot be safely removed or consistent with their human rights. There is a second concern that the rules should couple any residual power to deal summarily in cases where appellants do not attend should be accompanied by a power to reconsider such decisions if it later emerges that there was a good reason for the appellant's non attendance.
<P>
98. 4(1)(c) does not appear to make sense, seeming, in the final part, to envisage that an appeal could be remitted to an adjudicator for evidence to be obtained by the adjudicator, but that the Tribunal would then determine the appeal. It seems unlikely that this rather odd process is what is intended.
<P>
99. 4(1)(d) is not clear: it may intend that the Tribunal could set aside a refusal of leave, or it may intend that fresh evidence could persuade the IAT to re-open a case. The prospect of rival Chairs overturning each other's determinations, e.g. on sexual orientation cases or the dangers faced in certain countries, is unedifying. Clarification of the intention of this needs to be sought.
<P>
100. 4(2) comes as a surprise to many of us, but it is, as was pointed out, present in the 1971 Act (Section 22(3)), albeit with very slightly different wording ("shall have the right" as opposed to the present "is to have the right"). However, it is also worth pointing out that the 1984 and 1996 Rules interpret this very weakly. Para 26 in each case is apparently intended to meet the requirement, but in fact in each case limits itself to saying that parties "may act in person or may be represented". Attention needs to be paid to this paragraph as it presently appears, in order to ensure that the "right" is enforceable, and that it means "opportunity", rather than just being an optional extra. ILPA does not imagine that when the 1971 Act was drafted, the shortfall in representation was anything like as acute as it is now, and so issues of opportunity did not arise.
<P>
101. ILPA suggests an amendment providing that no appeal shall be heard unless the appellant has been given an adequate opportunity to find representation, and that directions against the appellant shall not be enforced under 4(l)(b) if the reason for failing to comply is lack of representation or inadequacy of representation.
<P>
102. Furthermore, ILPA believes that the right to be legally represented must exist from the stage of the service of a Section 55 notice (if not indeed from the commencement of the application for asylum). The Home Office's argument that applicants do not need representation at interview, because all they have to do is tell the truth, is in itself objectionable; but such observation becomes completely redundant when applicants are being asked to raise ECHR points or "prescribed concessions" at the time of refusal.
<P>
Paragraph 9
<P>
103. This paragraph "keeps" certified asylum cases. ILPA welcomes the abolition of the "white list" but oppose the retention of certification as a whole. The express intention of this part of the Bill, as explained by Jack Straw in the second reading debate, is to give the Tribunal greater authority and to cut down the use of judicial review. Certification has the opposite effect in each case.
<P>
104. Moreover, as certification applies only to 1951 Convention cases, the effect could be to deprive appellants of recourse to the Tribunal when they have strong points of law relating to the ECHR or to "prescribed concessions". One way round this might be to say that certification does not apply if the appeal to the IAT is on points not related to the 1951 Convention.
<P>
105. Paragraph 9(3) is of course particularly objectionable since it penalises people for not having passports, a matter which is irrelevant to a fear of persecution, and would indeed affect worst of all those whose fear of persecution by the state is greatest. The Home Office regularly refuses asylum to people who do have valid documents, and so to penalise those who do not is curious to say the least.
<P>
106. Amendments
<P>
 2(l): replace "may" with "shall".
<P>
4(1)(b): Insert before "enabling": "save where the appellant is not represented".
<P>
4(1)(c): Delete from "or" onwards and replace with (depending on what we think it is meant to mean) either "or to direct that further evidence be obtained with a view to determining the appeal itself or "or for further evidence to be obtained with a view to determination by the adjudicator".
<P>
 9: delete
<P>
9 (alternatively): delete (3)
<P>
 9 (alternatively again): in 9(2) insert at the end "on any point relating to the Convention" [meaning the 1951 Convention].
<P>
Paragraph 10
<P>
107. Paragraph 10 is largely reflective of section 19 of the 1971 Act. Paragraph 10(3) in particular restates part of section 19(2). But an issue that has been of concern to ILPA for some time (adjudicators reviewing facts not in issue between the parties on the face of the Home Office's refusal letters and/or explanatory statements) prompts the following question. Is paragraph 10(3) intended to mean that the Adjudicator may review facts which the decision maker has accepted, i.e. facts on which the decision was not based? Is it the intention of Parliament to have a system where all matters are open, and if so, have they thought through the implications for this in terms of length of hearings, time spent on preparation, etc? (See the letter sent to Mr Latter by ILPA and Asylum Aid last year.). A simple amendment would clarify this: add the phrase "in issue" between "question of fact" and "on which the decision or action was based".
<P>
108. Further, ILPA notes that the duty to comply with any directions given is only implied (paragraph 10(6) refers). Section 19(3) of the 1971 includes the following: "it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State and any officer to whom directions are given to comply with them". It is important that paragraph 10(5) be amended to like effect as section 19(3) of the 1971 Act by the addition of the same phrase at the end of sub-paragraph (5).
<P>
109. Paragraph 11
<P>
110. This deals with the Tribunal's jurisdiction and is broadly similar to its existing jurisdiction (section 20 Immigration Act 1971 refers). Again, however, sub-pararaph (5) should be amended in the same terms and for the same reason as sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 10.
<H4><center>PART V IMMIGRATION ADVISERS AND IMMIGRATION SERVICE PROVIDERS</center></H4>
<P>
Clause 61
<P>
Definition of "relevant matters": clause 61
<P>
1. Not included in this list are rights under the European Convention of Human Rights/the Human Rights Act 1998 so far as they impinge on the right to enter, or remain in the UK or to resist removal from the UK. Given the introduction of a new right of appeal on these grounds (clause 47) this is an important omission.
<P>
Providing advice in the course of a business clause 61(2)
<P>
2. In the 2nd reading debate, 22 February 1999, Humfrey Malins MP asked whether Members of Parliament could continue to give advice in their constituency surgeries without requiring to be registered. Mike O'Brien said that they would not. Initially he said this was because they would not be acting for profit (col 73). However, cl 61(2) defines the provision of immigration advice in terms that makes it clear that the profit element is immaterial. Later in the debate the Minister said that MPs would not be caught because they were not acting, in the course of a business (col 121).
<P>
3. We think that this should be explored further. MPs, of course, receive a salary. Might it not be said that the constituency advice is part of their job and therefore is part of their "business". If there is something special about MPs, we would ask whether there is also something special about MPs' advisers, secretaries or assistants. Is there a similar principle which would protect local councillors who may also be asked for advice?
<P>
Clause 62
<P>
4. This establishes the Immigration Services Commissioner
<P>
Appointment of the Commissioner: clause 62(2)
<P>
5. The Bill provides that the Commissioner should be appointed by the Secretary of State. We consider that this is wrong. The advisers and representatives whom the Commissioner will be regulating will be constantly in an adversarial relationship with the Secretary of State. This means that this regulatory function is unlike many of the regulators who are appointed by the minister of the department most closely connected with their subject matter. Independence of advisers is critical. Independence of the regulator is also essential. We think that the Commissioner should be appointed by the Lord Chancellor.
<P>
The exercise of the Commissioner's functions: clause 62(5)
<P>
6. Clause 62(5) provides a list of criteria which the Commissioner must observe. Although we think that this is probably intended, the Bill should make clear that these are criteria to be applied in the exercise of functions given elsewhere in the Bill. These criteria should not become free-standing functions of their own. If they were, the Commissioner's functions would be considerably enlarged and be of uncertain span.
<P>
7. We propose inserting after "must exercise his functions" the words "as otherwise conferred on him by this Act.
<P>
The general prohibition: clause 63
<P>
8. This provision sets out the basic principle that immigration advice and services should only be given by certain categories of persons who (in general) are subject to some degree of supervision and regulation.
<P>
9. The Bill gives a power to the Commissioner to exempt people from the requirement to register (cl.63(4)(a)) and the Secretary of State the power to prescribe by order people who can give immigration advice or services without infringing the general prohibition.
<P>
10. We understand that the Home Secretary intends one or other of these powers to be used to allow not-for-profit organisations to continue to provide advice without registering. If this understanding is correct, we do not see why the Bill should not say so.
<P>
11. We do not understand why the Commissioner should be given a general power to make exemptions unconstrained by rules, regulations or (apparently) any principles for which there is democratic accountability.
<P>
12. We think that there could usefully be the possibility of partial exemptions so that, for instance, a person might be exempt from registration for the purpose of giving advice, but not exempt (and so required to register) for the purpose of representation.
<P>
Schedule 5
<P>
The Commissioner's Rules: Schedule 5 para 1
<P>
13. Paragraph 1 allows the Commissioner to draw up rules regulating any aspect of professional practice. Paragraph 1(2) requires him to consult with such persons engaged in the provision of immigration advice and services as he considers appropriate.
<P>
14. We think that the consultation requirement should be the same as for the Code i.e. the Commissioner should be required to consult the designated bodies (essentially the legal professions) as well as such other bodies as he considers appropriate.
<P>
15. The members of the designated bodies could (conceivably) become subject to the Rules if their body's designation is withdrawn. In any case, consultation with the designated bodies is mandatory in the case of the Code even though the Code will not (initially) apply to persons authorised by a designated body. Thirdly, the Rules are likely to regulate conduct which is similar to conduct regulated by the designated bodies in relation to their own members. The Commissioner should be required to draw on their experience and take account of any comments on draft rules which they may make.
<P>
16. We propose that Para 1(2) should say: "Before making or altering any rules, the Commissioner must consult: each of the designated professional bodies; and such other person appearing to him to represent the views of person engaged in the provision of immigration advice or immigration services as he considers appropriate.
<P>
Extension of the scope of the Code: Schedule 5 para 3
<P>
17. This paragraph allows the Secretary of State after consulting the Commissioner and with the consent of the Lord Chancellor to extend the Code to any designated body.
<P>
18. We are concerned that the government should be given this power (even in the form of a reserve power) in relation to legal professionals. We consider that it impinges on the fundamental principle of professional independence. We also think that it is unnecessary. In practice the Commissioner's Code is likely to be referred to in disciplinary proceedings even if it is not binding. The powers of persuasion of the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State should not be underestimated.
<P>
Investigation of complaints: Schedule 5 Paragraph 4
<P>
19. Paragraph 4 gives the Commissioner power to investigate complaints in relation to a number of matters.
<P>
20. Paragraph 4(2)(c) refers to "an alleged breach of the Code". We believe that this should be amended to add "by a person to whom the Code applies". This would match the corresponding provision in paragraph 4(2)(d) in relation to a complaint that the Commissioner's Rules have been breached.
<P>
Complaints relating to the designated professionals
<P>
21. Paragraph 4(2)(e) allows the Commissioner to investigate complaints that persons authorised by one of the designated professional bodies or their employees are in breach of their professional rules.
<P>
22. We believe that there should not be duplication of regulation in this fashion. It creates many potential problems. Suppose the regulatory authority was already investigating the complaint. It makes no sense to have this duplicated. There is a further risk of differing interpretations of the designated body's rules and it is the professional bodies who should interpret their own rules. The person subject to the investigation will have to respond to questions from two different sources although both are investigating the same alleged default. In our view, if the Commissioner receives a complaint in relation to a person authorised by a designated professional body or an employee of such, he should refer the matter to the relevant regulatory body. If it is said that the Commissioner has powers of investigation that the professional bodies do not, this can be resolved by giving the regulatory bodies of the professions comparable powers. We understand that the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors is going to make such a suggestion.
<P>
The exclusion of Crown and government employees
<P>
23. The closing words of paragraph 4(2) exclude from the Commissioner's jurisdiction two groups.
<P>
24. The first are those who are excluded from s.63(l) by s.63(4)(b). S.63(4)(b) refers to employees of exempt persons. We cannot see why they should be excluded from the Commissioner's jurisdiction if their employers are subject to it. We wonder if this is a drafting error.
<P>
25. The second group are those in s.63(5). These are essentially Crown servants or agents. We agree that the Commissioner should not have jurisdiction over immigration advice given to the Crown or government departments. However, there are occasions when civil servants give advice to individuals about their own or their family's immigration position and rights. We are aware of complaints that on occasions advice given to individuals by the Public Enquiry Office at the Home Office in Lunar House has been woefully incompetent. We see no reason why the Commissioner should not be able to investigate these complaints.
<P>
Consultation on the complaints scheme
<P>
26. The paragraph requires the Commissioner to establish a complaints scheme. We think that it would be sensible for the Bill to require the Commissioner to consult with the designated bodies and such other persons as he considers appropriate in the same way as he is required to consult over his Rules and Code.
<P>
Power to enter premises: Schedule 5 para 6
<P>
27. This paragraph gives the Commissioner authority to enter premises of registered persons and require production of documents or information with the sanction of cancellation of registration for those who refuse access.
<P>
28. These are draconian powers particularly when it is recalled that these advisers will be giving legal advice and the documents on their premises will be related to that advice. Whether or not they are formally protected by legal professional privilege they come squarely within the spirit of the principle that such documents will remain confidential save in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
29. In our view it is quite wrong that the Commissioner can act in this way without any judicial supervision. Compulsory entry on to premises should be approved in advance by a Crown Court judge. This principle is accepted in the context of the investigation of even serious criminal offences where special procedure and exempt material cannot be the subject of an ordinary search warrant, but must have the specific warrant of a Crown Court judge.
<P>
30. There is a drafting error in paragraph 6(l)(b) which should cross refer to paragraph 4.
<P>
Commissioner's powers on conclusion of
investigation of complaints: Schedule 5 para 8
<P>
31. After investigating a complaint the Commissioner can lay before the Immigration Services Tribunal a disciplinary charge against a "relevant person". These include registered persons, persons employed by or working under the supervision of a registered person. An exempt person under s.63(4)(a) is also a relevant person. We understand that not-for-profit organisations are likely to be exempted from registration. Notwithstanding exemption (in effect from the registration fee), the not-for-profit sector will still be subject to the 9. An asylum seeker's "dependant" is defined so as to exclude unmarried partners, children other than sons and daughters, sons and daughters over 18 (however vulnerable), and all other relatives or household members whatsoever unless they fall into "such additional category, if any, as may be prescribed".
<P>
10. The Secretary of State has no discretion as to who he may regard as a dependant, unless the regulations (whose contents we can only guess) confer it. A much wider definition is required or the price will be on the one hand hardship, and on the other a proliferation of asylum claims by actual dependants who do not meet this restrictive definition and thus have no access to support unless they themselves claim asylum.
<P>
11. Furthermore the narrowness of the present definition may lead to interference with the right to family and private life under ECHR Article 8.
<P>
12. Amendments
<P>
Define "child of" to mean any minor who is de facto dependant on the asylum seeker.
<P>
13. Delete lines 31-32 and insert new subclause (c) "is a member of his household".
<P>
14. Import the definition of "household" European Community law (see also 73(5) below).
<P>
15. Clause 73(2) Confirms that "support" under s74 includes support provided under arrangements made by the Secretary of State under that section.
<P>
16. Clause 73(3) The Secretary of State's power to support asylum seekers ends when their claims are "determined". This sub-section seeks to define when that is, and to allow a period of notice (eg for vacating accommodation provided under Part VI), beyond the date of disposal of the claim or appeal.
<P>
17. This is badly drafted. It gives the Secretary of State no power to continue support in successful cases while a recognised refugee's mainstream benefit claim is processed, or in unsuccessful cases while the Secretary of State himself is considering Special Adjudicator's recommendations or post-appeal representations, or pending judicial review.
<P>
18. We will need to see the Regulations to judge how they are actually likely to impact both on successful and unsuccessful applicants. In any event, some basic safeguards should be built into the primary legislation, not left to the vagaries of future regulations.
<P>
19. See also our comments in the introduction above about the exclusion of those seeking judicial review.
<P>
20. Amendments
<P>
(1) replace (a) with:
<P>
"on the next working day after the Secretary of State notifies the claimant of his favourable decision on the claim, or"
<P>
(2) new sub-clause (b):
<P>
"if the claimant has been notified of an unfavourable decision on his claim, on the next working day after the expiry of the prescribed period for giving notice of appeal unless within that period the claimant does give notice of appeal, or"
<P>
(3) old sub-clause (b) becomes sub-clause (c), but insert "next working day after" before "the day" in line 11.
<P>
(4) add at end of line 12:
<P>
", save that such period shall be extended whenever it is necessary or reasonable to do so to avoid hardship to the claimant
<P>
(5) insert new sub-clause:
<P>
"The period referred to in section 3 above shall in any event be deemed to be extended
<P>
-- in the event that the claimant indicates an intention to apply to bring judicial review proceedings in respect of his asylum claim or any other aspect of his immigration status, for a period reasonably long enough to enable him to do so, and
<P>
-- for so long as any such proceedings, and any further appeal arising from them, remain pending, and
<P>
-- whether or not judicial review proceedings are proposed or taken, for so long as the Secretary of State has under consideration further representations in respect of the claimant's immigration status
<P>
21. Clause 73(4) Defines when an appeal is disposed of. We understand that "Part III is a clerical error and that "Part IV" is intended. Even so, it seems that this would not cover appeals beyond the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.
<P>
22. If that defect were corrected, and if confirmation is given that the effect of the definition is that the notice period in sub-clause (3) could not be triggered until the claimant bad notice of the determination and the notice period for any possible further appeal by either party had expired, then it would be acceptable.
<P>
23. Amendment
<P>
Drafting amendment to include appeals to the Court of Appeal, Court of Sessions and House of Lords, whether brought by the asylum seeker or the Secretary of State.
<P>
24. Clause 73(5) This intends to ensure that households of asylum seekers with dependent children continue to be supported at the end of the process by extending the definition of "asylum-seeker" in such cases until departure from the UK.
<P>
25. This would protect only the sons and daughters of asylum seekers their spouses, not any other child of the family or household, unless our suggested amendments to 73(1) in respect of the definitions of "child of" and "household" are accepted (see above).
<P>
26. The wording fails to allow for the fact that some asylum claims will succeed. As it stands would prevent such families from ever leaving the asylum support system for mainstream benefits.
<P>
27. Amendment
<P>
Add to line 18 ", unless he and the child are granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in which case the provision in section 73(3)(a) applies"
<P>
Clause 74
<P>
28. This is the very foundation of the scheme. The section confers powers, but no duty, on the Secretary of State to support asylum seekers, and defines the broad ambit of those powers.
<P>
29. Clause 74(1) Allows, but does not oblige the Secretary of State to support apparently destitute asylum seekers and their dependants.
<P>
30. It is shocking that no duty is imposed. Is Parliament really willing to permit a future Secretary of State to withhold support? And if it is unthinkable that a Secretary of State ever would, then what possible argument can there be against making it a duty?
<P>
31. Ordinary humanitarian considerations aside, we stress that among asylum seekers there are inevitably at least some who will in due course be recognised as refugees to whom the UK owes international duties (not favours) under the 1951 Convention.
<P>
32. Also worrying, both here and in the numerous other places that it occurs in Part VI, is the subjectivity of the "who appear to the Secretary of State to be . . ." proviso. This needs to be replaced with objective tests throughout.
<P>
33. Another recurrent theme is the tucking of potential time bombs behind the scenes, into regulations whose contents are not disclosed to us. Here it is the period within which an asylum seeker must be "likely to become destitute" before he can be supported that is "to be prescribed". So if the asylum seeker is in a pretty bad way, but the Secretary of State reckons he won't actually hit destitution level until tomorrow week, and if the prescribed period is 7 days, then the Secretary of State is prevented from providing any support today.
<P>
34. Amendments
<P>
(1) line 27 delete "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
(2) line 29 delete "or" and insert "and/or"
<P>
(3) line 31 delete "appear to the Secretary of State to be" and insert "are"
<P>
(4) line 32 delete "within such period as may be prescribed"
<P>
35. Clause 74(2) Enables regulations to be made to exclude some asylum seekers and their dependants from the support scheme, even though they are destitute.
<P>
36. This is dangerous, and the example given in the Explanatory Notes of someone who had previously caused serious damage to property is not reassuring. Why should deliberate exposure to destitution be inflicted rather than the normal sanctions of the law? What safeguards would the regulations give the accused asylum seeker? To what standard would the allegation against him have to be proved? Would he have rights of appeal? The right to be supported while the appeal is pursued?
<P>
37. And what would prevent a Secretary of State from making regulations to exclude certain classes of asylum seeker? Those who made their claims "late" or were deemed to be "without foundation" or come from a particular country?
<P>
38. Child Poverty Action Group has commented on this sub-clause:
<P>
"We do not want to see people excluded from support. This can happen under certain provisions of social security law and always creates problems, hardship and anomalies."
<P>
39. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete sub-clause 74(2)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) add after "excluded" in line 34:
<P>
"save that the prescribed circumstances may not be connected to the timing, place, manner or substance or any other aspect of the asylum claim"
<P>
40. Clause 74(3) Defines destitution as the lack of either adequate accommodation or the means to meet essential living needs or both.
<P>
41. This is welcome to the extent that the definitions such as they are are couched in objective terms, and allow some flexibility in provision, but minimum standards need to be set here in the primary legislation. Also the, proviso "or any means of obtaining it" is a worrying licence to pressure people into scraping around for support from elsewhere -- see further comment under 78(3).
<P>
42. Amendments
<P>
(1) in 74(3)(a) insert "and suitable" before "accommodation" delete "or any means of obtaining it"
<P>
(3) add to 74(3)(b)
<P>
"For this purpose 'essential living needs' means the costs of day to day living, including but not limited to food, household fuel, the purchase, cleaning, repair and replacement of clothing and footwear, weekly laundry costs, miscellaneous household and personal expenses such as toilet and pharmaceutical items [that are not available to him without charge on prescription], cleaning materials, window-cleaning, the replacement of small household goods (for example, crockery, cutlery, cooking utensils, light bulbs, etcetera) and such other needs as are essential to the individual asylum seeker given his particular circumstances and those of his dependents."
<P>
Note: If being in receipt of s.74 support is going to be a "passport" to free NHS prescriptions then the words within square brackets are useful. If not, they may be omitted. In any event the point about free prescriptions (and other benefits to which income support is a "passport", such as free school meals) needs to be clarified.
<P>
43. 74(4) Treats the asylum seeker and his dependents as a unit for destitution test purposes.
<P>
44. Clause 74(4) Deals with matters to which the Secretary of State must have regard in determining the adequacy of an applicant's existing accommodation.
<P>
45. The matters to be considered are concealed in regulations whose contents are unknown. This is unsatisfactory. Minimum standards at least should be guaranteed by the primary legislation.
<P>
46. Amendments
<P>
(1) In 74(5)(a) after "must have regard to" insert
<P>
"(i) the special needs of the person concerned and/or his dependents, if any, and
(ii) the welfare of the person concerned and/or his dependents, if any, and
(iii) the protection of any children of the person concerned or otherwise in the accommodation or its near vicinity, and
(iv) public health, and
(v) other [such matters ...."]
<P>
(2) delete "but" from the end of 74(5)(a) and delete the whole of 74(5)(b)
<P>
47. Clause 74(6) Dictates what the Secretary of State may not have regard to in determining whether a person's accommodation is adequate.
<P>
48. These prohibitions are unmitigated by any allowance for the particular circumstances of a case. So the Secretary of State is apparently forbidden even to consider the appropriateness of a vulnerable young person sharing accommodation with older adults, or with those of the opposite sex. And he is not allowed in any circumstances to consider whether location contributes to the adequacy of accommodation. A top floor flat for a wheelchair user? Remote accommodation with no street lighting or bus service for a single parent with young children? 300 miles away from your brother, or from the only other person you know in this country? These things will just be the luck of the draw. The Secretary of State would be breaking the law if he allowed them to even to feature in his consideration.
<P>
49. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete 74(6)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) amend 74(6)(b)
--to incorporate a prohibition on overcrowding
<P>
(4) to specify that the Secretary of State must have regard to the suitability of those with whom the individual asylum seeker is expected to share, and that factors to be taken into account in relation to this include age, gender, ethnic, political and religious background and health.
<P>
(4) In 74(6)(d) add "save that the suitability of the location in relation to the safety, welfare, dignity, right to family and private life and any special needs of the asylum seeker and his dependents must be taken into account".
<P>
(4) add at end of 74(6) "provided in all cases that it is reasonable and suitable for the person and his dependents to continue to occupy the premises" (wording from Housing Act 1996).
<P>
50. Clause 74(7) Deals with the Secretary of State's determination of whether or not a persons's essential living needs are met.
<P>
51. This is remarkable for being a clause totally devoid of substantive content. What the Secretary of State must and may not have regard to are both to be specified in regulations whose contents are undisclosed. This is a blank cheque indeed, giving no framework or objective criteria for the exercise of the Secretary of State's power.
<P>
52. Amendment
<P>
(1) delete 74(7) and replace with
<P>
"In determining the extent to which a person's essential living needs are met the Secretary of State shall take account of the person's income and capital as if he were calculating entitlement to income support under section 136 SSCBA 1992.
<P>
53. Clause 74(8) Allows the Secretary of State to specify certain items or expenses as being, or not being, part of essential living needs. Yet again the substance is to be tucked away in secondary legislation.
<P>
54. Amendment
<P>
In line 19 delete ",or are not,".
<P>
55. Clause 74(9) Allows support to be provided subject to conditions. This is hopelessly wide. What conditions? Decided by who? On what criteria? With what sanctions?
<P>
56. The scheme allows support to be provided by persons other than the Secretary of State, including persons who are not politically accountable. Are such persons to be empowered to determine the 74(9) conditions subject to which an asylum seeker may be supported?
<P>
57. Amendments
<P>
(1) add "but the conditions may not be related in any way to the claimant's asylum application, or to his choice of legal representative or the exercise of his rights of appeal or access to the High Court"
<P>
AND
<P>
(2) add "save that no conditions may be imposed, either generally or in any particular case, without the express authority of the Secretary of State"
<P>
58. Clause 74(10) Provides that the conditions must be set out in writing. The clause is silent as to the form this writing is to take or who is to do the setting out or in what language.
<P>
59. Amendment
<P>
To rectify the above.
<P>
60. Clause 74(11) Provides that a copy of the conditions must be given to the supported person. Again there is silence as to language.
<P>
61. Amendment
<P>
Add "written in a language which he understands".
<P>
Clause 75
<P>
62. Clause covers the ways and means by which support may be provided.
<P>
63. 75(l) Specifies that support may be provided by way of accommodation, essential living needs, or expenses (other than legal and other prescribed expenses) connected to the asylum claim and any associated appeal.
<P>
64. Again powers without duties are conferred.
<P>
65. The definitions are all purely subjective to the Secretary of State. They need to be replaced with objective reliance on the plain meaning of the words, perhaps with assistance from the definitions of similar concepts in homelessness and benefits legislation.
<P>
66. There is no provision for asylum seekers to be accommodated with or near their de facto dependents other than those within the narrow clause 3 definition. Combined with existing clause 76(2) (which obliges the Secretary of State to disregard any preferences such asylum seekers may have to be accommodated together) this is a violation of ECHR Article 8 which must have been overlooked by the Secretary of State when he made his statement of compliance in respect of the Bill.
<P>
67. Amendments
<P>
(1) in line 25 delete "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
(2) in 75(l)(a) delete "appearing to the Secretary of State to be"
<P>
(3) in 75(1)(a) add "and suitable" before "accommodation"
<P>
(4) add at the end of 75(1)(a) "having regard to all relevant matters including, but not limited to, the health, safety, welfare and any special needs of the claimant and his dependents, if any, and the suitability of its location for the long term resettlement of the claimant and his dependents, if any, in the event of a favourable outcome to the asylum claim."
<P>
(5) add "and/or" at the end of 75(l)(a)
<P>
(6) in 75(1)(b) delete "what appear to the Secretary of State to be" and insert "all the"
<P>
(7) delete "or" and insert "and/or" at the end of 75(1)(b)
<P>
(8) in 75(l)(c) delete "what appear to the Secretary of State to be"
<P>
(9) delete the brackets and their contents in 75(1)(c)
<P>
(10) drafting is needed to cover the Article 8 point--here and/or in clause 76
<P>
68. 75(2) Allows for flexibility in the ways in which support is provided in exceptional circumstances.
<P>
69. The meaning of "exceptional" here looks rife for litigation. This provision seems to be poor relation to a Community Care assessment in the mainstream benefits system. It is not clear whether "other ways" means "different ways" or "additional ways" ie whether you just get the same value delivered in a different package, or if you get more. Provision for both is needed. For example, support in "other ways" might be include providing direct labour to modify accommodation for the use of a disabled claimant, or it might need to include provision for more expensive food for someone on a special diet.
<P>
70. Amendments
<P>
(1) in line 35 delete "the Secretary of State considers that"
<P>
(2) in line 36 delete "he may" and insert "the Secretary of State shall"
<P>
(3) in line 37 after "ways" add "which may be additional to the support provided under section 75(l),"
<P>
(4) in line 37 delete "he considers" and insert "are"
<P>
(5) in line 38 after "to be" add "suitably"
<P>
71. 75(3) Provides that support will not be wholly or mainly by cash payments except in exceptional circumstances in particular cases.
<P>
72. The excepti onal circumstances are not defined, so we may predict litigation an this clause too. Presumably fire, flood or mayhem necessitating sudden relocation would be covered, but nothing is specified.
<P>
73. There would be no need to contemplate what constitutes an "exceptional" circumstance if the underlying insistence on non-cash support were omitted. Benefits in kind are more expensive to provide and administer. and as to their supposed magnetic effect on asylum seekers, please refer to our introductory comments above.
<P>
74. Child Poverty Action Group has commented as follows on the proposed established of a system based on payments in kind:
<P>
 byIt is not a modern system, but harks back to the principles of the workhouse.
<P>
It creates an apartheid system for the delivery of material support with asylum seekers being treated differently and thus made identifiable.
<P>
Creating an identifiable group will encourage anti-immigrant and anti asylum seeker feelings as existed in Germany.
<P>
It will be an inefficient and expensive system to operate by the govemment's own admission.
<P>
It could only conceivably be justifiable if the government were able to deliver on the six months processing of claims and appeals deadline which Jack Straw has admitted will not be achievable in the near future.
<P>
75. Amendment Delete 75(3)
<P>
76. 75(4) Allows for regulations to exempt whole categories of case from the prohibition against providing support wholly or mainly by cash payments.
<P>
77. Again this is simply unnecessary if the non-cash basis of the scheme is removed.
<P>
78. Amendment Delete 75(4) consequentially on deleting 75(3)
<P>
79. 75(5) Takes the power of secondary legislation so far as to allow the Secretary of State actually to repeal 75(3) by regulation. What doubts does the government have about the feasibility of its cashless scheme that it feels the need of such a get out clause?
<P>
80. Amendment Delete 75(5) consequentially on deleting 75(3)
<P>
81. 75(6) Specifies that "specified" in sub-clause 4 means specified in an order under sub-clause 4. ILPA makes no specific comment
Clause 76
<P>
82. This covers supplemental matters to which the Secretary of State must and may not have regard to when exercising his clause 74 powers.
<P>
83. 76(1) Requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the temporary nature of the accommodation, to the desirability of providing it in areas where there is a ready supply, and to whatever else may be prescribed but is not here divulged.
<P>
84. Again much too much is left to regulations. Safeguards and minimum standards are required in the primary legislation.
<P>
85. Amendments
<P>
(1) drafting addition needed to 76(1)c) to specify some minimum positive standards -- possibly along the lines of our suggested amendment (4) under clause 75(l) above
AND
<P>
(2) reorganize so that existing 76(2)(a) becomes new 76(l)(c), and 76(l)(c) becomes new 76(l)(d)
<P>
86. 76(2) Forbids the Secretary of State to have regard to the preferences of the asylum seeker or his dependents as to locality.
<P>
87. The breaches of ECHR Article 8 which this will cause will be all the more grave because of the vulnerability of the persons upon whom they will be inflicted.
<P>
88. Amendments
<P>
(1) Delete 76(2)(a)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) make provisos as in our suggested amendments (2) and (3) to clause 74(6) above
<P>
OR
<P>
(3) reorganize as in suggested amendment (2) under 76(l), above
<P>
89. 76(3) Allows the Secretary of State to amend (1) and (2) any which way he chooses. No comment except yet again on the breadth of powers which Parliament is being asked to delegate.
<P>
90. 76(4) Covers matters to be taken into account in respect of essential living needs.
<P>
91. This is another clause entirely devoid of specific content. Again Parliament is being asked to sign a blank cheque to allow this and any future government to make whatever regulations it sees fit.
<P>
92. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete 76(4)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) drafting may be needed to set minimum standards by reference to, for example, the definition of essential living needs in our suggested amendment (3) under 74(3) above
<P>
93. 76(5) Empowers the Secretary of State to cap the total expenditure in respect of essential needs for an individual
<P>
94. This is crucially dangerous. It means that a person who had his exceptional needs met under clause 75(2) could find his basic package of provision correspondingly reduced so as to stay within the cap. So some essential living needs would not be met, which is contrary to the stated purpose of this part of the bill.
<P>
95. Child Poverty Action Group has pointed out that where there were dependent children this would also contravene the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
96. Furthermore a cap on individual expenditure would penalise claimants for ineffective purchase cost controls on the part of the Secretary of State and his suppliers.
<P>
97. If the proposed scheme is to be enacted at all this subclause must be deleted or fundamentally amended.
<P>
98. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete sub-clause 76(5)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) amend so that expenditure under 75(l)(c) (costs related to appeals) and 75(2) (exceptional provision) is excluded from the cap
<P>
OR
<P>
(3) specify that the limit may not be less than 90 per cent. of what would be the claimant's income support applicable amount plus 100 per cent. of any relevant premiums
<P>
(4) Note:--there is no way to deal with the inefficient cost control point except by deleting this capping, provision altogether and/or by returning to a cash benefit system.
<P>
99. 76(6) Provides that expenses met in connection with a supported person's asylum appeal are to be treated as essential living needs for the purposes of the expenditure cap under 75(5).
<P>
100. This is pernicious, and would mean, for example, that the claimant called for interview who was housed far from his port of arrival, or whose appeal was heard at a distant location or was subject to adjournments, could find expenditure on his food or other daily needs reduced by the amount of his fares.
<P>
101. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete 76(6) whether or not 75(5) survives
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) if 75(5) survives add "not" after "section 75(l)(c) is" in line 41
<P>
102. 76(7) Gives the Secretary of State power to disregard claimants preferences as to the way in which support is to be given.
<P>
103. This is a welcome contrast to his obligation to disregard preference as to location of accommodation, but, this is not saying much because, as usual, the power is uncircumscribed.
<P>
104. Amendment Delete 76(7).
<P>
Clause 77
<P>
105. This provides that an asylum seeker ceases to be a person for whom support may be given either upon leaving his provided accommodation or, where essential living needs only have been provided, upon leaving his notified address.
<P>
106. Thus does the support system become a direct tool of internal immigration control. Not only is this a sanction on breach of temporary admission conditions, but also an asylum seeker may be penalised for simple error or delay in notification (or in the Secretary of State recording a notification?) of a change of address.
<P>
107. There is a safety net in 76(6) which allows for the provision to be disapplied in certain circumstances by regulation, but yet again we do not know what the regulations will say.
<P>
108. Basic safeguards need to be built into the primary legislation.
<P>
109. Amendments
<P>
(1) safeguards to be drafted to protect those leaving their accommodation to escape violence or harassment or for some other compelling reason
<P>
(2) add to 77(2) "and, where leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom has been granted, becomes entitled to a lump sum resettlement grant"
<P>
Note: this idea needs developing and may require further enabling clauses eg in s74 itself
<P>
(3) add to 77(4) "but he is entitled to reapply at any time"
<P>
(4) drafting needed to provide for authority to be given in appropriate circumstances for transfers of address without interruption to the provision of support
<P>
Clause 78
<P>
110. This empowers the Secretary of State to make whatever other regulations he pleases with respect to his s74 powers. Sub-clauses indicate particular circumstances which regulations might cover, but nothing is excluded so the power is essentially untrammelled.
<P>
111. This is a blank cheque indeed. The breadth of the power is dangerous in itself, and its application potentially pernicious, for example:
<P>
78(2)(a) Provides for "prescribed levels" and a "prescribed kind" of support without giving any clue as to what these might be, while 78(2)(b) permits the Secretary of State to deviate from these standards in unspecified circumstances and, presumably, in either direction.
<P>
112. Amendment Minimum standards to be incorporated into the primary legislation.
<P>
113. 78(3) Contemplates regulations requiring the Secretary of State to take into account support or assets that "might reasonably be expected to be otherwise available" to the claimant.
<P>
Both limbs of this are objectionable:--
<P>
78(3)(i) The concept of support that "might reasonably be expected to be otherwise available" will place pressure on claimants' relatives, friends and communities (other, apparently, than the wider community of which the Secretary of State himself is part) to support them.
<P>
It also raises the spectre of denying support to someone because he "might reasonably be expected" to receive it from such sources but in fact is not, and is destitute.
<P>
It risks churches and other charitable organizations becoming barriers to statutory support because claimants "might reasonably be expected" to turn to them--or of such charities being inhibited in their work for fear of this effect.
<P>
It is contrary to the 1951 Convention for the government to seek to absolve itself of responsibility for those whom it will subsequently recognize to be refugees by devolving its international obligations on to private individuals such as friends and relatives in the UK.
<P>
It conflicts with the Human Rights Act, being contrary to the ECHR Article 14 anti-discrimination provision because the pressure to provide community support will inevitably fall disproportionately heavily on ethnic minority communities.
<P>
78(3)(ii) The concept of assets that "might reasonably be expected to be otherwise available" raises the spectre of demanding that personal possessions (which may be a vulnerable asylum seeker's last tangible memento of a lost way of life) be sold and the proceeds exhausted before an asylum seeker could qualify for support.
<P>
It breaches Article 1 of the 1st Protocol to the ECHR which protects the right to the peaceful enjoyment of possessions.
<P>
114. Amendments to 78(3)
<P>
(1) delete 78(3)
<P>
(2) in line 41 delete "or might reasonably be expected to be"
<P>
(3) provide specific safeguards so that people are not pressurised to seek support from strangers or from people whom they have cause to fear or to be embarrassed to approach (eg abusive or estranged family members)
<P>
(4) specify assets that may not be taken into account--eg exclude "wedding, engagement or eternity rings or any equipment or tools you use for work" as the MEANS 1 assessment form for civil legal aid does--but this may need to be expanded to make it of more multicultural applicability, or to include a general "sentimental value" proviso
<P>
 115. 78(4) Provides for procedural regulations in relation to applications for support.
<P>
 116. This subclause is devoid of any safeguards whatsoever for applicants.
<P>
117. Amendments
<P>
Provision is needed for
<P>
(1) the procedure, including review and appeal rights, to be explained or otherwise made available to him in a language the claimant understands
<P>
(2) the information provided by the applicant to be held in confidence and not disclosed to those who will determine the asylum claim except at the request of the claimant
<P>
(3) ensuring that nothing to do with the asylum claim, choice of representative or exercise of appeal or other legal rights could constitute a reason not to entertain an application for support
<P>
(4) prescribing the ambit of the enquiries to be made by the Secretary of State and ensuring that they do not include the claimant's national authorities or otherwise breach confidentiality
<P>
(5) safeguards in relation to notification of changes of circumstance in view of the potential criminal consequences of error--refer to 87(1) below
<P>
Clause 79
<P>
118. This provides for the temporary provision of support in emergency circumstances prior to full assessment under the Secretary of State clause 74 powers.
<P>
119. The stated aim is unobjectionable, but once again why is no duty imposed and why is the test of destitution rendered wholly subjective to the Secretary of State? And why on earth, if the rationale of the provision is designed to meet emergencies, hedge it about with all the clause 74 provisos on the exercise of the power?
<P>
 120. There is also a potential problem that one of the unresolved issues could be whether or not a claimant is indeed "an asylum seeker" under the 73(1) definition--for example a claim may not yet be recorded or the Secretary of State may not yet have decided whether a 2nd application amounts to a fresh claim.
<P>
121. Amendments
<P>
 (1) line 7 delete "may"--insert "shall"
<P>
(2) line 9 insert "persons who are or may be"
<P>
(3) line 10 insert "persons who are or may be"
<P>
(4) line 11 delete "it appears to the Secretary of State may be" and insert "flare or may be"
<P>
(5) delete sub-section (3)
<P>
Clause 80
<P>
 122. This allows local authorities to provide support in accordance with arrangements made by the Secretary of State under s.74 in the ways "mentioned" in 75(1) and (2).
<P>
123. The Secretary of State's powers are not delegated. This is an enabling clause via "arrangements" to be made by him.
<P>
124. The methods open to the local authorities are limited to 75(1) and (2). Clarification is needed as to whether they are also empowered to make exceptional payments under 75(3) as these are themselves expressed to be payable under 75(1) and (2).
<P>
 125. 80(2)(b) contemplates such arrangements being made with a "person" other than the local authority. The chain of responsibility and control seems thin.
<P>
126. Amendment Introduce checks on who "another person" might be?
<P>
 Clause 81
<P>
127. This enables the Secretary of State to force local authorities and certain types of housing association (registered social landlords) to co-operate in providing accommodation.
<P>
128. There is a safeguard in 81(3) against a housing association being required to act beyond its powers, but nevertheless this represents an unwarranted interference in the affairs of the voluntary sector by giving the Secretary of State non-reciprocal coercive powers against them.
<P>
129. It appears to conflict with the ECHR protection of the right to enjoyment of private property.
<P>
 130. Clause 82
<P>
131. Provides for the designation of "reception zones".
<P>
132. This enables the policy of enforced dispersal of asylum seekers to be implemented.
<P>
 133. In 82(2) we encounter Part VI's one and only consultation process. It is striking, however, that no procedure is actually specified and there is no suggestion that the Secretary of State need act on the results of the consultation.
<P>
 134. There is an odd "or" in 82(3) which suggests that the Secretary of State could commandeer accommodation even if it were only temporarily unoccupied.
<P>
 135. There is a dangerous lack of attention to the provision of legal services to asylum seekers in the reception zones.
<P>
 136. Amendment add to 82(2)
<P>
He must in any event consult the Legal Aid Board, the Law Centres Federation and the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux and no area may be designated unless the Legal Aid Board is satisfied that adequate provision for competent legal advice and assistance is available to any asylum seekers and their dependants who may be accommodated in the area under section 74.
<P>
Under clause may be accommodated in the area under Section 102--under proposed amendments insert:
<P>
lines 21-22 delete "and the persons occupying them"
<P>
Under Proposed New Clause insert the following after the note on our proposed 73A. It could be 73B or 73A (ii):--
<P>
when any question arises with respect to a child, or with respect to any household which includes a child, the child's welfare shall be the Secretary of State's paramount consideration in the exercise of his powers under this part of the Act.
<P>
 Note
<P>
This derives from the wording of s1(1) of The Children Act 1989. It requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the standards of the general law in respect to children.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B> Clause 83 and Schedule 8</B><P>
<P>
137. This clause provides for appeals to Asylum Support Adjudicators. Some (but not much) further provision about these Adjudicators is in Schedule 8.
<P>
 138. Schedule 8 is really only half a schedule. It deals only with adjudicators and makes no provision for funding for premises, interpreters or administrative support or for the conduct of appeals.
<P>
139. Who are the Asylum Support Adjudicators to be? They should certainly not be asylum Special Adjudicators, but preferably should have a background in welfare and housing provision.
<P>
 140. Who will appoint and supervise them? It certainly ought not to be the Secretary of State who will be one of the parties to the appeals that the Adjudicators are to hear.
<P>
 141. Amendments
<P>
(1) amend para 55 of Schedule 12 to make Asylum Support Adjudicators subject to the supervision of the Council on Tribunals
<P>
(2) provide for their appointment and supervision by the Lord Chancellor's department
<P>
(3) amend Schedule 8 to give the necessary funding powers and to require the provision of basic facilities such as interpreting
<P>
(4) amend Schedule 8 to limit the length of appointment of Asylum Support Adjudicators to, say, 5 years
 <P>
Clause 84
<P>
142. Specifies when the right of appeal to an asylum support adjudicator arises.
<P>
 143. As things stand the unsuccessful applicant will remain without support while appealing, while the partially successful will have no appeal remedy in respect of the amount or type of support offered. This means that the only remedy in such cases will be by way of judicial review.
<P>
 144. Amendments
<P>
(1) to provide for appeals against the level or type of support offered
<P>
(2) for provision of emergency support pending appeal against refusal
<P>
(3) for appeals against termination of support to have suspensive effect
<P>
(4) to require the Adjudicator to substitute his own decision in all cases OR to specify the circumstances in which referrals back might be made
<P>
(5) in the event of a referral back to provide that support is to continue while the Secretary of State deliberates
<P>
(6) in the event of a referral back to guarantee a further appeal (with suspensive effect) against a further adverse decision
<P>
Clause 85 and Schedule 8
<P>
145. Empowers the Secretary of State to make procedure and other rules regulating the conduct of appeals.
<P>
146. It is wholly unacceptable for the appeal system to be regulated by one of the parties to it. It is also unacceptable for fundamental matters affecting the just conduct of appeals, including the burden of proof, to be relegated to secondary legislation.
<P>
147. Amendments
<P>
Note: some, but not all, of the following might more appropriately be included in an expanded Schedule 8
<P>
(1) to provide that the rules are to be made by the Lord Chancellor's Department
<P>
(2) to guarantee the right to legal representation at appeal hearings
<P>
(3) to provide legal aid for advice, assistance and representation in relation to asylum support appeals
<P>
(4) to guarantee the right to a hearing, or at least to place the onus on the Adjudicator to justify disposal in any other way without the Appellant's consent
<P>
(5) to provide official interpreters at hearings
<P>
(6) to specify in the primary legislation that the burden of proof is on the Secretary of State in appeals against refusal or cessation of benefit, and on the Appellant in appeals against level or type of support
<P>
(7) to give Adjudicators power to summons witnesses
<P>
(8) to give Adjudicators power to award travel expenses to Appellants and witnesses (otherwise, for example, a witness might not be able to afford to come to court to explain why the Appellant cannot reasonably be expected to turn to him for support)
<P>
(9) generally this section should be amended as relevant along the lines of Schedule 4 paras 3 and 4 which deal with the Lord Chancellor's rules of procedure in relation to asylum appeals, with additions as indicated above.
<P>
(10) in relation to 85(3) (or its equivalent in any amended clause), to provide that regard be had to the interests of justice, not just to speed and practicality, in making the rules
<P>
Criminal Offences--clauses 86-90
<P>
 Clause 86
<P>
148. This creates an offence of making false representations with a view to obtaining support for oneself or another under Part VI.
<P>
149. This is extraordinarily draconian. Failure to notify a change in circumstances "without reasonable excuse" becomes a criminal offence, even if not done "knowingly", and as it stands the change of circumstances need not even be material in any way. And for such heinous crimes one could go to prison!
<P>
150. Apart from terrorising asylum seekers (and their advisors or anyone else on whom a duty to report changes in an asylum seeker's circumstances might be imposed by 78(4)(e)) it is difficult to see what this achieves that is not already covered by the ordinary criminal law on fraud and attempt.
<P>
151. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete clause 86
<P>
(2) add "knowingly" before "fails" in 86(1)(c)
<P>
(3) add "material" before "change of circumstances" in 86(1)(c) and (d)
<P>
(4) in 86(2) delete "imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to"
Clause 87
<P>
152. This creates an offence of making dishonest representations with a view to obtaining any benefit or "advantage" for oneself or another under Part VI.
<P>
153. Again it is not clear why this is required in addition to the general law on fraud, but the conduct it is aimed it is undeniably objectionable, being by definition dishonest.
<P>
154. Amendment Add "material" before "change of circumstances" in 87(1)(c)--see comment on equivalent provision in 86.
<P>
Clause 88
<P>
155. Creates offences of obstructing functionaries in the course of their duty and of failure to give information under Part VI.
<P>
156. This appears to be a charter for officialdom to pry without any safeguards for anyone else.
<P>
157. Those who could fall foul of this provision are not restricted to claimants but could apparently include, for example, anyone or any organization whom the official on behalf of the Secretary of State took it into his head to suppose might be able to support the claimant. It could perhaps even include legal advisors as there is no express saving provision as to professional privilege.
<P>
158. Why should anyone have a greater duty to supply information to Part VI functionaries than to the police? And why should enquiries under Part VI not generate the protection of at a least a modified right of silence?
<P>
159.  Amendments
<P>
(1) Delete 88(b)
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) in 88(b) delete "neglects"--the onus should at least be on the official to seek the information, not on the rest of us to volunteer it or figure out what it is that maybe we should be volunteering
<P>
(3) add "knowingly" before "refuses", and "material" before "question", before "information" and before "document"
<P>
Clause 89
<P>
160. This creates an imprisonable criminal offence of failing to maintain in accordance with an undertaking to be responsible for maintenance and accommodation.
<P>
161. No account is taken of the possible reasons for the "refusal or neglect" to maintain, eg that the claimant may have been abusive to the person who gave the undertaking. This is inconsistent with recent Home Office recognition of the problems of domestic workers and spouses who suffer abuse.
<P>
162. The provision would appear to be otiose in any event because the Secretary of State can either refuse to support the claimant if it is really still reasonable to expect him to look to his sponsor, or if not can enforce the undertaking and seek to recover the cost from the sponsor through the courts in the usual way.
<P>
163. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete clause 89
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) provide safeguards for the protection of sponsors
<P>
Clause 90
<P>
164. Provides for bodies corporate and their officers to be guilty of the criminal offences in clauses 86-89.
<P>
165. This could place support scheme Assistants working for voluntary organizations at risk from the more draconian of the clause 86-89 measures unless amendments such as are outlined above are passed.
<P>
Financial provisions--clauses 91-94
<P>
Clause 91
<P>
166. This covers payments to local authorities in respect of expenditure incurred under the support scheme.
<P>
167. A fair scheme would allow local authorities not only reimbursement of the direct costs of support under Part VI, but also top up funds for their basic health and education budgets to take account of the special needs of refugees and asylum seekers. Clause 91 does not preclude this, but amendment is needed to oblige the Secretary of State to do it.
<P>
168. Specific provision for grants for asylum seeking and refugee children in schools would be welcome.
<P>
169. Under Part VI asylum seekers'children will not be eligible for free school meals because their parents will not have access to the "passport" benefits, JSA and income support.
<P>
Clause 92
<P>
170. Enables the Secretary of State to make grants to voluntary organisations not only in respect of support ("of whatever nature") to asylum seekers but also "connected matters".
<P>
171. Are refugee resettlement programmes "connected matters"? What about accountability?
<P>
Clause 93
<P>
172. Provides for the recovery of expenditure made as a result of misrepresentation or non-disclosure, whether or not fraudulent.
<P>
173. This echoes Social Security recovery legislation, but the echo is inappropriate because here we are dealing not with a system regulated by clear rules but with a wholly discretionary scheme.
<P>
174. The government needs to clarify whether it intends merely a recovery clause regardless of the reason for the expenditure, or whether it is intended, as we submit it should be, to be linked to misconduct.
<P>
175. As it stands there is a danger that recovery proceedings could be taken against an applicant, or someone else assisting him with his application, for expenditure incurred as a result of failing to disclose something that the person was unaware of, eg that there was a church charity that might have offered accommodation.
<P>
176. The clause is open to absurdly and perniciously wide interpretation. If an asylum seeker receives a food parcel, or his child is given a meal at a friend's house, must he disclose this as materially affecting the level of support he needs on pain of recovery of the "excess"? And does the donor of the parcel or the meal also have a duty of disclosure?
<P>
177. Amendment Either delete entirely, or amend to allow recovery only where misconduct has caused the expenditure.
<P>
Clause 94
<P>
178. Enables the Secretary of State to pursue sponsors in the Magistrates Courts for recovery of money in respect of s74 asylum support provided to persons for whom a maintenance undertaking was in effect.
<P>
179. The need for this is unclear. What evil is it intended to meet that is not met by the existing law? Who could and could not be caught by it?
<P>
Exclusion from benefits and services --clauses 95-99
<P>
Clause 95
<P>
180. This clause redefines persons "subject to immigration control". It excludes all of them (not just asylum seekers) from jobseekers allowance and all other mainstream social security benefits. It then provides for some (but not all) of those who are not asylum seekers to be readmitted to benefit eligibility. Those excluded include lawful permanent residents in the UK and other tax payers.
<P>
181. The whole concept behind this clause is objectionable. ILPA believes access to subsistence, disability and child benefits should depend upon need, not immigration status. Clause 95 allows the Secretary of state to abandon large groups of people to life well below the poverty line.
<P>
182. These include people whose stay has not been formalised, those who were admitted on the basis that they could maintain themselves, but whose circumstances have changed, any sponsored immigrant and those who are exercising an in-country right of appeal. As Clause 96 makes clear, unlike asylum seekers, such people will not be permitted to use the Secretary of State's scheme in the event of destitution.
<P>
183. Once again the Secretary of State has chosen not to allow Parliament to consider the terms of any exceptions, leaving these to delegated legislation.
<P>
184. If the clause is to survive at all, ILPA believes it is critical that an alternative to "person subject to immigration control" in subclause (4) be found. See further comment below.
<P>
185. 95(1) Lists the benefits excluded. They are all means tested and are the most basic safety net benefits, without which a financially eligible claimant would be at risk of destitution.
<P>
186. 95(2) Extends the provision to Northern Ireland.
<P>
187. 95(3) Allows for some unspecified category of person to be excluded from the exclusion. Who is this intended to cover? ILPA understands that the Benefits Agency has been informed that it is intended to use this provision to ensure that, in the short term at least, the status quo is maintained and that, for example, permanent residents who originally entered on a sponsorship undertaking could have access to income support after 5 years. If this is so the government should say so. In any event it is simply not good enough for something so fundamental to the welfare of residents of this country to be prey to the vagaries of secondary regulation in this way.
<P>
188. 95(4) Redefines "person subject to immigration control" in a dangerously confusing way. The expression does not accurately describe the class of persons to which it relates and will be easily confused, for example by Benefits Agency staff, with the identical phrase in earlier legislation still in force. There is a very real danger that 355 356 permanent residents who are subject to immigration control in law because they have never taken British Citizenship will be unlawfully excluded from benefit as a result of this confusion.
<P>
189. Amendments
<P>
(1) delete clause 95
<P>
OR
<P>
(2) in 95(1) delete all benefits relating to disability
<P>
(3) in 95(1) delete child benefit
<P>
(4) in 95(3) add "and in any event does not apply to anyone with indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom, or recognized refugees or those granted exceptional leave to remain in the United Kingdom"
<P>
(5) in 95(4) line 24 delete "A person subject to immigration control" and insert "A person without permission to stay or with permission to stay that is qualified"
<P>
Clause 96
<P>
190. Excludes destitute persons subject to immigration control (as defined in 95(4) from the provisions of the National Assistance Act, although it preserves the rights of those who require s.21 residential accommodation where their needs arise for reasons other than destitution (eg. pregnancy, age, illness, disability, or "other circumstances"
<P>
191. To a destitute person subject to immigration control has access to no relief whatsoever unless he applies for asylum in order to bring himself within the s74 asylum support scheme. Is this really the govemment's desired effect?
<P>
192. It is noteworthy and scandalous that there is no provision for exempting anyone subject to immigration control from this exclusion. In contrast to clauses 97-98 (below) there is no proviso that the exclusion does not apply to people within the clause 95(3) exemption. The effect is that destitute "persons subject to immigration control who are not asylum seekers are excluded from s2l accommodation and nothing is substituted in its place".
<P>
193. As it stands clause 96 leaves a vulnerable group without any state protection from homelessness, a scenario the courts have described as unacceptable in a civilised nation.
<P>
194. Another effect is that a failed asylum seeker at the end of the process who no longer qualifies for s74 support or accommodation will have access to no alternative statutory relief whatsoever, regardless of how long it may take the Secretary of State to effect his removal from the United Kingdom, whether because of difficulties in travel documentation or for any other reason. An indeterminately sized sub-class of vagrants with no incentive to respect or remain in contact with any authority whatsoever is in the making here.
<P>
195. Amendment Delete clause 96
<P>
Clause 97
<P>
196. This clause provides for the exclusion of persons subject to immigration control from various statutory provisions under the Health Services and Public Services Act 1996, the National Health Service Act 1977 and the Housing Act 1996.
<P>
197. The effect is to withdraw health and social services from people who need them through no fault of their own or of their sponsors. Access to these services is triggered by need resulting from aging, which is unavoidable, and from illness and mental disorder which may not have been anticipated at the time of entry to the United Kingdom, let alone planned for, The services are, for the most part, ones that can only be provided by the state so turning to relatives or community groups does not represent an alternative.
<P>
198. What is achieved is the most pernicious and distasteful form of social exclusion: the denial of help to the vulnerable, elderly and sick for no other reason than their national origins.
<P>
199. These provisions are in some respects even more exclusionary than Clause 96 which at least preserves the rights of those who require s.21 National Assistance Act 1948 residential accommodation where their needs arise for reasons other than destitution (eg pregnancy, age, illness, disability, or "other circumstances").
<P>
200. For asylum seekers who are destitute there is, for what it is worth, the Secretary of State's scheme, but under clause 97 other destitute "persons subject to immigration control" lose their right to residential accommodation and absolutely nothing is substituted in its place.
<P>
201. This becomes even more objectionable when the nature of what is taken away is fully understood. The Public Law Project has commented as follows on these provisions for excluding needy people from access to community care:--
<P>
202. 97(1) The Health Services and Public Health Act 1968: s45 gives the Secretary of State power to direct that certain services may and must be provided by local authorities to promote the welfare of elderly people. If Clause 97 is passed in its present form local authorities would be prevented from, for example, providing meals on wheels services to elderly people who entered under a sponsorship agreement. It would also prevent such people from receiving help from social workers if they are abused, neglected or ill.
<P>
203. The concept of a "person subject to immigration control" extends to those with an outstanding appeal. It follows that an elderly person, who applies to remain on grounds that they are unfit to travel and is refused, will be deprived of all of these services pending their appeal.
<P>
204. Confusion about the meaning, of "person subject to immigration control" will inevitably restrict access to services by the elderly Black and ethnic minority population who remain entitled. Their take up of these services is already considerably lower than that of the elderly population as a whole (see Caring for Ethnic Minority Elders, Age Concern 1998).
<P>
205. 97(2) The National Health Service Act 1977: para 2 Schedule 8 is focused solely on arrangements for the prevention of illness, assisting people who are ill and those who need aftercare. The current directions impose a duty to provide day centres for people suffering from mental disorders, and arrangements for training and paid work for such persons. Even more importantly, these directions provide the framework for social work services for the identification, assessment, diagnosis and social treatment of mental illness.
<P>
206. In relation to other illnesses, the directions empower local authorities to provide day centres, occupation and work at such centres, meals (including meals-on-wheels), advice and support from social services, night sitter services, and facilities for recuperative holidays, social and recreational activities. Specific provision may also be made for people with alcohol or drugs dependency problems.
<P>
207. Again, withdrawing these basic facilities will result in deprivation and social exclusion of vulnerable people. An overseas student who becomes clinically depressed or suicidal will lose the help he or she would have had from social services. A husband who is admitted under a sponsorship agreement and is taken seriously will not qualify for meals on wheels which might otherwise be provided if his wife is working.
<P>
208. 97(3) and 97(4) Housing Act 1996
<P>
209. These subclauses exclude "persons subject to immigration control" as defined in clause 95 from the duties of local authorities to homeless persons, and from access to local authority housing waiting lists.
<P>
210. But, as Shelter has pointed out to us, the Housing Act already excludes persons subject to immigration control as defined in the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996, subject to regulations designed to re-admit to eligibility certain classes of person (including refugees and people with exceptional leave to remain).
<P>
211. ILPA agrees with Shelter that these clauses are nonsensical unless there is a substantial difference between the 2 definitions of "subject to immigration control", in which case they are wilfully obscure and confusing.
<P>
212. What is the point of saying, as the inserted sub-clauses (2A) say, that the housing regulations cannot prescribe certain persons subject to immigration as being eligible when it is the very point of the regulations in question to do just that? The absurdity is illustrated by the need to insert sub-clauses 2(B) to undo at least part of the damage and restore some people to eligibility.
<P>
213. We reiterate our position that deprivation of fundamental rights is a matter that should be debated properly, not left to delegated legislation.
<P>
214. Amendment Delete clause 97.
<P>
Clause 98
<P>
215. Excludes those subject to immigration control from certain provisions of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
<P>
216. Neither this nor clause 99(2) appears to take account of the establishment of a Scottish Parliament.
<P>
217. Amendment Delete clause 98.
<P>
Clause 99
<P>
218. Excludes from the Children Act s17 those whose needs arise from destitution and "may" be met by support under s74.
<P>
219. The "may" is worrying. What of the child whose destitute asylum seeking parents "may" qualify for s74 support but have disentitled themselves by rejecting an offer of accommodation in a far flung location? Is the child to be separated from them and taken into care for the lack of s17 powers to meet his needs within his family? It appears so, since the Children Act s.20 duties and powers to accommodate children apart from their parents are not excluded by this clause. Is this a result that the government intends?
<P>
220. Amendments
<P>
delete clause 99
<P>
in 99(1) line 27 and 99(2) line 38 delete "may be" and insert "are being"
<P>
Miscellaneous and surveillance--clauses 100-103
<P>
Clause 100
<P>
221. Makes the Secretary of State a corporation sole for property conveyancing purposes. No comment
<P>
Clause 101
<P>
222. This gives powers without safeguards for the invasion of a supported person's home, using "reasonable force if necessary", to check on who is living there and whether the accommodation "is being properly treated".
<P>
223. This represents an outrageous flouting of civil liberties which as drafted may well go even further than the government intends since it applies not only to accommodation provided by the Secretary of State under the s74 scheme, but to any accommodation provided to anyone who is being supported under the scheme. So for example a relative or neighbour or kindly church member who puts up a supported asylum seeker may have his or her home invaded under this provision.
<P>
224. And if that is unintended and unacceptable, why is it acceptable for an asylum seeker accommodated anywhere else to be open to such unchecked invasion of privacy?
<P>
225. The provision breaches the most fundamental expectations of privacy and security within one's own home, and excludes supported persons from the basic protections of the ordinary law on the searching of premises and the powers of landlords.
<P>
226. It is another breach of ECHR article 8 (right to private life), and probably article 14 (anti-discrimination), that has evidently escaped the Secretary of State's notice when he conferred his compliance statement on the Bill. We direct his attention to it now, and to the recent judgement in the case of Mcleod v United Kingdom (Times, 1 October 1998).
<P>
227. Amendments
<P>
delete clause 101
<P>
No replacement is necessary because property is already adequately protected by the general law, and specific provisions could also be included in the conditions provided for in clause 94(9)
<P>
Clause 102
<P>
228. This obliges anyone who appears to have any involvement with premises used for accommodation under the scheme to give whatever information the Secretary of State requires about the premises or the people occupying them.
<P>
229. This is another potentially draconian provision whose purpose is unclear. The government should be asked to clarify. If it is intended to encourage snooping on accommodated asylum seekers and their visitors then it is to be deplored and opposed. If, however, it is intended to enable the Secretary of State to exert control over providers and the standards of provision then it is to be encouraged, subject to clarification and safeguards, including safeguards as to the confidentiality of information obtained about individual asylum seekers.
<P>
230. Amendments As may seem appropriate in the light of any clarification obtained.
<P>
Clause 103
<P>
231. Requires persons "conveying postal packets" to provide information to the Secretary of State for use in relation to criminal offences under Part VI, and for checking the accuracy of information and for "any other purpose relating to the provision of support to asylum seekers".
<P>
232. This is very wide, as to both the persons to whom and also the purposes for which it applies.
<P>
233. Do I "convey a postal packet" if I take a mis-addressed letter back to the post box? Or give a letter to a previous occupant the next time I see him?
<P>
234. If the clause is intended to be aimed at those who convey postal packets in the course of business then it should say so.
<P>
235. What is the ordinary law about the conveyers of postal packets providing information for use in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences? Does this add anything?
<P>
236. Amendment Delete 103(1)(c)
<P>
PROPOSED NEW CLAUSES
<P>
(1) Insert after existing clause 73:
<P>
73A It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to make arrangements with a view to ensuring that officials of his department and all other providers of assistance to asylum seekers and their dependents operate the provisions of this Part of this Act and exercise their functions in such a way as shall best promote the welfare of asylum seekers and their dependents, if any, who require assistance under this Part of this Act.
<P>
Note:
<P>
This derives from Conservative legislation underlying the Supplementary benefits legislation which was in force from 1980-1988. It imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to operate the system for the benefit of its recipients.
<P>
(2) Clause to be drafted to provide for the establishment of the post of independent Asylum Support Commissioner with a duty to monitor the operation of the scheme, to keep statistics as to ethnic origin and gender and to report annually to Parliament
<P>
(3) Clause to be drafted to provide
<P>
that Part VI shall to cease to apply forthwith to any asylum seeker whose asylum application remains undetermined 2 calendar months from the date on which it was made, or whose appeal remains undetermined 4 calendar months after notice of appeal was given
<P>
OR
<P>
for increased levels of support and/or the additional payment of lump sums of cash and/or the opportunity to change location and/or a lower eligibility threshold for support in the event that an asylum application remains undetermined 2 calendar months from the date on which it was made, or that an appeal remains undetermined 4 calendar months after notice of appeal was given.
<P>
(4)When exercising his duty to make provision for the essential living needs of asylum seekers and their dependents under clause 74 the Secretary of State shall exercise his powers in accordance with all the articles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
<P>
PART VII
POWER TO ARREST AND SEARCH
<P>
Introduction
<P>
1. ILPA objects, as a matter of principle, to the wide-ranging attempt to criminalise asylum seekers and others seeking to enter or remain in the United Kingdom contained in Part VII of the Immigration and Asylum Bill.
<P>
2. It believes that the introduction of further criminal sanctions into what should be an administrative and humanitarian process is ill-conceived and potentially breaches Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees and a number of the rights contained in the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
3. It also believes that the new criminal sanctions place further unnecessary burdens on the police and prison services, which are already over-stretched, and are inappropriate in the context of the victimless nature of immigration offences.
<P>
4. The MacPherson Report correctly identified the need for an improved police complaints system, effective monitoring of the use of police powers and the acknowledgement and eradication of institutional racism within the police force. Until the recommendations of the Report have been implemented, ILPA believes it would be inappropriate and potentially abusive to expose thousands of members of black and ethnic minority communities, who are asylum seekers or who seek leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, to further criminal sanctions.
<P>
5. ILPA also notes that the Bill contains no provision for the training of immigration officers in the use of reasonable force or the exercise of the wide ranging powers to enter, search and arrest. Neither does the Bill provide for any form of public accountability.
<P>
6. This is particularly of concern when the Bill further fuses the differing roles being carried out by immigration officers. They are already expected to be primary fact finders and to reach decisions as to whether or not leave to enter or remain should be granted and at the same time are often the officers responsible for arresting an overstayer or illegal entrant. This in itself breaches the principle of separation of powers.
<P>
7. However, the provisions in the Bill go much further and provide them with, for instance, powers to seize and retain evidence, upon which they will later adjudicate, or to arrest an asylum seeker who has used deception to enter the country, before any consideration has been given to the substance of his application for asylum.
<P>
Clause 104
<P>
8. The clause reproduces existing powers for immigration officers to arrest without warrant for immigration offences contained in section 24 (other than section 24(1)(d)) and section 25(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. It also provides immigration officers with the power to arrest anyone who has used any deception to enter or remain in the United Kingdom contrary to Clause 16 of the Bill, anyone who harbours an overstayer or illegal entrant or anyone who obstructs an immigration officer or anyone else who is implementing the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>
9. The introduction of a power to arrest, without first obtaining a warrant, a person reasonably suspected of using any deception to enter or remain in the United Kingdom compounds the unacceptably wide nature of the offence being created by Clause 16. It is particularly of concern, as it is a measure which specifically targets asylum seekers, in breach of Article 31 of the Convention on the Status of Refugees.
<P>
10. Furthermore, Clause 16 does not define what actions will amount to obtaining or seeking to obtain "avoidance, postponement or revocation" of enforcement action. Neither does it state that a person will only become liable for prosecution under this Clause after his asylum application has been considered and any appeal rights exercised. ILPA, therefore, believes that judicial scrutiny should be introduced to ensure that all those asylum seekers forced by necessity to use false documents to escape persecution are not arrested, as a matter of course. It also believes that such arrest powers should only be implemented after an asylum seekers has had her application determined and he has exhausted any appeal rights.
<P>
11. ILPA is also concerned about the lack of definition of what amounts to obstruction in the 1971 Immigration Act and the lack of judicial scrutiny before arrest, when the powers of arrest are being exercised by immigration officers with no legal or other appropriate training and experience.
<P>
12. Amendments
<P>
Delete reference to 24A in section 28A(1)(a).
<P>
Delete sub-sections 28A(5)-(9).
<P>
OR
<P>
Add new (2) and re-number the following sub-sections
<P>
"(2) And sub-section (1) will not apply to an offence under section 24A until the suspect's application for asylum has been determined and he has been able to exercise any appeal rights arising from the decision reached."
<P>
AND
<P>
Insert after "name" in sub-section 28A(7)(a): "and the suspect is capable of understanding the language in which he is being asked to give his name and he is not in need of assistance from an appropriate adult by reason of age, mental incapacity or any other disability".
<P>
Insert after "service" in sub-section 25A(7)(c): "and the suspect is fluent in the language in which he is being asked to give his name and he is not in need of assistance from an appropriate adult by reason of age, mental incapacity or any other disability".
<P>
13. Questions In section 26(1)(g) who are those "other persons lawfully acting in the execution of this Act"? Does it include the Secretary of State for the Home Department? What actions will be classed as obstruction for the purposes of section 26(1)(g)? What actions will amount to the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action for the purposes of section 24A? What is the justification for treating most immigration offences as if they were serious arrestable offences?
<P>
 Clause 105
<P>
14. The clause enables an immigration officer to enter any premises by force in order to search for and arrest a person wanted for an immigration offence contrary to sections 24(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) (illegal entry and overstaying), section 24A (deception) or section 25(2) (harbouring a person who is an illegal entrant or overstayer), once he has obtained a warrant.
<P>
15. ILPA believes that no warrant should be granted to enable premises to be searched for someone suspected of committing an offence under section 24A until the suspect has had his asylum application determined and has been able to exercise any appeal rights.
<P>
16. It is also opposed to unliniited force being used to enter premises. This is particularly so when the warrants obtained will often relate to a suspect's home and there are, therefore, likely to be children present and there may also be other people present who themselves have been the victims of torture and persecution in the past.
<P>
17. Amendments
<P>
Insert in the second line of section 28B(2) and in the third line of sub-section (4) before the word "force", the word "reasonable".
<P>
Add new sub-section (5) (and re-number (5) as (6)):
<P>
"(5) It shall be a condition of the grant of any warrant under this section, that the immigration officer or constable must be accompanied by an interpreter fluent in the first language spoken by the suspect and also by an appropriate adult, if there is any possibility of there being minors, or those who are mentally incapacitated or suffering from any other disability on the premises.
<P>
Add new sub-section (7):
<P>
"(7) Sub-section (5) only applies to offences under section 24A if the suspect has already had his application for asylum determined and has exhausted all of his appeal rights.
<P>
18. Question What justification is there in permitting the use of unlimited force to enter premises under such warrants?
<P>
Clause 106
<P>
19. Section 25(3) of the 1971 Immigration Act and clause 104 of the Bill provide immigration officers with the power to arrest those suspected of facilitating illegal entry, without needing to apply for a warrant. Clause 107 provides them with a new power to enter any premises to search for and arrest such suspects, without a warrant.
<P>
20. ILPA believes that such a power to enter and search without a warrant should be restricted to cases where the suspect has been facilitating illegal entry for profit or reward. It believes it is oppressive and unnecessary to provide such powers where a suspect has merely assisted a friend or relative to enter the country.
<P>
21. Amendments
<P>
Add at the end of sub-section (1): "where it is reasonably believed that the person has facilitated such entry for profit or reward".
<P>
Add at the end of sub-section (4): "in a language and form which the suspect is able to understand and in circumstances where he is not prevented from understanding the nature of the warrant and the identity of the immigration officer by age, mental incapacity or any other disability".
<P>
Clause 107
<P>
22. The clause provides immigration officers with the power to apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant to enter and search any premises for evidence relating to an immigration offence under section 24(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f), section 24A and section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>
23. ILPA is opposed to granting immigration officers the power to enter premises with which the suspect may have little or no direct connection. It will mean that community centres, advice agencies, churches, hostels and the homes of friends and relatives of the suspect can be searched. It will also mean that material wholly unconnected to the suspect's case will be examined and read and that work with other members of the community, who may themselves be vulnerable, will be disrupted.
<P>
24. The likely cumulative affect of such warrants being issued will be to discourage communities and organisations from offering support and assistance to those who may, at some time in the future, be suspected of immigration offences. This will further isolate and stigmatise asylum seekers and those seeking leave to enter or remain in the country and expose them to further risk of racist attack.
<P>
25. In the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 similar powers are only given to police officers under section 8 of that Act in relation to serious arrestable offences.
<P>
26. Amendments Delete the clause in its entirety.
<P>
Insert a new section 28D(e) and renumber (e) as (f):
<P>
Section 28D(e) will then read
"the immigration officer has made reasonable enquiries to establish:
<P>
(i) a substantial connection between the premises and the suspect;
<P>
(ii) the nature of the premises themselves;
<P>
(iii) whether they have previously been searched and, if so, how recently; and
<P>
(iv) that the proposed search will not have an adverse effect on the work carried out at the premises for people other than the suspect.
<P>
Add at the end of sections 28D(2) and (3): "in a language in which they are fluent".
<P>
27. Question Should immigration officers not be required to carry out the same stringent enquiries that a police officer must undertake before seeking to obtain a warrant for non-serious arrestable offences?
Clause 108
<P>
28. The clause provides immigration officers with powers to enter and search premises after there has been an arrest, at a place other than a police station, for an immigration offence and also where a person has been arrested or detained under Schedule 2 of the 1971 Immigration Act.
<P>
29. ILPA believes that sub-section 28E(2) is too wide and is oppressive and that sub-section 28E(3) does not provide a sufficient safeguard.
<P>
30. Amendments
<P>
Add at the end of sub-section 28E(5): "and it is necessary to seize it in order to prevent the evidence being concealed, lost, altered or destroyed".
<P>
Add at the end of sections 28E(6) and 25A(8): "or are items of excluded or special procedure material".
<P>
Add new sub-section 28E(5) and re-number the subsequent sub-sections.
<P>
28E(5) will then read:
<P>
"A relevant document is one which is material to the offence for which the suspect was arrested."
<P>
31. Question What evidence will be seen to be relevant evidence for the purposes of sub-section 28E(3)(a)?
<P>
Clause 109
<P>
32. The clause provides immigration officers with powers to enter and search premises after there has been an arrest for an offence contrary to section 25(1) of the Immigration Act 1971, that is facilitating illegal entry or harbouring illegal entrants or overstayers.
<P>
33. ILPA believes that such a power to enter and search premises after arrest under this section should be restricted to cases where the suspect has been facilitating illegal entry for profit or reward.
<P>
34. Amendments
<P>
Insert new sub-section 28F(6) and re-number the subsequent sub-sections.
<P>
The new sub-section 28F(6) will read:
<P>
"If the person who was in occupation or control of the premises is in detention at the time of the search, a copy of the record referred to in sub-section (5) shall be given to him and, if he was in police detention at the time the record shall form part of his custody record."
<P>
Insert in section 28F(7), after "legal privilege": or items of excluded or special procedure material".
<P>
35. Question What evidence is likely to be found on the premises of a person who had facilitated the entry of, for instance, her brother who was an asylum seeker?
<P>
Clause 110
<P>
36. The clause provides immigration officers with the power to search a person who has been arrested for an immigration offence at places other than police stations. The immigration officer will also be able to search a suspect's headgear.
<P>
37. Police Officers were specifically not given such a power under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, because of concern about obliging those who covered their heads in public for religious reasons to remove their headgear. ILPA believes that this power has the potential of causing offence to a number of different communities and also sparking off incidents of public disorder.
<P>
38. ILPA also believes that in the context of searching for identity documentation and other material relevant to an immigration offence, there can be no justification for searching a person's mouth.
<P>
39. Amendments
<P>
In section 26G(5) delete from "headgear" in the 4th line to "mouth" in the 5th line and in section 25B(5) in the 3rd line delete "headgear" and in the 4th line delete from "but" to "mouth".
<P>
Add new sub-section (6) in both sections and re-number the subsequent paragraphs to read: "Nothing in this section authorises an immigration officer to make any physical contact whatsoever with the arrested person's body.
<P>
ADD new subsections 28G(10) and 25B(11)
<P>
"Sub-section 3(b) shall not apply where the person arrested is not able to fully comprehend the reason for any such search, whether by reason of language, mental or other disability or age. In such circumstances, any such search should only be carried out at a police station and in the presence of an interpreter and/or appropriate adult".
<P>
Insert in 25B(8) in 3rd line after "legal privilege": "or items of excluded or special procedure material".
<P>
40. Questions Is it proposed that women will be asked to uncover their heads and reveal their faces in a public place and in front of men or that Sikhs will be asked to remove their turbans? What will happen if the person arrested does not understand sufficient English to comprehend the reason and justification for the search and resists the proposed search? What happens when an immigration officer attempts to search a suspect and a hostile crowd gathers?
<P>
Clause 111
<P>
41. The clause provides immigration officers with the power to search or strip search a suspect who is already being detained at a police station.
<P>
42. ILPA is opposed to immigration officers being given powders to search those already in police custody. The suspect will already have been subject to a search undertaken by the Custody Officer, or on his behalf, under Section 54 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 when he arrives at a police station. In most situations, an immigration officer will not attend the police station until some hours later.
<P>
43. This means that the suspect is likely to be searched by the police and an immigration officer. Subjecting a person to a second search is arguably oppressive and is likely to be perceived by the suspect as an act of intimidation. This is particularly so if the person concerned is an asylum seeker, who has in the past been detained and/or tortured in his country of origin.
<P>
44. Furthermore, clause 111(3) will not offer the suspect any protection when he is held in police detention at a place other than a police station as the custody officer's role is restricted to the supervision of a suspect once he is booked in to the police station.
<P>
45. ILPA believes that the only reasonable rationale for giving immigration officers such powers is that they may be able to identify whether the evidence found on a suspect is relevant to an immigration offence. That rationale can simply be met if the Bill provides for immigration officers to have full access to all items found on a suspect on reception into a police station or when searched in police detention at a place other than a police station.
<P>
46. The Custody Officer will not as a matter of course have required the suspect to undergo a strip search. However, Clause 111 would enable an immigration officer to strip search a suspect, as the only type of search prohibited by clause 111(8) is an intimate search, and yet there are no safeguards included in the Bill and no codes of practice attached to the Bill which would provide the suspect with any safeguards in relation to such a potentially intrusive procedure. Nor are there any firm proposals to provide appropriate training for immigration officers in such procedures.
<P>
47. Amendments
<P>
In Clause 111(2) delete all after "at any time" and insert "have access to the record made, as part of the custody record, of all items found on the suspect".
<P>
Delete sub-clause (3) and (4) and (5)
<P>
In sub-clause (6) delete "seized under subsection (4)(b)" and insert: "recorded which the immigration officer has reasonable grounds for believing is evidence relating to the immigration offence in question". Re-number sub clause (6) as (3).
<P>
In sub-clause (7) insert after "seizure" "and given the name of the immigration officer retaining the evidence".
<P>
Re-number sub-clause (7) as (4). Add new sub-clause (5): "The person from whom something is seized must be given a record in writing in a language which they can fully understand of these reasons within twenty four hours and also be provided with copies of any documents seized within the same time period. If he is incapable of understanding the reasons by reason of age of mental disability, such reasons should be given in the presence of an appropriate adult and any such copies given to them."
<P>
Delete sub-clauses (8) and (9).
<P>
Clause 112
<P>
40. The clause provides rights for occupiers of premises or persons previously in control of material seized during a search to have a record of what has been seized and to have access to and copy the material.
<P>
41. ILPA believes that the powers granted to immigration officers in section 281(6) are excessive and unjustifiable in the context of nature of the criminal proceedings referred to in Part VII of the bill. It also believes that any attempt to withhold evidence, which may be relevant to any future immigration appeal by the applicant, would frustrate the appeal rights contained in Part IV of the bill. It would also potentially breach article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which will be incorporated into UK law, when the Human Rights Act 1998 comes into force in 2000.
<P>
42. Amendments
<P>
In sub-sections 281(5) and 25D(5): delete "in a reasonable time" and insert "within one week".
<P>
Delete sub-sections 281(6) and 25D(6).
<P>
Clause 113
<P>
43. The clause imposes conditions which must be complied with before a warrant under clause 112 can be issued.
<P>
44. This raises the concern that an immigration officer can apply for warrants in connection with third party premises, for example the Medical Foundation, advisers on panel, or the Refugee Council.
<P>
Clause 114
<P>
45. The clause imposes limitation on the execution of warrants obtained under 28K(2). Amendments INSERT "a maximum of two" after "authorise". And INSERT NEW (3)
<P>
"If there is reason to believe that those in occupation cannot fully comprehend the purpose of the warrant, whether by reason of language, mental or other disability or age, the Immigration Officer must be accompanied by a suitable interpreter and/or appropriate adult."
<P>
Clause 115
<P>
46. The clause defines the meaning of premises and items subject to legal privilege as used within part VII of the Immigration and Asylum Bill.
<P>
Clause 116
<P>
47. This clause extends the power to detain to potentially a large number of immigrants. It is unacceptable as it puts no time limit on detention.
<P>
Clause 117
<P>
48. The clause provides immigration officers with the power to use reasonable force when exercising any power under the Bill or the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>
49. There is no definition of reasonable force within the Bill. Furthermore, the use of force is not restricted to the implementation of powers specifically given to immigration officers in the Bill, which would equate with the power to use reasonable force given to police constables by section 117 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Clause 117 of the Bill also provides immigration officers with the power to use reasonable force in relation to any powers conferred on them by the Immigration Act 1971. In addition, the use of reasonable force is not restricted to powers related to the investigation of immigration offences, but could also apply to the determination of applications and the exercise of other administrative powers. It could also apply to intimidatory questioning of applicants whilst in detention.
<P>
50. Amendments
<P>
Insert before "the 1971 Act" in the 2nd line of clause 117: "Part III of".
<P>
Insert before "this Act" in the 2nd line of clause 117: "Part VII of".
<P>
OR
<P>
Add at the end of clause 117: "to enter premises".
<P>
51. Question Will the Secretary of State for the Home Department accept vicarious liability for the actions of immigration officers when the force used exceeds that which is reasonable?

<H4><center>PART VIII DETENTION CENTRES AND DETAINED PERSONS</center></H4>

<P>
General concerns about detention
<P>
1. Although opposed in principle to the private control of detention, ILPA welcomes the Bill's proposals to put the contracting out of detention functions on a statutory framework. We do, however, have the following points of concern:
<P>
 a. Bill fails to provide statutory rights or protection for detainees;
<P>
 b. there are inadequate controls on employees of private companies, unlike Crown servants;
<P>
 c. there is inadequate training for private employees as compared to Prison Officers;
<P>
 d. for any safeguards to be effective, all the rules which will apply to detention of immigrants must be transparent. Performance standards must be published, including the requisite training standard for custody officers and escort personnel; and
<P>
 e. visiting committees must have statutory obligations and powers to take actions after upholding complaints made to them so that they constitute effective external supervision.
<P>
Minors
<P>
 2. There are no special statutory rules governing the immigration detention of minors. ILPA believes that no minor should be detained purely for immigration reasons. Although. the Home Office acknowledges that 371 372 minors should not be detained, it is implicit in the White Paper (at para 12.6) that minors are detained. Nothing in this Bill takes any steps to prohibit this. The excuse in the White Paper that it is difficult to determine whether a person is over 18, and the reference to reliable medical evidence, is not tenable. ILPA believes that where there is doubt as to whether to detain, detention cannot be justified, unless it is manifestly clear that the individual concerned is an adult. The evidence relied on by the Immigration Service that a minor is over 18 is often a forged or dubious passport. The Immigration Service doubt the authenticity of the document as evidence of identity, but are happy to rely on it as evidence of age.
<P>
3. It is our experience that the Immigration Service never seek to obtain medical evidence from an appropriate specialist. That is invariably left to the individual's legal representative. It is our experience that even when expert medical evidence is produced, it is rarely accepted, and a bail hearing becomes necessary.
<P>
4. Under various statutes, including the Children Act, local and central government have duties towards minors, particularly those who are vulnerable, such as unaccompanied minors. This necessary for the UK to comply with its international obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This includes immigration detainees who are detained within the local authority's area of responsibility. In our experience, very few local authorities take these responsibilities seriously. The proposed amendments to the Children Act proposed by Clause 99 of the Bill can only exacerbate the problem.
<P>
5. The protection of minors, and getting them released, is dependent almost entirely on the initiative and quality of the minor's legal representative, rather than any steps taken by the Immigration Service, the Home Office, or Social Services departments.
<P>
 Clause 123
<P>
6. This Clause mandates the Secretary of State to set up a Visiting Committee for each detention centre.
<P>
7. ILPA believes that there is a need for appropriate avenues for complaints to be made, both externally and internally, to ensure proper independent review of detention conditions. This should be analogous to the existing situation in Prisons, such as resort to the Prison Ombudsman, or Area Office.
<P>
8. Information on conditions of detention, powers of officers complaints should be made available to detainees in a language they can understand, as is the case with prisons.
<P>
9. ILPA therefore urges that there should be amendments to the Bill to achieve these ends.
<P>
Clause 124
<P>
 10. This Clause gives the Secretary of State power to make rules for the regulation and management of detention centres. See general comments above
<P>
 Clause 125
<P>
 11. This Clause creates Detainee Custody Officers and provides for their regulation, which is further dealt with in Schedule 9. See general comments above
<P>
Clause 126
<P>
12. This Clause gives detainee custody officers the power to discharge their functions. See general comments above.
<P>
Clause 128
<P>
13. This clause prevents those employed in detention centres from disclosing details of particular detainees.
<P>
14. At first glance this appears to be a sensible clause, but the reference in sub-clause (1) to a "detained person" presumably does not apply to a person previously detained. Also, does the prohibition on disclosure mean, the person could refuse to answer questions while under oath?
<P>
 15. Amendment In line 7, after person, insert "whether that person is still detained or not".
<P>
Clause 129
<P>
 16. This Clause grants powers to a constable to act outside his area of jurisdiction when accompanying a person to or from a detention centre. No further comment
<P>
Schedule 9
<P>
17. Paragraph 1 Creates the offence of obtaining a certificate of authorisation by false pretences. No comment.
<P>
 18. Paragraph 2 These are wide powers and their exercise should be supervised. To that end, it is suggested that records should be kept of the occasions on which they are used. ILPA is concerned that these powers could be used to insist on the removal of headgear, which could give offence on cultural or religious grounds. For that reason, we would suggest deletion of the references to headgear.
<P>
19. Amendment
<P>
In line 29, delete "headgear".
<P>
After sub-paragraph 4, insert new sub-paragraph
<P>
"(5) The details of any exercise of powers under this Paragraph must be noted in a register kept for this purpose which must be open for inspection."<P>
<P>
20. paragraph 3 This seems to allow unqualified or certified persons to carry out the duties of detainee custody officers, which undermines the whole purpose of custody officers. These persons are not likely to have had the appropriate training.
<P>
Short-term is not defined and this therefore constitutes a loophole in the safeguards, such that they are, provided by this Bill.
<P>
21. Paragraph 4 See comments on paragraph 6
<P>
 22. Paragraph 5 See comments on paragraph 6
<P>
23. Paragraph 6 It is submitted that as the punishments envisaged under paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Schedule are greater that those in which apply in ordinary cases of assault, then a detainee custody officer ought to be readily identifiable as such, as applies to Paragraphs 2 and 3. To that end, ILPA proposes the following amendment.
<P>
24. Amendment In line 22, delete "paragraphs 2 and 3" and substitute "this Schedule".
<P>
Schedule 10
<P>
 25. Subject to the appropriate safeguards on the exercise of the power granted under this Schedule, ILPA has no comments to make, with the exception of paragraph 6.
<P>
26. Given the wide and divergent range of items which different detention centres do not allow to be conveyed within, it is suggested that a standard list be drawn up, and that the items on the list be placed on a notice clearly displayed outside the detention centre. Further, the list of prohibited items should be confined to those which would cause difficulty within the centre, not such things as paper handkerchiefs for personal use.
<P>
Schedule 11
<P>
27. No comment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Good afternoon, Mr. Nicol and Vicky Guedalla--I hope that I have the pronunciation right. I welcome you to the Committee. Would you briefly say for the record who you are and whom you represent? As you already know, we are not taking opening statements but moving straight into questions.
<P>
<B>Andrew Nicol (Immigration Law Practitioners Association):</B> Thank you, we are grateful for the opportunity to give evidence. My name is Andrew Nicol and I am the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners Association. Our body is a group of about 800 members, most of whom are immigration practitioners of one kind or another--some solicitors, some barristers, some working in advice centres, some who have a general interest in immigration law and policy. Vicky Guedalla is a solicitor working in private practice whose speciality is in immigration matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> To what extent do we have a problem in the legal profession in the area of asylum law as a result of incompetent and unscrupulous lawyers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> We certainly have a problem in that there are not enough good immigration lawyers. Demand far outstrips supply. In terms of the extent to which there is a problem at the other end of the scale--in relation to incompetent and unscrupulous lawyers--there are no doubt some, but I am not in a position to be able to quantify it any more than anybody else here.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Vicky Guedalla, do you have any experience of dealing with cases--as Deighton Guedalla solicitors no doubt do--in which lawyers previously gave bad advice to clients before they came to you?
<P>
<B>Vicky Guedalla (Deighton Guedalla Solicitors):</B> Yes, most ILPA members have the experience of picking up files where people's cases have been--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Does it often happen?
<P>
<B>Vicky Guedalla:</B> It happens too often. I would not be able to quantify it, but I would not disagree that there is a problem. ILPA's approach to the problem is to try to develop schemes in conjunction with the Legal Aid Board and the Law Society to squeeze out bad advisers by tackling the lack of good advisers at the other end by accreditation schemes and by working with the Legal Aid Board on standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Has the office for the Supervision of Solicitors been efficient and effective in dealing with unscrupulous and incompetent lawyers in this area of law?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> The OSS can deal with complaints, and is dependent on complaints being made to it. When the Home Office put forward its paper for consultation on unscrupulous advisers at the beginning of last year, we had discussions with a number of bodies. One of the things that we urged those who are in the position that Miss Guedalla described of receiving bad cases that have been badly handled to do was to raise such matters with the OSS so that they can be investigated by the professional body. Certain organisations, particularly the IAS and the RLC, and others which deal with large numbers of immigration clients, are in an especially good position to make those types of complaints and references to the OSS and, indeed, to the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I pick up these cases all the time in my constituency when people come to the end of a line of bad advice. I also pick up cases where the same group of solicitors will come month after month, saying, "Sorry, I brought you a bad case last month but this is a good one." I offer you the opportunity to say how we should regulate the type of practitoner who works in this field. Why are there not enough good immigration lawyers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> May I take the last part of your question first? The short answer is money. It is not a field in which there is a large amount of money to be made, notwithstanding that one hears anecdotal evidence of some people taking very large fees from clients. Generally speaking, it is not a field in which there are a large number of lawyers, partly because there is not a large market to support it. Although there is a degree of publicly funded assistance through what used to be called the green form scheme, it has shortcomings of its own.
<P>
On the first part of your question about how we regulate the bad, the position of ILPA has been that where advisers are not at present regulated by a professional body, the gap needs to be filled. To that extent, we welcome and support the proposals in the Bill to introduce regulations for advisers who are not currently regulated. In brief, we think that the right way to regulate those who are subject to professional discipline is through the professional bodies.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> What is your view on the proposed commission?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> We have rather a lot of views which we have set out in our submissions. In terms of the commissioner's role as a regulator of those who currently have no regulation, we agree in principle that that is a good thing. In terms of his role in relation to lawyers who are currently subject to regulation, we think that his role is duplicative and unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> So this is a bit of motherhood and applie pie. The commissioner may even be a female, by the way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> You are quite right. I am sorry.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Will you be more specific about the broad provisions that you think the regulations should contain?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> The regulations are notable not so much by their absence of power as by the breadth of their power. I think even though we have welcomed in principle the institution of regulation of unqualified advisers, some of the powers that the commissioner is given are, frankly, troubling. We mentioned in our submissions that there appears to be a power for the commissioner to authorise searches of premises without judicial warrant. Even in the case of advisers who are not currently regulated by a professional body that appears to us to be excessive.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> But you cannot give a more positive answer about what should be in them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> The basic scheme for those advisers who are not qualified is set out in the Bill. We have supported the basic scheme and principle of regulating unqualified advisers and I can, if it will assist the Committee, go through the matter point by point, but in summary, we accept the basic idea.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate the extremely comprehensive briefing--probably the most comprehensive that we have received from any quarter--and the expertise that has gone into it.
<P>
You highlight concern about the effect of the proposed system of dispersion and the way in which it will operate. You express fear that it will lead to growth of racism, discrimination and even attacks on asylum seekers and you propose safeguards to protect asylum seekers who are sent to unfamiliar parts of the country. How important do you consider the inclusion of such safeguards on the face of the Bill to be?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> May I ask Vicky Guedalla to deal with that?
<P>
<B>Vicky Goedalla:</B> First, I should say that the position of the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association on the support scheme, including the dispersal proposals, is to oppose it hook, line and sinker. We regard it as obnoxious and unnecessary. It is unnecessary because, if the Government are to meet their target of two months plus four months for an appeal, we are at a loss to understand the need for a cumbersome and expensive mechanism to construct a segregated benefit and support system for asylum seekers. The Government's motivation for the proposals seems to be that they should act as a disincentive to non-genuine asylum seekers, but we believe that the time-targets will themselves be sufficient disincentive. It is unnecessary to be so obnoxious and to inflict such an expensive new construct on the taxpayer.
<P>
The Government acknowledge in the White Paper that the scheme is justifiable only if it is to be temporary--if the time limits will be met. Therefore, ILPA's second-line comment on part VI is that there can be no excuse for contemplating introducing it in advance of meeting the targets. We understand that the targets--two months for determination and four months for appeal--are not expected to be reached until some time in 2000 or 2001; I forget exactly. I am not even sure if a precise date has been specified. Yet at the moment we understand that it is expected that the scheme will go ahead, and asylum seekers will be pushed into it, as soon as possible. There are to be no sanctions concerned with bringing them out if the six-month time limits are not met.
<P>
Those objections are fundamental and anything that we say about the detail is said under duress and with deep regret at the possibility that the Committee and the House intend to allow the Government to proceed with the proposal.
<P>
We consider it terribly important that if any such scheme is contemplated, many more safeguards should be on the face of the Bill and, beyond that, that much more of the regulation and secondary legislation should be made available for the scrutiny of the Committee and the House before is Parliament asked to rubber-stamp blank cheques to be given to the Government.
<P>
An example concerning the detail of the support-system and the delegated legislation and regulation, the content of which we cannot predict, is the inclusion of the Secretary of State's powers to decide where people will be accommodated. We know that he cannot take account of the fact that accommodation will be shared or temporary and that he is not to be allowed to take into account preference. However, we do not know what matters he will take into account. That is hidden in secondary legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> That is all very helpful. There is a mass of detail here, and I am touching on a point that caught my eye.
<P>
In your evidence on how accommodation is to be allocated, you say that the Secretary of State is forbidden from taking preferences into account. Under the Bill's provisions, once asylum seekers have arrived at the accommodation which they have been allocated, they must stay there. The duty to accommodate them will expire if they leave the accommodation, so they can lose accommodation.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Vicky Guedalla:</B> Absolutely. Putting into regulations the Secretary of State's consideration of continuing support should asylum seekers leave their designated accommodation would be a safeguard. We are worried that asylum seekers may need to leave their designated accommodation because they are being abused or harassed or subjected to domestic violence.
<P>
There may be compelling reasons why people have to leave. Those reasons relate to personal safety and integrity, especially in accommodation where young people may share with older people, or in temporary accommodation where different sexes share with little support. At the moment, the Bill provides no protection and people lose their right to be supported.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> The circumstances might be drastic and might include attacks and the matters to which you referred in your evidence. Would you like the safeguards that you mentioned to be included in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Vicky Guedalla:</B> We would like them in the Bill or, if that is not possible, in regulations that can be scrutinised in Committee or by the House. We want something as fundamental as personal safety and certain other delegated powers to be included in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On a different subject--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have only 20 minutes left in which to examine these witnesses. Six Committee members have indicated that they wish to ask questions--that number has now risen to seven.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I shall be brief. I was most impressed with the care and comprehensive nature of the briefing from the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association.
<P>
Your organisation, Mr. Nicol, asserts that quicker decisions are desirable: we all agree with that. On page 56, you explain that the certainty of a quick disposal is a disincentive to those who do not qualify. We all want disposal to be fair as well as quick. However, I was not sure what proposals you are making for speeding up the asylum decision-making process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> May I express our thanks for your appreciation of our briefing? It was prepared in a hurry, and I apologise for any errors that may have crept in. It was a collective effort by a number of people.
<P>
The Government easily identify with the importance of speed and have taken it on board. Of course, speed is one of the desiderata of an immigration system. All of our members have had experience of clients who have suffered frustration as the decision-making process has ground on year after year.
<P>
However, speed is not the only desideratum, although it is difficult to recognise that. We are lawyers, so it is our job to recognise that there are other desiderata in the immigration system. Our role is to bring to the attention of the Committee and others the importance of those desiderata.
<P>
The immigration White Paper used the title, "Fairer, Faster and Firmer". So the Government are not oblivious to the demands of fairness. We accept that. But a balance must be struck, and we must alert those who take the decisions to the fact that advocacy of speed brings costs with it.
<P>
The demands of speed are already there. Our job is to bring into the equation the demands of fairness and emphasis the price paid for some of the Government's proposals in the interests of speed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> There is more than one way of speeding up the process. You know how it works; you are the experts. You assert the importance of quick decisions. However, if the Government's way of speeding up the process is wrong, what alternative ways would you suggest for speeding it up and keeping it fair?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> ILPA contributed to a briefing paper before the Government's White Paper was published, which was called "Providing Protection". One of its themes was that a positive way forward would be to front-load the system to put more emphasis on the quality of the initial decision making. Our view was that if you did that, a lot of the other problems that had been built into the system would fall away. Of course you would still have people who were subject to negative decisions wanting to challenge them: of course there would still be disappointed applicants. But if clients felt that all their points had been properly considered and they had been given a reasoned decision, a number of them--you would be surprised how many--would be more accepting of the situation. If there were not such a large number of appeals pushing through the system that would be one way of achieving savings in time.
<P>
<B>Vicky Guedalla:</B> And if some of the resources and training currently devoted to establishing the Asylum Support Directorate were redirected into the Asylum Directorate itself, we might achieve a faster put-through and better decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> You have advocated the extension of legal aid for a range of hearings within the immigration appeals system--interviews, bail hearings and so on. We live in a world of cash-limited budgets. What is your view of the other areas of the legal aid budget that should be trimmed to create space to pay for the legal aid costs in this area?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> Those are decisions that others will have to take. We can see the problem. We can shout because we can see it being suffered. We can say, "This is the price that you will pay if you don't provide legal advice in these situations." Others will have to say, "Well we will have to cut the cake and divide it up a different way." Measures are already being taken by the Legal Aid Board to bring under a greater degree of rigorous scrutiny what I still call the green form--although the expression has become anachronistic--and that may yield some savings. But when one is confronted with clients or potential clients who will suffer injustice if they do not get representation or advice, I am not sure that we can say anything other than that it is unfair. The question of how to pay for that will have to be decided by others who look at a larger picture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson </B>(Harwich): Do you have any evidence on comparable costs or charges within the practices of charges for a completed asylum case, so that we can see how much some cases cost?
<P>
On the question of carriers liability, you said that you had concerns about a number of matters. Would you say that carriers overall, if they were found with anything illegal, other than persons, in their vehicles or trailers, would still be liable to prosecution, whether it be for drugs or for any other matter?
<P>
<B>Miss Guedalla:</B> On the costs of asylum seekers, I am afraid that I do not have figures or evidence. That is a question that may be for the Legal Aid Board. I am not sure whether it keeps statistics on that. But inevitably it would be hugely variable. The asylum seeker who has a strong case, gets good legal advice and a good decision after a single interview or a single submission of a 379 380 statement will cost £200 or £300. The asylum seeker whose case has to go through the entire appeal procedure or who comes to the solicitor with a messed-up case that needs to be put right will be much more expensive. Any statistics that the Legal Aid Board can give us--I am happy to ask them whether they keep them--would need careful interpretation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> It is not the direct concern of the Committee, but proposals to move legal aid to what is called block funding, rather than payment on an hourly basis would also apply in the context of immigration. Part of the debate and the discussions that we are due to have with the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Legal Aid Board will address the difficulties that this causes, for precisely the reasons that Vicky Guedalla has mentioned.
<P>
There is an enormous variety in the way in which an asylum case can pan out. Some cases are fairly straightforward because the Home Office recognises, almost as a matter of course, that a person from a particular country or of a particular race from a particular country has a well-founded fear of persecution. In other cases it is a much more difficult task, even if ultimately it is successful.
<P>
On your other question about carriers' liability, the distinction in our context is that the carriers' liability creates a particular dilemma for people seeking asylum. That is not a problem which has any kind of analogy in relation to other prohibited goods. It is the effect of carriers' liability as a barrier and an obstacle to those who genuinely are fleeing persecution which prompts our concern. I appreciate that you may hear from other organisations that have more specific concerns about carriers' liability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> I mentioned this yesterday. Would you share the concerns of others that people are being carried in unsafe and life-threatening conditions which should be monitored and perhaps controlled in some way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> Of course, but what drives people to seek to be brought to the UK in those conditions is also our concern.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> You highlighted enforcement and the role of immigration service officers as a matter of extreme concern, particularly the extension of powers of arrest and search to immigration officers. Do you think that there should be no extension of powers and that the police should continue to carry out those functions? Secondly, if there is an extension of powers, are there other measures that you would wish to see in the Bill, such as an independent complaints procedure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> At the moment there are certain types of enforcement action where immigration officers in effect have to go along with an officer in uniform. We think that that is a useful discipline. It is obviously not foolproof as certain tragic incidents have shown, but it is a useful discipline. There is something significant about a person in a uniform turning up as opposed to an immigration officer who is part of a non-uniform service.
<P>
It is also important because although the police are not without their faults and difficulties, they have at least the institutional structure for the training, discipline and professional complaints that is not as developed in the immigration service. Yes, we would object to the extension of the powers that the police now have exclusively to the immigration service. As very much a second best we would urge the Committee to see that the kind of safeguards that we talked about in other contexts are also introduced on the face of the Bill as a condition for extending those powers.

<P>

<B>Ms Vicky Guedalla:</B> In relation to that, we also draw the Committee's attention to our serious concerns about clause 101, which empowers the Secretary of State to give authority in writing to anyone to enter into accommodation that is being lived in by a person receiving support and search it, without any safeguards whatever. Clause 101 appears to us to justify the Orwellian echo. We certainly hope that the Committee will see to it that something is done about it.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I appreciate the detail of your submission and share many of the sentiments expressed, especially in respect of clause 101. Are you categorically stating that if clause 101 is enacted it will subsequently be found to be in breach of article 8--the right to a private life--of the ECHR?
<P>
<B>Ms Guedalla:</B> Yes, I believe so. It is completely unnecessary; the ordinary law on property and landlords, rights is enough.
<P>
<B>Dr. Stephen Ladyman </B>(South Thanet): It did not appear to me from your written evidence, although your words have been slightly different, that you were in favour of simplifying or speeding up the existing procedures in the Bill. Wherever there is existing complexity, you seem to find justification for its continuation. In particular, I got the impression that you were not in favour of a one-stop shop, but your words have made me wonder whether I misread the evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> We share the concerns of the witnesses that you heard previously about the so-called one-stop appeal. It Is not comprehensive; it is combined with taking away rights of appeal, particularly from overstayers, which we think is unjust and unfair and it will lead to other problems.
<P>
The decision making takes place over an extended period of time; the Government have a paradigm of a very short period for deciding the asylum application, but in the real world the time scale is much longer. Things change and develop over that period. A one-stop appeals system at the moment seems not to take account of that.
<P>
In our submission, it also fails to take account of the very patchy availability of advice. It is all very well saying to a person who has appealed against an adverse immigration decision, "Right, here's our notice, you now tell us every possible reason why you would be entitled to stay in the United Kingdom." But as other witnesses have mentioned, if you are not a lawyer and you do not know about Home Office concessions, if you do not know about European Union rights, for instance, your failure at that stage to mention rights which you might in fact have, can hardly be a matter of blame. Yet, in the structure of the Bill, the failure to mention them would lead to the loss of an opportunity to have those matters adjudicated upon by an independent official.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> Is it not a reasonable principle that if people have rights to remain in this country, they should put them down on paper to start off with, rather than expecting to go through serial appeals, so that when the first one does not work they will try the second? Is is unreasonable that that should be dealt with?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> That is really a question in two parts. The first--is it reasonable for people to state their rights when asked to do so--has the premise that people know what their rights are. Those who have access to advisers such as Ms Guedalla will know, but an awful lot of people who will receive these notices will not know. In that case, we would say that it was unreasonable to expect them to declare rights of which they are ignorant.
<P>
We can understand your second proposition--is there not something wrong about a sequential series of appeals--and we can understand the Home Office wanting to get rid of that phenomenon. There are aspects of the one-stop appeal with which we have no quarrel. The problem is that the way in which this has been devised means that it sweeps up in its wake a great many other situations in which the merits and justice go in the other direction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Ladyman:</B> May I--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry, Dr. Ladyman, but if you do not mind, I shall ask Mr. Faber to put the last question. Mr. Gerrard, I know that you wanted to ask something, but I shall make sure you are called early at the next opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> My question is brief. You heard my question to the previous witnesses about schedule 2 and the abolition of lay membership of the tribunal. In your evidence, you say that you would oppose the routine use of single-member tribunals in place of lay members, whose role is to be abolished. Do you oppose just the use of single-member tribunals, or the abolition of lay membership also?
<P>
<B>Mr. Nicol:</B> There have certainly been times when I have appeared before the tribunal and the dialogue has taken place between me and the chair, whereas the participation of the lay members has not been obvious. They may contribute to the decision-making in a valuable way outside the hearing room in private consultation. We do not know; you should inquire of the tribunal about that. I understand the point that was made earlier about the ethnic make-up of the tribunal and the effect that abolishing lay membership would have on that. I also share earlier witnesses' sentiments that a far more significant change would be a move to the paper disposal of appeals. That is where I would focus the Committee's attention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you for your evidence. As you know, we have two other groups of witnesses before 7 o'clock, with the possibility of a Division in that time. I am very grateful to you for coming to give evidence this evening.
<P>
The witnesses withdrew.

On resuming--
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Law Society</center></H4>
<P>
1. The Immigration and Asylum Bill is intended to provide a fairer, firmer and faster immigration and asylum system.
<P>
2. The Law Society believes that the Bill fails to achieve those objectives and is generally opposed to the Bill for the following reasons:--
<P>
 (i) The Bill fails to recognise the need for and desirability of proper legal advice and representation for an asylum seeker at every stage of his/her application which would contribute to the fairness, speed and integrity of the system as a whole;
<P>
(ii) The Bill fails to take the opportunity to improve the immigration appeals system including failing to provide that legal aid be available for representation at any immigration and asylum appeal hearings;
(iii) The Legal Services Commissioner is unlikely to be sufficiently financed by those to be directly regulated and the cost implications for immigration advisers are likely to affect the number of competent advisers prepared and able to undertake this important and complex area of work; and
(iv) The proposals for the support of asylum seekers are inhumane, and are unlikely to be workable, particularly if the new Asylum Support Directorate does not meet its own time targets, and does not recognise in any meaningful way that legal advice has a role to play in the support application process.
<P>
3. This submission is prepared on the basis of the information currently available in the Bill, but without sight of the numerous rules, regulations and orders referred to in the Bill.
<P>
The role of lawyers and legal aid
<P>
4. The Society strongly believes that access to competent legal advice, including at the making of the initial immigration or asylum application and before and during interviews, would not only assist applicants to reach a fair, prompt and efficient determination of their individual cases, but facilitate the early identification of genuine claims and improve the fairness, speed and efficiency of the decision-making process, diminishing the necessity of correcting errors through the appeals system.
<P>
5. Provisions to increase applicants' access to appropriate legal advice, assistance and representation are absent from the Bill.
<P>
6. The Immigration Appeal Tribunal is the only legal forum where an appellant is not represented by a lawyer or other appropriate adviser as a matter of course. Under this Bill, immigration and asylum remains the only major area of law where there is resistance to legal representation.
<P>
7. This is particularly disappointing since the Lord Chancellor's proposed changes to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal appear to be modelled on the Employment Appeal Tribunal before which cases may be eligible for civil legal aid.
<P>
8. In the event of refusal of an application, legal advice assists the applicant in identifying whether there are any grounds for appeal. The availability of appropriate and effective legal representation at detainee bail hearings and before adjudicators and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal is essential to the fair and efficient conduct of hearings.
<P>
9. State-funded representation at appeal hearings is currently only available from the Home Office-funded Refugee Legal Centre and Immigration Advisory Service which are currently over-subscribed.
<P>
10. Legal aid funding is currently available through the Legal Advice and Assistance Scheme for all aspects of immigration advice, including for example asylum applications, and applications for a work permit, visas or leave to enter. Advice and Assistance may also cover preparation for an immigration appeal and any judicial review, but does not cover actual representation at any hearing. Legal Advice and Assistance is currently means tested. It is available free to those receiving income support or certain other benefits or with an income of £80 or less per week and who satisfy limits as to their capital.
<P>
11. It is necessary to apply for civil legal aid to be represented upon an application for leave to apply for judicial review proceedings and for the judicial review proceedings themselves if leave is given. Civil legal aid is both means and merits tested.
<P>
12. Under the Bill legal aid will not be available for:--
<P>
 (i) Bail hearings for those in detention (clause 29) although there is reference to representation of the detained person by a soilicitor or barrister (clause 34(2)(b))
<P>
 (ii) An appeal to an adjudicator by a person who is refused leave to enter the U.K (clause 41)
<P>
 (iii) An appeal to an adjudicator by a person with limited leave who is refused further leave (clause 43)
<P>
(iv) An appeal to an adjudicator against the making of or refusal to revoke a deportation order (clause 45)
<P>
 (v) An appeal to an adjudicator in connection with an alleged breach of human rights by an immigration officer or the Home Secretary (clause 47)
<P>
 (vi) An appeal to an adjudicator against directions for removal (clause 48)
<P>
 (vii) An appeal to an adjudicator against the destination specified in connection with removal (clause 49)
<P>
 (viii) Asylum appeals to special adjudicators (clauses 51 and 53)
<P>
 (ix) An appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in respect of (ii) to (viii) above (clause 38 and schedule 2)
<P>
 (x) Appeals to support adjudicators about the refusal or withdrawal of support (paragraph 5.2 of the Process Manual).
<P>
13. The Society wishes to see an additional clause/clauses in the Bill providing for legal aid to be available for the applications set out above. Such work could be brought within the scope of the Assistance by way of Representation (ABWOR) scheme. It is commonly accepted that immigration is a difficult, complex and relatively poorly remunerated field of law. Such funding would contribute not only to fairness and efficiency, but would also encourage a sufficient number of competent practitioners to enter the field or continue to do this type of work.
<P>
14. The Immigration and Asylum Bill should be considered in the light of proposed changes to the legal aid scheme in the Access to Justice Bill currently going through Parliament. All immigration advice and assistance by solicitors and other providers will be provided by contract from the end of 1999. The Lord Chancellor has asked the Legal Aid Board to produce specific proposals for dealing with immigration in the exclusive contracting regime and addressing the potential shortfall of suppliers. Those proposals are still awaited, but the request for them recognises the need for arrangements to ensure adequate access to good advice in this area. It is important to remember that those solicitors' firms with a contract with the new Legal Services Commission will not be awarded or retain a contract if they cannot comply with quality standards.
<P>
15. The Access to Justice Bill also proposes to replace the current civil legal aid merits test with a Funding Code which will prioritise the areas of work for legal aid funding within a controlled budget. The Government has identified human rights cases and challenges by individuals to the unlawful acts of the state and public bodies as a high priority for the new scheme. The draft Code proposes that pre-leave funding would only be available if the applicant has exhausted all administrative avenues prior to applying for judicial review, and has a public interest case which demonstrates the potential to produce real benefits for a significant number of people which is also of overwhelming importance to him/her.
<P>
16. The Committee's attention is drawn to Article 6 of the European Court on Human Rights which guarantees "a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law" to allow a person's civil rights and obligations to be tested. In the Society's view, representation should be a right and the Convention has been interpreted so as to hold that legal aid itself is a right.
<P>
Routine bail hearings for detained persons (Part III clauses 29 to 37)
<P>
17. The Society welcomes the introduction of automatic bail hearings for detainees a week and a month after detention. However, the Society is keen to ensure that these are effective and not empty rituals.
<P>
18. Detainees should be given the opportunity to be legally represented at such hearings (before whichever court as set out at clause 29(11) and whatever their location as set out at clause 30(2)) and by a publicly funded representative if they satisfy appropriate eligibility criteria. This would be consistent with bail hearings in criminal proceedings and increase the confidence of detainees, the public and the courts in the bail process.
<P>
19. Solicitors have rights of audience to appear before magistrates, but arrangements need to be made for non-legally qualified representatives to attend bail hearings. The Committee might wish to consider whether hearings are to be public. The disadvantage of this would be that experienced nonqualified staff working under the supervision of solicitors could not conduct such hearings.
<P>
20. Whilst the Society accepts that the entering into of a recognizance by a detained person may be appropriate in some cases, it does not agree that detained persons should only be released if a recognizance is given (clause
 31).
<P>
21. In addition, the Society is concerned about the procedure and practice for bail hearings before magistrates' courts in the Bill (clause 34).
<P>
22. The Bill is silent as to the criteria which are to be taken into account by magistrates in reaching their decision, and the burden of justification for release falls on the detainee as opposed to the burden of justification for detention falling on the detaining authority. The Society suggests amendments to the Bill providing:--
<P>
(i) That the magistrates must be informed by notice of the reasons for detention and be given power to review those reasons against defined criteria in order to ensure that there is meaningful judicial oversight of decisions to detain.
<P>
(ii) That there should be a presumption in favour of bail, similar to the presumption in favour of liberty operative in criminal cases under the Bail Act 1976, unless the magistrates have good reason to believe that the detainee has committed a criminal offence or that there is a real and substantial risk that the conditions for bail are likely to be breached and that other measures short of detention will not suffice.
<P>
23. The imminence of removal should also be a factor to be taken into account by the magistrates.
<P>
24. The amendments in paragraph 22 would not preclude the making of rigorous conditions of bail as to residence and reporting.
<P>
25. Clause 34(4) provides that on any second bail hearing the court need not hear any arguments as to fact or law that that court has heard previously. The Society is unclear as to what the content and purpose of such a hearing would therefore be. The Society suggests an amendment to the Bill deleting clause 34(4) or alternatively setting out the circumstances for argument at any subsequent bail hearing.
<P>
26. Clause 35 provides for the use of live television links at bail hearings. The Society has doubts about the workability of such a system. Where the detained person is represented, his/her representative must be able to take instructions and advise on a confidential basis, and may need to converse with the detained person during the hearing as issues are raised.
<P>
Appeals (Part IV clauses 38 to 60)
<P>
 27. The nature of the proposed changes to the appeals system increases the need for applicants to have access to competent advice. Those making applications may already be vulnerable and additionally in the process of dealing with applications to the new Asylum Support Directorate.
<P>
28. The Bill proposes a "one stop" procedure for those with rights of appeal against a refusal of an application for leave to enter or remain in the U.K (clause 55). Under the Bill it will be vital for the applicant to fully and properly complete within a prescribed time limit a statement of all possible grounds he/she has for remaining in the U.K, including any claim for asylum and alleged breach of his/her human rights. It would be logical for applicants to be advised to take or be referred to legal advice at this stage. If not advised or badly advised the applicant could risk losing the appeal avenues to which he/she is legally entitled, including upon human rights grounds.
<P>
29. Any "one stop" appeal should be comprehensive and should include any relevant compassionate grounds.
<P>
30. The Society suggests an amendment to clause 58 expressly giving the adjudicator or Tribunal dealing with the appeal power to consider compassionate grounds even if not stated in response to a notice served under section 55.
<P>
31. The Society opposes the removal of a comprehensive right of appeal for overstayers subject to deportation. A single right of appeal should be available to all rejected applicants, including those facing removal from the U.K, whatever the nature of the refusal, and covering all the circumstances of the case.
<P>
32. The Society believes that without truly comprehensive appeals procedures complimented by adequate representation for appellants, the number of applications for judicial review is likely to increase.
<P>
 33. Clause 59 provides for the payment of penalties by an appellant or his/her representative where an appeal has been continued and dismissed after the Immigration Appeal Tribunal gave notice that it considered that the appeal had no merit. Whilst there may be room for a wasted costs type jurisdiction against legal representatives in this area of work, the Society suggests that clause 59 be amended, as far as the appellant is concerned, to provide that the appellant have his/her application fee refunded where he/she is successful on appeal.
<P>
34. The Bill must be viewed in conjunction with the Lord Chancellors proposals to modernise the immigration and asylum appeals process, some of which are included in 387 388 the Bill and which will supplement the provisions set out in Schedules 2, 3 and 4 to the Bill. The Society's main areas of concern are as follows:--
<P>
 (i) The exclusion of lay members;
<P>
(ii) The power for an adjudicator or the Tribunal to allow or to dismiss an appeal without considering the merits of a party's case where that party has failed to comply with directions or has failed to attend a hearing, without having at least investigated the reasons for this; and
<P>
 (iii) The power for the Tribunal to determine an appeal without a hearing.
<P>
Regulation of immigration services and immigration service providers (Part V clauses 61 to 72)
<P>
35. The Society continues to support the Government's objective of improving the standards of advice in connection with immigration and asylum advice and to regulate unqualified immigration advisers. As already indicated, this is even more important if appellants' grounds of appeal are to be restricted to those set out in one statement and appellants are at risk of incurring financial penalties if an appeal of no merit is continued.
<P>
36. However, in order to achieve consumer protection for those making immigration and asylum applications, the Bill needs to ensure that there will be an adequate number of competent advisers remaining in and entering the field in order to meet demand, and appropriate remedies should be available to those who are the unwitting victims of inadequate or unscrupulous advice by lawyers or non-lawyers.
<P>
37. The Society is committed to working with the Government, the Legal Aid Board and others to provide effective regulation of solicitors in this area of work and others. Solicitors will continue to be subject to comprehensive rules of professional conduct enforced by a disciplinary system. The Society has also taken the following initiatives to promote best practice and to encourage supply of proficient practitioners:--
<P>
(i) The issuing in January 1999 of revised specific guidelines for immigration practitioners to amplify the mandatory professional standards as they apply to immigration and asylum work;
<P>
(ii) The on-going development of an Immigration Law Accreditation Panel to enable clients and referral agencies to identify proficient practitioners. The Panel will be open for applications for membership from April 1999 and the first national directory of immigration law practitioners will be available in July 1999;
<P>
(iii) The seeking of a closer working relationship between the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors and the Legal Aid Board including the seconding of Law Society staff to the Board; and
<P>
(iv) Agreement with the Home Office for new procedures designed to improve the way in which complaints about immigration matters are investigated.
<P>
38. The Society considers that the regulatory and disciplinary roles of the designated professional bodies and the Immigration Services Commissioner should be coordinated and provide consistency of approach to regulation and standards. Specifically, the Society's regulatory powers should be brought into line with those proposed for the Immigration Services Commissioner and gaps in the legal powers available to the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors remedied. The Society has already suggested to the Home Secretary (and the Lord Chancellor) changes to the powers that are available generally. These relate to access to solicitors' papers to monitor compliance with practice rules without the need for a complaint to have been made; requiring solicitors to meet costs in cases of both inadequate professional services and disciplinary matters; access to accounts for inspection; and direct action against unqualified persons employed by solicitors.
<P>
39. The Society's main submissions on Part V are as follows:--
<P>
(i) Clause 62(2) should be amended to provide that the Immigration Services Commissioner is appointed by the Lord Chancellor. This would ensure the independence of the Commissioner. It would be perverse for the Secretary of State to have the power to regulate the Commissioner who effectively controls his/her "opponents" in immigration and asylum cases.
<P>
(ii) Clauses 63(4)--The Bill should set out the criteria to be applied in determining an application to be an "exempt person".
<P>
(iii) Clause 64--The meaning of exemption is unclear. It appears that those with exemptions will be subject to the Commissioners powers but exempt from payment of a fee to the Commissioner.
<P>
(iv) Clause 65(2) should be amended to provide that the name of a designated body may be removed by the Lord Chancellor if he and certain designated judges including the Master of the Rolls (in the case of the Law Society but possibly others for other designated bodies) consider that a designated professional body has consistently failed to provide effective regulation of its members in the provision of immigration advice or services. This would reflect the procedure in respect of the amendment of the Solicitors' Practice Rules and be a practical safeguard in the exercise of this significant step against any professional body. The exercise of this power should be subject to affirmative procedures.
<P>
(v) Clause 65(7)--The Society is alarmed at the provision that each designated body pay an annual fee of an unspecified amount with no reference as to how this may be calculated. Any fee payable by a designated body should be proportionate to or based on the actual costs incurred by the Commissioner in relation to that body.
<P>
The Society and others are sceptical about how a self-financing regulatory scheme will be effected in view of the number of those who will not be members of a designated professional body and yet will be able to afford the suggested registration fee of £6,300 per annum and an annual audit fee of £1,350. The basic practising certificate fee for a solicitor is £430 per annum and the estimated three year membership fee for the Immigration Law Accreditation Panel is £250.
<P>
(vi) Clause 68--There should be additional provisions extending the remedies available to clients and/or their sponsors where a disciplinary charge is upheld by the Immigration Services Tribunal. The remedies suggested are both monetary compensation and a power for the Commissioner to refer a decision back to the Home Office, the adjudicator which heard the relevant appeal or the Immigration Appeal Tribunal with directions, where the client has been negligently or improperly advised and/or represented, resulting in a failed appeal or missed appeal rights. The second remedy would probably be the only meaningful redress for the individual concerned other than through a possible application for judicial review.
<P>
A similar power should be made available to the relevant arms of the designated professional bodies to provide consistency with the powers of the Commissioner and more effective regulation. This approach is already reflected in Clause 69.
<P>
(vii) Schedule 5 Part I 1(2) Before making or amending any rules the Commissioner should also be obliged to consult each of the designated professional bodies.
<P>
The Society hopes that it would be able to assist the Commissioner in the formulation of the Commissioner's rules.
<P>
Schedule 5 Part I 4(l) The Commissioner should be obliged to consult the designated bodies and others on the Commissioner's complaints scheme.
<P>
Schedule 5 Part I 4(2)(e) The Commissioner is given the power to investigate an alleged breach by a member of a designated body of that body's rules. The Society suggests that the Commissioner have power to refer alleged breaches which come to his/her attention to the relevant professional body on the basis that these should have the same powers of investigation. This would avoid both duplication of effort and the conduct of two possible investigations in respect of the same complaint.
<P>
Schedule 5 Part I 6 The Commissioners power to enter premises should be subject to judicial oversight by the obtaining of a warrant from a circuit judge.
<P>
Schedule 5 Part II The Commissioner should be answerable to the Lord Chancellor for the same reasons as set out at 1. above.
<P>
Support for asylum seekers (Part VI clauses 73 to 103)
<P>
40. The Society endorses the submissions which will be made by others on the proposed nature of support and the dispersal of asylum seekers away from the existing concentrations of support services and legal advice providers, and the creation of a second class of person present in the country. It believes that the proposals will have the effect of removing basic legal protections from asylum seekers which are available to all other individuals in the U.K.
<P>
41. Clause 74 of the Bill deals with the Home Secretary's power to provide or arrange for the provision of support for asylum seekers and their families. More information on the detail of those proposed support arrangements is set out in the draft first version of the Process Manual for the Asylum Support System.
<P>
42. The Society wishes to draw the Committee's attention to the following arising from the Manual:--
<P>
(i) Whilst it is acknowledged that those considering making an application to the Asylum Support Directorate for support need information on access to legal advice and representation (paragraph 2.10), the Manual does not appear to envisage that legal representatives would be involved in assisting with applications for support or attending support interviews at the Directorate, and there is certainly no reference to the availability of public funds in this context. This again disregards the benefits to the system of asylum seekers obtaining timely legal advice. Their asylum case may have special features including the needs of children which would also be relevant to their application for support.
<P>
(ii) Those in emergency accommodation subsequently found ineligible for support may appeal against that decision but there will be no support pending the outcome of the appeal (paragraph 2.33).
<P>
(iii) It is intended that there should be no right of appeal to an adjudicator against the location of accommodation offered or other aspects of the support decision (paragraph 5.3).
<P>
(iv) Adjudicators will be able to hear cases where support has been denied or withdrawn at any stage and for any reason (paragraph 5.3). No support would be available pending the outcome of that appeal (paragraph 7.1). Nor would the appeal be supported by legal aid (paragraph 5.2), The Manual states that where free advice or representation is available, the asylum seeker may make use of this (paragraph 5.2). This acknowledges that legal advice has a role to play, but the Society believes that the voluntary sector or pro bono units would not be able to cope alone with the possible demand and should be complemented by the sometimes more specialist advice available from competent solicitors.
<P>
(v) Asylum seekers will be ineligible for support after their appeal rights before the immigration tribunal are exhausted. Support will not be provided pending an application for leave to apply for judicial review or during such proceedings even though the asylum seeker's legal remedies would not be exhausted (paragraph 7.5). The Society believes that this is a denial of natural justice in cases involving fundamental rights of the greatest importance to the individuals and families concerned by undermining the ability of asylum seekers to pursue their legal rights, and may breach 391 392 Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Judicial review is the mechanism for ensuring administrative decision making is subject to judicial oversight and as such provides a basic protection to all citizens and non-citizens affected by administrative decision making. The approach suggested in the Process Manual assumes that all decisions by the Home Office and appeal bodies are fully transparent, well-reasoned, consistent and defensible, but this will not always be the case.
<P>
There is no automatic right to judicial review, which is not pursued in every case. In addition, legal aid for an application for leave will be available only for those cases of public interest under the new Funding Code. It is difficult to go behind judicial statistics in respect of judicial review, but anecdotally the Society is aware that the Treasury solicitors, acting on behalf of the Home office or the Immigration Appellate Authority, commonly concede the matter before any hearing in those cases where it fears an adverse ruling. In such circumstances, an application for leave is either withdrawn or simply lapses and therefore a significant proportion of the applications officially recorded as having lapsed should be regarded as having been successful.
<P>
The Society suggests that paragraph 7.5 of the Process Manual be deleted. In addition, the Process Manual should provide that asylum seekers will be eligible for support pending any application for leave to apply for judicial review and during any such proceedings.
<P>
The enforcement powers of immigration officers (Power to arrest and search Part VII clauses 104 to 115)
<P>
43. The Society endorses the submissions which will be made by others in respect of the need for training and accountability structures for immigration officers; published guidelines on the exercise of their extended powers and an independent complaints body to investigate the misuse of immigration officers' powers.
<P>
44. In the Society's view, immigration officers should be subject to at least the same provisions as police officers through the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). For example, clause 117 permits immigration officers to use reasonable force when exercising any power under the Bill or the Immigration Act 1971, However, reasonable force must be used only if necessary by the police in exercising any power under PACE.
<P>
Detention Centres and detained persons (Part VIII clauses 118 to 128)
<P>
45. The Society endorses the submissions which will be made by others on the need for a regulated and accountable detention service.

Memorandum from the Law Society of Scotland
<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
The Society welcomes the efforts of the Government to reform and regulate certain aspects of Immigration and Asylum law. However, having examined the Bill, a number of the proposals give the Society cause for concern.
<P>
Part I--Immigration: General
<P>
The Society has the following issues to raise in relation to Part I of the Bill:]
<P>
Firstly, the Society is of the view that in a number of areas throughout the Bill access to justice may be restricted for vulnerable asylum seekers who do not have ready access to funds. This is apparent in Part I of the Bill which specifies that applications for leave to remain in the U.K. and variations of leave to enter or remain in the U.K. must be accompanied by a fee. There are to be regulations to provide for situations when no fee is to be payable but no indication is given of what those circumstances may be.
<P>
The Society is also concerned about the requirement for financial surety on entry clearance and extension of leave in Clauses 7 and 8. The demand for this surety appears to be based solely on doubts about a visitor's intention to leave. Many people could be adversely affected by the arbitrary nature of these provisions.
<P>
Whilst the Society accepts that the Government may be trying to control the costs of the immigration and asylum system by implementing these provisions, such control should not be at the expense of the interests of justice.
<P>
Secondly, the provisions in relation to the reporting of suspicious marriages also cause the Society some difficulty. Clause 15 states that marriage registrars have a "duty" to report to the Home Office any "reasonable grounds for suspecting that a marriage will be a sham marriage". A "sham marriage" is defined in Section 16(5)(b) as being a marriage (whether or not void) "entered into by (a person) for the purpose of avoiding the effect of one or more provisions of Immigration Law".
<P>
The assessment as to whether or not a marriage is sham is a subjective one. A decision could be affected by a lack of proper understanding of immigration law or the cultures and traditions of the parties involved. It is the opinion of the Society that Clause 15 as it presently stands could raise issues under the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
Thirdly, there may be a need for clarification of the position of legal advisors if the provisions set out in Clause 16 remain as currently drafted. Clause 16 creates the offence of deception. A legal advisor may either directly or indirectly from the client come into possession of information that the client has used some form of deception to obtain leave to enter or remain in the U.K. There is statistical information to suggest that a great many asylum seekers only make their claim after arrival and after they have had the benefit of obtaining legal advice. (R-v-Secretary of State for Social Security ex parte Re B & Joint Council for the Welfare of
 Immigrants 1997 I.W.L.R275). The legal advisor is then in the invidious position of advising a person who may, after entry to the U.K., be seeking to "avoid" enforcement action against himself by virtue of claiming asylum and by definition therefore potentially committing the offence of "deception". Questions then have to be asked as to whether the legal advisor is facilitating the commission of this offence.
<P>
It is perhaps unsurprising that asylum seekers do not make their claim on arrival at the point of entry when they have not had the opportunity to take legal advice. Indeed, there is force to the argument that there ought to be greater accessibility to legal advisers at the point of entry in order that people can be afforded adequate representation.
<P>
Part II--Carriers' Liability
<P>
The Society has no comments to make in regard to this part of the Bill.
<P>
Part III--Bail.
<P>
The proposals in Part III of the Bill relating to bail for those who are detained are also of concern to the Society. Although the proposals do make significant in-roads into the existing problems encountered in the present law regarding detention, they are not far reaching enough. A detainee can be held for a long period of time before being brought to court for bail. There is provision in the criminal law of Scotland for an accused person who is remanded in custody to be brought before a court on the next day when the court is sitting. However, a person detained under this Bill can be held at first instance for a period of 5 to 9 days. It is not appropriate that a detainee who is not accused of any crime and who may be in a vulnerable condition should be treated less favourably than those accused of crime.
<P>
Furthermore, the Society is opposed to the concept of money bail. In Scotland, where there has been a move away from money bail in criminal law, it is concerning that the payment of a monetary surety may be a condition of bail under the proposed scheme. The practical effect of this would be to deny liberty to people without access to such funds. It is submitted that there are sufficient other provisions in relation to bail, e.g. the imposition of reporting conditions, to make the possibility of absconding less likely.
<P>
Clause 33 represents a further potential threat to the liberty of someone actually released on bail. For, if an immigration officer or constable believes that the person released on bail is likely to breach a condition of the bail order, then he may arrest him without warrant. Although there is provision for him being brought before a court within 24 hours of such arrest, this is still a significant infringement on the person's liberty, especially as it is based solely on a suspicion.
<P>
Part IV--Appeals
<P>
The Society welcomes the proposal that those appealing against various orders are afforded the right to be legally represented. However, there is concern that there is no mention made of how that representation is to be funded. This concern is exacerbated when one considers that support will be withdrawn from the asylum seeker if he decides to take his case to judicial review. There must be doubt as to whether such a policy is compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>
The impact of this policy decision must be looked at in the context of the removal of the right of appeal against a deportation order. It may be that the removal of such appeal rights will lead to an increase in judicial review as being the only means of challenging the proper exercise of discretion by the secretary of State. However, whether or not judicial review will be a viable option for many people after support is withdrawn is debatable.
<P>
The plight of those who had overstayed their leave is made worse in the light of there being no appeal on the basis of compassionate and compelling factors or the strength of the overstayer's ties with the U.K. Appeals against removal would be restricted to alleged breaches of the 1951 Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human Rights. In many respects, therefore, the real issues behind these cases would not be capable of being raised on appeal.
<P>
Part V--Immigration Advisers and Immigration Service Providers
<P>
The Society welcomes the efforts of the Government to protect the public from unscrupulous advisers who operate within the immigration system. The Society also approves of the proposals for regulation of non-legally qualified advisers. There is, however, no evidence that in Scotland there is a substantial problem in relation to Immigration advisers. In particular, the public and the Tribunal system obtain a high quality service from Scottish solicitors, The service provided by solicitors is supported by an unrivalled range of consumer protections including professional indemnity insurance, an unlimited Guarantee Fund, and a rigorous complaints system.
<P>
Against this background, it is difficult to see the necessity of the complaints procedure or indeed the extensive powers afforded to the Commissioner in the terms proposed in the Bill. The need for the Commissioner to have the powers referred to in the Bill has not been justified. The rationale for the Commissioner to have such powers is difficult to see, especially where the remedy available to him, having investigated a complaint, is to refer to the relevant regulator.
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland has concerns about the wide powers available to the Commissioner, The Law Society of Scotland is particularly concerned that the Commissioner will have power to enter a solicitor's office and require the production of documents without first having to obtain a warrant or order of court authorising him to do so. There is no provision made in the Bill for any judicial examination of the substance and evidential weight of the information available to the Commissioner which forms the basis of the complaint. Therefore, the solicitor and the solicitors clients have no protection from situations where the Commissioner may be acting on insufficient or unreliable information.
<P>
The position is exacerbated by the power which the Commissioner has to delegate these matters to "such person as he may determine". Great care should be taken 395 396 to ensure that the duty of confidentiality is not overridden. The Law Society of Scotland accordingly proposes that items subject to legal privilege are excluded from the powers ofthe Commissioner.
<P>
It is noted that Clause 65 determines who is to be a designated professional body and how they are to be monitored. It also makes provision for a group licensing arrangement. The Society is concerned about the level of the fee which may be levied. There is concern that the legal profession as a whole will in effect have to subsidise the Commissioner where there are only relatively few solicitors who practise in this field in Scotland. In England in the year 1997/98, there were 87363 applications for advice and assistance made in relation to immigration and asylum cases compared with only 832 similar applications in Scotland from April 1998 until January 1999. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate has confirmed that none of the solicitors' firms which it had concerns about are based in Scotland. It is not apparent, therefore, why these fees should be payable, especially as solicitors in Scotland already pay subscriptions to maintain inter alia the Law Society of Scotland's disciplinary system under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. Accordingly, it is the Society's view that the Bill ought to be amended and reference to the payment of the specified fee be removed. If the fee is not removed completely, then at least provision should be made for Scottish solicitors to pay only a proportion of the proposed fee.
<P>
Consideration must be given to the fact a number of immigration and asylum cases are dealt with on a pro bono basis at present and the levying of this additional fee may make the provision of legal services in this area of law more problematic. Legal Aid and the ABWOR scheme are not available for tribunal work at present and the Advice and Assistance Scheme has limitations in terms of eligibility. The Society is of the view that there ought to be provision made for the extension of ABWOR to allow applicants to obtain legal representation. The Bill does nothing to address this situation.
<P>
There is also provision for each designated professional body to have its effectiveness reviewed by the Commissioner. If there is concern about a designated professional body failing to provide effective regulation of its members in this area of law, then the Secretary of State may remove the body from the designated list. The procedure for doing this is detailed in the Bill and reference is made to the fact that representations will be considered from the professional body. It is not specified in what form or indeed in what forum these representations would be made or who would represent all the facts to the Secretary of State. The Society has concerns that not all aspects of this solution in the context of devolution have been taken into account. Furthermore, no mention is made of any right of appeal from such an order.
<P>
Indeed, although this Clause makes provision for the compulsory removal of the designated professional body from the list, there is no comparable provision in relation to voluntary removal. The Society believes that the Bill should provide for this situation.
<H4><center>Part VI--Support for Asylum Seekers</center></H4>
<P>
Whilst the Society understands the reasons behind monitoring the provision of support to asylum seekers, it is concerned that the proposals may severely disadvantage those seeking asylum. The asylum seeker will effectively be deprived of the right to choose in what way the support is received and indeed, where he will ultimately stay. The asylum seeker could be removed from a community which already provides emotional support and placed where the Secretary of State deems appropriate, without any attempt to meet the asylum seeker's needs. With the advent of cluster areas, there must be concern that this vulnerable group will be located in one area without adequate legal or social support. The effect of this combined with the cashless system proposed could potentially have grave consequences in the areas of race relations and discrimination.
<H4><center>Part VII--Power to Arrest and Search.</center></H4>
<P>
The Society's concerns in relation to this Part of the Bill centred around the powers given to Justices of the Peace in Scotland to grant warrant to search and arrest under Clause 105 and to enter and search premises under Clause 107. Whilst the Society welcomes the fact that the Government has recognised the requirement of the protection of the warrant in these circumstances, it is the Society's view that the power to grant such warrants should only be extended to Sheriffs. Often a Justice of the Peace will not be legally qualified and may be unfamiliar with the criteria needed to grant such warrants. In the interests of justice, therefore, this matter ought to remain within the sole ambit of the Sheriff.
<P>
The Society understands that at present Immigration Officers must rely on police officers to assist them in performing various tasks in the enforcement of Immigration Law and that the need to reduce this dependency is the ethos behind extending the existing powers of arrest to them. However, the powers envisaged in the legislation are extremely wide and provision for training to be given to Immigration Officers in this field is obviously necessary.
<H4><center>Part VIll--Detention Centres and Detained Persons.</center></H4>
<P>
The Society has no comments to make.
<H4><center>Part IX--Registrar's Certificates: Procedure.</center></H4>
<P>
The Society has no comments to make.
<H4><center>Part X--Miscellaneous and Supplemental.</center></H4>
<P>
The Society has no comment to make.
<P>
The Law Society of Scotland will be preparing amendments together with a briefing note to address the issues raised in this memorandum.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The Division has taken 16 minutes. The Clerk advises me in his typically efficient manner that we can add that to the three hours allotted. Instead of finishing at 7 pm, we will finish at 7.16 pm.
<P>
I welcome you all to the Committee and we look forward to hearing your evidence. Will you introduce yourselves and we can then proceed straight to questions? As you know, we are not taking any opening statements.
<P>
<B>Ms Kamlesh Bahl (Law Society):</B> I am the Deputy Vice-President of the Law Society of England and Wales. I am accompanied by Ruth Bundey, who is a solicitor and chair of the Law Society's immigration law sub-committee. She is a very experienced practitioner in this field.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Dry (Law Society of Scotland):</B> I am President of the Law Society of Scotland and I am accompanied by Alastair Thornton who is the Vice-President Elect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Law Society is responsible for ensuring the propriety, quality and competence of its members in delivering services to people who have immigration and asylum problems. Is it satisfied that it is discharging those obligations to the highest quality and standards?
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> The Law Society has been taking leading-edge steps with respect to standards, and ensuring that standards are maintained in this context. I shall ask Ruth to talk a little about the initiatives that we have taken.
<P>
<B>Ms Ruth Bundey </B>(Law Society): The Immigration Law sub-committee has been absorbed in, if not obsessed with, weeding out abuse with the lack of diligent and scrupulous advisers in the profession. We have spent more than a year developing several initiatives, good practice guidelines--which are generally circulated--and our accreditation scheme, which is to be launched in April. We hope that the first tranche of accredited practitioners will be available and listed in July.
<P>
The sub-committee has also been concerned about the question of complaints, or lack of them, to the OSS. We have had many meetings with the OSS in the past 12 months. On our sub-committee are practitioners, many of whom have appeared before you previously, wearing various different hats, because the field in which we work involves a small interest group. As well as conducting meetings with the OSS we have reported wide-scale abuses to it--in particular a series of events at the asylum screening unit. We were dismayed that because those were generic complaints based on general intelligence and not related to individual clients' files, the OSS was prevented from taking pro-active measures as we should have wished. Instead, there was close liaison between that body and the Legal Aid Board, which finally resulted in interventions in two solicitors' firms that were becoming renowned for bad practice.
<P>
The main point is that we see clearly that the OSS cannot be a proper regulatory body of solicitors unless it has additional powers. Our president has written to the Home Secretary specifying what those powers should be--in particular the power to call for files where there is not necessarily an individual complainant. I hope that that would be enormously helpful, but our committee wants to keep a close eye on matters. We have asked the OSS--and it has agreed--to give us regular two-monthly reports, while preserving confidentiality, on exactly what kind of cases it is handling, and the outcomes. We want to monitor the situation and make sure that the profession is properly controlling abuse.
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> It may be helpful for the Committee to know that the powers that the Law Society seeks in England and Wales are already available to the Law Society of Scotland.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was going to ask Mr. Dry if he had a Scottish perspective to give us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> I was just going to say that we have those powers under section 33 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990. The Law Society has a duty to investigate any complaint made against a practitioner by an interested party. That could be the asylum seeker, the commissioner or the Law Society itself. We have extensive powers to call for files, and we find that very useful, so I support Kamlesh in that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Can I assume that the relevant powers have now been transferred to the Scottish Parliament?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Is not your accreditation scheme, which is aimed at tackling lack of competency in immigration and asylum advice, voluntary? Will lawyers who are not part of it and who do not display the relevant competence still be allowed by the Law Society to practice and give advice in immigration and asylum cases?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> It is a voluntary scheme and we cannot prevent solicitors from continuing to practice if they are not accredited. However, we hope that the less competent will, in a sense, be driven out by all sorts of factors. First, there will be publicity for those who have the accreditation, and information about that will circulate in the profession. We have liaised with the Legal Aid Board on this subject. It is prepared--we hope--to accept our accredited practitioners as being of supervisory standard in the higher standards involved in franchising.
<P>
Such matters are interrelated, and it is right to say that the Legal Aid Board has serious concerns about access to quality providers, and is making specific arrangements on block contracting that have yet to be published.
<H4>6.15 pm</H4>
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> It is also a fact that under the Access to Justice Bill, those who wish to practice in this area and get an exclusive contract will have to meet standards. Therefore, there will be a compulsory form.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> But that will be only if they want legal aid. Lawyers in private practice can charge vulnerable clients high fees.
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> Yes, but a compulsory and mandatory requirement will be introduced, and it will be based on the accreditation standards and guidelines developed by the Law Society.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Gerrard, I promised that you could ask initial questions on this matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> First, may I ask the Law Society about legal aid? Your evidence suggests far-reaching changes and extensions to the legal aid system in relation to immigration cases. What is the reason for that?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> Our starting point is that we want the new system to work. There are two strands running through the proposals to minimise delays, tighten focus in appeals and root out incompetence and those who insist on abusing the system. It has already been said that the quality of initial decision-making is vital. I would add that equally vital is the quality of the initial response to the decision, which may be a refusal. The question of legal aid all the way through to representation comes in at this point.
<P>
As we heard, there is a huge responsibility to get it right. Under clause 55, the onus is on setting out one's stall--that is, everything that will be considered at a later stage. That, in addition to expecting asylum seekers to articulate every aspect of their claim, demands legal representation at the initial stage. At the moment, such representation is only available courtesy of green-form legal advice and assistance.
<P>
A person assisting at the initial stage who is going to see the matter all the way through to representation is under pressure to ask: "Are these grounds sustainable in an argument that I am prepared to put forward at a hearing?"
<P>
Extending legal aid involves all kinds of checks and balances. If legal aid is to be available from the beginning until representation, that would not be an automatic right in every case. There would still be strict merits test and, hopefully, the professional integrity of the adviser. That integrity would apply if there were no arguable grounds to serve a notice, so the solicitor would have to decline to act as there would be no way forward.
<P>
Good-quality representation--legally aided at appropriate stages--will save time and money and will help the speed and efficiency of the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alistair Thornton </B>(Law Society of Scotland): In general terms, the Law Society of Scotland supports the extension of legal aid to tribunals.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise to the Committee, as I must suspend the sitting again, for fifteen minutes. However, I assure Members and witnesses that we are getting injury time, so it would be as well to phone up and change dinner appointments. Our two Scottish visitors may have to change their flight bookings.
<P>
<H5>6.18 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>6.31 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Division took 12 minutes, which means that we will finish at 7.28 pm--unless there are further Divisions. I hope suitable flight arrangements have been made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thornton:</B> I was saying that the Law Society of Scotland generally supports the extension of legal aid to tribunals. However, regarding immigration and asylum seekers, it is important for the Committee to appreciate the very different scale of the situation in Scotland as opposed to the rest of the United Kingdom. As we set out in our memorandum of evidence, in Scotland in the course of a year there are only a few hundred applications for advice and assistance compared with an equivalent figure of some 87,000 in England and Wales. That sets in context the cost factor that would apply to Scotland as opposed to the rest of the UK.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May we return to the cost factor and how it matches with legal aid budgets in the English context? You suggested extending legal aid to support applications to the Asylum Support Directorate.
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> No. I suggested extending it to representation before adjudicators in the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> In your evidence, you draw attention to the process manual and suggest that legal representation could be involved in assisting with applications for support. No reference to public funds is made in that context. You also suggest that legal aid should be provided for appeals to support adjudicators.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Bundey:</B> That is right. I am sorry. We do indeed and we also make a specific point about bail applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> May I turn to bail? You made a point that was also made by one of the earlier witnesses about non-legally qualified representatives attending bail hearings. You say that the Committee might wish to consider whether hearings are to be public. Are you suggesting that hearings should or should not be public?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> We come down on the side that hearings certainly should be public. It causes a difficulty, mentioned by ILPA as well, whereby advisers who are not legally qualified, yet are experienced practitioners will not, unless something is done about the situation, have the right of audience to make applications in the magistrates court. They will have the right to make applications in chambers--for example, in the Crown Court--but not otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerrard:</B> Forgive my ignorance of the way in which the law in Scotland operates, but youi talked secifically about money bail and said that you were concerned about it. I assume that that that has changed in Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> We have moved away in Scotland from money bail into other methods. Mr. Thornton may wish to speak on this.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thornton:</B> Yes. There are usually conditions laid down rather than the availability of any money security. Those conditions may involve residence and staying with a responsible person.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> May I take you back to some of the earlier comments made about the control of legal advisers? You expressed some confidence in the reputation of legal aid and professional integrity. Now as consituency Members of Parliament, we are faced week after week by people who have been appallingly advised--given shoddy advice --by qualified lawyers. Yet I understand that you have closed down only two firms.
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> I am afraid that the OSS has often been presented with evidence that appears on scrutiny to be either anecdotal or not to be associated with particular clients and particular cases. That has been the enormous difficulty in the past in trying to do anything about particular firms. Equally, the Home office produced a list with details of abusive advisers or solicitors but when asked to provide the evidence, again could not do so. It is a catch-22 situation. We want the OSS to act properly. We want them to be pro-active and to have power. We would he delighted if Members of Parliament who have these dreadful cases coming to their surgeries would make complaints when it seems that many are emanating from the same firm of solicitors. We want to root that out, but we cannot do that without the information.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Have you considered being just a tiny bit more pro-active in this and suggesting ways in which to gather evidence that may he more useful for you in taking action?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> Yes. The suggestions that have been made to the Home Secretary have asked for specific further powers for the OSS. I have dealt at length with getting away from the individual client complaint and being able to ask for files where there is general information about a firm's behaviour. We have also asked for costs to be awarded against solicitors where there is misconduct, which is not the case at the moment. We have also asked for powers to further inspect solicitors' office account money, as opposed to client account money, which is the only thing that can be inspected at the moment and for powers over para-legals who work in solicitors offices, over whom the OSS has no control. I feel that the OSS should work closely with the commissioner when he or she is appointed and make sure that the same powers are available, both within the professions and within the Government regulatory body to do exactly the same thing. Otherwise everything will be a nonsense.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> I should remember this but, do the extra powers you require relate only to immigration work or to all your functions in the OSS? Also, how long does it take to investigate a firm?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> The powers that are being sought are general wider powers for the OSS in all sorts of areas but the thrust behind our asking for them is specifically our concern over immigration which has really come to fore.
<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> On average, how long does it take to investigate a firm, from the time of the first complaint to reaching a decision?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> I do not know. That is something about which the legal services ombudsman is concerned. I expect there will be a report in the near future. I spoke about our wish to monitor, and the time scale is certainly high on the agenda.
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> On the complaints issue it depends on the severity of the complaint. If it is a case of gross dishonesty or fraud, it has priority within the OSS. If it is a case of inadequate professional conduct, it is an area where I would be the first to say that the legal profession is having considerable difficulty. That is where the majority of the backlog of complaints-comes from.
<P>
Adding to what Ruth Bundey has just said, on our own initiative we are working now in partnership with the Legal Aid Board to try to plug the gap, temporarily I hope, while the Home Office considers giving those additional powers so that wherever information is available it can be transferred to the OSS. The other point is that the OSS powers are triggered by a complaint. By virtue of its nature, this is not an area that people complain about themselves. The individuals concerned may not be in the country to make the complaint.
<P>
This sounds ironic but we have been trying to encourage a culture of complaint in terms of saying, "Let us get that investigated too". We believe that it will be a combination of those additional powers, plus the standards that will be extremely important in tackling this. The Law Society is totally committed to addressing this area and ensuring the best standards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Some of what we have just heard is quite worrying. Many Members of Parliament feel that the worst cases are those of constituents who pay with their own money rather than through legal aid and are given very bad advice. It seems in some ways that those with the weakest cases will be those with the worst advisers because people with a better adviser would have been told that they did not have a case and would have gone down the tree. With the Bill as it is, and without a change in the powers, you cannot guarantee that that sort of solicitor will not continue to practice. If that is a fair reading, I wonder whether, in Scotland, you are able to say that, with the extra powers, you have been able to get such solicitors out of the trade thereby stopping our constituents from consulting them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> The scale of the problem, as Alastair Thornton said, is very much smaller in Scotland, as we have had many fewer applications. We have had only two complaints about solicitors in relation to immigration matters in the past 10 years: these were for inadequate professional service and were not substantiated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> On the Scottish point and the business about bail, you said in your submission that in Scotland a person is entitled in law to a bail hearing the next day if he has committed a criminal offence, and you are concerned that the Bill specifies five to nine days for people who have not committed any offence. Is it your view that there should be a separate Scottish provision in the Bill to enable the bail hearing to be at least comparable to that for people held on criminal charges?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thornton:</B> If that is the way of achieving an equivalent result, yes. I should not like to say that it is the only way of achieving that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> But it is the equivalence that you feel is important?
<P>
<B>Mr. Thornton:</B> Yes, it is the lack of equivalence that concerns us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I ask Ms Bahl whether the Law Society agrees that speedy and final determination of asylum applications is a proper objective of Government policy?
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> If that is right, where in the Law Society's submissions is there anything that would add to the speed or finality of procedures either presently in use, or proposed by the Government?
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> I support the answer given by the ILPA to the same question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> With respect, ILPA did not give me an answer.
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> We are not against the process of a faster system that you are trying to achieve. My answer is--and we consider that this is a legitimate issue for the Law Society to raise--that the system created should be fair, and those are the points on which we have raised concerns. We are not against the Government's principle, but we say that there are certain safeguards that need to be built in to ensure that the system that you create will be fair to all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> On legal aid, again, I appreciate why the ILPA is focusing only on immigration issues, but you have a wider remit. If we are to extend legal aid to the 10 additional types of hearings proposed in paragraph 12 of your submission, what do we cut in a cash-limited legal aid budget, from United Kingdom citizens who pay taxes to support legal aid, to extend services in that area?
<P>
<B>Miss Bundy:</B> One thing that we--and the Legal Aid Board, with our help--will have to cut out, is fraud, because I am afraid that investigations into two firms recently showed that a vast sum was being claimed for work that had not been done. We have suggested to the LAB that, just as in other areas of work such as crime, where bills above a particular sum, or, for example, on the higher standard fee basis, are submitted, it is customary to send in one's file of papers so that the LAB can check what has been done, and that it has all been properly accounted for.
<P>
The past difficulty under the legal aid advice and assistance scheme was that the LAB properly has clear criteria under which you may request and get an extension of x hours, depending on the type of work you have to do. At present, having got that extension, all that is done at the end of the case is sending in the bill. There is no check on the quantity, never mind the quality, of work. We think that huge savings could be made there.
<P>
The cost of representation in these specific areas is not necessarily enormous. We are talking about hearings before the adjudicators where, at the moment, we have authority to go along--in a sense, the worst possible world--with a Mackenzie adviser, which means that you are not allowed to represent someone, but you can whisper in their ear to try to tell them what to do at any given moment. The difference in cost between that and appearing under the assistance by way of representation scheme is £10 an hour.
<P>
In global terms, and in terms of the efficiency of the hearings--to go back to your earlier point about trying to speed up the process and be more efficient and effective--I honestly think that that might be £10 well spent.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lock:</B> May I clarify? Your view of the Law Society is that there is extensive fraud by its members on the Legal Aid Board, and you believe that it is the Government's job to sort it out, but if that is your view, surely it is the job of an independent self-regulating profession to sort itself out.
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> No. You may have misinterpreted what Ruth said. The legal aid budget has grown in two years from £29 million to £35 million. It is on target this year to hit £50 million. There is an element of abuse in that budget and many of the cases mentioned by members of the Committee are the subject of abuse. I should also say that there are some very competent legal practitioners who operate in the field of immigration and asylum. I would hate to leave the Committee with the impression that all those practitioners are involved in defrauding the system.
<P>
The Legal Aid Board has one and a half fraud investigators for the whole of the London area--for all areas of law and for all firms. We think that there is scope for the Legal Aid Board, which is responsible for the allocation and distribution of the money, to ensure that the system works and the money is properly dispensed.
<P>
You asked where we thought savings could be made. We believe that that is one area where they could be made. Another area is the projected costs of the legal services commissioner and the Legal Aid Board, which have been rising over a period of time and are projected to rise again this year. Perhaps we could look also at costs there. We would be happy to sit down with the Government and look at projected savings in the legal aid budget because a cost benefit analysis of the provision of proper legal representation in this area will help to achieve the Government's target of a speedy and fair resolution of complaints. It would probably be more effective.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you. We could return rather more closely to the Bill now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> On appeals, do you agree that in general terms complexity is the enemy of a fast determination? Some of the Bill's provisions for high-quality advice are complex.
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> Indeed. The applicant will need steering through the system by experienced people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If the right safeguards are not in place, that could generate additional legal challenges under another form of appeal--judicial review, human rights or whatever. It would generate extra cost and delay.
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Could I take both the Law Society of Scotland and the Law Society to a specific part of the Bill, which we have not yet addressed? I refer to the new duty of registrars to report suspicious marriages. I know that the Law Society of Scotland has some views on that. You should have received a copy of the guidance to be sent to registrars. Would you share with us your reaction to that, and any concerns that you might have about the impact of the new provision?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> I should say first of all that we have not seen it yet and I do not think that it applies to Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We were given to understand that it had been sent out. This is the guidance for registrars to report suspicious marriages and it covers circumstances in which registrars might feel that a marriage was suspicious. Have you not received it?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> It was received in the office today and I am afraid that some of us have travelled from all directions: I have not yet had a chance to read that document. We are very interested in it and, if we may, we would like to give a written response by Monday or whenever we can.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Are you concerned that the provisions need to be culturally sensitive to avoid discrimination?
<P>
<B>Ms Bahl:</B> May I raise a general point for the information of the Committee? The Government have made a commitment to look at the impact of equality in all bail law provisions or policy. It is called the mainstreaming guidelines. I for one would be very interested to see the analysis of the Bill's impact on equality published. It would be helpful to understand whether not just that provision but other provisions in the Bill, particularly following the Macpherson report into the Stephen Lawrence case, will have some culturally sensitive implications.
<P>
It would be very helpful if the Government would also publish their analysis of the Bill's impact in relation to the European convention on human rights. That would enable a more informed discussion and debate about the issues that have been raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Has the Law Society of Scotland anything to add?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> I just adopt what Kamlesh said. I understand that the document was received in Edinburgh today but we have not had a chance to see it ourselves.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We would be very interested to receive a response on the matter, and any proposed amendments that you think would be appropriate to avoid the pitfalls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> We will write to you as soon as possible.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East): The Law Society of Scotland draws attention to provisions in part I of the Bill in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"access to justice may be restricted for vulnerable asylum seekers who do not have ready access to funds."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Yesterday, we were considering in evidence the different categories of asylum seeker. Most people agreed that the most deserving category of asylum seeker is those who are fleeing in fear of their lives, or at least their liberty. Surely they would be the least likely to have access to funds of any sort for access to justice. Which parts of the Bill do you regard as most dangerous in this respect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dry:</B> The payment of fees and the provision of sureties concern us, as people coming from the sort of background that you envisage would not have any funds. That is our position.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do you have anything more to add?
<P>
<B>Ms Bundey:</B> As has been said, this must be most crucial to the asylum seeker--the person fleeing. We have concerns about visitor appeals; we appreciate that the suggestion of funding has come from many constituents who would like the chance to put up funds to enable their visitors to come. We are concerned, however, that there will be one law for the rich and one for the poor. The point you made, about this being much more germane to the asylum seeker situation is absolutely right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you very much indeed. I thank you for coming and for your forbearance in putting up with the strange customs of the House of Commons. If I had my way, the hon. Members would simply have sat here and voted by pressing a button, but not everyone is as modern as I am. I hope you catch your planes and trains to wherever you are going.

The witnesses withdrew.
<H4><center>Memorandum from the Refugee Working Party</center></H4>
<H4><center>Introduction</center></H4>
<P>
The Refugee Working Party consists of 51 London based refugee community organisations funded, or part funded, by the London Boroughs Grants. Established in 1986, the RWP is the longest existing forum for refugee community organisations. It works closely with the lead refugee agencies and faith communities, plays an important role in the development of policy on refugee issues and is a key channel of communication between the refugee community organisations (RCOs), the agencies and the statutory and voluntary sector. Refugee community organisations are set up and constituted by refugees to provide services and support for their own community. They provide a front line service for asylum seekers and refugees in the UK; in addition they work to address the long-term settlement needs of refugees in the UK.
<P>
Main issues of concern
<P>
1. Pre entry controls:
<P>
Strengthening of the Carriers' Liability Act
Visa sanctions
Airline Liaison Officials
<P>
We are deeply alarmed at the emphasis on pre-entry controls. These proposals effectively set up an external frontier by creating a UK immigration control in the country of origin. They will prevent people from boarding planes, documents and visas will be checked with increasing rigour and it will be impossible for many Recommendations:
<P>
 by Vulnerable groups such as families, the elderly and the disabled should be exempted from the new arrangements and be maintained by mainstream support such as benefits.
<P>
 by Access to support arrangements should not be seen as a safety net system. It should be means tested and not based on arbitrary assumptions about available community or family support.
<P>
4. Detention
<P>
 by We have a fundamental objection to the use of detention for people who have not committed a crime.
<P>
 by We are concerned that asylum seekers will be detained for an indefinite period of time.
<P>
 by In relation to any bail hearing we think there should be a presumption in favour of liberty, as there is for those charged with a criminal offence.
<P>
 by There should be no detention of vulnerable groups such as victims of torture. Assessments of vulnerable should be made by independent experts.
<P>
 by Unaccompanied children should never be detained and where there is uncertainty there should be a presumption in favour of the claimant. Independent experts should conduct age assessments.
<P>
 by Families and children should not be detained.
<P>
 by Alternatives to detention should be considered, for example reporting restrictions.
<P>
 by We welcome the intention to move away from the use of prisons but have concerns about the intention to expand the detention facility overall.
<P>
 by We have severe concerns about the staffing of detention centres.
<P>
 by We welcome the fact that people will be given written reasons for detention but want assurances that they be related to the individual and not "standardised".
<P>
5. Increased Powers to Immigration Officers
<P>
We are extremely concerned about this proposal. The immigration service is not publicly accountable to any body, unlike the police who are answerable to the police complaint authority. In our experience many immigration officers are already "heavy handed" when carrying out their duties. We are concerned that some immigration officers may regard this as a licence to overstep the mark still further and that this will be very damaging to race relations. Giving IO's the power to stop and search is a serious infringement of civil liberties.
<P>
Mr. Fazil Kawani, Chair, Refugee Working Party, called in and examined.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Kawani, thank you very much for attending. You are almost the only witness to appear on your own, and we are grateful to you for coming. As you know, we are not asking for opening statements but it would be useful if you would explain who you are and where you come from.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fazil Kawani </B>(Refugee Working Party): I thank you for inviting me to give evidence. I represent refugee community organisations in London and I hope that members of the Committee understand that if sometimes I sound as if I am against people becoming a refugee it is simply because of the painful experience of having been one myself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> You are the only person to come before the Committee who is a refugee. It would be useful for us to know about your experience because we will be considering what impact the Bill will have on people like yourself.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I still believe that the majority of asylum seekers arriving in this and other European countries are here because they have been persecuted. There are, of course, a small number of asylum seekers who have been told by agents that life is better in Europe, but the majority are people who flee persecution and oppression in different parts of the world.
<P>
What I feel sad about is the perception in the White Paper and in the Bill that cash is the pull factor--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Forgive me, but I want to know the experience of an asylum seeker going through the system. Perhaps you could say where you come from, why you were persecuted and what happened to you when you moved through the system, which we will discuss in our consideration of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I am a Kurd from Iraq. I came here because my life was in danger at the hands of Iraqi security forces. I came here when I was very young. I was persecuted because as a young student I was very active in a student movement campaigning for human rights in Iraq. The authorities in Iraq did not like that and that is why I had to flee.
<P>
The system then was much different from the system now because all the asylum seekers then were entitled to benefits like every other British citizen, which was much fairer than the system now.
<P>
As you know, since 5 February 1996, some asylum seekers--those who apply in country--are not entitled to benefits, although the provision is provided by local authorities. I am sure many people support me in saying that it is a very degrading and sad fact of life. Many asylum seekers are not even bothered to approach social services to apply; it is simply because it is very degrading--
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to be difficult, Mr. Kawani. You will have the opportunity to deal with these issues in questions from other people. I have some specific questions: first, when did you come to the United Kingdom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I came to the UK in 1979.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> How quickly were you recognised as a refugee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I applied for asylum in 1987 although I stayed in the country for seven or eight years without going back to my country. I was supported by my father who was very rich so I did not have any problems applying for social security. I did not apply for asylum because I wanted to go back to my country but the situation changed and changed and in 1987 Saddam used chemical weapons and killed thousands of people. It was impossible for me to stay any longer so I applied for asylum.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> When were you recognised as a refugee?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> It took the Home Office 18 months to consider my application and at that time I worked as an engineer with Barking and Dagenham council. I paid tax as well. I had to wait for 18 months and I was very worried about getting a negative decision. I had many sleepless nights; I was worried when I opened my mail in the morning.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Was the Home Office's decision positive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> It was exceptional leave to remain, although I had a very strong case.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Did you subsequently get refugee status?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> How long afterwards?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Just one year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> We want to hear about your personal experience. However, I understand that you also represent a number of refugee and asylum seeker groups.
<P>
It is crucial to consider the pull factor when examining the support system. Do you think that the people you know will be more likely to apply for asylum if there is a cash system or if there is a voucher system? If we bring in the Bill's all-voucher system, will the numbers claiming asylum drop?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I will go back to 1995 or 1996. Yesterday, the Minister made a strong argument for decreasing the numbers from 44,000 to 28,000. The main reason that numbers dropped is not because people were no longer entitled to benefits but because many of those advising refugees and asylum seekers told them not to come to this country. The Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 was well publicised abroad, and we all produced newsletters telling people that British law would be changed.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the majority of asylum seekers applied to Germany, Holland and other European countries. I personally advised hundreds of asylum seekers who phoned from abroad not to come to Britain. That does not mean that they came here for cash. We simply could not afford to look after them. Knowing that the changes would be difficult for everyone, we had to advise them not to come.
<P>
Numbers dropped from 44,000 to 28,000, as at least 50 per cent. of asylum seekers had knowledge of the changes prior to coming to this country. That knowledge came from contacts with friends, communities and hearing the news from outside. British asylum changes featured in many foreign television programmes, especially Turkish ones.
<P>
Since then, the numbers have increased from 28,000 to 34,000. Last year, they grew to 46,000. The first year after the introduction of the measure, the numbers will probably drop to somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000. Eventually, however, the figure will rise to 40,000 or 46,000 again. That will definitely happen.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> So there is not a big difference between a cash system and the voucher system that has been established. In 1996, the deterrent was the fear that there would be nothing at all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I do not think so. I have talked to many British people living on income support. They accept that people do not travel thousands of miles to get income support. A single person receives about £40 a week. As we all know, it is impossible for an individual to live on £40 a week, so income support by itself is not a pull factor.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> The Bill's support arrangements have given rise to concern. Those arrangements are the total removal of benefit and the dispersal proposal. That proposal is about making people go out of London and other areas to communities that might not be willing to accept them. Will you comment on that proposal and how it will work in practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I am worried about the relationship between host communities and asylum seekers. Yesterday, while I was here, a member of our community was attacked in Kent. He was told that refugee and asylum seekers have already occupied London, and are now trying to occupy Kent.
<P>
Asylum seekers will be welcome in some parts of the country, but not in others, as you know. If asylum seekers are dispersed to every village, town and city, many of them will be isolated, lonely and homesick. However, if they are dispersed to cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff, they will probably not be isolated because there are small communities there, and ethnic minorities. Many will face racial discrimination.
<P>
<B>Ms Abbott:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> I want to ask about dispersal, Mr. Kawani, and take you on a little from that answer. Most answers to questions about dispersal have related to the possible outcome for refugees in the places to which they are dispersed. However, in your written evidence, you introduce a new angle to some of the other evidence that we have heard. You say that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It will also limit access to specialist services such as language provision, legal support and counselling for torture victims."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Can you say a little more about what they will lack and the problems that they may encounter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> At present, we have many of our community's asylum seekers or refugees phoning us from Manchester to make an appointment to see a solicitor in London. They have to come all the way from the north to see a solicitor to give them advice. There is a lack of asylum and immigration advisers in most parts of the country except London. Also, there is an understanding in the help service of the needs of asylum seekers and ethnic minorities in London, but there is most probably a lack of understanding in the north. Some London local authorities are already dispersing asylum seekers outside Londonon. Every day we get very many calls from schools and hospitals which have problems communicating with individual asylum seekers, and we have to spend a lot of time interpreting. Most people are willing to help them, but the problem is a lack of understanding and communication, and this is only a very small-scale dispersal. My worry is that next year it will be on a very much larger scale and the problems will be even greater.
<P>
<B>Mr. Faber:</B> Looking at it from the other side, the London boroughs might say that the necessity was to improve the services on offer in other parts of the country, and that dispersal was inevitable. So is it not that services should be improved elsewhere?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I agree. I have no doubt that there is a lot of pressure on local authorities and health authorities in London, but it is preferable for refugees rather than asylum seekers who have just arrived in the country to be dispersed because people such as I and refugees who have been here for a few years can communicate and understand the culture of this society, whereas new asylum seekers are very isolated. Those from European countries such as Kosovo and Bosnia do not even have a community in this country.

<P>

<B>Mr. Faber:</B> You also make the point that if people voluntarily leave the placement they have been given, they effectively fall out of the system and the safety net. You say that organisations such as yours will be left to pick up the pieces. How do you envisage that happening?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> My worry is that if the system becomes hard on asylum seekers--if the conditions of accommodation are very bad, if there is no cash whatever because at present it is cashless--the majority will, I assume, come back to London if they are greatly isolated, and the voluntary sector, the London boroughs and the refugee community organisations will have to pick up the pieces. We will go back to post 5 February 1996 when many asylum seekers slept in church halls and mosques in London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Henderson:</B> What are your views on the present legal support and advisory system for asylum seekers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Do you mean in London?
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Overall--for assistance on seeking asylum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Most of the legal advisers are based in London. Many community organisations such as mine also give limited advice and refer clients to firms of solicitors and organisations such as IAS and RLC. Obviously, if asylum seekers have been sent outside London, they have to come back to get legal advice. If the Home Office makes a decision within two months--and I see no reason why it should send asylum seekers outside London for only two months. They have to come back to London for interviews and for advice. If the intention is to integrate asylum seekers, it is wrong to make sure that they stay outside London because the majority will come back to London. They put pressure on London local authorities again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> I was trying to ask whether you believe that the present system of legal support is effective for asylum seekers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> There are some very bad legal representatives who take on many asylum seekers every week and simply ask them to sign a green form. A few weeks later they abandon the case. They do not follow it up. Every year they take on thousands of clients and make good money. That is not to say that all legal representatives behave like that. There are some very good legal representatives too. It depends on luck whether you get the right person to advise or represent you. Very often asylum seekers do not know where to turn because they lack information about the country and their legal rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Do you have any views about how that could be improved?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> There should be a limit to the number of asylum seekers that every firm or legal representative could take on per week or per year. If they take on thousands of clients they will not be able to provide a good service.
<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis:</B> I have three questions. Do you agree that the primary purpose of granting asylum is to save people who are at risk of losing their lives or liberty?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Yes, I do.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Your life was at risk when you came here. Would it have deterred you from coming here if you had been informed over the telephone of the sort of things you say you have been informing people about which have resulted in people not coming here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> When I had to flee because the Iraqi security forces went to my house and searched all my documents, I had to run and hide in my friend's house. At that time, cash was the last thing on my mind.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> That is precisely my point. If people are at risk of losing their lives or their liberty, they will not be deterred. So what happened to the thousands who were deterred at least for a short period after the last lot of restrictions? Does not that suggest that the only people who will be deterred are those who are trying to come here not to preserve their lives or freedom?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Can you repeat the question?
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Yes. Given that someone whose life or liberty is at risk will be desperate to come here, irrespective of whether something is inconvenient or degrading, what happened to all those people who you say were deterred from coming here previously when you had to advise them by telephone not to come because of various problems here? Does not the fact that they 415 416 were deterred from coming here suggest that they did not fall into the main category for which asylum is really there, namely people whose lives and liberty were at risk? The mere fact that they were deterred suggests that their lives and liberty were not at risk or they would not have been deterred by such inconveniences, unpleasant though they might be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> The people I talked about did not come to this country, but went to other countries. That is why the number of asylum seekers rose last year and the year before in Holland, Scandinavia and Germany. The fact that they did not come to this country does not mean that they stayed where they were. They simply went to other European countries to apply for asylum.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> So if their lives had really been at risk and they did not have that option, they would still have come here?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> If they had the choice of going to another country where the conditions of life were much better, of course they would go there, but the fact that I was not thinking about cash at that time does not mean that if people are advised not to come to the UK, they will not change their minds and go to another country. I was prepared to change my mind and come to this country. If your life is at risk, the last thing you think about is cash. You simply want to flee.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis:</B> Exactly. So you accept that people whose lives were really at risk would not be deterred and thus put their lives in danger. It is just that they might choose somewhere where there are more benefits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I do not agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gwyn Prosser </B>(Dover): You have raised your concerns about the proposals to disperse and you have explained the problems of lack of support. Other witnesses have expressed worries about putting asylum seekers into areas where the local communities are not used to different cultures. We have also heard a lot about clusters and the effect that large proportions of asylum seekers, or visitors from any other area, can have on small communities.

You have probably heard some of the stories from Dover, my constituency. I am not proud of some of them and I am ashamed of some of the press coverage, but that is for another day. In 1996-97 apart from being a big ferry port our only statistic was that we had the smallest ethnic minority communities in the country--0.6 per cent. We also have areas of deprivation and near poverty and we have high demands on housing which cannot at present be met. Because of the changes made in 1996 we found ourselves over a period of months with 300, 400 and then 600 and 700 asylum seekers, initially mostly from the Czech Republic. That had an enormous social impact.
<P>
In terms of the Dover story and other parts of Kent, do you agree that it is reasonable to consider dispersing those large concentrations, if only to reduce the numbers in a small area. The area I have described is just the sort of area where you would not want to implant asylum seekers because there is no culture, experience or history of receiving visitors, although millions pass through every year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> We have to create a condition in which asylum seekers can go to those areas too, but at present the Home Office is relaxed about creating such conditions. That is why I am worried about it. Of course, if there are 700 or 800 asylum seekers in one place in Dover, I can understand the backlash against them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> The reality is that if we could ease the numbers and then ease the tensions on housing we could take away many of the myths and alleviate the unhappiness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> I very much agree with you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> In those circumstances, if we were careful in the way we did it, there would be a good case for dispersal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> It depends how the Home Office would manage the dispersal and how they would disperse people within the dispersal areas. Would they send a particular nationality to one city or would they send different nationalities to different places? Many factors will be involved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> There were no support systems in place in Dover. There was a migrant helpline but that was purely for transient visitors. The happy experience is that those support groups started to evolve through voluntary organisations and through people in the community who wanted to help. Now it could almost be said that we have something of a support regime in place. Can we transplant that into areas where there is surplus housing stock and where local authorities are in a better position to receive large numbers of visitors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> One of the main reasons for negative publicity in the press in areas such as Dover is simply that asylum seekers are not entitled to benefit, accommodation or money. Local people do not like asylum seekers because they believe that the local authority is spending a lot of money offering hostels for asylum seekers. That is the main reason for the negative publicity about them in certain areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> How would we overcome that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Provision should be made by the national Government--it is a national issue. My worry is that a cashless system will be similar to the National Assistance Act 1948. Some of the negative publicity will continue when the new support arrangements come into effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Prosser:</B> So you support the element in the Bill which transfers and moves resources from local government to the national Government through the Home Office?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Sure, because there is a lot of pressure on London local authorities. We find it very difficult to find any accommodation for asylum seekers because they are not entitled to housing from local authorities and they cannot afford to pay privately.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> I have two points and I hope that we have time to deal with them briefly. First, I want to ask you about pre-entry controls and, secondly, about your deep concerns over increased powers for immigration officers in the absence of a body such as the independent Police Complaints Authority. It sounded like you wanted an independent immigration complaints authority.
<P>
Which of the Bill's provisions on pre-entry controls cause you most concern? How could the Bill be amended to make it easier for asylum seekers and refugees to reach the UK?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Very often visa restrictions are imposed on the countries from which many asylum seekers come. I would be very much against visa restrictions on countries in which there is a violation of human rights. One example would be Columbia last year, when many asylum seekers arrived in this country, but a few weeks later visa restrictions were imposed.
<P>
Stationing more airline liaison officers in countries from which asylum seekers come is another issue. Many people have a well-founded fear of persecution. They will be unable to seek asylum in this country, so they will be detained and refused asylum. Yet, as I said, the majority of these people's fears of persecution will be well founded.
<P>
Carriers, liability is another issue. A few months ago, a member of our community was killed in Dover. There was a lorry accident and I am sure that the lorry driver feels very guilty. For the past three months, I have been trying to raise £3,000 from individual community members in order to send his body back to his family. The reason why this man lost his life is simply because of the carriers' liability. The lorry driver did not even know that the man was under the lorry. Those kinds of measures deter people from coming here and seeking asylum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclean:</B> On the increased powers granted by the Bill to immigration officers, you suggested in your evidence that you are extremely concerned. You suggest that some immigration officers may be, in your words, heavy-handed and also that you would like an organisation similar to the Police Complaints Authority to investigate allegations against those officers. Will you elaborate briefly on your concerns about this matter and say how great they are?
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> Very often now, police officers go with immigration officers to check hostels where asylum seekers live. I remember that last year we had someone from Africa who was doing a work placement in our centre. One morning she came to work very nervous and frightened. She said to me that at six o'clock in the morning--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Division Bell is ringinge. We will have two more minutes and then adjourn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Kawani:</B> The woman was very frightened. People had knocked on the doors of three women, two from Russia and one from Africa. They had to wake them at six o'clock in the morning just to find out who lived in that place. My worry is about giving powers. Often people try to abuse them. It is very important that immigration officers are accountable to an independent complaint authority like the Police Complaints Authority.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you very much, Mr. Kawani. I am sorry that we have to cut your time, but it is only a few minutes.
<P>
The witness withdrew.
<P>
Adjourned till Thursday 18 March at Three o'clock.
