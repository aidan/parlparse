<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. We are discussing clause 14, which raises significant issues. On the surface it seems to be a relatively technical clause, allowing enforcement of the regulations, but it gives rise to serious matters that should give the Committee pause for thought.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Before my hon. Friend starts what I am sure will be an outstanding oration, it would be courteous if we were all to offer a warm welcome to you, Mr. Atkinson. I am sure that my hon. Friend, who is a most courteous individual, will want to do just that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I shall repeat what I said. I have already welcomed you, Mr. Atkinson; under instruction from my hon. Friend, I do so again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, being a new Member and thus comparatively inexperienced in such matters, is under a misconception. I believe that it is still Tuesday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for reminding me that, for the Committee at least, it is late at night on Tuesday.
<P>
The point about clause 14 that the Committee should consider, and on which we require a series of reassurances from the Minister, is that the imposition of a minimum wage might affect people's basic liberties. The Opposition fully recognise that some sort of enforcement will be necessary and that enforcement officers will therefore be needed. It is important that the Committee should recognise the seriousness of the steps being taken under clause 14, which deals with the powers of enforcement officers.
<P>
Clause 14 creates a new set of law officers with extremely wide-ranging powers. Given this country's traditions, it is important that we should not regard the change as merely technical; it is worthy of the most serious consideration. It can be argued that there are already at least enough, if not too many, people with enforcement powers.
<P>
Clause 14 will create an entirely new class of enforcement officers, who will potentially have access to every business premise and home. They will not only cover employees working in a conventional work force; the notes on clauses explicitly state that officers will have enforcement powers over home workers, piece workers and the many other classes of worker that we have mentioned.
<P>
The Bill particularly affects home workers and among the powers of those officers is the power to demand records and to interview people in person. It is therefore extremely likely that they will want access to people's homes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My hon. Friend is starting to conjure up a worrying image. Does he agree that it is, to say the least, unfortunate that although clause 14 has a whole page on the powers of enforcement officers, I see nothing in it to protect people against the abuse of that power? That is a most serious worry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is indeed; I propose to discuss that later.
<P>
We all recognise that enforcement officers should have proper powers to deal with bad or rogue employers. No one would dispute that there should be a means of enforcing the law. I hope that nothing I say suggests people should be able to evade the law. Nevertheless, I invite the Minister and Labour Members to consider that if they create a new class of enforcement officer, the extensive powers may become oppressive in the wrong hands or if there are insufficient controls.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend makes an important point about the powers being in the wrong hands. At this stage we do not know into whose hands those powers will be put. Has he any confidence in giving such powers to persons or bodies as yet unidentified?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that. Yes, I am extremely disturbed. It is accepted in other parts of the Bill that the Government can do things the economic effect of which they do not yet know because, in other parts of the jungle, the matter is being considered by the Low Pay Commission. That is bad enough, but we accept that it is the principal purpose of the Bill and it was discussed on Second Reading. However, the powers of enforcement officers were not debated on Second Reading, and they have been passed by in all public comments so far. To my knowledge, they have not been mentioned in submissions to the Low Pay Commission. It seems not to have occurred to anyone until now that there might be a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This part of the Bill gives me great cause for concern. The mere words "enforcement officer" will bring terror into the hearts of many engaged in small business and commerce. I wonder whether my hon. Friend, who is very knowledgeable on the subject, knows about enforcement practices in the United States, a country prayed in aid of the Bill many times by the Government?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> The United States, like many countries, has separate police forces. Italy has six, some of which are responsible for specifically business-related crime. I remember some of the disastrous effects of misjudgment by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in the United States. My hon. Friend makes a good point; experience in other countries suggests that we should cling to our policing model and not seek to create new classes of Government employee with intrusive powers to interview people, to demand to see[Mr. Green]
records, and to enter their homes and business premises. The Government have decided to create another class of enforcement officers; Parliament should scrutinise their enforcement powers carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend might be interested to learn from my personal experience. It is the practice in Italy for Ministry of Labour inspectors to arrive at a company's premises to inspect the employment records accompanied by armed and uniformed Polizia Fiscale who effectively seal the building while the inspection takes place. We must avoid such heavy-handed methods here. They would be quite alien to our culture.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. Not only is it alien to our culture, but the creation of an entirely new class of potentially intrusive enforcement officers may, if it falls into the wrong hands or is not properly supervised, directly affect the business community. It might also have a spin-off effect on the respect that the general public have for the existing forces of law and order.
<P>
My hon. Friend painted a picture of what happens in Italy. I would hate it ever to happen in Britain. It is not clear whether enforcement officers for the minimum wage will be working under the President of the Board of Trade or whether they will have to be escorted by policemen, armed or not, but the sight of British policemen engaged in such activity would greatly damage the image of the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend concede that it is particularly worrying that we know from the President of the Board of Trade's occupation of a grace-and-favour residence in Admiralty house that security considerations surround her person? That Department, great as it is, is far from being a comparatively safe place; working for it will become a highly critical and security-related activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It will become much more so if the right hon. Lady is seen as a super-policewoman 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have the slight difficulty of trying to discover what the President of the Board of Trade's personal security has to do with clause 14 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was about to say what it has to do with clause stand part, Mr. Atkinson. As my hon. Friend said, it is not one of the more controversial, high-profile Departments of State, but because it is setting up an enforcement agency with the power to force itself into every business and home in the country, it is possible that the office of the President of the Board of Trade may require more personal security. Because that potentially dangerous new enforcement power is being created out of nothing, parliamentary scrutiny is more important in relation to clause 14 than to some of the central economic clauses of the Bill. We are talking about the liberty of the subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Although my hon. Friend is talking about scrutiny, I fear that we have no idea yet of the interplay between the various bodies that might use those powers. The immediate question is whether Customs and Excise officers or Inland Revenue inspectors would have concurrent powers in relation to tax and employment records. The relationship of many companies with Customs and Excise or the Inland Revenue is fraught enough as it is, without them feeling that, under the Bill, they will have to expose additional records for different purposes, which may be read across in the hands of one person.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes a significant point. It adds to what I said about the police service being brought into disrepute if it has to ride shotgun at the shoulder of the new minimum wage enforcement police. Customs and Excise and VAT officers and others may become even more unpopular with business people than they already are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I understand why my hon. Friend is concerned about the use to which existing officers might be put. Is there not another danger of which my hon. Friend will, in his perceptive way, also be aware that because the officers will not be identified, we might witness a whole new category of professionally unqualified people, who might even have a long-standing anti-business track record that they wish to continue into their new activity?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely good point. One would hope that that will not happen. I was indeed going to ask the Minister for reassurance about the recruitment and training of enforcement officers because if new ones have to be appointed, my hon. Friend is right that people with a grudge against a specific business or business generally might be taken on. They may try to creep under the wire, knowing that the creation of the new enforcement powers may give them to put it crudely a badge that will enable them to become someone's worst nightmare. I hope that the Minister can give us full assurances that those responsible for recruitment will be careful to ensure that such people are not given those quasi-police powers.
<P>
The point about scrutiny is illustrated well by the financial memorandum. In this instance, parliamentary scrutiny ought to be as careful and detailed as possible but the financial memorandum renders that impossible by stating that:
"Operational details as to who enforces the National Minimum Wage have yet to be decided."<P>

<P>
That is not good enough. The Government are blithely telling us in Committee that the details about who will enforce the minimum wage, a class of people who will have enormous, intrusive, quasi-police powers, have not yet been decided.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend because the paragraph of the financial and explanatory memorandum to which he refers prays in aid the fact that the choice of enforcement route may depend on the rate that is set and the exclusions. Will my hon. Friend comment on my supposition that the enforcement route probably does not depend a great deal on the rate that is set or the exclusions we know that the exclusions will be modest and that Ministers are hiding behind the fact that they have simply not made a decision, in the context of a Bill in which they hide behind the skirts of the Low Pay Commission? The Low Pay Commission plays no part in the matter. The Government could have made that clear in the Bill but failed to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. The Government could admit that the higher the minimum wage, the more businesses will be affected the assumption in their own financial memorandum is that the higher it is, the more businesses will seek to avoid it. They are therefore effectively saying that if they set too high a level, they will potentially criminalise thousands of businesses in this country, as well as people who regard themselves as honest business men, who in the vast majority of cases will have had no brush with the law or the tax authorities. The Government's own financial memorandum clearly admits that the Government may criminalise thousands of currently innocent people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that most of the cases that arise under the legislation will be cases at the margin, perhaps where there is disagreement about how benefits in kind are to be treated or where one element of remuneration we do not know which one because we do not yet know which elements are to be included and which are to be excluded has not been properly calculated in determining where the minimum wage should be set?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is an extremely relevant point because we will not be talking about situations such as a drugs bust, where enforcement agents can enter premises and find, or fail to find, something criminal. The minimum wage enforcement officers may well be forcing their way into premises where they are not wanted and looking at financial records that will probably not state whether any offence has been committed. So it is extremely likely that more cases than those of other law enforcement agencies will fall into the category of a grey area in which it is not clear whether a criminal offence has been committed. The business involved certainly will not be clear about whether it is engaged in criminal activity. The failure rate the intrusion rate on the innocent is therefore likely to be much higher in that enforcement agency than in any other. Again, that will create resentment and, no doubt, word of what is happening will get around the business community. The situation could rapidly descend into a vicious spiral in which the reputation of the enforcement officers is blackened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Does my hon. Friend foresee difficult circumstances in which Ministers may choose to use an enforcement route such as the Inland Revenue? By virtue of Ministers' resistance to our amendment proposing that taxable emoluments be treated as a basis for calculating the national minimum wage, two inspectors could examine the self same information and make different judgments about whether it should be included in taxable pay or the national minimum wage. For many employers, the system will become incomprehensible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed. The financial memorandum states:
"The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to arrange for existing officers working for a Government Department or other Government body to carry out the enforcement of the National Minimum Wage".<P>

<P>
Revenue officers, therefore, may well have a dual purpose and may find that, according to one set of criteria, no offence has been committed, while according to another, one has been both of which judgments would be controversial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman seems to be labouring the point about the proposal being radical, draconian and unacceptable. He is implying that it will constitute a police state. In fact, the clause is modelled on sections 23 and 24 of the Wages Act 1986, which was piloted through the House by the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), the then Paymaster General and Minister for Employment; Nigel Lawson, the then Chancellor; Douglas Hurd, the then Home Secretary: Malcolm Rifkind, the then Secretary of State for Scotland; Paul Channon, the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; and David Trippier, the then Under-Secretary of State for Employment. It is another example of this Government incorporating legislation, which was introduced and tested by the previous Administration, into new legislation. The previous Government believed that the legislation was workable and enforceable. If it was good enough for them, it is good enough for us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is a completely different situation because, as we are constantly reminded, potentially the national minimum wage will have to be enforced on every business in the country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Does my hon. Friend recall that the Institute of Directors has said that it is surprised and disappointed that the proposals for enforcement seem so draconian that they will inevitably increase the burdens on business, particularly small business? It is the reaction of business that matters, not the opinion of the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> That is indeed so although both are involved. The Minister is keen to foster good relations between his Government and business and such reactions from the Institute of Directors should, if he reflects sensibly, give him pause. He may wonder whether he is over-reaching himself by taking all those powers, but apart from my worries about civil liberties and the effect on relations between perfectly honest businesses and the law enforcement agencies, an interesting and unanswered set of questions arise about the cost and the financing of the new enforcement agency.
<P>
According to my reading of the explanatory and financial memorandum, the money will not be disaggregated. Will the Minister tell us how much it will cost? I accept that the Government cannot say exactly how much it will be, because they do not know how many staff will be needed, whether they will need to employ new staff or whether existing staff can double up on some jobs. That will depend on the rate at which the minimum wage is set.
[Mr. Green]
<P>
It beggars belief that the Department has not made some costings based on the minimum wage likely to be set by the Low Pay Commission. It will be a small but substantial chunk of public money. It would help if the Minister told the Committee what the range will be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is generous in giving way. One consequence of the introduction of self-assessment is that the Inland Revenue Staff Federation has seen a considerable reduction in the number of Revenue staff. My hon. Friend might want to speculate on whether the federation would look a little askance at the idea of staff being taken by the new inspectorate. It may wonder whether Ministers would have been wiser to act more swiftly and bring those two processes closer together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Or Ministers should at least have planned ahead. It would not then seem that the right and the left hand in Whitehall were each unaware of what the other was doing. We are told that it is impossible to calculate the cost of the new agency, but the activity at the Table leads one to believe that it is possible that the figures may be available.
<P>
One of the key reassurances that I seek from the Minister this morning technically it is still yesterday evening is who is funding the agency. Will the Minister give a cast-iron assurance that none of the costs of that extra enforcement will flow back to business? It will be extremely tempting for the Government to dump as much of the cost as they can on the businesses that will be regulated, as they have with the Food Standards Agency.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge reminded the Committee that many of the business organisations represented by the Institute of Directors want to be reassured that they will not have to bear the cost of the extra enforcement, which many of them would find intrusive and unpopular. I hope that the Minister will give us those assurances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Would it not be curious if the position described by my hon. Friend were true? If it were, businessmen would be paying a tax for the doubtful privilege of being subjected to a thoroughgoing interrogation. What an extraordinary state of affairs for a free country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> It is an extraordinary state of affairs, but it is about to happen with the Food Standards Agency. Good and reputable food processing companies are to pay for an agency that will, at the margin, make their life more difficult and, I am sure, making it unnecessarily difficult, because that is how such things work.
<P>
I am entirely in favour of law enforcement. If this wretched Bill passes into law, as I assume that it will, it should be enforced. However, the Government have not thought about the consequences of the enforcement measures that they are imposing.
<P>
One factor not mentioned in the Bill, or in the notes on clauses or in any of the helpful bits of paper that the Government are handing out, is the appeal mechanism. I seek an assurance from the Minister on that, because many aspects of it could affect millions of businesses and business people. If the Government do not get it right at the start, they could create more resentment about that than about any other factor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not merely a matter of political resentment? It is essential that the Government are seen to secure natural justice.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Green:</B> Candidly, I am not interested in the Government's relations with small businesses; it is up to them if they want to make a mess of things. More to the point, small businesses want to be left alone as far as possible so that they can get on with their job. I can envisage a reputable, well operated small business being visited by a slightly over-intrusive enforcement officer every law enforcement agency has one. The business will say that it is doing nothing wrong and will want to know how quickly the case will be heard, and if the case is going wrong, it will want to know how quickly a decision can be appealed against and what are the appeal procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I confess to not having studied the clause in detail, but as my hon. Friend speaks I am becoming more familiar with it. Am I right to say that what is proposed will turn conventional practice on its head, in that the accused will be presumed guilty until he proves himself innocent? When enforcement notices are served, employers will be presumed to have committed an offence. It will be up to them to appeal and prove their innocence. That is an outrageous perversion of the traditions of English justice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> If that is the case, my hon. Friend is right but we should be fair to the Government and not condemn them until we have heard the Minister's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I share my hon. Friend's wish not to condemn the Government unheard, but I am sure that in his perusal of the Bill he will have spotted that clause 26 explicitly reverses the burden of proof in some cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I was going to mention that. I was hoping that the Minister would assure us that businesses inspected by his new law enforcement agency would not be treated as guilty until proved innocent. However, the way in which investigations are carried out could make businessmen feel guilty, even if they are not charged with anything. Even if they are never to be charged, it is particularly important that the investigations are carried out sensitively, fairly and quickly. For a small business to have a potential criminal action hanging over it could affect the businessman personally; it could distract him so much that the business could be severely damaged.
<P>
If low-paid workers are working for a business that does not have good cash flow, some of them may lose their jobs as a result of the enforcement agency's mounting an investigation. It would be a most appalling paradox if Ministers' woolly thinking about enforcement led them inadvertently to stumble into causing the low-paid to lose their jobs.
<P>
Quite apart from the speed of investigations, which is important, there is also the question of transparency. Any business being investigated by the agency needs to know clearly what the procedures are, who the bosses are and who to telephone. It is a classic example of open government being necessary. Again, nothing in the Bill or in any of the background papers suggests that Ministers have considered that transparency might be a problem, let alone that they have thought of a solution. I invite the Minister to give the Committee some reassurances on that score.
<P>
I now move on to the appeal mechanism. In some cases there will be genuine doubt and the Department may decide that it is not sensible to take a case to court, which would be expensive and, unless the Lord Chancellor has abolished legal aid altogether, increase the legal aid bill something else that the Government do not want to happen. They may consider implementing a low-cost appeals mechanism or a tribunal to keep away from the full might and expense of the law. Again, I invite the Minister to comment on the potential for independence [Interruption.] I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry back to the Committee. I can foresee some weighty speeches later this morning.
<P>
I invite the Minister to consider setting up a special, cheap, quick and independent appeals mechanism. I am sure that the Minister would not want his Department to be associated with a legal process that worked against the interests of businesses, which the Department exists to sponsor and to help flourish.
<P>
An appeal or hearing mechanism set up in the wake of an investigation by officers empowered under clause 14 should, as far as possible, be private. For many businesses, reputation is extremely important. Entirely innocent businesses may sometimes be visited by enforcement officers, and a case may drag on. If it is public, that business could lose its reputation, lose business and, as a result, need to shed workers. I cannot believe that that is an intended consequence, so I put it to the Minister that clause 14 could have quite dangerous effects.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> By way of illustration of the danger outlined by my hon. Friend, does he agree that the mere hint that someone is under investigation by the Inland Revenue is enough to cast serious aspersions on his good character and fitness for office?
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I cannot think which Treasury Minister my hon. Friend is thinking of. The reputations of people who may be innocent of the charges laid against them until we know the full facts of a charge, it is impossible definitively to say whether someone is innocent can be quickly and seriously damaged. What applies to Ministers also applies to businesses.
<P>
The Inland Revenue has a decent reputation of keeping its investigations reasonably private. Nothing in the clause suggests that any thought has been given by Ministers to privacy. The legal powers needed to enforce the law should be drafted in such a way that officers will be enjoined to make privacy one of their principle aims, so as to avoid inadvertent damage to the innocent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> Given that there will always be over-zealous officers, who will abuse their position no matter how strict the code of conduct under which they are supposed to operate may be, it is essential that the Bill should contain a right of redress, and a means by which businesses in the situation described by my hon. Friend can secure it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Elegantly, as ever, my hon. Friend makes my next point for me. The next assurance that I seek from the Minister is that he will consider some sort of redress. Can he guarantee that redress will be swiftly available, perhaps by tabling an amendment, by promising secondary legislation or by issuing guidelines to enforcement officers?
<P>
In his intervention, my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham raised the possibility of compensation. No mention is made in the Bill or the supporting material of a mechanism to provide compensation for businesses visited by enforcement officers, who will have used all the powers vested in them under clause 14. Those business men may have had their lives and businesses turned upside down for many weeks and, because of a lack of safeguards, it may have been publicly blazed around that they were under investigation. Their reputations would be severely damaged. At present, it is not possible for them to gain redress, unless they go for the full force of the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am currently advancing the case of a near constituent, who lost his business as a result of police actions, in circumstances that I do not wish to share with the Committee. It is open to him to seek recompense, and I have helped him to apply to the Home Office for restitution for the losses that he suffered from what he regards as a wrongful arrest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Indeed; I am sure that many hon. Members have similar cases in their constituencies. These incidents tragedies for those involved do happen. Under this laxly drafted clause the possibility is that they will happen much more often.
<P>
The practical point that I wanted to make was that no sensible business person, especially the small business man, would want to take the Government to court. It would be time consuming and they would know that an agency of the state could always afford good lawyers. However, they will want and will deserve, if they have been treated badly because of the powers granted to the enforcement officers a cheap and cheerful form of redress and compensation. The Government should give urgent consideration to that matter, especially if they want to maintain a good reputation among business people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I want to emphasise that point. The fact that clause 14 relates to the remedies that are available for those who are not paid the national minimum wage does not arise spontaneously as one looks at the Bill. It looks as though it were a civil offence, or a civil remedy in relation to the person who is underpaid. Clause 28 permits the enforcement power to be used when an offence has been committed, which would be a criminal offence by employers if they behaved wilfully in any of the ways detailed in the provisions. Does my hon. Friend agree that this runs[Mr. Lansley]
counter to the view expressed by the CBI? Its evidence to the Low Pay Commission stated:
"Non compliance with the minimum wage legislation should be a civil rather than a criminal offence."
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> Yes, my hon. Friend's interesting remarks relate to the point that I was making that many businesses would be used to the civil law. They would be able to balance sensibly the advantages or disadvantages of taking on court cases, such as the enforcement of debts. They would certainly not want any involvement with the criminal law. I respect the views of the CBI and think that it is correct in this matter. However, civil action against a Government agency would not seem an attractive option, especially for small business although it would obviously be a more attractive option than a criminal case. However, I suspect that they would not take such civil action and that they would just harbour resentment. I am not considering only the attitude of small businesses; in this case, the businesses involved would deserve a better remedy.
<P>
In conclusion, I ask the Government not to regard clause 14 as a small, technical clause. Even if they have based its drafting on previous legislation, they are opening up a Pandora's box. As, presumably, they do not want to bring the whole issue of the minimum wage into disrepute, they should think much harder about the matters that I have mentioned the powers of the enforcement officers; the costs; whether any of the costs will be borne by businesses; the appeal mechanisms; redress and compensation. Those are important issues. In two or three years, time, when the Minister wonders what went wrong with his Government's relations with small businesses, he will not want to look back on the Bill and to conclude that it was one of the things that most contributed to the decline in popularity of his Government among small businesses which I am sure will happen. The Government are rather thoughtlessly blundering into imposing a regime on small businesses, through the clause, that they did not intend and that small businesses will not welcome.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford has amply illustrated some of the problems in clause 14. I shall mention a few more at the risk of prolonging an already interesting debate, which has given rise to many more concerns than we expected. That is the nature of these debates when one encounters an obstacle one finds that others are littered around it.
<P>
I am struck by the fact that, once again, Ministers are hiding behind their failure to specify how the Bill will work. The Minister said in an intervention that the Bill is modelled on the structure of the Wages Acts and the enforcement activities of the wages inspectorate, but why did he not simply say that enforcement will be conducted by the inspectorate? Why did he not say, as the Confederation of British Industry said in its perfectly proper suggestion in its evidence to the Low Pay Commission, that the Contributions Agency should undertake enforcement?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I hesitate to assist the hon. Gentleman in talking for the sake of it, but the previous Government abolished the wages inspectorate it does not exist.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> The Minister is helpful, as always. His suggestion that I am speaking for the sake of it seems harsh; I have only just begun to speak.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I will make a little progress before giving way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
By way of illustration, I was informing the Minister that suggestions have been made on how enforcement could be undertaken. The Minister might correct me again if he wishes, but it might have been more advantageous to have more detailed notes on clauses good as they are, they are not comprehensive. It might have been advantageous if the Minister had made it clear by what process Ministers will take the decision on enforcement procedures and powers.
<P>
In this case, it might be a good idea if the Low Pay Commission takes evidence and sets out how the powers will be used because, with respect to Ministers, even on the Low Pay Commission there are those who have some understanding of industry at least, I hope so and can respond to the representations of industry.
<P>
In debating clause 13, Ministers made it clear that they would not subcontract any enforcement activity to private sector agencies or bodies not directly employed by the Crown. However, many industries might say that avenues are available through which the powers, especially those relating to a civil offence, can be enforced other than through Government agencies. Ministers do not want to do that; it never occurs to them to consider private sector agencies or, indeed, intermediary bodies that have relationships with business. For example, business links often have everyday relationships with small businesses and might provide a perfectly viable route to deal with such matters.
<P>
I do not want to revert to the point about the position of the President of the Board of Trade, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ashford referred. However, in the same vein, the Deparment of Trade and Industry must deal with such matters carefully. Over time, employers have become accustomed to a belief that there are different cultures in different parts of Government. Business perceives there to be tax-collecting parts of Government, with which, we hope, it has a professional relationship, albeit a somewhat adversarial relationship. But with the Deparment of Trade and Industry, business seeks a partnership I am sure that the Minister would fully endorse that.
<P>
I will not elaborate on this point, but I remember that when I was at the Deparment of Trade and Industry, we had an enforcement role over radio communications. I simply observe what changes have taken place during the past 11 or 12 years, from the point when we were sending inspectors to close radio stations to the point where the Department is going around the country trying to help radio stations to open.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> My hon. Friend is developing an interesting point about the need to avoid conflict wherever possible. Is not the logical conclusion of his argument that the function of managing the implementation and enforcement of the minimum wage regardless of from which agency the officers in the field come should be separated from the Department of Trade and Industry in a stand-alone body? That would allow the DTI to avoid getting itself into an adversarial relationship with businesses, which it is seeking to sponsor and foster.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> Yes, and there is a further reason for doing exactly what my hon. Friend suggests. That would mean that enforcement and use of the powers would be vested in an agency that did not bring the Department of Trade and Industry into conflict with business that would be to the Department's advantage because it would ensure that the partnership created between business and the DTI during recent years could be sustained. There is also a great danger when a body that is the enforcement agency is also the body that, through the medium of the Secretary of State, is taking decisions about the structure and application of the minimum wage as a whole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I shall just finish this point, and then I will certainly give way to my hon. Friend.
<P>
I remember that the DTI was responsible for policy on regional development grants, before they were abolished I remember that they were abolished; the Minister will not have to correct my memory on that. At the same time, the Department had a policy of driving towards simplification, reduction of burdens, reduced record keeping and minimum bureaucracy. However, because it was also the enforcement agency, the Department found that in framing regulations it felt for reasons of prudence and audit that it had to try to cover every angle and account for every eventuality. I fear that if the Department is also the enforcement agency, the enforcement tendency to cover every eventuality will predominate over the proper DTI attitude to try to make regulation work with the least possible overall bureaucracy.
<P>
In its evidence, the CBI states:
"Employers want the least intrusive, least bureaucratic and litigious system of enforcement possible."<P>

<P>
That is precisely what I would aim for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Green:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way in the middle of developing his interesting argument which, again, I suspect that the Government have not thought about. Has he considered that the extra and more widely spread enforcement powers will be exercised over a huge group of businesses especially small businesses, which are precisely those that the DTI is trying to involve in training and enterprise councils, and so on, and wants to give grants to and encourage? The effect of that will be to drive those businesses away from contact with the DTI. They will be suspicious that the enforcement agency may be too intrusive; they will be less likely to provide DTI-sponsored places or contact DTI grant-giving bodies that might actually do them some good.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend is right; this is one of several instances in which under the Bill the DTI may find itself appearing to be facing two ways in relation to businesses. For example, as we know only too well, the President of the Board of Trade may make a speech about the desirability of flexibility in labour markets, while at the same time introducing legislation designed to impose rigidity in labour markets. No doubt before too long the Department will have a deregulation initiative. Many businesses will say, "That is very interesting, but at the same time you have an enforcement agency that will require us to count hours worked, report in relation to pay reference periods that are not our normal pay structure" and so on. If we are not careful, we may be setting up in the clause an excessively burdensome structure of powers which will hinder the DTI.
<P>
One or two specifics concern me that were not referred to by my hon. Friends or previous speakers. Two or three items in the clause immediately give one a sense that these powers seem to relate to a criminal offence, whereas the intention should be, so far as possible, to treat any offence as essentially a civil matter. Indeed, a subsequent clause refers to it as a normal contractual right. The Government are trying to structure the Bill as if it were simply the enforcement through this agency of a normal employment contract. In a sense, later in the Bill these are criminal offences that put employers at risk. The powers that are to be used, such as in relation to entry to premises and not being required to give information that might incriminate one, are clearly designed to be used by the Government to deal with criminal offences rather than by an agency in the enforcement of a civil obligation.
<P>
I am no lawyer, so I may trespass into error here, but I believe it would be better to structure the clause so that it provides for an agency that would help individuals those who should be in receipt of the national minimum wage but who, for whatever reason, are not to secure their contractual rights. That seems to be the implied structure of the Bill. However, the clause seems to include enforcement powers for a Government agency that will explore whether people who are wilfully trying to avoid or evade the terms of the national minimum wage are involved in criminal activity.
<P>
I have two further points. The first is in relation to section 17 enforcement notices, to which clause 14(1)(c) refers. There are two problems with that paragraph. First, there seems to be no requirement in it for the officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State to have satisfied himself that a person upon whom the enforcement notice has been served has had reasonable time to comply with the notice. It should be clear that there should be both reasonable time to comply and reasonable grounds to believe that the notice is not being complied with.
<P>
I also wonder this is purely a drafting point whether it is necessary for the paragraph to say that the officer must acquire information
"reasonably needed in order to establish whether this Act, or any enforcement notice under section 17 below, is being or has been complied with."<P>

<P>
If it said "to establish whether this Act is being or has been complied with", by definition that would include subsequent or subsidiary requirements under the Act. Why it is necessary to specify section 17 I do not know.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My hon. Friend is making a powerful case broadly in defence of civil liberties on the part of the employer. Clearly there is a balance to strike. It may be appropriate for me to comment further on section 17 as I have been doing some research on it. Will my hon. Friend add to his list of provisions that it would be reasonable to provide, in the context of powers of officers, an understanding that persons likely to be affected by the notice or by entering should have reasonable opportunities to make representations to the officer as to the reasonableness of the proposed course of action?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because that is desirable and it further reinforces my argument, although I had not thought of that aspect.
<P>
I am not a parliamentary draftsman, although I have had some experience of drafting legislation. However, it seems a pity that we are called on to debate in clause 14 the structure of powers that are to be provided for officers to enforce the national minimum wage, when some of the principal respects in which those powers are to be used relate to subsequent clauses. For example, we have referred to clause 17 enforcement notices and there are references in clause 28 to some of the specific offences that might arise in relation to those who wilfully or otherwise fail to meet their obligations under the national minimum wage. The structure of the Bill should be such that the requirement laid upon persons and employers, their obligations and the offences that might be committed are set out first. Then we could look at the appropriate powers for officers in pursuing those requirements.
<P>
There is a curious situation here. We looked at record keeping and then we arrived at powers, and the powers provided in clause 14 about record keping seem excessive. However, they may not be excessive if we conclude in debates on subsequent clauses that criminal offences might arise from the Bill and that enforcement powers, including entry to premises, must therefore be applied, requiring people to attend at certain places and so on. It would be better to debate those powers and what is to be provided to officers in that respect after we know what they are being asked to enforce.
<P>
I know that I tend to harp on [Hon. Members: "No!"] No, indeed, that is rare, but I shall do it one more time. I tend to harp on about the way in which business, almost intuitively, feels about the way that the Government relate to it. I shall use an analogy. Just as people feel that their street is often dug up for one utility only to be dug up shortly afterwards by another utility to lay a different pipe or undertake different work, many businesess feel that bureaucracy in the form of tax collectors, health and safety operatives, factory inspectors and so on, comes along at different times to ask for complementary or duplicate information.
<P>
As the Minister elucidates further on how the enforcement powers are to be used and which officers are to use them, perhaps he could clarify the ways in which bureaucracy could make sure that people do not visit businesses excessively and that, when such visits are necessary, they are conducted in the most user-friendly manner possible. People should not obtain information for one purpose and then use it for another. Only information that is needed should be acquired and businesses should be in no doubt that the information for which they are asked is not excessive or duplicatory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> Good morning, Mr. Atkinson. I apologise that I was not here when you took the Chair.
<P>
I listened carefully to the contributions. If it was not for some ludicrous suggestions, I might have taken them more seriously. Some synthetic concern has been expressed.
<P>
It is outrageous to talk about armed police terrorising small and medium-sized companies so that they pay the minimum wage and about police officers being brought from Italy to train the Metropolitan police in strong-arm tactics. As such lurid pictures were painted, the Committee realised that Opposition Members were not being serious. They made no serious attempt to deal with the issue. The reason for that, of course, is that they are on the side of bad employers, of employers who want to undercut other employers, of employers who want to operate in the informal economy and of employers who wilfully and negligently refuse to meet their legal obligations. It is only such employers who need to fear, if that is the right word, their obligation to implement the proposals or the introduction of enforcement officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The Minister has expressed rather synthetic concern about my hon. Friends' alleged support for rogue employers. Does he concede that clause 16 which we shall consider in a moment may pave the way for consideration of illegal contracts? Such contracts involve people who pay in improper ways to evade tax, and have never been accepted as legal contracts until now. Such contracts seem to be facilitated by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> When we reach clause 16, we shall discuss it. Let us try to get through clause 14.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman painted a lurid picture of gun-toting officers rampaging around the United Kingdom on behalf of the President of the Board of Trade. He then shifted to talk about draconian measures that are somehow unique, have never been considered before and are part and parcel of an attack on business.
<P>
In the notes on clauses and in my interventions I made it absolutely clear that the proposals are modelled on the previous Government's enforcement proposals in the Wages Act 1986. Opposition Members cannot dodge that. That is true in the concept and the principle of appointed enforcement officers and in relation to offences.
<P>
However, there is one significant difference. Under the previous Government all employers were fined for accidental non-payment. There was no get-out clause. If employers accidentally did not comply with the legislation they were fined up to level 3. Under this Bill, we shall improve that. The only people who will suffer a potential fine are those who deliberately do not pay, who wilfully attempt to circumvent their legal obligations. The previous Government put unnecessary burdens on employers by fining them when such non-payment was clearly an accident. We have removed that draconian measure from the Wages Act 1986, and have improved with the position with this Bill.
<P>
Failing to keep records, making or producing false records, obstructing an officer and refusing to answer relevant questions were all included in the Wages Act 1986. The Bill faithfully follows the proposals in the 1986 Act. It does that not only because the proposals were set out effectively, but because they had been accepted by employers. There is nothing new for employers in this part of the Bill. They have been operating under such provisions since 1986.
<P>
The synthetic anger of the hon. Member for Daventry is just an excuse for continuing the Tory objection to giving the lowest-paid people in society an entitlement to a national minimum wage.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also attacked good employers. One of the most important influences on our enforcement proposals has been employers' insistence over the past three years that enforcement must be effective. Cowboys must not be able to damage the capacity of good employers to pay the minimum wage and undermine the labour market by failing to meet their obligations.
<P>
Enforcement officers will give an opportunity to seek redress if the minimum wage is not paid, and employers will be able to act against competitors who refuse to comply with the law by adopting anti-competitive low-pay policies. Our enforcement proposals are friendly and will ensure effective introduction of the minimum wage.
<P>
Clause 13 sets out the Secretary of State's ability to appoint officers to enforce the minimum wage. That can be done in two ways through existing agencies or by an alternative one, and we are discussing those options. We want to make sure that the Government are able to implement decisons effectively. We have no qualms about our proposals. They are pro the good employer and pro the employee.
<P>
The basis of the Bill is partnership in the workplace. Employers will not be badly treated by anti-competitive low-pay policies and there will be economic justice for low-paid workers who have never had the capacity to ensure that they are paid a proper rate. We make no apology for including powers to deal with unscrupulous employers. We are asking employers to produce relevant records; to explain them; to give additional information such as the number on their payroll and when people joined their company; and to agree to attend an interview to discuss those matters. None of that is new. Employers have to do all that for the Inland Revenue and the agency responsible for national insurance contributions. Employers should retain such information anyway. If they do not, why not? Why not keep records of wages, national insurance contributions, Inland Revenue contributions and so on?
<P>
The Conservatives are not on the side of the angels here, but of those who systematically refuse to meet minimum standards in the workplace or work on the margins of the informal economy to the detriment of their work forces. We will not allow that, and that is why clause 14 must be retained.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I know that the Minister holds heartfelt views on the minimum wage. He expresses himself with a passion that I respect. However, the Bill contains powers to enter relevant premises that go beyond the powers of the police with warrants, Customs and Excise officers or environmental protection officers. Those are public servants who can enter premises with a warrant, but the Bill will allow someone to simply walk in.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a lawyer and will therefore recognise, from the notes on clauses, that:
"The enforcement powers in this clause are among the powers transposed into the agricultural wages regimes ... in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in accordance with clause 44(1) and schedule 2."<P>

<P>
For the record, that is also covered by the Wages Act 1986. Employers are being asked to do no more than they have done since 1986. The state is taking no more powers than those that were taken by the previous Administration.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Our proposals are reasonable and strike the right balance between regulation that is not excessive but is transparent and capable of effectively investigating any complaint. On the one hand they can secure justice for the worker who has a prima facie case. On the other hand, an employer who believes that a competitor is acting contrary to the law will be able to have that investigated. That is all that the powers provide for. I ask my hon. Friends to reinforce the Bill by supporting clause 14.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I must restate the Minister has no idea that I am going to say this my considerable admiration for the Minister. He has behaved with considerable courage on several occasions. He knows what I mean. He has been physically menaced by people whose behaviour has no place in our society and he behaved very bravely. I shall always admire him for that, although I think less of his politics.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for those kind remarks. I want to make it clear that I was not training to be an enforcement officer at the time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> That, if I may say so, adds a gracefully light touch to a discussion that was becoming a little heavy.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> And out of order, too.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> That is more serious.
<P>
It is important to stress that the bland words of clause 14(1)(d) 
"at all reasonable times to enter any relevant premises" <P>

<P>
far exceed powers possessed by policemen, Customs and Excise officers and environmental protection officers with warrants. If those people have the correct powers, why should the enforcement officers have greater powers? A great deal of thought has been given to the powers of the police, the environmental officers and the Customs and Excise, and the powers of the last are controversial. But here we are, blandly and without qualification, giving considerably more power than is possessed by other officers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> I share the anxiety of my hon. Friend about the words
"at all reasonable times".<P>

<P>
They are vague and ambiguous. Would not it be better to specify the precise hours within which officers could legitimately visit? If the Minister is not prepared to agree another formulation, there is a danger that the clause will be a charter for the intimidation of innocent people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> My hon. Friend is a man of pronounced views which he expresses with lucidity and verve. However, I do not always agree with him in every detail, and this is one such rare occasion. I do not emphasise the words
"at all reasonable times".<P>

<P>
I am content that our courts can interpret that. What I worry about is the ability
"to enter any relevant premises"<P>

<P>
without fetter. I find that part of the clause offensive; my hon. Friend finds the other part offensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> They both are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> They both are.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> During any longeur in our proceedings, it would have been worth while to do a sum to figure out whether members of the Committee now qualified for the national minimum wage.
<P>
I want to respond to the Minister's comments. During the second part of his bluster, there were two extraordinary revelations. He is learning, and I almost warm to him. He told us that the fact that the relevant provisions had been in place since 1986 meant that they must be all right and could not be improved. Apparently, their introduction by a Conservative Government puts them beyond all criticism. This is new Labour gone to extremes.
<P>
My hon. Friends and I say with some modesty I have espoused our concerns about the Bill. The fact that powers have not been abused previously and the fact that no major problems have arisen does not mean that we should not criticise the Bill's details. I invite my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.

<H4><center>Non-compliance: worker entitled to additional remuneration</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is a short clause, but that does not automatically justify a short debate the length of a debate is not always related to the number of words in a clause.
<P>
As the notes on clauses makes clear, the clause will establish the main mechanism for the enforcement of the national minimum wage. It is all very well to set out the principle behind the national minimum wage we debated it at some length and to work out how the rate will be calculated and to whom it will apply, but a worker may or may not be entitled to more than he receives in his remuneration package, and the basis on which that will be established should be clear. We shall explore later those aspects of contract law in more detail the concept is stretched to the very limits of its durability by the Bill.
<P>
The provisions of this enabling clause are simple and, if I may say so, well expressed. There should be a mathematical way to work out the relevant remuneration received by a worker assuming that records are in place and are released to the enforcement officer and the relevant remuneration that the worker would have received under the national minimum wage. I deliberately elide the terms of the Bill, and I shall return to that matter later.
<P>
The concept behind the clause is blissfully straightforward, but I want the Committee to dwell for a moment on three smallish points, and I should appreciate the Minister's response to them. On second thoughts, I am not sure that one of them is particularly small.
<P>
First I appreciate that a legal term of art may be involved and that I do not have the appropriate radar to pick it up and to define it myself subsection (1) states:
"the worker shall be taken to be entitled under his contract to be paid ... additional remuneration".<P>

<P>
What concept does the phrase "taken to be" involve? Taken by whom, in what circumstances and with what consequences? Is that a way of saying that the worker will be entitled to the difference?
<P>
My second question which, I must admit, came to me only when I re-read the clause this morning; occasionally, problems strike one on re-reading is about the difference between the remuneration received and the remuneration that the worker would have received under the national minimum wage. Subsection (2)(b) states:
"the relevant remuneration which the worker would have received for that period" <P>

<P>
namely, the pay reference period 
"had he been remunerated by the employer at a rate equal to the national minimum wage."
<P>
There are two difficulties in that paragraph. The first relates to multiple employments, which we discussed previously. Two employments might run simultaneously conceivably, for work carried out at one time. The Minister, for example, is paid as a Member of Parliament and also receives a ministerial salary. The Bill defines the employer as a single employer, but a multiple employer might be involved, Secondly, the paragraph refers to
"a rate equal to the national minimum wage".<P>

<P>
The context makes it clear that that involves the national minimum wage that is in force for the relevant pay reference period. It involves not the then present day rate but the rate that would have applied when the money should have been paid. As we discussed earlier, the national minimum wage could be amended during that period there would therefore be a difference between that amended rate and the rate that would apply to a late and retrospective claim for underpayment, which would refer to an earlier pay reference period. Those are technical matters.
<P>
I explained my third general concern about the clause a short time ago. When an underpayment occurs, a retrospective clawback will be enforced in ways that are described in subsequent clauses. Recourse to a tribunal may be involved, and penalties may be imposed. At some stage, therefore, the worker involved will receive or should receive if the system works and I hope it does a cheque equivalent to the wage that he would have been paid for the relevant period. I do not wish to complicate matters by assuming a change of employer or a change in the period; we are simply assuming that there is one back pay cheque to come. Any payment of that kind, as I have already mentioned, automatically attracts a charge to taxation, and is also likely to attract a charge to national insurance contributions. One of the bugbears of our system is that taxation and national insurance are not coincident the tax system operates on the basis of a tax year, and the national insurance system operates, as I understand it, on a weekly basis, as does the benefit system. That causes many of the difficulties that successive Ministers have encountered when considering welfare reform.
<P>
There will be problems not merely in collecting the money some people are not keen on paying up even when they should, which we do not condone but in working out the retrospective entitlements. For example, it would be perfectly possible to have recourse to an industrial tribunal across a tax year. It is likely that the Inland Revenue would be able to cope with that, probably by adjusting the worker's PAYE coding. How it would be possible to make a retrospective charge for national insurance contributions is more a matter for speculation, especially in circumstances in which the worker had more than one employment, and was working on different days of the week.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have followed my hon. Friend's argument closely, and agree with him entirely that both national insurance and tax pose potential problems. Clause 15(1) clearly says that
"the worker shall be taken to be entitled under his contract to be paid, as additional remuneration in respect of that period, the amount described".<P>

<P>
I suggest to my hon. Friend that it would be helpful if the Bill were to prescribe that any such payments should be treated by the Inland Revenue as payments received during the period to which they refer, and not as payments received at the time that they were paid. Such payments might be paid some considerable time later and, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, possibly in a different tax year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I think that that is a valuable and interesting suggestion. I do not wish to skewer the Government on this point, but my hon. Friend is right to make the point that such payments could be made in a different tax year. A further complication is almost implicit in the drafting of the clause. My hon. Friend referred to additional remuneration in respect of the period, and the clause seems to state clearly that that is
"for any pay reference period".<P>

<P>
Again, it would be possible for a pay reference period to straddle the tax year, which would require an allocation of the under-remuneration in two years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not a lawyer the only lawyer among Opposition Members of the Committee has departed in an untimely manner but it seems to me that the relevant wording in this context is that
"the worker shall be taken to be entitled under his contract to be paid".<P>

<P>
If the contract specifies that he shall be paid the minimum wage in respect of the given period, I suggest that conventional Inland Revenue practice will result in that money being treated for tax purposes as earned in that period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That is a helpful contribution. I strongly suspect that my hon. Friend is right and I feel tempted to make the point and then hastily retreat from it that only lawyers and professional persons currently account for tax on a cash basis, and that the Inland Revenue appears to have some extremely unpopular and uncongenial schemes for bringing that state of affairs to an end. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that as the payment of the minimum wage would be under a contract although when we discuss clause 16 we will consider quasi-contracts, which are not contracts at all it is likely that any back payments would be treated as if they were earned in the year in which they should have been paid. A further complication arises from the fact that the pay reference period, as well as the tax year, could straddle the payments. It may not always be possible to work out the part of the tax year in which they should have accrued. I do not want to labour the point, but if there are problems with the Inland Revenue which has a broadly based tax year concept such problems will be grossly compounded by back calculations of national insurance contributions.
<P>
I have no final blueprint there is no amendment dealing with these matters but I hope that the Minister[Mr. Boswell]
will find a practical, commonsense way of working out these problems. I suspect that the answer is treating back payments as if they were paid when they should have been paid under the contract that subsisted, or was deemed to have subsisted. Employers and their workers should be able to understand the system, which should be administered fairly flexibly by the Inland Revenue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> May I say that the hon. Gentleman asks his questions in a reasonable way I do not mean that in a condescending way. He raised three key issues. He raised the issues of multiple employers and relevant pay periods. He also drew attention to clause 15(l), which states that
"the worker shall be taken to be entitled under his contract to be paid".<P>

<P>
I shall deal with each of those issues in turn.
<P>
The issue of multiple employers was debated for a short period under either clause 1 or clause 2 I cannot quite remember. The Under-Secretary and I responded that, irrespective of the number of employers, those employers were a single employer for the purposes of the minimum wage. If an individual has two employers, for whom he works during a particular pay period, each employer is obliged to pay the national minimum wage, irrespective of whether a worker has three, four, five or six employers. Each contractual arrangement is a requirement for the employer to pay the national minimum wage.
<P>
In relation to the relevant pay period, we had a debate under clause 14 about the powers of officers. The hon. Member for Daventry rightly said that in most instances the relevant pay periods would have passed. There will be a need to identify the period, to establish whether there is a genuine case of potential under-payment, and to determine what the process of recovery is if there has been under-payment. Clause 14 deals with the production of relevant records, the maintenance of those records, and the ability to give adequate information about those records, the synergy of which is of great importance. When a claim is made, either legitimately or illegitimately, that there has been under-payment, the records will be as critically important for the employer as for the employee, whether an employee is still in the employment of that employer or not. The maintenance of records in relation to pay periods is therefore of great importance.
<P>
I shall now deal with the third point that the hon. Gentleman raised, which is that clause 15(1) says that
"the worker shall be taken to be entitled under his contract to be paid".<P>

<P>
That wording mirrors the wording of section 16 of the Wages Act 1986, which also refers to a worker being taken to be entitled. The legal definition which has been provided for me, so I am not trying to be clever is that "taken" means considered by his employer or by a court to be entitled to the amount in question. It is therefore a simple transposition from the 1986 Act. The clause is intended to ensure that workers who are paid less than the minimum wage are entitled to recover the difference of the additional remuneration. That is the point between the contractual rate to be paid and any disputed difference between what has been paid and what the worker is entitled to. This is very important in some sectors of the economy, such as piece work and home working, because there is a potential for home or other workers not to be paid the appropriate rate. The clause helps to ensure their entitlement to remuneration and their key right, as part of the enforcement strategy, under the practices and procedures that are in place, to claim underpayment and for that underpayment to be made good. That is the proposal, no more and no less. On that basis, I hope that my hon. Friends will ensure that the clause remains part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I thank the Minister for responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. I want to take one or two moments to pursue a point to which my hon. Friend referred, but which he did not elaborate on because he thought that I would do so.
<P>
Essentially the clause rests, as the Minister explained, on the establishment of an employee's contractual right to receive the national minimum wage from his or her employer. We must consider whether that is followed through in the Bill and whether enforcement is robust in pursuit of that right.
<P>
Clause 15 is added to by a number of clauses which seek to create the relevant contractual right, even where such a contract may not exist between an individual and an employer or between two individuals. For example, clause 16(3) contains an implied contract, a contract created even where one has not existed before, particularly in relation to home workers. The same occurs in clause 31(2), which contains the same kind of provision in relation to agency workers, and in clause 32 in relation to homeworkers. Clause 31(2) states that
"the other provisions of this Act shall have effect as if there were a worker's contract".<P>

<P>
Therefore, a contractual right is deemed to exist in that respect. Then in clause 51(3)(b), although there is a contract of service, or to provide work between an individual and another person, that is to be treated as if it were a contract of employment.
<P>
Therefore, it is proposed that we should create in the Bill a series of implied contractual relationships that amount to an employment contract. Then, having created something that amounts to an employment contract, the Bill uses the provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 as a basis on which civil proceedings can be undertaken. I hope that I am not misleading myself and the Committee by summarising it in that way.
<P>
Two general problems arise from that which I wish to put to the Committee, although I do not know whether the Minister of State plans to respond. First, if the Employment Rights Act 1996 is used to try to enforce contractual rights on the part of employees, but it turns out, in the pursuit of these civil proceedings, that they are not employees at all or they do not have the employment contract foreseen in that Act, we need to be assured that the procedure set out and the form of the Bill will be robust against challenges to the effect that "The Bill seeks to imply that I, being a person who has a contract of service with somebody or who puts piece work out to home workers or has agency workers working in relation to my business, have this contract of employment with this person, but I do not have a contract of employment." I am not sure whether the notes on clauses give us the assurance that we seek that the Bill's structure is sufficiently robust against subsequent challenge, if people were minded to challenge it.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The second point arises directly from the Employment Rights Act 1996. I am no expert on it, but it is reasonably new. It no doubt consolidated and brought up to date legislation that had a life before 1996. The second part of the notes on clauses, refering to this new set of enforcement procedures, which are effectively based on the 1996 Act, states that
"those responsible for enforcement can rely on familiar mechanisms."<P>

<P>
However, the mechanisms are unfamiliar in two respects. First, the 1996 Act is not in all respects such long-standing legislation that we can necessarily feel that it is robust enough for these purposes. I question whether to rest so large an enforcement requirement on an Act created for a different purpose is a basis on which to proceed with legislation so quickly,

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> My understanding, as advised, is that the 1996 Act is tightly drawn in terms of the conventional employer-employee relationship and that the new legislation seeks to approximate, through deemed contracts, to a large variety of circumstances which are not contracts in the normal sense of the word, to try to give workers the rights available under that more tightly drawn Act.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> My hon. Friend has hit the second nail on the head, as it were, because the point I was moving towards was that there is a sense in which this large inverted pyramid will rest on the 1996 Act. Perhaps more significant is the fact that, as a consequence of the various relationships which are not employment contracts but which are deemed to be such through devices in the Bill, a set of relationships will be created which will then be interpreted in the context of the 1996 Act. They may be able to be pursued in relation to the narrow context of national minimum wage enforcement, but that begs the question whether there will be challenges to it, because the Bill creates an expectation that there is a contract of employment between people who do not have one. Bringing theminto the context of the 1996 Act by virtue of the Bill may cause difficulties to those other relationships.
<P>
Even in relation to the national minimum wage we may find that, to challenge some of the deemed contractual rights that will be offered by the Bill, employers deemed employers will be continually seeking to reinterpret their relationship with individuals to try to make it not an agency relationship or a contract of service but a sort of business relationship that falls out with the Bill. That may give us considerable difficulties.
<P>
To sum up, and to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, we have encountered a further obstacle, in that the Minister and the notes on clauses have not yet satisfied the test of whether the proposed enforcement is robust enough for the purposes for which it is designed. Will the Minister of State tell us how the 1996 Act is sufficiently robust for these purposes and how these deemed contracts can be brought into use through that Act without the enforcement mechanism proving fallible in the circumstances designed in the Bill?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I propose to suspend the Committee until 11.25, but before I do so, I have a brief announcement to make.
<P>
The Committee has made good progress, and by the time we sit on Thursday morning we shall have reached parts of the Bill that could not have been foreseen yesterday. As a result, a number of new amendments have been submitted for tabling today. In accordance with the usual practice, any amendments tabled today would be printed this evening and appear as starred amendments on tomorrow's amendment paper. That will still be the case, but it may be helpful to the Committee to know that this will be one of the rare occasions when the Chair will look sympathetically on the selection of starred amendments. In order to assist hon. Members, the Public Bill Office will arrange for production of an informal paper containing new amendments tabled up to the end of this sitting. This paper will be available at the Vote Office during the afternoon.
