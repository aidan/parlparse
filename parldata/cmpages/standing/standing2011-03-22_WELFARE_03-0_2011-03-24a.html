me that what is proposed is devolution

                           </div>to local authorities, probably at unitary authority level. As you know,
I was a social fund commissioner for many years. My view on all this is
that we have a UK social security system and that, for the past 25
years, the discretionary social fund has been the ultimate, final
safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable. If we have a UK social
security system, I would argue for a UK safety net underneath it. It
does not seem to me very likely that local authorities will provide
that. I am not clear whether the Government intend to issue
instructions to local authorities about what kind of scheme they should
run, but I would be very sorry to see the end of a national scheme that
provides proper
underpinning.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000024">&#160;</a>

form of accountability by local authorities. That is the very least
that is needed. Otherwise, we will find even less fairness than the
Public Accounts Committee found when it inquired into the current

years ago, but I cannot believe that the situation has
changed—for the Department looking at people who got partial
awards or were refused entirely, who, I should say, were the majority.
Very few got exactly what they asked for. They had very little—I
am talking about community care grants—to fall back on. Hardly
anyone had any savings at all, and if they had they were less than
£100. They had few friends or family to call on, and often their
family was the cause of the difficulties that they were
facing—abuse, being thrown out of home and so on. Family
breakdown was frequently a cause. They frequently had no access to
low-cost credit, or to any credit at all. The consequence was that many
of them applied for a budgeting loan, and we might find greater demand
for payments on
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000028">&#160;</a>

take the example of providing adaptations to disabled people, which is
done through local authorities, they have been very poor at doing that.
Often, people are assessed as having significant needs, but they cannot
meet those needs because the money is not made available. My experience
of local authorities is that that provision is patchy. Some will
provide perfectly good services, but many will not.
I think there will be a patchwork or postcode
lottery, and it will be very different across the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000033">&#160;</a>

Are there any examples that you think perhaps could be used to help
local authorities improve the way they deliver that local support in
future? Both the National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee
have publicly criticised the way targeting happens at the moment, so
presumably a move to local level gives us the opportunity to ensure
that money is better targeted. Are there examples of where people are

work done in Liverpool and Belfast with recycling of
goods—recreating them, refurbishing them, and providing them to
poor families. That can work very well, but I have not seen a lot of
it, and it takes quite a lot of organisation. Community care grants are
the bit I am most concerned about—£141 million. By the
time you that have dished that out to 100 plus local authorities, there
will not be a great amount of money at local level, and I think, as it
is not ring-fenced, it is likely to disappear into other
things.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000036">&#160;</a>

I respond on the Scottish and Welsh point?  I simply want to
say that as the thing is proposed, I imagine an equivalent amount of
money will go to the Scottish and Welsh Governments. I think there is a
real possibility, particularly in Scotland, that the Scottish
Government might decide to run something akin to the community care
grant system on a national level. I do not know whether that will
happen, but my experience of dealing with both Scotland and Wales is
that there is quite a likelihood of it
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000037">&#160;</a>

it is going to be quite difficult, but it is something that we need to
crack. We need collectively to give our mind to it. If this is going to
be put at the local level, we must have some form of accountability.
Perhaps the kind of relationships that the Department has with some
subcontractors—for example, the delivery of Jobcentre Plus
services—might form a model for that so that there is some sort
of contractual agreement. However, with the potential for such wide
variability across local authorities, I think that if there were no
form of accountability, many vulnerable people living in some parts of
the country would get nothing,
frankly.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000041">&#160;</a>

assume that the Government’s intention is for local authorities
to exercise powers under the Local Government Act 2000 for general
well-being in the local area. One of the things that could be done is
to turn those powers into duties. You would need to describe a scheme
and give local authorities some rather specific duties in relation to
it. If you are looking at accountability, you could then underpin that
with some form of independent review mechanism at a national level that
allowed people to test local authority decisions. It would not have to
be the same one as now, but that sort of
model.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000042">&#160;</a>

people who are vulnerable and need help and support. How do you suggest
going forward, particularly with local authorities—I welcome
your views on this, to be perfectly honest—so that there is real
fairness in the system and people who are in need actually get the
money and support that they need? It sounds quite mixed right now. From
your comments about local authorities, Sir Richard, it seems that there
is a

is almost certainly not enough money in the community care grant
budget, which is a cash-limited one. One understands the reasons why it
is cash-limited, but £141 million is not enough money to meet
what most people would describe as legitimate need. The estimates that
we made a year or two back were that the figure probably needed to be
closer to £400 million. If you got to that sort of figure, you
would have a much better chance of providing a decent service across

overturned in half the cases of those who go to the trouble to ask for

everywhere. I do not have a lack of trust in local authorities. Many of
them do very well, but my experience is that you get a very patchy
service. Some local authorities provide a good service, but others do
not. I gave you an example of adaptations for disabled people, where
just across a boundary you could see quite a different level of service
being provided. The other thing about local
authorities—presumably locally elected people—is that
they decide where they want to put the money. The money for this is
being given to local authorities for them to decide where they want to
put it. Some local authorities will decide not to put it into the
equivalent of community care
grants.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000051">&#160;</a>

scheme for elderly people. As Elaine said, I think about 10% of the
money at the moment goes to people of pension age. By spending a very
small amount of money, you can help people to stay longer in their own
homes. That is a very good investment for all of us as taxpayers. Just
a few hundred pounds will often be the difference between staying in
their own home and having to be taken into residential care or
hospital.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000055">&#160;</a>

apply, that it is exactly that, the stigma and humiliation. It depends
on which part of a local authority or which organisation locally

fair, although the Department has tried to make some shifts in the way
the budget is distributed. In the main, the budget is distributed on
the basis of historical spend up to the 1980s on the single payments
scheme that preceded the social fund. At the point at which the social
fund was introduced, the level of expenditure to different parts of the
country at that time was set in concrete, and has been changed little
in the 25 years. A number of people, myself included, have argued a
number of times that there needed to be some change in the budget
allocation mechanism. Curiously, London, for example, is rather better
provided than some parts of the north of the country. As I said
earlier, Northern Ireland is particularly well provided in comparison
to the rest of the United Kingdom. There are anomalies and it has been
difficult to shift
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000059">&#160;</a>

what Richard said earlier other than to make the point that we should
not imagine that all of the community care grant applicants are known

even where people that we were interviewing were known to social
services, they were frequently not told about the community care grant
by those people, but rather by other caring agencies, such as citizens
advice bureaux, hostels and so on. To pin all our hopes on social
workers would not be the right solution. If one did put it down to the
local level, it would require cross-agency working, and that is going
to be quite complex and difficult to orchestrate. That would mean
bringing in probation workers, mental health nurses, CAB and hostel
workers, which is a wide range of different

critical needs. My experience of that has been in terms of working with
some families who perhaps have children with problems and so on, but
until they reach a certain level, they are not even being picked up.

other concern is that a number of the people who we interviewed had
been moved from one local authority to another, and I am not quite sure
where you would be applying for the grant. I can think of one
particular case of a young woman, who had been both sexually and
physically abused by her family, who was moved from Birmingham to
Somerset and was not told about the community care grant until the CAB
told her. She applied, but did not get it until the child was injured,
and she then received some money to carpet the concrete stairs. I do
not quite see how she would be helped. Where would she make contact?
The people that she is most in contact with are in Birmingham, but they
would not be able to activate it in Somerset. There are lots of
practicalities that one needs to think through. It gets more complex

contact with social services. Indeed, in those cases where giving a
community care grant was successful, that might well be one of the
things that actually prevented them from coming into contact with
social work departments. It just saw them through. Most community care
grants go to families under exceptional
pressure.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000069">&#160;</a>

Taking carer’s allowance into universal credit as a whole
benefit would have meant means-testing an extra 225,000 to 250,000
people. We would have seen that as a very retrograde step.
Carer’s allowance is the only thing in the benefit system that
provides an independent income for carers that recognises the enormous
contribution that they make to society. We would have seen that as a
retrograde step, so we are delighted that it is being kept outside. Who
does move in, of course, are all those who

                           </div>are in receipt of income support. Progression to earn additional money
and keep more of your benefits with a change in the withdrawal rates
will benefit that sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000079">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Where we
would like to see change really is around the earnings thresholds.
We would like more clarity about how much carers
could earn if they were within universal credit and still keep that
element of the benefit. I know that discussions are going on about
fire-walling and things like that and how you describe benefits. What
is not tackled is this: carers are now able to earn £100 after
deductions and still receive carer’s allowance; that will not
change, so that is still a problem. If they earn over that £100
they lose 100% of their benefit, so it is a very high penalty. We do
not have an awful lot of carers who are working and caring. There are
only about 44,000. Those statistics are quite old, so the Government
could look at using some of the mechanisms that they have already and
how they are reforming jobseeker’s allowance and apply it to
carer’s allowance outside the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000080">&#160;</a>

Why would you take in those 44,000 who do have earnings? They would not
necessarily all get to keep those earnings. They would not all be
better off. Why would you means-test a whole swathe of other people who
would lose their only source of independent income to help a small

Holzhausen:</strong>
                           </em> That is an excellent question.
Conditionality takes up a lot of our advice line and helpline time.
People worry about conditionality when they are drawn into a
work-focused interview that they cannot attend because they are
providing too much care, or when they feel that they are being forced
back to work and that is impossible because they cannot get the social
care in order to do that. We do not want a system that sets people up
to fail, particularly when carers are saving the state £87
billion a year. We are not there to punish families; we are there to
help
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
fact that carers will not be subject to conditionality is very
important. We think that there are certain areas in which the system
needs to be more flexible. For example, if you look at a single parent,
conditionality will apply to her, but if she has caring
responsibilities, that may not count. How do we roll that out? It might
be that she could go back to work if she was just looking after her
children, but if she is also caring for her mum that is enough to make
it impossible for her to return to work. We need sensitivity around
conditionality.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000085">&#160;</a>

to be clearer ways of training, because although caring is part and
parcel of our life, people still do not recognise it as an issue or
recognise how it impacts on people’s lives. We need some
standard way in which all advisers are able to identify carers. We
would say that there needs to be a clear definition of what caring is,

Obviously, there are opportunities out there, but it is about
understanding their predicaments and situations—the facilitation
of the closeness to their caring roles and responsibilities—to
enable them to get into
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000089">&#160;</a>

very important that carers are still able, if they choose, to have an
opportunity to take advantage of any work-focused programmes that might
help them. Some of the bigger problems, however, come from the lack of
funding of social care, so that people cannot work, cannot return to
work or fall out of work—26% of those who were out of work were
out of work because there was insufficient social
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000090">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that everybody is familiar with the arguments about child care,
and about how investment in child care has revolutionised the ability
of women—and men—to return to work and stay in work.
Exactly the same is true of social care. If we want people to stay in
touch with the labour market, we need to invest in social care. I know
that that is not the subject of the Bill, but it cannot be seen as
divorced from that. As I say, you must have access to learning
opportunities, but you have to have support behind that, and
flexibility from employers—this Government have continued the
previous Government’s focus on flexibility, which is very
welcome—is also part and parcel of keeping people in work and in
touch. People are more able to return to work if they know they have a
supportive
employer.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000091">&#160;</a>

say on our helpline, because I have no other data to hand. There are no
other official data that I am aware of. People tend
to cluster just below that. There are a couple of reasons for that. One
is that it becomes very difficult to find work and jobs that you can do
for under £100, those little bits of work. The second is the
risk of going over that £100. We get that desperate call around

I am sorry, is part of the complexity of the benefit rules. If you are
paid weekly, it may be losing weekly. If you are paid monthly, it may
be losing monthly. Or, if they can establish a pattern, that may be
longer. We did have one case where somebody lost a whole year. That is
unusual; it tends to be more on  a monthly basis. When you
explain to a carer that they are taking on the risk of losing that
£53.90, they usually feel that is too big a penalty to

                           </em> We have a number of concerns about how
the reforms of the personal independence payment are shaping up. Our
biggest worry is that no real analysis has been done on the impact on
carers. That is a big concern. It is the gateway for getting
carer’s allowance. We don’t know how many carers will
continue to receive carer’s allowance as a result of those
gateways. It could cut both ways. You could increase the number, or
indeed decrease the number. Several tens of thousands of people could
lose out.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000098">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Overall, of
course we have concerns about the budget reductions around the personal
independence payment. People tend to look at carers receiving
carer’s allowance, but personal independence payment is linked
to a whole string of different things in the family. For instance, the
family car with the mobility component makes a difference as to whether
you can go out and about with your child. All those levels contribute
to family income and disabled people’s independence. It is
urgent that we get a full analysis of how the changes to disability
living allowance will impact on carers, and to see what we are talking
about.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000099">&#160;</a>

example, from carers on the condition of the person they care for, it
has been shown that that evidence can make all the difference in work
capability assessments. We should be looking at getting a full set of
evidence from the people who really know. We accept nowadays that
carers can be experts in care. We do know the people we care for
extremely well, and that should count alongside other forms of
evidence.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000100">&#160;</a>

universal credit provides a framework to help the poorest people back
into work and make all hours of work pay. First, what do you think
about that? Secondly, particularly for lone parents, who struggle to
get back into work, how do you feel about the role of mini-jobs and the
prospect of self-employment to help people get back into the
workplace?<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000104">&#160;</a>

                              <strong>Professor
Gregg:</strong>
                           </em> The universal credit involves three big
structural changes. It is merging the in-work and out-of-work benefit
systems, merging the housing benefit system into the rest and putting
all the out-of-work benefits into one space. The two big features that
you are getting at are that we are moving towards removing the big step
changes when you enter the tax credit system. The current system is
that there is almost no incentive to work until 16 hours if you have
kids, and then bang, you have a big step, so everybody jumps to that
point or does not move at all. In a sense, you have a polarised
position with nobody in the middle.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000105">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first key
design change is that those jobs in the middle—mini-jobs, as you
have called them—will become viable for people, which they
currently are not. That applies to both sides. I think that it is
important that people have it in their heads that it is not just people
moving out of work into mini-jobs; for many lone parents currently
jumping 16, 17 or 18 hours, the incentive will be to go the other way.
Because you are smoothing out that step or jump, people will move from
both ways.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
compounded by the second feature, which is that the withdrawal rate is
quite high. Net, it is 65p in the pound, so the incentive to work a
little more—to work the extra hour; to do eight, 10, 12 or 16
hours—is relatively small at each step. When you move into the
tax system, it becomes 76p in the pound. Those are relatively high
effective tax rates. That is the second feature of all this—the
incentives to work are improved 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 93<a class="bkMark" name="Column93">&#160;</a>
                           </div>by mini-jobs and, for those with high housing costs, taking jobs with
£15,000 a year—but the incentives to progress more or
earn more are being weakened under the system, particularly for second
earners, who face the high 65p tax rate before they enter the main tax
system, whereas under the current system it is 39p.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So we have a
big gain on one side, but some losses on the other side, because of the
high withdrawal rate, particularly before you enter the tax system. For
the first job at low hours, or the second job within a family, marginal
tax rates are high. The incentives to work are going to be reduced, if
anything.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000108">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>May I ask you to answer my particular
question about your feelings? I accept what you say about the fact that
it is creating a framework. At the moment, because of the financial
constraints facing the country, the marginal rates of tax might not be
as desirable as we would like. Hopefully, over time, they can come down
to increase the incentive. However, my fundamental question was this:
do you think that the fact that every extra pound earned will make a
financial contribution to the family or individual is a beneficial
feature of the system?<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000109">&#160;</a>

Gregg:</strong>
                           </em> The simple answer is yes, but when you are
balancing child care costs, the desire to look after your children and
so on, the incentives need to be fairly strong for you to work more.
Another feature that was not mentioned in your question, but sort of
features in this, is the cut in the generosity of support for child
care that is currently coming through and, as I understand it, will be
enhanced under the new universal credit, so we will no longer have 80%
of child care costs covered; it will be 70%, or perhaps 65% or 60%
under universal credit. We are creating a system with strong incentives
to work a little, but fewer incentives to work more. There has been a
reference to mini-jobs, and there is a fear that we are creating a
system and a design for people to take mini-jobs, but to stay there
instead of progressing and becoming more independent of the tax and
benefits
system.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000110">&#160;</a>

Gregg:</strong>
                           </em> Okay. The first point, which directly follows
from that, is that we are creating a strong incentive for people to
work a little, which will not lift them out of in-work poverty. They
will not go far enough to get out of in-work poverty. The current
system should get you—particularly lone parents—to jump
far enough to get out of in-work poverty. That is not so for couples so
much. We are creating a zone where people will work a little, but not
be sufficient to get out of
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000113">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
would like to say two additional things that are particularly relevant
to that question, but have not cropped up before. The first is that the
tax credit system—the universal credit system—will be
uprated with the consumer prices index, which is relatively ungenerous.
The in-work support will diminish with time. If we have real earnings
growth—obviously, we do not have that at the moment— 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 94<a class="bkMark" name="Column94">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and if we return to such a situation, that will be eroded by lower
credits over time, which tends to enhance in-work
poverty.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
income tax system will be linked to the retail prices index, continuing
for the foreseeable future. The current Government, particularly the
Liberal Democrats, are encouraging the idea that tax allowances at the
bottom end should be increased under a net taper, which we have under
the universal credit. All those benefits for lowering taxes for the low
paid will be eaten away in lower credits. The Liberal Democrat policy
of trying to redistribute money towards the poor through the income tax
allowance system will essentially become pretty much redundant if it is
all taken away again, or if 65p of it is taken away in the universal
credit. There is a conflict between the arms of the tax policy and the
universal credit policy with uprating and with the treatment of now
having a net taper rather than a gross, where this does not
change—taxes and the benefits do not interact in
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The other thing I want to ask about is the
transitional protections. The Government have said that nobody will be
worse off at the point of change as they migrate on to universal
credit, but we are obviously unsure what might trigger a change in
circumstances, and therefore remove that transitional protection. We
understand that family circumstances change quite frequently, and I
wonder whether you could give us some sense of your analysis of the
likely impact of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000116">&#160;</a>

Gregg:</strong>
                           </em> As you say, it is unclear to me what will
trigger a change in circumstances. About 400,000 people a
month are moving on and off benefits, so that is a huge flow. Changes
in earnings, changes in rents and changes in child care are all
features within the new universal credit, which potentially will be
adjusted on a monthly basis. The previous system was adjusted on an
annual basis, and the old working families tax credit was six-monthly.
In a sense, there is a large array of potential monthly triggers, which
could lead to a change of assessment, and which could reclassify people
between transitional protection and the main benefit. I am not clear
how that will
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Again,
the point about uprating only with the CPI emphasises that there will
be quite big losers down the line. At the point of transition, the
losers are not high. The transitional protection and increased
generosity will protect a lot of people, but as we go through time, we
will see the generosity of support diminishing because of the link only
with the
CPI.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000118">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have received a lot of evidence from
around the world that financial incentives in these sorts of scheme are
perhaps less important than might be imagined, and we certainly heard
that on Tuesday. In your view, is it more important to get people back
into work at all, or to worry about the fact that they might come down
the income scale because of financial
incentives?<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000119">&#160;</a>

and probably bores everyone else stupid. Yes, there is a big difference
in the responsiveness of people to the incentive to work at all
relative to the incentive to work a little bit more. The participation
incentive, as it

			Column number: 95<a class="bkMark" name="Column95">&#160;</a>
                           </div>is called, seems to be more malleable. People’s behaviour changes
more on the participation decision—to work or not—than it
does over the marginal tax rate. You are right that there may
be benefits in getting people to participate at
all, and not worrying so much about the effects of the relatively high
effective tax rates subsequently.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000120">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Because of
that sensitivity over the participation decision, a
key feature of these kinds of system around the world has been to try
to get people to jump a distance. The American system has a positive
zone, where people get more credits to make it attractive to jump. We
had the hours system. Those create incentives for people to
jump—at least so far—and the system does not worry so
much about how much more people
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000121">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Here,
we are, in a sense, getting rid of that jumping device. The
participation decision is likely to be made much more in the mini-job
zone, rather than jumping further, so we are creating an incentive to
work a little, in the way that I have described, but people will tend
to stick at
there.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000122">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I like the idea of devices to encourage people
to go far enough to make a significant contribution to their living
standards. The hours rule does not fit well with the universal credit,
because we do not particularly want to collect hours information as
well. Income disregards in the tax credit system help, because people
can earn up to that level before they kick in, but there are other
potential devices, such as the American one, which are interesting in
trying to get people to
jump.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000124">&#160;</a>

were setting the rate, I would go for 55p. That was the rate that was
set under the working families tax credit, which seemed to be quite
effective. However, I would like to put it into people’s heads
that there are distinct disadvantages for second earners and for the
tax system in having a net taper relative to a gross taper. A net taper
erodes the gains that people get from being outside the tax
system—if you get a tax cut, the tax credit erodes it under a
net system that is not a under a gross. I would go for a bit
lower—<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000128">&#160;</a>

39p in the pound, irrespective of whether you are in the tax system or
not. So it is 39p plus tax, or 39p without tax, and it stays there.
Under a net system,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 96<a class="bkMark" name="Column96">&#160;</a>
                           </div>it is 65p if you are not in the tax system, but that is net. If you are
in the tax system, it is 65% of everything after tax, which results in
76%.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000130">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the net system, if you move the boundary between tax and not—you
pull people out of tax—they lose 65p of that, because that is
the gain. A gross taper system does not change anything—it is
just 39, 39, 39. It is a design feature that reduces the amount of
spend where people—second earners, or first or second
jobbers—are outside the tax system. It therefore costs less to
the Exchequer, but creates disincentive effects for participation of
married women and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000131">&#160;</a>

being outside and subject to a second taper is that you have a
supplementary taper system on top, which is unhelpful. The second is
that one of the key features of the universal credit is the idea of
simplicity, relative transparency and a single system, and potentially
we will have 150-odd different variants set by local authorities for
the council tax benefit. That jars with the fundamental logic of a
universal credit. Taking part of the system, sticking it outside and
making it highly diverse does not fit well with the idea of
simplification and transparency. I think that that is a mistake and
that you should try and get it inside. At the very least, you should
have the same definitions of income, so that things can be transparent
and to minimise the extra complexity that might arise out of having
highly diverse local variations in a

integrate it with the universal credit. Does it come before the rest of
the universal credit in terms of the taper? That is not easy when you
have something assessed separately. That is occurring in other areas
too, where you have things potentially outside, but there is a certain
logic of replicating as much of the universal credit system as within
the council tax benefit system to try and reduce the complexity.

intimated earlier to the question, it is less sensitive to incentives
than the participation decision to work or not. It is more sensitive
among married women with children than single people and first-earner
men. The biggest likely response, or the most sensitive group, is that
second-earner group, which I was talking about. They are the ones most
likely to respond to radical

                           </div>changes and incentives for quite obvious reasons—there is a
second job you want to be doing, which being is
with the children. If you have a low margin of distance in terms of
total income, because you are losing 65p in the pound of it from
working more or not, you cut back. So, lone parents and married women
with children are the most sensitive. Men, particularly older men, are
the least sensitive. The young are also quite sensitive. That is not
about kids; it is probably about

                           </em> The punch line is probably that lowering the
taper rate increases the cost for where people are now, substantively.
You would not get all of that back by changes in behaviour. You may get
about 40% or 50% back. You would still have substantive extra costs,
even after behavioural responses. It is not enough to make it a free
choice. It does involve costs. I think that is a fair representation of
where we are, which is why there is a tendency to try and push it up,
because it reduces overall costs.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000139">&#160;</a>

that, there is a third alternative that I am quite attracted to, but it
is costly. Overlapping taper rates of that kind and the tax system is
the problem. What we have is an earnings distribution. Most people are
in the middle, and then there are few at the bottom and a few at the
top. One solution is to means-test at the bottom, where there are
relatively few people, and have an affluence test at the top, where
there are relatively few people, as is happening with child benefit.
You keep it relatively flat in the middle, so that you are not damaging
people’s incentives. It costs more because you are not taking it
away as quickly, but you are getting rid of this big
zone.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000140">&#160;</a>

that and do it where there are fewer people, but it does cost

to try to get people to move further before all the disincentives of
high taper rates kick in. We typically have a single one for a family,
so it applies to the first earner but not to the second. An interesting
parameter we have always considered is whether there should be a

this up—you get 100 quid before your universal credits start to
be withdrawn for the first person. Under the current system, a second
person is then subject to 65% tax rates before they are earning into
tax, but we

earner. There is always that big incentive to get a second earner
within the family, which is what you need to get out of working
poverty—that was Kate Green’s point. With one and a half
jobs, people can get out of working poverty, so there is a
value there and earnings disregards are a valuable
device in that kind of

Gregg:</strong>
                           </em> Let us take a little step back and say that
the logic here is that there are out there a range of short-houred,
low-paid, relatively unstable jobs that are just not viable for people
in the welfare system. If you are in the universal credit area, they
are just not viable and the system is trying to make those
opportunities viable. An earnings disregard is powerful in that,
because that is exactly the kind of earnings we are talking about. That
is the
logic.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem, from my perspective, is, first, that the earnings are not very
much—they do not take you very far up. What we have very much
seen in the States for lone parents is that there are big incentives
there to work a little, because benefits for lone parents are
time-limited. So they work for five or eight hours, and that is your
lot. They do not progress, they stay there—low-waged,
low-income, relatively unstable, which is not a very attractive space,
if you like. We should, in a sense, be trying to think of design
features that encourage people to move out of that zone. Earnings
disregards are one; jumping rules of the kind we were discussing are
another. The third, which is potentially within the system, is some
kind of conditionality, so that if someone is working those five or
eight hours, there is still an expectation that they are looking for
work with more
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am not quite clear about how this is going to work—I think the
details will be in the regulations, rather than the Bill—but we
are opening up the territory to solve the problem of people taking but
not progressing out of mini-jobs. We might try to use conditionality
much more aggressively with the in-work population, which is new
territory and a distinct cultural change from where we have
been.<a class="bkMark" name="11032454000154">&#160;</a>

system. Putting the two together, the proposals are that we penalise
saving above the limit, but also income from any savings, more

contrast this with the Government’s logic in trying to avoid
such penalties on saving for pensioners in the form of trying to get
rid of the pension credit. There is a clear logic, which says we try to
incentivise people  to save and reduce these pension credit
disincentives to save. We are penalising savings within the universal
credit system more aggressively than was previously the case. The
