Ainger</b> (Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire) (Lab):
It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship on this beautiful
morning, Mr. Pope. I have a couple of questions on clauses
129 to 134, which includes byelaws in Wales to protect marine
conservation zones. Again, I have been approached by the Countryside
Council for Wales, which would like to know whether it would be
possible for byelaws to control movement, not just in MCZs, but in the
areas immediately outside them. That is with particular regard to the
disturbance of seabirds and marine mammals. The MCZ may well have been
set up to protect them, but they do move. I am thinking, for example,
of the gannets that nest on Grassholm and similar areas. The CCW seeks
information and clarity on whether byelaws can be made that are not
limited to the geographic location of the MCZs but cover areas
immediately outside or some distance away from them. It is seeking to
protect a particular species and avoid
disturbance.</div><a name="09070263000018"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000153"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> I shall both disappoint and
reassure my hon. Friend. He shows the importance of getting the
area&#151;the scope&#151;of the MCZ right, based on the best
scientific evidence. Clause 129 sets out the byelaw provisions for the
protection of MCZs&#151;for example, to restrict the movement of
animals and vessels, to restrict speed and to restrict the anchoring of
vessels in an MCZ. There may also be byelaws to restrict the killing or
taking of animals and plants in the zone. However, that is within the
zone. It is important to get the zone and the network of zones right,
so that movement, whether migration of species in the marine
environment or the movement of birdlife, can be taken into account.
This is a question of designating the geographic limits not only of the
individual zone, but of other zones that relate to it. That is where
the network becomes important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div><a name="09070263000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I
have to disappoint my hon. Friend in some ways, as we cannot take
account of things outside the zone. This clause has to do with the
byelaws that apply within a zone. That is where the importance of
getting the zone right comes into play. The hope is that if the zones
are set up in the right way, they will take account of the factors to
which he referred, to the satisfaction of the CCW and
others.</div><a name="09070263000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000154"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I seek further clarification. The problems that we
are discussing are often seasonal problems, particularly for seabirds
when they raft up and so on at certain times of the year. They are
mobile species and there may be rafts of seabirds a mile or two away,
or perhaps even 10 miles away. My hon. Friend the Minister is saying
that because there is a specific geographic designation to the MCZ, a
byelaw could not apply outside that specific geographic
location.</div><a name="09070263000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000155"></a>Huw
Irranca-Davies:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right, but in
respect of the seasonal aspect, it is perfectly conceivable&#151;I am
not drawing up the MCZs at the moment&#151;that an MCZ could be
designated to cover the overlap area that he is talking about and that
has byelaws applying to it that relate to the seasonal nature of
particular migratory patterns and so on. In effect, we would have an
extended MCZ, but byelaws would restrict movement at certain seasons of
the year. It is important that the underpinning science takes account
not only of the restricted area but of a slightly wider area, in order
to reflect such concerns.</div>
<a name="09070263000022"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000156"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Pope.
Clause 139 refers to the offences of intentionally or
recklessly killing or injuring animals in MCZs and so on. I realise
that many members of the Committee are concerned about the disturbance
element. Would it not be more appropriate to discuss the disturbance
element when debating clause 139 rather than clause 140? I seek your
guidance, Mr. Pope, because although the offences are listed
in clause 139, the relevant amendment is to clause
140.</div><a name="09070263000026"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000157"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I am grateful for that point of order. As the
hon. Gentleman said, we will come to that amendment in the next clause.
That will be the correct place for us to have the appropriate debate.
It is not necessary to have that debate now, given that we can have it
in a few seconds.</div>
<a name="09070263000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
140</h4><a name="09070263000007"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Offence
of damaging etc protected features of
MCZs</div><a name="09070263000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000158"></a><b class="B">Andrew
George</b> (St. Ives) (LD): I beg to move amendment
39, in
clause 140, page 95, line 8, leave
out &#145;kills or injures&#146; and insert &#145;kills, injures
or disturbs&#146;.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div><a name="09070263000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would add the word &#147;disturbs&#148; to subsection (2). Although
many conservation bodies welcome the general offence of damaging the
protected features of the MCZ, there is a desire to explore the
possibility that the provision as currently drafted is insufficient to
protect the features of MCZs as intended. The worry is that the
provision will provide a loophole unless &#147;disturbs&#148; is
added, as features and animals that should be protected may be
disturbed; they will not be as well protected as was originally
intended. As drafted, the general offence still does not cover
disturbance to the features of the MCZ. Disturbance can be very
damaging, but it is much harder, on a case-by-case basis, to prove that
that damage exists than that disturbance has occurred.</div>
<a name="09070263000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause should refer
to disturbance of any animal in an MCZ that is a protected feature of
that MCZ. As the Minister will know, that would also have the benefit
of bringing the Bill into line with the provisions for sites of special
scientific interest and those in the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981.</div>
<a name="09070263000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern that marine mammals that are identified&#151;this is the
critical factor&#151;as a protected feature of an MCZ, such as
cetaceans, dolphins, porpoises, seabirds and sea ducks, will be
disturbed and move away from the source of the disturbance. That may
cause them to suffer because they will be unable to feed adequately or
will come under increasing stress, and the likelihood of their
continuing to thrive will diminish. Such things can have a lasting
negative impact on the animals&#146; ability to grow, reproduce and
survive.</div><a name="09070263000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Disturbance
can be caused by a wide variety of marine activities, such as fishing,
dredging, marine construction, and oil and gas exploration and
production. In some cases, it can even be caused by certain
recreational activities, such as swimming, diving and boating. There
are even cases where cetaceans have been disturbed by boats coming too
close to them. On Second Reading, I argued that there is a case for
looking carefully at the impact of sonar, particularly in the case of
cetaceans, and the Minister may like to reflect on that. We would not
want to constrain the activities or training carried out by our
Ministry of Defence vessels, but it is worth looking at the impact that
some of those activities might have on cetaceans. For seabirds,
disturbance can be particularly damaging at certain sensitive times.
For example, when birds are feeding, roosting, breeding or moulting,
they will be more sensitive to the effects of disturbance.</div>
<a name="09070263000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important to note that including &#147;disturbance&#148; in
subsection (2) does not turn all activities that could result in
disturbance into offences. If the disturbance affects only animals that
are not named features of the MCZ, or if it will not significantly
hinder the achievement of the MCZ&#146;s conservation objectives, no
offence will have been committed. The amendment is not, therefore, a
simple, all-encompassing provision that makes any kind of disturbance
an
offence.</div><a name="09070263000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is welcome that clause 129 can be used to prohibit disturbance to
animals or plants of any description in an MCZ. That is an improvement
on previous nature conservation byelaws and it is broader than the
inclusion of &#147;disturbance&#148; in the general offence would
be, because it refers to animals or plants and does not rely on the
subject of the disturbance being a named feature of the
MCZ.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="09070263000128"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09070263000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the ability to control disturbance in MCZs through byelaws is very
useful, some conservation bodies do not consider the provisions to be
sufficient as currently drafted. In particular, byelaw provisions under
the Bill extend to only 12 nautical miles. Without byelaw-making
powers, there is still a need for protection of offshore waters from
activities that cause disturbances that pose a risk to the MCZ
objectives. Therefore, the system clearly needs to be complemented with
the general offence in waters beyond 12 nautical miles.</div>
<a name="09070263000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
concern that it is hard to prove that disturbance has occurred and the
provision will be particularly hard to enforce, as I have mentioned,
beyond 12 nautical miles. However, it will be equally hard to prove
that disturbance has occurred in contravention to a specific byelaw,
unless the byelaw imposes a blanket ban on a particular activity
thought to be capable of causing a disturbance. In many cases, it would
be disproportionate to completely ban an activity on the grounds that,
if done recklessly or irresponsibly, it could cause a disturbance.
Enforcement in the marine area, particularly in offshore waters, is
clearly going to be challenging, but that is a universal problem for
all offshore activities. I know that organisations which are concerned
about strengthening the clause do not believe that that should be used
as an excuse to avoid regulation in the marine environment.</div>
<a name="09070263000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will appreciate that the purpose of the
amendment is to both probe the Government&#146;s intentions and to
seek clarity. Given the current drafting of the clause,
there is a deep and justifiable concern that a disturbance of the type
I have described could have a knock-on effect and damage those features
that the MCZs have been created to protect. They will be damaged not
simply through the killing or injuring of any animal, as the animals
may well, as it were, experience their own demise, or be significantly
injured by the kind of disturbing activities that I have
described.</div>
<a name="09070263000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do all the
Government agencies that advised the Minister on the drafting of the
clause, particularly Natural England, take the view that, as currently
drafted, it is sufficient to provide adequate protection to animals in
designated MCZs? Are there more exacting demands in having to prove
that an animal has been killed or, in law, having to prove a definition
of &#147;injury&#148;, rather than the offence of
&#147;disturbance&#148;? That will clearly require a much higher
evidential level of definition. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response. This is an important area, which clearly needs to be explored
further.</div><a name="09070263000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000159"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Richard Benyon</b> (Newbury) (Con): This is an interesting
amendment, which comes down to the definition of the word
&#147;disturbed&#148;&#151;the previous word in clause
140 is &#147;recklessly&#148;. &#147;Disturbed&#148; has a very
wide descriptive meaning. I am constantly disturbed by the thoughts and
actions of my children&#151;and sometimes by those of my
colleagues&#151;but that is not relevant in this context. We have to
think about the impact on an MCZ, because we could be limiting actions
in an MCZ in the wrong sort of
way.</div><a name="09070263000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am inclined to support the hon. Member for St. Ives,
provided that we do not damage the kind of activities that we want to
see in MCZs. For example, tourism, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div>even eco-tourism, could in certain circumstances be described as
disturbing wildlife in the marine environment. Certain sustainable
fishing activities, such as recreational angling, could be permissible
in or close to a MCZ, but they could be described in a pedantic
following of the letter of the law as damaging. I support the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention and look forward to the Minister&#146;s
words on the impact that it will have, because I do not want unintended
consequences in the protection provided to
MCZs.</div><a name="09070263000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000160"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Jones</b> (Clwyd, West) (Con): I want to draw the
Minister&#146;s attention to the representations that I have received
from the CCW&#151;I am sure that the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West
and South Pembrokeshire will be pleased to hear that he does not have
the monopoly on correspondence with that body. The CCW is an adviser to
the Welsh Assembly Government on the Bill and other matters. It takes
the view that clause 142 should be expanded to include disturbance of
an MCZ. Its point, which the hon. Member for St. Ives has also made, is
that that would be more intellectually coherent, because it would
create a degree of uniformity with offences relating to SSSIs. Since we
are talking about conservation of sensitive sites&#151;whether marine
or land-based&#151;it is appropriate to introduce intellectual
coherence into the Bill. I am interested to hear what the Minister has
to say about
it.</div><a name="09070263000042"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000161"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I will not repeat what the hon. Member for Clwyd,
West has said. We have both received the same communications, and I am
sure that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has also received
correspondence from the CCW.</div>
<a name="09070263000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am chairman
of the Pembrokeshire coastal forum, which was set up nearly 10 years
ago as a secretariat to bring together the public and private sectors,
statutory agencies, individuals and charities to look at coastal issues
in Pembrokeshire. At our AGM on Monday, I asked members whether the
issue of disturbance should be in the Bill. They have all been avidly
watching the progress of the Bill and all said reference should be made
to disturbance.</div>
<a name="09070263000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Pembrokeshire coastal forum includes the outdoor charter group&#151;a
range of 26 companies offering activity-based holidays on the
Pembrokeshire coast. They have come together to produce the outdoor
charter, which is aimed at protection and minimising disturbance. They
are not just companies that take tourists round Ramsey island to see
porpoise and seals. There are also organisations offering surfing and
coasteering, field study council people&#151;anyone who is involved
in activity on the coast. It is a voluntary charter, and it has been
self-policed and self-regulated surprisingly well, but the charter
group admits that even its members occasionally cause unnecessary
disturbance, which is sorted out between them.</div>
<a name="09070263000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that there will be literally hundreds, and at times thousands, of
other individuals on the coast&#151;on jet skis, for
example&#151;who are not there under the guidance of one of those
companies, and they can, and do, cause serious disturbance. The charter
group feels that the voluntary code, which has been worked out over the
years and appears to be working well, should be given some teeth, so
that it can be used 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>to regulate those individuals or groups not currently under the guidance
of the signatories to the outdoor charter and so that enforcement can
take place. It feels that we need to do more on that disturbance
issue.</div><a name="09070263000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
know that that is not on the face of the Bill and am sure that the
Minister will say that it can be included in byelaws, but I want an
assurance that that matter will definitely be taken seriously, because
disturbance can be just as damaging as the injuring, or even killing,
of a marine mammal. If there is constant disturbance from jet skis
during the seal pupping season, not only could pups die as a result,
but that area might not be used by seals as a pupping site again.
Disturbance is just as important an issue as the killing or injuring of
marine animals, or any sort of animal. I would be grateful if the
Minister were to respond positively and assure people across the board
that disturbance is seen as an important issue, because people feel
that it should be in the
Bill.</div><a name="09070263000129"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

the Great Barrier reef for the breeding season and has been spotted off
the coast of Australia. The Australian environment ministry has said
that no one may approach within 500 m of the whale or fly
lower than 600 m above it. I draw Members&#146; attention to that to
demonstrate that the question of disturbance is one not only for the
British Government, but for Governments across the world who are trying
to protect their marine animals&#151;yes, I have been lobbied by the

proposal has been imposed in other parts of the world, so it would not
be new for Britain, but it is something from which we could gain
experience and which we could implement in this country through the
Bill.</div><a name="09070263000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000163"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Ann
McKechin):</b> Good morning, Mr Pope. I welcome the
contributions that have been made in this interesting debate.</div>
<a name="09070263000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Four features
that need careful examination define the debate: one is the definition
of disturbance, as the hon. Member for Newbury has mentioned; the
second is what level of fines is appropriate; the third is what is
proportionate to the offence; and the fourth, which is quite important,
is the standard of proof.</div>
<a name="09070263000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw hon.
Members&#146; attention to subsection (2)(b) which specifies that
someone is guilty of an offence under the clause if, at the time of
doing the act in
question,</div><a name="09070263000124"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
person knows, or ought to have known, that the feature to which the act
relates is in, or forms part of, an
MCZ&#148;.</div><a name="09070263000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a high standard of proof, relating to what we call, in law, mens
rea. It is necessary to show the mental intention behind the act, as
well as the physical act 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>itself. That high standard of proof would, by definition, limit the
prospects for prosecution, in comparison with the much lower standards
of proof found in
byelaws.</div><a name="09070263000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee that considered the Bill stated in paragraph 79 of its
recommendations:</div><a name="09070263000125"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
recommend that the Government insert the general offence referred to in
the Marine Bill White Paper of damaging or destroying any species or
habitat or other feature, for which a site has been designated an
MCZ.&#148;</div><a name="09070263000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have done precisely that. We have reinstated the general
offence provision, which will help to prevent deliberate and reckless
acts of damage to a marine conservation zone.</div>
<a name="09070263000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
explain why we and the Joint Committee did not want to widen the
general offence to include disturbance. Acts of disturbance will be an
occasional and serious problem, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire has pointed out, but they are
fundamentally different from deliberate or reckless damage. It is
important that the Bill reflects that, because, as my hon. Friend has
said, many incidents of disturbance are sorted out without prosecution
by voluntary codes. That is somewhat different from incidents involving
reckless damage or death. There is a difference in the definition,
depending on the incident.</div>
<a name="09070263000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
comes down, first, to the difference in severity of the impact of what
is done. Disturbance might, for example, be caused by people straying
too close to a group of animals through innocent curiosity, although I
think that if I saw a humpback whale I would move well back.
Alternatively, the disturbance might come about because of an organised
wildlife watching trip or through the use of machinery that emits a
loud noise. A single act of disturbance is likely to have a temporary
effect and will often be entirely accidental. In contrast, intentional
or reckless acts of damage are likely to have longer-term and more
permanent
effects.</div><a name="09070263000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
what constitutes disturbance will depend on the protected features and
conservation objectives of each MCZ. Byelaws provide a proportionate
and effective mechanism to target specific activities in local areas
and accordingly are the right way to control acts of disturbance in a
MCZ, as opposed to areas of special scientific interest, which are in
highly protected areas. MCZs often cover a wider spectrum of protection
needs. That is why clause 129(3)(e) specifically states that byelaws
may be made to prohibit or restrict the</div>
<a name="09070263000126"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;killing,
taking, destruction, molestation or disturbance of animals of plants of
any description in the
MCZ&#148;.</div><a name="09070263000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
give an example of that, an MCZ might be designated to ensure the
protection of sea birds. The byelaw provisions in the Bill will allow
us to provide targeted protection against disturbance and to impose
movement restrictions at certain times of the year. Breeding seasons
and nesting periods, which various hon. Members have alluded to this
morning, are also relevant. Restrictions would thus be the minimum
necessary and would be drafted to specify the offences and to be
clearly understood by
everyone.</div><a name="09070263000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
byelaws will often be the most effective means of protecting a site
from the general offence. That is because byelaws create strict
liability offences. Prosecution under a byelaw will depend on proving
not that an anticipated result occurred, but that a prohibited
activity, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>such as movement within a protected area, took place. In contrast,
prosecution under the general offence would depend on being able to
prove that the defendant intentionally or recklessly carried out a
prohibited act that significantly hindered&#151;or could have
significantly hindered&#151;MCZ objectives. That is, again, a high
level of proof. The hurdle is lower for proving breach of a
byelaw.</div><a name="09070263000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are fully committed to preventing disturbance within MCZs, where there
is scientific evidence to suggest that such an approach is required. I
do not want to pre-empt the scientific evidence by suggesting that all
conservation zones will need to be protected from disturbance, but I
will reassure hon. Members on various points raised in this
debate.</div><a name="09070263000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for St. Ives correctly pointed out that the byelaws extend
to only 12 nautical miles. However, clause 124 contains a duty on
public authorities to ensure that they must do their best to further
the achievement of conservation objectives, including those relating to
the impacts of sonar and other activities. Activities beyond 12 miles
are generally licensable and controlled through the mechanism in part 4
of the Bill. I assure him that sonar can be regulated through the
licensing provisions and the nature of conservation byelaws. All public
authorities, including the Ministry of Defence, will be subject to the
byelaw restrictions in inshore areas and are under a duty in inshore
and offshore waters to further conservation objectives. Under the Bill,
nature conservation bodies can offer guidance on
that.</div><a name="09070263000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for St. Ives also mentioned Natural England&#146;s
evidence. Natural England has stated that in the vast majority of cases
in SSSIs, writing to people to advise them that they may be in breach
of byelaws and subject to a fine is the most effective way to deter
further
breaches.</div><a name="09070263000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000164"></a>Andrew
George:</b> On the effectiveness of existing regulations, will
the Minister clarify whether the introduction of the Bill, as drafted,
will either diminish or remove existing levels of protection available
through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended? I understand
that last year a conviction was successfully brought against
individuals in a case involving the disturbance of cetaceans off the
Kent coast. It would be interesting to know whether the Bill will
lessen the ability of authorities to obtain such
convictions.</div><a name="09070263000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000165"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill will
not remove protections to that effect contained in existing
legislation. It is certainly not our intention to weaken existing
protections.</div>
<a name="09070263000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire
mentioned the good work of the Pembrokeshire coastal forum. I confirm
that the Marine Management Organisation must consult such groups under
clause 136(6) and (7). It is certainly our intention&#151;it is
implicit&#151;that when it comes to considering byelaws, local
organisations on the ground should be fully involved in the
consultation on what is best. Their local knowledge will be valuable in
that
regard.</div><a name="09070263000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly,
I believe that the Bill, as it stands, provides a proportionate and
flexible way of dealing with disturbance and the right level of
sanctions. I hope that on the basis of what I have said, the hon.
Member for St. Ives will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="09070263000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000166"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. She
drew attention in her response, as I did in my opening remarks, to
clause 129 and the provisions available there for the creation of
byelaws to add further protections in respect of the intentional and
reckless disturbance of animals that contributes to their demise. That
is reassuring.</div>
<a name="09070263000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A lot of the
bodies that are concerned that the Bill, as drafted, does not contain a
general offence as proposed in the amendment are worried because
achieving the attachment of protection from reckless and intentional
disturbance will now depend on the successful introduction of byelaws,
with all the various hurdles over which byelaws must inevitably go,
including the Secretary of State. The hon. Member for Newbury rightly
emphasised that we are not talking about&#151;as the Minister
described, I think, in her response&#151;simple, innocent curiosity
without the intention to disturb or contribute to the demise of an
animal, but about a reckless or intentional disturbance that would have
a lasting impact on an animal. I hope that the Minister will
acknowledge that a case similar to one that I referred to in an earlier
intervention&#151;I shall not mention names, as the matter is on the
record&#151;could be dealt with through byelaws, if, for example,
there is an intention to protect particular cetaceans within an
MCZ.</div><a name="09070263000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000167"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments;
he has made some good points. To reiterate what we have already said:
we see the MMO as a proactive body. We do not think that there will be
any reluctance to create byelaws; the body will have a duty to do so
under conservation objectives. Byelaws are implicitly the means to
achieve such ends. We anticipate the MMO carrying out exactly the type
of activity that the hon. Gentleman has discussed and dealing with the
need for protection, which will be the core of its work. I
hope that I have reassured the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09070263000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000168"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I think that all parties want to see such an
organisation&#151;a proactive body that is keen to be responsive to
the concerns expressed by stakeholders, including conservation bodies
that wish to uphold the principles and objectives of designating an
area an MCZ. In the case off the Kent coast, a conviction was
successfully enforced on 16 April 2008, and it is worth reflecting on
that example.</div>
<a name="09070263000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
previous year, the two gentlemen who were convicted for that offence
had been involved in trying to lift a bottlenose dolphin out of the
water by holding on to its dorsal fin. The animal was not injured or
killed, but the impact on it was long lasting. The police were called
and the men were arrested and charged with recklessly disturbing a
dolphin under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, as amended. Our
amendment seeks to ensure that reckless and intentional disturbance can
ideally be made a general offence, because once a marine conservation
zone has been designated, it is clear which features and animals are to
be
protected.</div><a name="09070263000130"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09070263000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have listened to the Minister, and I hope that she will take on board
the concerns expressed. Providing that we can be reassured, as the Bill
goes through its later stages, that there will be little or no
obstruction to legislating for the kind of byelaws that we need to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>provide that kind of protection, I am happy to have had the debate and
probed the issue and to have received the assurances that the Minister
has offered so far. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09070263000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000169"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> I beg to move amendment 18, in
clause 141, page 96, line 2, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(3A) It is a
defence for a person who is charged with an offence under section 139
to show that that person took all reasonable precautions and exercised
all due diligence to avoid the commission of the
offence.&#146;.</div><a name="09070263000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems at times that we are coming at the Bill from different
directions. I do not apologise for that because this is all about
getting the balance right. I have been persuaded by many arguments made
by some of the organisations lobbying us&#151;both greens and those
more concerned with socio-economic factors, which shows the nature of
the Bill; we have to ensure that we get the balance right.</div>
<a name="09070263000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">In moving the
amendment, I hope to debate whether it is appropriate for a breach of a
byelaw or order made on an MCZ to be a strict liability offence.
Offences of strict liability are those crimes that do not require
awareness of one or more elements of the guilty act; therefore, to be
convicted, the defendant need not have intended to commit the offence
or known that what they were doing was an offence. As the Bill stands,
MCZs will clearly have an impact on navigation. They will not
necessarily be marked with physical aids, as we discussed earlier this
week, so there will not by any buoys or markers on the sea and perhaps
not a recording on the relevant navigational charts. In the absence of
such demarcation, it seems short-sighted not to include a defence for a
person who takes all reasonable precautions and exercises all due
diligence to avoid committing the offence. The language reflects that
used in clause 104 on marine licensing. Proposed new clause 141(3A)
does not need to apply to clause 140 because that relates only to acts
committed &#147;intentionally or recklessly&#148;.</div>
<a name="09070263000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The longer I
look at the clause, the more concerned I become about the sea-fishing
defence in clause 141(4)(a)(i). I know, Mr. Pope, that you
do not want me to start a debate that belongs to a later amendment, but
this is important. It seems incongruous to whack a yacht or a ship that
inadvertently breaks a byelaw in an MCZ with the full force of the law,
regardless of it having done all in its power to avoid committing the
offence, while those who are fishing and may not have taken reasonable
steps to avoid damage, appear to have an instant defence. That is
inconsistent. I firmly believe that the majority of fishermen will do
all that they can to avoid the offence, but there may be one or two,
and they might not be our own fishermen, who come into our waters and
damage an MCZ. It is important to look at these matters, and, perhaps
in the context of later aspects of the clause, clarify the position
when there is no intention to damage an
MCZ.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000170"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> When I first saw the amendment, I thought back
many years ago to when I was studying law at university and the
wonderful case from, I think, the 19th century. While a chap was away
at sea, a law was changed at Westminster. He came back, went onshore
and duly committed the said statutory offence. He gave as a defence the
fact that he could not have known about the change in the law. That was
absolutely correct. Regrettably, the finding was that ignorance of the
law was not an excuse, although it is probably a pretty good plea in
mitigation.</div>
<a name="09070263000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the amendment, most activities in the sea are carefully regulated.
Some, however, have traditionally been considered to have such a low
impact on the environment that there is no need to regulate them. We
now know that in some circumstances even these activities can have an
adverse impact on conservation objectives&#151;we are talking in the
main about recreational activities such as boating, jet skiing, which
my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire
mentioned earlier, and diving. The byelaw provisions for this part of
the Bill are intended to enable us to regulate those activities as
necessary.</div><a name="09070263000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Offences
under MMO byelaws will be strict liability offences. We had an
interesting discussing on the previous amendment about proof,
successful prosecutions and the consequent deterrent effect. This is
consistent with treatment of some other offences elsewhere under the
Bill such as byelaws made by inshore fisheries and conservation
authorities and other legislation for regulatory offences. Examples of
possible offences are speeding, anchoring in a prohibited area or
taking prohibited species when diving. I entirely understand where the
aim of the amendment and the concerns raised by the Royal Yachting
Association. We do not want to make criminals of those who take all
reasonable steps to comply with the
law.</div><a name="09070263000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000171"></a><b class="B">Linda
Gilroy</b> (Plymouth, Sutton) (Lab/Co-op): When the hon.
Member for Newbury was making the case for the amendment I could see
that he was trying to strike a balance. He drew attention to a certain
inconsistency with other parts of the Bill. Rather than reject it
outright, would my hon. Friend the Minister take the amendment away and
have another look at
it?</div><a name="09070263000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000172"></a>Ann
McKechin:</b> I hope that my later comments will reassure my
hon. Friend. If an offence was not clear or a person cannot reasonably
have known he was committing the offence, the chances of securing a
conviction would be very low. It would be very unlikely to be in the
public interest to prosecute. At the same time, we do not think that
the Bill is the right place to include due diligence provisions,
because it is better addressed through the secondary legislation
itself.</div>
<a name="09070263000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power to
make byelaws is broad enough to enable the MMO to provide a due
diligence defence in specific byelaws where that is appropriate. Other
relevant areas of legislation have already taken this approach. For
example, some harbour byelaws and the byelaws for lakes such as
Windermere both specify the geographical area in which they apply,
similar to the way in which the MMO byelaws will, and contain a due
diligence defence. I can tell the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend
that if a due diligence defence is necessary and appropriate in a
byelaw, it will be included. I hope that provides sufficient
reassurance for the hon. Gentleman to enable him to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000173"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> In a sense, the debate on this amendment will be
balanced by a debate that we shall shortly have on another amendment.
It is important to lay down a marker showing that there are legitimate
activities that take place in our seas and that there are industries
that we want to encourage for a whole range of reasons. We want to be
absolutely certain that we are not creating an unfair and inconsistent
law. The Minister made a good point about developing this in secondary
legislation. I am nervous about setting that precedent through the
Bill, because it is subjective and dependent on all sorts of other
factors. However, I shall withdraw the amendment so we can move on to
the next debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000174"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I beg to move amendment 35, in
clause 141, page 96, line 11, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) the act
occurred on the seaward side of the 0-6 nautical mile
fisheries zone in a location where European vessels have fishing
rights.&#146;.</div><a name="09070263000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment stands in my name and the names of my hon. Friend the Member
for Reading, West and of the hon. Member for Broxbourne. It touches on
a very contentious issue that was raised on Second Reading by Members
on both sides of the House. The Bill contains a blanket defence for
causing damage within an MCZ if that was the result of sea fishing and
if there was no reasonable way of avoiding it. I think that everyone
was surprised that the Bill contains such a broad defence. Many
organisations have contacted us to raise their concerns and have acted
constructively to try to address the issue, which is what my amendment,
too, seeks to do. We recognise that, at this stage, no substantial
changes can be made in areas covered exclusively by the common
fisheries policy. However, the amendment, or something similar, would
address the situation in inshore fishing areas&#151;the nought to 6
nautical mile zones&#151;and in 6to 12 nautical mile areas with no
track record of foreign vessels being allowed to fish.</div>
<a name="09070263000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment
might not be worded perfectly, but I think that the Minister
understands the need to address the problem. Marine habitats have been
drastically damaged by some sea fishing activities. We have mentioned
in previous debates the effect of scallop dredging in Cardigan bay, but
there are many other examples around the UK of the activities, often
not of British fisherman&#151;certainly not of British inshore
fishermen&#151;but of fisherman from other countries, that have
devastated habitats, not just of other species, but of their target
species. Such areas are, in effect, deserts. I could give other
examples from around the world, such as the Grand Banks off
Newfoundland, where over-fishing removed a whole stock that for
centuries provided massive amounts of fish for northern Europe and
north
America.</div><a name="09070263000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment would make it clear that the blanket defence is not
acceptable and that sea fishing has to be compliant with the
requirements of the MCZs. We could address the problem by limiting the
CFP to specific areas. Although the amendment might not be worded
perfectly, I hope that the Minister will respond
positively.</div><a name="09070263000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000175"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I want to comment on the primary objective in the
identification of an offence. The thinking behind exempting fishing
from prosecution might have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>been that, given that the purpose of fishing is to target a particular
species, or species in a mixed fishery, it would be difficult to prove
that damage to a feature or animal within an MCZ was either intentional
or the result of reckless behaviour on the part of the people using the
fishery. Would the hon. Gentleman like to respond to that in relation
to mid-water trawling, for example? He has mentioned scallop dredging,
but what about fishing activities such as mid-water trawling, which are
clearly intended to target a particular species, but in which there is
no intentionality or recklessness to damage an MCZ feature through that
activity?</div><a name="09070263000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000176"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I gently remind the Committee that
interventions must be brief and to the
point.</div><a name="09070263000131"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09070263000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000177"></a>Nick
Ainger:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point.
Certainly, mid-water trawling should not cause problems on the sea bed,
but he knows as well as I do that some techniques cause significant
damage to the sea bed. Some forms of trawling use a chain, which churns
up the surface of the sea bed, causing enormous damage to areas of sea
grass and maerl. I accept that certain techniques should not cause
damage; they are fine, and are not a problem. It is the techniques that
do cause damage that are a problem. The argument about reasonableness
is interesting, because, often, alternative techniques could be used. I
recently saw a demonstration of people fishing for razor fish, or razor
clams&#151;this will be a short digression, Mr.
Pope&#151;by passing an electric current over the sea bed. For some
reason, that causes them to pop up, and they are then harvested without
any damage to the sea bed. There are therefore other techniques for
targeting particular species.</div>
<a name="09070263000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
my amendment, we need to address this issue, because the blanket
defence is too widely drawn. I am sure that we can come up with a
better wording, but if we do not address this issue, we risk
undermining the concept of MCZs, because commercial fishing is likely
to cause the most damage within them, and if we allow this widely drawn
blanket defence, we risk undermining the whole
process.</div>
<a name="09070263000096"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000178"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Charles Walker</b> (Broxbourne) (Con): I rise to support the
amendment. I served on the Joint Committee on the Draft Marine Bill,
and it was of great concern to me that while we had the best intentions
of conserving marine areas and sites of special scientific interest and
protecting them from over-exploitation, we were operating under the
aegis of the European common fisheries policy, which would allow
European fishermen to continue trawling those areas, creating mayhem
and destruction at will.</div>
<a name="09070263000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
extremely pleased that the hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment,
because we are in a position to protect not only inshore
areas&#151;nought to 6 miles from the shore&#151;but areas that are
6 to 12 miles from the shore, where there is no traditional access for
European fishery vessels. The Bill currently provides too much of a
blanket defence. Anybody who fishes in the marine conservation zones
will be able to say, &#147;There is no other method or way that I can
do it, but I&#146;m terribly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column98" />Column number: 98</div>sorry that I have caused this damage and taken non-target
species.&#148; In a sense, one could drive a coach and horses through
this piece of legislation. If MCZs are to mean anything, they have to
provide sanctuary and safety for the species, plants and corals within
them.</div>
<a name="09070263000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, we
do not want to create a situation in which nothing can happen in MCZs
and no types of fishing can occur in them. We need to ensure that
sustainable fisheries that do not cause damage are allowed to continue,
because if MCZs are to have the support of the public and the
communities who border them, we have to allow those communities to
derive some commercial benefit from them. We also have to strike a
balance between commercial fishing and low-intensity recreational
fishing. It is more than possible for recreational fishing to take
place in the areas under discussion without causing damage. Of course,
the captains of boats that embark on recreational fishing will need to
ensure that their anchors do not drag through areas of special interest
and cause damage, but that is manageable. Naturally, anyone who derives
a sustainable living from conservation zones will want to ensure their
future
integrity.</div><a name="09070263000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not try your patience, Mr. Pope, because I do not want
to stray too far from the amendment. If I do, please rule me out of
order, but I do not think that I will do so. We accept that MCZs will
provide important nursery areas for endangered species. For example, we
have a growing bass fishery around our shores, but we need to ensure
that there are places where bass can breed in relative safety. There is
a danger in that it is difficult to have a nursery area where
commercial fishing takes place, because, even though the bass may not
be the targeted species, they will end up in the nets of fishing
trawlers and will ultimately be discarded. The bass may go back into
the sea, but they will be dead. We therefore need to make sure that the
MCZs provide nursery areas for endangered species that can then go on
to populate the surrounding areas, which will be of benefit to
commercial fishermen. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire therefore offers a win-win
situation.</div><a name="09070263000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, we need to think globally, but act locally. We are globally
aware. For example, the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, which
is in south Wales, not New South Wales, is very concerned about
whales&#151;that was very tortuous&#151;on all sorts of levels. At
a time when the World Wide Fund for Nature and others are bringing to
our attention the parlous state of tuna stocks around the world, and
the need to protect them and to provide safe areas for them to breed
where they cannot be persecuted, it would be a rum deal if this country
could not create a few MCZs that provide the necessary levels of
protection for our own marine species to breed in safety. As I have
said, they will be able breed in safety, the young will grow, and they
will then be able to populate the wider area to the benefit of the
species, to the benefit of animals that prey on the species and to the
benefit of commercial fishermen. I support the amendment, and even if
the Government have to go away and think about it, I hope that they
will return on Report with something that we can all
support.</div><a name="09070263000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000179"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Alan Whitehead</b> (Southampton, Test) (Lab): If a small plane
took off from Southampton airport, flew over the New Forest national
park and dropped a large 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column99" />Column number: 99</div>net in the middle at tree-top height in order to catch pigeons to sell
in the restaurants of Southampton, and in doing so uprooted a load of
trees and caught thrushes, blue tits and starlings, and then returned
to Southampton airport, emptied the catch, discarded all the thrushes,
blue tits and starlings, took the pigeons to the restaurants,
apologised for the fact that it had uprooted a lot of trees, but said
that that had been necessary in order to catch the pigeons, there would
be a national outcry. There might also be a headline in the local paper
asking why the trees had been
uprooted.</div><a name="09070263000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is exactly what we appear to be enabling to happen, in a nautical
sense, between nought and 6 miles in MCZs off our shores, but because
we cannot see it in the way that I have just described, our attention
may not be as concentrated on it. I accept that there are areas outside
the 6-mile zone where it is difficult to take action. However, if we
can state in the Bill that it is not a defence in the nought to 6-mile
zone for someone to say that they churned up the seabed in pursuit of
fishing, we will have done something very positive for the sound
passage of the
Bill.</div><a name="09070263000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even
if the wording of the amendment is not exactly right, I urge my hon.
Friend the Minister to pay close attention to what it says, because it
is right. If he is able today at least to say that he will consider the
matter and perhaps return at a later stage of the Bill with something
that works as far as the purpose of the amendment is concerned, hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee will be reassured that the Bill
will be as good as it can be when it reaches the statute
book.</div><a name="09070263000104"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09070263000180"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): I rise to
support my colleagues and the amendment. However, I can tell you,
Mr. Pope, that I will not be as elaborate and descriptive as
my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test in making the case. The
point that he made is absolutely valid, although obviously we are
considering the nautical and marine aspect of what he described. I am
anxious about the matter. As other hon. Members said, we must address
the issue of a blanket defence. In supporting the amendment, I
recognise that it is never easy to convince our good colleagues on the
Front Bench that an amendment is 100 per cent. spot-on and that we
should win the case. However, if we are sincere and genuine about the
value of marine conservation zones, we must ensure that whatever else
is in the Bill, we are not doing something that will undermine the very
idea behind the
Bill.</div><a name="09070263000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Certain
aspects of the clause seem somewhat anomalous. In view of that, I shall
echo the sentiments of my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test
and hope that if Ministers do not accept what has been proposed, they
will at least take the issue away for further serious consideration,
because it is a serious
issue.</div><a name="09070263000106"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000181"></a>Andrew
George:</b> The amendment clearly implies that the
geographical target is between the 6 and 12-mile zone, unless I have
misunderstood it, yet many of the comments so far relate to areas
within the 6-mile zone. I want to make it clear that we are talking
specifically about the 6 to 12-mile zone being affected. I want to
understand why the amendment would not deal with any area either within
the 6-mile zone or beyond the 12-mile zone.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div><a name="09070263000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000182"></a>Mr.
Brown:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct. I shall finish by
re-emphasising to the Ministers that if they are not minded to accept
the amendment, I sincerely hope that they will take the issue away for
further serious consideration at a later
stage.</div><a name="09070263000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000183"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> One frustration of the Bill is that we could end
up securing and protecting large areas of our seas from our own
fishermen, but fishermen with historic fishing rights from abroad will
be able to come in and fish more or less as they please. This matter
must be seen in the context of CFP reform. We have to reach an
understanding across Europe that the only way successfully to manage
fisheries is to control them. A much greater degree of control of our
seas out to 12 miles must be the ultimate aim of CFP reform as we
approach
2012.</div><a name="09070263000132"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15
am</div><a name="09070263000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
solution that must have crossed Members&#146; minds would be to
remove subsection (4), but I understand why such an amendment has not
been moved. I have heard informally that the Minister will say that the
clause must remain part of the Bill because its provisions are a
fundamental part of European law, and that the Government do not want
to contravene it. We want the Government to assure us that they have
heard our serious concerns and are taking steps to secure MCZs from the
few fishermen who might be inclined to misbehave in those areas. We
should not protect our marine areas only from our own fishermen; those
from other parts of the EU who enter an MCZ and break the law by
damaging the area should be guilty of a criminal
offence.</div><a name="09070263000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000184"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that if that is not the
case, the Bill will be nothing more than a few nice ideas, and that it
will remain so? Our fishermen will be forced to sit on their hands, and
there will be a great sense of animosity as European vessels plunder
the conservation
zones.</div><a name="09070263000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000185"></a>Mr.
Benyon:</b> We must not put all fishermen in the same bracket.
We shall come later to an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for St.
Ives that refers to coastal communities. Many coastal communities are
hanging on by their fingertips, so we should be protecting those people
in a vast social endeavour in order to secure their
viability.</div>
<a name="09070263000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Broxbourne is right that our fishermen could be
restrained; they want to fish in an entirely proper fashion, and they
want their children and their grandchildren to become fishermen and
harvest the seas in a sustainable fashion. The risk is that
restrictions are being placed on them, but not on fishermen from abroad
with historic fishing rights. It is vital that the Government clarify
the matter.</div>
<a name="09070263000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000186"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I wish to add a few remarks to this important
debate. It is a subject to which I drew attention on Second Reading. We
need to balance what we are trying to achieve in the Bill&#151;its
primary purpose is the promotion of marine conservation&#151;and
ensuring that our coastal communities, particularly those that depend
upon the fishing industry for their commercial future, are maintained.
It is must be done with care.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div><a name="09070263000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
clearly does not address the sentiment expressed by those who are
promoting it. From the geographical point of view, if one wants to
ensure that fishing is not exempted from the provisions of the clause,
the intention&#151;the sentiment&#151;must be to ensure that they
are applied as widely as possible. It should go from the coast to the
median line, or even out to the 200-mile limit. I understand and
entirely sympathise with the sentiment behind the amendment. I am sure
that the Minister will say that the CFP would clearly come into play,
and a lot of the intentions would need to be achieved through
international, member-state-wide, European negotiation. However, simply
restricting the measure to the 6 to 12-mile zone, as the amendment
would, would be rather odd. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to
come back to the
issue.</div><a name="09070263000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
view that that has underpinned many of the remarks that have been made
is that the fishing industry is of one opinion on everything, but there
is a lot of conflict among fishermen regarding different techniques.
For example, scallop dredging is clearly in conflict with lots of other
fishing activities.</div>
<a name="09070263000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000187"></a>Linda
Gilroy:</b> I hope the hon. Gentleman agrees that continental
fishermen, like our own fishermen, have a great interest in
conservation and they are increasingly co-operating. Does he think that
the sort of set-up that we are trying to bring about with the Bill
prepares us for those sorts of discussions with other European
countries?</div>
<a name="09070263000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000188"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I think that that is right. The intention must be
to ensure that such negotiations draw out the best views from other
member states. Some in the fishing industry say that the use of scallop
dredgers and heavy beams is like heavily ploughing an area of land
again and again.</div>
<a name="09070263000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000189"></a>Mr.
Walker:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the amendment
would allow the promotion of best 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>practice in MCZs? Perhaps we will have to help certain fishermen to
change their methods, and we should support them. Our seas are under
huge threat, and if we are to have a voice at international level, we
have to be seen to be making progress in those parts of the ocean where
we can influence fishing
practices.</div><a name="09070263000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09070263000190"></a>Andrew
George:</b> I agree and have no difficulty with that. When the
Minister responds, perhaps this afternoon, I should like some
reassurance that we are talking about the provision of byelaws, which
are currently available to sea fisheries committees, to police the
conflict between different fishing techniques and to take into account
the impact of one fishing technique on the marine biodiversity of an
area. It is important that the provisions focus on the most destructive
and least selective techniques, so we need to look at the clause
again.</div>
<a name="09070263000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to
the point I made in an intervention on the hon. Member for Carmarthen,
West and South Pembrokeshire. In bringing fishing within the provision,
one has to demonstrate that the activity is reckless or intentionally
damaging, which is the most difficult thing to do. Damage to the marine
environment is caused by certain fishing activities and techniques,
which the fishing industry fully acknowledges, but we need to establish
that the intention is to cause damage. I do not think we can do that.
It is a worthwhile debate, but I hope it can be
balanced.</div>

Affairs (Huw Irranca-Davies):</b> It has been a worthwhile
debate. The issue was raised extensively on Second Reading by a number
