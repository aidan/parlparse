<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This morning, Dr. Brand raised a point of order about the unavailability this morning of Hansard's report of last Thursday afternoon's sitting. I undertook to investigate the situation.
<P>
I am informed that a large number of Standing Committees and Westminster Hall met last Tuesday. In the production of Hansard reports, meetings in Westminster Hall take precedence over Standing Committees. Hansard's resources last week were under great strain, and the production of Standing Committee reports fell behind schedule. Hansard apologises for the inconvenience to hon. Members, and the Editor assures me that his department will continue to make very effort to meet hon. Members' expectations of the accurate and prompt production of reports. The Editor also said that should hon. Members want to contact him about this matter, he is always readily available.
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): Further to that point of order, Mr. Illsley. Would you suggest, through your connections in the exalted circles of the Chairman's Panel, that perhaps it is a mistake to give priority to the production of reports of Westminster Hall debates? Hon. Members who sit on Standing Committees need to refer back to debates in previous sittings, but, however interesting are the debates in Westminster Hall, they do not have continuing relevance to the business of the House.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Editor wanted to emphasise that matter in his response to my investigation. I shall refer the matter to the Chairmen's Panel in due course.

Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 56, in clause 10, page 7, line 5, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) Any person who privately fosters a child under the age of 16 years for a consecutive period of 28 days or more without being registered under this Part shall be guilty of an offence'.-[Mr. Shaw.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) and for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson) for raising this matter this morning. I am sure that all Committee members agree that they presented their arguments effectively. I shall respond to the concerns that they, and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand), raised and explain why I cannot accept the amendment, although I shall none the less try to reassure them about the Government's approach in this context and our determination to keep the matter under review.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) raised the concern that the Bill's provisions might mean that the homes of foster carers could be treated as children's homes. We have agreed to many amendments, and I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman for losing sight of one or two amendments that were agreed to at the beginning of our proceedings. I refer him to amendment No. 52. Early on-it may have been the first thing that we did-we sought to tighten up the definition of children's homes in clause 1 to make it clear that the private homes of foster carers would not be treated as children's homes. We need to be clear about which establishments should be under an obligation to register. When we debated that matter, I tried to explain why we felt that it was inappropriate for the homes of foster parents to be subject to the regulations that will apply to children's homes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It is difficult to keep track of all of the amendments that have been agreed to. Is there a distinction between the homes of official foster parents and those of unofficial, private foster parents, whom we discussed this morning? There does not appear to be a clear definition in the Bill that embraces both.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman should go back and look at those amendments. There is a clear distinction between the two. We incorporated into the Bill the Children Act definition of private foster care, so there should be no danger of that eventuality arising.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford raised one other point about what he thought was my noble Friend Lord Hunt's view on private foster caring, when similar amendments were discussed in another place. We have never said that children who are subject to private foster care arrangements are being fostered with their own families. My hon. Friend may have misunderstood what my noble Friend said. Arrangements are often made between families, where the child is being privately fostered and looked after as if he were a member of the family. We cannot say that the majority of such arrangements are between members of the same family. I hope that my hon. Friend did not interpret my noble Friend's views in that way.

<P>
I understand that the concerns of my hon. Friend and of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre are deeply held and in both cases reflect many years' work as social workers in child care, work to which I am happy to pay tribute. The best way that I can respond is to say that we start from the clear recognition that children who have been placed with foster carers are exposed to the risk of abuse. We know that from all our research into abuse of children. Therefore, we start from the clear proposition that the children's home is not the sole focus of the child abuse. We know that from looking at the Waterhouse report, and my hon. Friends will no doubt be aware of that from some aspects of their social care practice. Therefore, we do not approach the issue minimising the risk to children who have been placed in foster care-far from it: we accept that there is a risk. The challenge and the responsibility facing the House is to make sure that that risk is minimised, that effective procedures are in place to tackle those who would abuse children in the first place and that local authorities have sufficient powers to ensure that that does not happen.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford quoted from the response to the Utting report. We made it clear that we did not accept the report's recommendation that we should introduce a system of direct regulation of private foster care arrangements, and we tried to spell out in the report why we felt that that was not appropriate. To put it in a nutshell-I am trying to summarise the arguments and not delay the Committee unduly-we considered the range of powers that local authorities have under the Children Act 1989 to be excessive. My hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre referred to sections 66 and 67 of that Act. Section 69 is also important, because it gives a local authority the power to prevent someone privately fostering a child if they are not satisfied about the child's safety.

<P>
We have always taken the view that the issue is not so much the need to introduce a new set of regulatory arrangements for private foster care as to ensure that the quite extensive powers contained in the Children Act are properly enforced by local authorities. I am sure that he and I would agree that that does not happen-it may be partly a matter of resources for local authorities. I accept that they have other priorities that they need to address. However, no one who looks objectively at the framework of primary legislation could take the view that the powers to deal with these issues are not extensive.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford was right to say that, too often, local authorities are not notified by private foster carers that they are about to receive a child as part of a private foster care arrangement. That is unacceptable. It is a legal requirement under the Children Act 1989 that that notification should take place six weeks before the foster placement begins. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns to local authorities about the operation of the law in this area.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but will he direct his comments more towards the Hansard recording equipment? I understand that the Hansard reporters are having difficulty in picking up his words.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am happy to aim my words at those who need to hear them more clearly. I apologise, Mr. Illsley. I was trying to address my concerns directly to my two hon. Friends. I apologise if I have caused any inconvenience to Hansard reporters.

<P>
In essence, our concerns are that the present arrangements are not being properly enforced, that they are given insufficient focus by local authorities and that there is now an overwhelming case for the regulations to be properly enforced by local authorities, because it is their statutory responsibility.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, who has carefully studied the debates in another place, will have noticed the three actions that my noble Friend the Under-Secretary outlined to their Lordships to improve the situation. It starts with a national publicity campaign. My hon. Friend expressed some cynicism about whether that would work. I hope that it will, because we must ensure that there is greater awareness, and we shall make a significant effort to do so. Secondly, the chief inspector of social services has already written to all social services authorities, reminding them of their responsibilities in relation to private fostering arrangements. Thirdly, this will be followed by a monitoring exercise, including an inspection by the social services inspectorate, of local authorities' enforcement of the private fostering regulations.

<P>
I can make it clear to my hon. Friend that, depending on the outcome of that monitoring exercise, we will take further action if it proves necessary, to ensure that these safeguards for children are properly in place. We certainly do not rule out the need to take further action in this respect, and I am not ruling it out today. He asked me whether clause 39 would give us the flexibility to extend the remit of the National Care Standards Commission. I think that that would be difficult, under the clause as drafted. We shall draft some amendments to the clause, later in the Committee proceedings, to allow us to use the regulation-making power more flexibly. Perhaps we need to look at that point as part of that exercise.

<P>
I hope that I have been able to reassure both my hon. Friends. We do not minimise the risks that children face in these circumstances, and I share my hon. Friends' joint concerns about the existing arrangements and their application by local authorities.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his thoughtful and measured response to the concerns that we have raised. He has rightly pointed out the three new steps that the Government are taking to ensure that local authorities carry out their duties, that they are monitored and properly inspected, and that an eye will be given to the future in case the provisions do not work. Will he also turn his attention to the responsibility placed on private foster carers, to which the amendment refers? Will he assure me that proper arrangements are in place to ensure that people who take on private fostering are aware of their legal obligations, and that there is sufficient force behind them? This area is ripe for paedophiles to exploit, and the whole House should be concerned about this issue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am concerned about that and I know that my hon. Friend is, too. All hon. Members will be concerned about exposing children to the risk of abuse by paedophiles. Some of those concerns will be addressed by the awareness campaign that we are launching, to remind people of their own responsibilities as well as those of local authorities. I accept my hon. Friend's point about being alert to the danger of paedophile abuse.

<P>
We are fighting a war-there is no other way to describe it-and my hon. Friend is right to say that everything that we know about the behaviour of these child sex abusers suggests that they will look for avenues and opportunities to gain contact with children in circumstances that are unregulated or not properly regulated. We know that, and we take it seriously. I can reassure my hon. Friend that we shall actively examine ways of ensuring awareness of the existing framework of legislation and, especially, of emphasising the responsibilities of private foster carers under the Children Act to behave as they are required to do by that legislation.

<P>
In summary, I am grateful to my two hon. Friends for raising these issues, which were also raised in another place. I hope that they have been reassured by the actions that we are currently taking, and by our willingness to look again at the regulation of private fostering if that proves necessary in the light of the SSI inspections that will take place later this year. I hope that my hon. Friends will not find it necessary to divide the Committee on the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his response. I do not intend to divide the Committee on this amendment. I am reassured, especially by his comments that clause 39 might be amended to include the scope for further action to be taken at a later point. If the social services inspectorate re-examines private fostering and finds that there has been no improvement in the matters that it raised in 1993 and that, despite the publicity, private foster carers are not coming forward and notifying local authorities that they are fostering children, we must act.

<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Many of us who spoke on Second Reading asked ourselves whether the provisions are good enough for our families, our elderly relatives and our children. If we put our hands on our hearts, we must admit that enforcement of the current arrangements is not good enough, because people do not come forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre said, we want to close all the loopholes for paedophiles. We are tightening the provisions covering day care and residential care, but we may be widening the net in the provisions covering agencies. Paedophiles are sophisticated operators in an underworld in which no one knows how many children are being looked after. It has been said time and again in the Utting report and by the inspectorate that the regulations are just not good enough.

<P>
I welcome what my hon. Friend the Minister said and am particularly pleased that the inspectorate will re-examine the matter and report back to him. I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I hope to return to the matter when we know more details of the Government's proposals to introduce flexibility in clause 39. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 7, line 19, leave out ``of the offence'' and insert ``under this Act''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 160, in clause 13, page 8, line 12, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) on the ground that that person has been convicted of an offence to which subsection 10(6) applies;<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>( ) on the ground that any other person has been convicted of an offence to which subsection 10(6) applies in relation to the establishment or agency;'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We are all anxious to make progress and I shall try to be brief. The amendment is an attempt to persuade the Minister to explain what precisely is intended in subsection (6)(b), which refers to a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>second or subsequent conviction of the offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It may be possible to have a second or subsequent conviction for a similar offence, but no one can be convicted twice of a single offence.

<P>
Is it appropriate to consider only an offence of the same type in relation to an establishment or agency of the same description, which is the effect of subsection (6)(b). Surely, we do not want the stricter provisions of subsection (5), which refers to subsection (6), not to apply to someone because he has been convicted of an offence under the Bill in relation to a care home, but is then convicted of an offence of the same type in relation to a nursing agency. Under the Bill as drafted, the second offence would not count unless it was in relation to an establishment or agency of the same description and unless it was a conviction for the same offence, whatever that is supposed to mean.

<P>
Common sense dictates that, if we want to catch someone under this more serious category of sanction, which will apply to repeat offenders, the Bill should deal with such offenders. That is the key concern. If I have misunderstood, will the Minister explain where and how the Bill makes it clear that anyone who commits a second and subsequent offence will be caught within the ambit of subsection (6)(b)?

<P>
I should like to stretch the point a little wider, to include the nature of the sanction. Are Committee members comfortable with the idea that, in all cases, a sanction of imprisonment could be imposed where subsection (6) will apply-in other words, where a second and subsequent offence has been committed? In practice, such an offence could be fairly technical. I realise that this is a difficult issue in terms of drafting legislation, but one can easily envisage a complex registration procedure and regulation regime. Someone might repeatedly commit an offence of the type that one would not expect to be punished by imprisonment. Equally, under the Bill, imprisonment might be the appropriate sanction for other, wilful offences.

<P>
Amendment No. 160 relates to clause 13. Although it refers to definitions in clause 10(6), in essence, it makes a slightly different point. Again, it seeks to probe the Government on the issue of the seriousness of the offence, and would provide additional ground for cancelling registration. Registration could be cancelled where the person in question-or any other person connected with the establishment in question-has been convicted of an offence to which clause 10(6) applies.

<P>
I could not find a more elegant way in which to phrase the amendment, but I have in mind the totting-up procedure with which we are all familiar in respect of road traffic legislation. That procedure applies to relatively minor offences that are technical, and which involve oversight, sloppiness, careless record-keeping, and so on. Although some form of sanction must be applied when such an offence is repeated, it is not appropriate to impose serious penalties when the offence is committed for the first-or even second time. The cancellation of registration is a fairly heavy sanction that could lead to the deprivation of a person's livelihood. For a first offence, that could be regarded as a disproportionate punishment, and may fall foul of the Human Rights Act 1998. Would the Minister be tempted to regard totting up as a better way in which to deal with relatively technical offences?

<P>
The Minister will say that the registration authority may-rather than must-at any time cancel registration, and that provides scope for a less heavy-handed response to a relatively technical offence. However, given the commission's devolved, regional structure, I am concerned that we should not inadvertently create the sentencing disparities with which we are all familiar in the magistrates court.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> The hon. Gentleman rightly draws attention to the serious implications for care home owners in those circumstances, but surely the other side of the coin is also extremely important. We are talking about the lives of vulnerable people, who place their trust in care home owners. Will the hon. Gentleman reflect on that factor in assessing the balance of justice?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman is clearly right. I hope that I drew attention to the distinction between offences of gravity, where people are put at risk, and technical offences, such as a failure to send in paperwork or to complete a registration form properly-the kind of offences that are perhaps committed without malice. In a sense the hon. Gentleman underlines the point that I am trying to make: it seems intuitively wrong to lump all offences together. A distinction must be drawn between offences relating to the technicalities of the registration process and compliance with the letter of regulations and standards and offences where there is clearly malicious intent.

<P>
My purpose in tabling the amendment is to spark a debate about proportionality and to focus on the seriousness of cancellation as a sanction. We are not talking about a minor, technical sanction but about possibly depriving somebody of their livelihood, which would be an appropriate sanction where somebody, whether deliberately or through carelessness, puts another person at risk. However, we would all agree that it would not be an appropriate sanction if, for instance, someone was late sending in one's VAT return. One would not expect that to be a basis for one's business being shut down. We must make sure that we are putting in place a series of sanctions that are appropriate and proportional to the offence committed.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling the amendment, because it highlights an important aspect of the Bill-when and in what circumstances someone should be liable to a sentence of imprisonment. In general, that is a sanction that we should reserve for the most serious offences, such as a deliberate flouting of a fundamental part of the Bill, which requires people to register a care home, establishment or agency and allows only those people to manage and run it. In subsection (6) we make clear the circumstances in which someone should, through their behaviour, attract a liability to serve a sentence of imprisonment.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman may not have understood the way in which subsection (6)(b), which amendment No. 136 affects, has been put together. He has inadvertently widened the provision. He, like me, wants to ensure that the sanction of imprisonment is used specifically for those who deserve to go to prison and not indiscriminately for those who might commit what he described as a technical or minor breach of one of the regulations in clause 21. All those regulations would, by definition, be important, but he made the point well that he did not want people who might have broken those regulations, perhaps on more than one occasion, to go to prison, which is probably what his amendment would lead to.

<P>
As the clause stands, a person is liable for imprisonment only if he continues to run an establishment or agency after a registration has been cancelled or if he continues to run an unregistered establishment or agency after having been convicted of that offence. That is a reasonable place to draw the line between someone who should be fined and someone who should go to prison.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> What the Minister says is entirely reasonable. Why was it not possible to put into the Bill the words that he has just read out? They seem to express the matter in plain English better than the rather convoluted language of subsection (6).

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman thought that my description was accurate. It is my interpretation of subsection (6). I do not find it obscure or obtuse. Because of the way in which case law has developed, a court may refer, for interpretation purposes, to a Minister's attempts to describe and explain the operation of a provision.

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The amendment would make a person liable for imprisonment for a second or subsequent conviction of any offence under the Act, including any breach of the regulations under clause 21. Inadvertently, the amendment would give the clause exactly the effect that the hon. Gentleman did not want-I am sure that he agrees that it would be an unreasonable and draconian provision. We must be very clear about who should go to prison and the circumstances in which they should do so. The two scenarios in subsection (6) achieve that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am convinced by the Minister's argument in relation to amendment No. 136, but does he think that a person with a conviction for running an unregistered establishment or agency of type A should be caught by the clause if he is subsequently convicted of running an establishment of type B?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, I think that he should. It must be clear that it is a serious matter for someone to run, unregistered, an establishment that is required under the Bill to be registered. People should not be able to get away with running an unregistered children's home and an unregistered care home for adults, thus committing two offences, without having their registration cancelled and facing a possible prison sentence. It should not matter whether the care home or establishment is of the same or of a different type.

<P>
Amendment No. 160 raises further difficult issues. I am sympathetic to its intentions, but it is unnecessary. As I understand it, it would enable the commission to cancel the registration of a person who has been convicted of an offence to which subsection (6) applies.

<P>
Clause 10 in general deals with the requirement to register. Subsection (6) stipulates the circumstances in which a person who is guilty of an offence under the clause is liable for imprisonment. However, the subsection applies only where the registration has already been cancelled, or where the person has been prosecuted for running an unregistered establishment or agency. The amendment does not make sense in terms of the structure of the provision. There is no need for the commission to be able to cancel registration, because under subsection (6) registration has either already been cancelled or the person was never registered in the first place.

<P>
Perhaps subsection (6) has defeated the hon. Gentleman; he said earlier that he found it obscure. I fully understand his point about the need for the commission to be able properly to police and enforce the regulations and the Bill, but he has misunderstood the application of the provision.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is right to say that the reference back to subsection (6) is inappropriate in this case. However, I would be grateful if he would address my substantive point. Does he see any merit in a totting up approach, whereby the grounds for cancellation of registration should be multiple reoffending against the regulations, not a single instance of breaching them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a difficult question. The answer is probably not. We want to preserve the power of the commission to deregister someone in the event of a breach of the regulations if it believes that the breach is sufficiently important in its own right to raise a question mark over the person's suitability to continue to run the establishment. It is important that the commission should have that sanction.

<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I am sure that he agrees that we must root out the industry people who should not have responsibility for running care homes, establishments or agencies. We have to ensure that the commission can do that properly. The totting up procedure might not protect the public properly and might make the operation of the regulations and procedures more complex and harder for people to understand. There is always a trade-off between clarity and simplicity and sanctions, and we do not want sanctions to be used inappropriately.

<P>
We should have confidence in the commission, which should use its powers effectively and reasonably-when it exercises any or all of the powers that are contained in these provisions, it must act reasonably. There will be opportunities for care home owners and others to use their rights to appeal under clause 20, if they feel that one the commission's decisions needs to be challenged. The balance is probably in the right place, although I suspect that we may return to this matter later.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by my comments. Amendment No. 160 is unnecessary because of subsection (6), and amendment No. 136 would be unreasonable and draconian, and it, too, is unnecessary.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept the Minister's comments on the amendments' technical suitability, and I intend to withdraw them. However, I am still troubled by the question of proportionality. The cancellation of registration sanction should be treated for what it is, namely, an extremely grave sanction that has implications for the Human Rights Act-it may involve the deprivation of people's livelihoods. We may return to this matter at a later stage-we must ensure that decisions will not be taken that are out of line or offensive to common sense or may give rise to grounds for appeal. The Bill's provisions and the Human Rights Act are relevant in that regard. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is just one issue that I want clarified. I trust that I am not the only Committee member who has found it difficult to follow the logic of parts of the Bill or to track some of its definitions. Studying subsequent clauses has made me increasingly confused about the distinction between a person who carries on and a person who manages an establishment or agency.

<P>
Clause 10 refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any person who carries on or manages an establishment or agency.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that ``carries on'' and ``manages'' are pretty much interchangeable terms. However, later provisions suggest that two people may be involved in carrying on and in managing an establishment. Morever, the Bill's overall architecture does not make it clear whether both people would need to be registered. Clause 21(2)(j) states that regulations may
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>make provision requiring the person carrying on an establishment or agency to appoint a manager.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly suggests that two people will be involved. If so, will they both have to be registered?

<P>
Subsequent clauses refer to the registered person. If there is a manager and a person who carries on the establishment, which will be the registered person: If a sanction is imposed on one of them, what will happen to the status of the other? If a manager and the person who carries on the establishment are both registered for that establishment but one of them has his registration cancelled, is the establishment allowed to continue under his management, or will the other person have to manage it? If the Minister could clarify the position, it would help members of the Committee a great deal when we discuss the issues arising from the next few clauses.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Subsection (2) refers to agencies and branches and how each of the branches will be treated as a separate agency. On Second Reading, I spoke about independent foster care agencies and the need to bring them into the fold. It is not good to have them outside the mainstream, especially as there is no proper registration. They welcomed my comments, but I received a letter expressing concern abut the position of agencies that operate in a particular area-a county, perhaps-and open sub-offices. An agency operating in Yorkshire, for example, might have its central office in Sheffield, but it might have outposts in Bradford, in order to provide a better locally based service for everyone. Would such an agency be subject to the clause?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond to my hon. Friend's concerns shortly.

<P>
The requirement to register is a fundamental part of the Bill and is one of its basic building blocks. The clause imposes a requirement to register on
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any person who carries on or manages an establishment or agency of any description.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge expressed concern about the distinction between a person who ``carries on'' and establishment and a person who ``manages'' it. He expressed some confusion about that. In some cases, only one person will need to register, and that will be the person who runs and owns the care home. However, there are care homes that are owned and run by companies that own multiple care homes throughout the country-BUPA would be a classic example of such an organisation-and there will be a clear obligation on both the owner and the manager to register, if there is a distinction between them. That requirement is appropriate. We will want to be satisfied about the suitability of both the owner of the care home and the manager, who has day-to-day responsibility for it. Of course, that case may not always apply, and decisions on who should register will depend on the facts of each application.

<P>
I would reassure the hon. Gentleman about the terminology used in the clause. It is not new: the hon. Gentleman will find that the provisions are set out in terms similar to those used in the Registered Homes Act 1984 in relation to persons who will ``carry on'' or ``manage'' an establishment. It may be a well-worn argument, but it is worth making the point that the industry is familiar with such terms, and they do not give rise to any particular difficulties.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford raised a concern about registration requirements for independent fostering agencies and asked whether there would be a separate registration requirement for branches of independent fostering agencies. The answer is yes. Each branch will be required to register, because the National Care Standards Commission will need to be sure about the quality of all the operations of an independent fostering agency. It will be dealt with in a way that is not unduly burdensome-for example, by not repeating the same checks unnecessarily across a range of operations. We are probably at one on this issue. My hon. Friend has concerns about fostering arrangements generally and, like me, wants to ensure that the regulations are adequate for the new task and that we do not register inappropriately people who should not be conducting this type of operation.

<P>
I hope that I have reassured the Committee with those comments. This is an uncontroversial part of the Bill and I hope that the Committee will allow it to stand.

<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. I suspect that we might to want to explore some consequences further in clauses yet to come.

<P>
If both a manager and a person carrying on an establishment were separately registered, it would raise questions about the procedures to be followed in which a proposal was made in respect of a registration. If the person who is the subject of the proposal-perhaps the manager of the establishment-did not enter a defence or an appeal, would there be a danger of the other person with an interest finding himself disadvantaged without even having been aware of that process going on? We might want to examine issues such as those.

<P>
I am not clear, as a result of what the Minister said, about what would happen to an establishment when the registration of a person was cancelled in respect of that establishment. I suspect that some hon. Members will have looked at clause 13 and assumed that the establishment would be closed down, on reading that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The registration authority may at any time cancel the registration of a person in respect of an establishment or agency-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) on the ground that that person has been convicted of a relevant offence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, I infer from the Minister's comments that that might not be the case, and that the cancellation of the registration of a person in respect of an establishment or agency might not require the closure of that establishment or agency. Perhaps we can explore with the Minister how that will work in practice, because there does not appear to be a separate power to close down an establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> These are not new problems created by this legislation, but problems that inspection authorities have to deal with already. Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that if a manager's registration were cancelled, there would be obviously a need to appoint a new manager. However, if the registration of an owner-the person carrying on the business-were cancelled, that would be more serious, and would mean that the home or the agency would not be able to continue to provide those services for which the requirement for registration is made clear in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that point. Perhaps an understanding of this matter requires a level of interface with previous legislation that I have not undertaken. It is not clear from the Bill that the cancellation of the registration of a manager will have a different effect from the cancellation of the registration of a person carrying on an establishment. However, the Minister has given me the clarification that I sought, although some consequential issues could arise later in the Bill.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 10 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 11</center></H4>
<H4><center>Applications for registration</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 7, line 26, leave out from ``the'' to end and insert ``information prescribed in regulations;''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 138, in page 7, leave out lines 27 and 28.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This group of amendments seeks to achieve greater precision, greater clarity and less discretion in the carrying out of the application process.

<P>
Amendment No. 151 would make it clear that the information that had to be given in relation to an application must be prescribed in regulations. The Minister may tell me that that is already the case, in which case I shall be quite satisfied.

<P>
Amendment No. 138 would remove subsection
(2)(b), which seems to provide an unnecessary broadening and an unnecessary double jeopardy. Regulations ought to prescribe the information that must be supplied in making an application and that information should be supplied by the person seeking registration, together with the fee.

<P>
Subsection (2)(b) states that, in addition to providing everything that the regulations require, an applicant
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>must give any other information which the registration authority reasonably requires the applicant to give.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems to give too much discretion to the registration authority. Some matters are relevant and should be prescribed in regulation, but others are irrelevant and perhaps the authority should not be given the discretion to require such information.

<P>
It does not take much imagination to realise that such a discretion could be used to discriminate against individual care home owners, owners of businesses, or types or classes of people, by requiring them to submit supplementary information. We need a clear and explicit application procedure and-to repeat a phrase that has been used in relation to the Bill-a level playing field.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): Will the hon. Gentleman accept that, in certain circumstances, it would be helpful to have additional information for which the regulations do not necessarily provide? Two homes might have remarkably similar names. Alternatively, two applicants-against one of whom there is a question mark-might have similar names. In such circumstances, clarification would be needed and it would make sense to require additional information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman has given an example that is not particularly controversial. It is perfectly possible for regulations defining the information required to allow for clarification of names, for example. However, there are types of information over which it might not be desirable to give the registration authority discretion. If we are to have a level playing field, there must be a presumption that all applicants will be treated in the same way. It is right to ask all applicants whether they have any criminal convictions, for example, but it might not be right to ask them certain other personal questions. Eventually, such questions would become intrusive and unacceptable. The hon. Gentleman will see that such discretion could be used to discriminate against or discourage certain types or classes of applicants.

<P>
I am simply suggesting that we must have a consistent and clear regime. We must bear in mind that the application process will be carried out not by a single body but regional organisations and one can envisage differences arising through the use of this catch-all phrase. I am concerned that loose phraseology and a broadly drawn subsection will undermine the principle of a level playing field and a clear and consistent procedure for all applicants. We must maintain that principle, so that there is no discrimination between applicants of different types, categories or characteristics.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendment No. 138 would prevent the registration authority from requiring applicants to give additional information. In most cases, it will not be necessary for the authority to exercise that power, because the information on the application form will be sufficient. However, if we take away the power to request additional information, we would weaken the National Care Standards Commission's ability to do its job properly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) suggested. There may be instances where the authority will require clarification-something written on a form or evidence for an answer-and it should have the opportunity to have that. I know that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge wants to delete subsection (2)(b) from the Bill, but the subsection makes it clear that any additional information must be ``reasonably'' required. The idea that the National Care Standards Commission could intrude into personal matters unnecessarily or unreasonably when requiring information could clearly be challenged under the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Other Ministers have argued that putting in ``reasonably'', as I have sometimes sought to do in an amendment, adds nothing, because there is a prima facie requirement for public authorities to behave reasonably. Therefore, quoting the word ``reasonably'' from the Bill does not add anything to the argument.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I believe that it does add something to the argument, because, if the word is in the Bill, it is an express requirement for the National Care Standards Commission to accede to any request for information reasonably made. If it decided to seek from an applicant the sort of information that the hon. Gentleman described as intrusive, private and unrelated to the application, it could be challenged. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to have it in the Bill. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be attracted by that argument.

<P>
I reassure the hon. Gentleman that this is not something that we have conjured up out of thin air. The provision is already in the Residential Care Homes Regulations 1984 and he will know who drafted those regulations.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Not precisely, I have to say. However, the Government are seeking to create a level playing field and there will be two classes of applicant-local authorities and private operators. The Minister's argument about the Registered Homes Act 1984 is not applicable in this case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right; the power to register will be extended to new categories of people who want to carry on or manage businesses. However, this is a power already deemed necessary for inspectors if they are to do their job properly. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would simply remove the power from the new National Care Standards Commission. I should have thought that he would follow the argument that, given that the power to request this information is now available in relation to those running private establishments but not to local authorities, he would want those powers to extend to local authorities. He has declared himself to be an advocate of the level playing field. The provision would ensure that there continues to be a level playing field.

<P>
In amendment No. 151 the hon. Gentleman proposes a drafting change. The amendment would require the information given in applications to be prescribed in regulations. He has anticipated my remarks and I shall pray in aid clause 100, a clause that I like to cite on these occasions. He will discover that the amendment does not add anything to the meaning of the clause, because clause 100 already makes it clear that the word ``prescribed'' means prescribed by regulations. Amendment No. 151 adds that into the clause, but it does not need to be added in, because that is what ``prescribed'' already means by virtue of clause 100.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept that the Minister is technically correct, but what he has said sits rather ill with his argument that having ``reasonably'' in the Bill adds something, even though it does not change the meaning: it puts emphasis on it. Amendment No. 151 would simply have added emphasis, even if it did not change the meaning in any practical way.

<P>
I am not persuaded that, in an environment where there are significantly different categories of applicant, this widely-drafted provision will not cause us problems and undermine the level playing field that we all want to create. However, I have heard what the Minister has said and shall possibly return to this issue at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 7, line 29, at end insert-

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person who applies for registration as the manager of an establishment or agency must be an individual.'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Where a single establishment includes establishments of different descriptions the person who carries on or manages it shall only be required to make one application in respect of the establishment.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and Government amendment No. 64.

<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This is one of the most surreal amendments that I have ever moved, but it is a good one. The purpose of amendment No. 62 is simple and is to ensure that only a named person may be registered as the manager of an establishment or agency. It would not be possible for a company, voluntary organisation or other body to register as the manager. The Committee will appreciate that the manager of a registered establishment or agency has an important role. He has day-to-day control over what happens in the establishment and how it carries out its work. It is essential that he should be a named individual so that inspectors, service users and members of staff know who is responsible for decisions and sorting out problems and who can be held accountable for any failing in the service.

<P>
It is worth noting that the amendment would not prevent more than one person being registered as the manager when that is appropriate, so long as they are all named individuals. That would be necessary in the case of a job-sharing arrangement.

<P>
The amendment would not prevent a company, voluntary organisation or other body from being registered as the person operating the establishment or agency. The amendment would not change anything. Managers registering under the Registered Homes Act 1984 are always individuals. The reason for the amendment is simply to ensure that current practice continues when more services are brought within the scope of regulation.

<P>
Amendment No. 64 provides for the managers of establishments and agencies to be registered with the General Social Care Council. The overall aim of the Bill is to drive up standards because, too often in the past, vulnerable people have been let down by inadequate safeguards against poor-quality standards of care. The Bill will help to ensure that users of care services obtain the standards of care and protection that they deserve. The General Social Care Council will raise standards in social care and increase the protection of the general public by driving up standards of conduct and practice and the levels and quality of training. Social care staff will be registered by the council if they are of good character and sufficient physical and mental fitness and if they satisfy the relevant requirements on training, conduct and competence. The council will also lay down codes of conduct and practice for social care staff and a code of practice for employers. The amendment covers the interface between the council's regulation of the social care work force and the National Care Standards Commission's service regulation responsibilities for social care services. We want to ensure that the two systems work together effectively and in harmony.

<P>
Clause 21(3) requires certain staff working in registered establishments or agencies to be registered by the General Social Care Council. One example that we have in mind is residential child care staff. We are already engaged in pushing up the training levels of staff working in children's homes and have developed specific qualifications for that crucial sector. As well as providing specific funds to improve the take-up of that training, we have said that residential child care workers will be one of the categories of staff for whom we hope the General Social Care Council will open a register. To complete the picture and to ensure that service users obtain the benefit of a properly trained work force, the final step would be to require staff to be registered with the General Social Care Council if they are to work in children's homes.

<P>
Clause 21(3) covers only those who work in an establishment or agency and not managers. That is an important omission that must be fixed. We have started work to determine the right qualifications for people in charge of care homes and we have said that they will be an early priority for registration with the General Social Care Council. By allowing the Secretary of State, through regulations, to require managers of registered homes to be registered by the council, we seek to ensure that only those individuals who satisfy the required levels of training and competence will be authorised to manage those establishments. I might add that the care home sector has been very keen to be eligible for registration with the General Social Care Council and that such requirements should be laid down in the Bill. The amendment ensures that they can do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 139 relates to a matter that we have examined before. It involves what I call hybridity. The amendment, which I accept is not elegantly drafted, is intended to establish whether the Government sympathise with the proposition that when an establishment embraces in a single premises and under a single management structure activities that could be defined as involving different types of establishment-such establishments will typically be run by voluntary organisations and tend to be small-a single registration could be used, although it would be subject to the different regulations that will apply to different activities.

<P>
It might be unnecessarily bureaucratic and expensive-we do not know what the relevant fees will be-for a single voluntary establishment to have to register three times to cover all the different activities that are carried on in a single premises. I shall not press the amendment to a vote-it poses as many questions as it seeks to answer-but if the Government sympathise with that view, we should go away and talk to others who are better able than I am to draft effective amendments.

<P>
I do not have anything to say about Government amendment No. 62-I understand why the Minister wanted to introduce an amendment that clarifies the Government's thinking about the manager of an establishment-but I want to discuss Government amendment No. 64. It will amend clause 21, which begins with a massive catch-all. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations may impose in relation to establishments and agencies any requirements which the appropriate Minister thinks fit for the purposes of this Part and may in particular make any provision<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
under various conditions. Those particulars are listed on pages 12 and 13 of the Bill. Why does the Minister want to insert another particular power into a clause that already contains, so far as I can see, a virtually unconstrained general power?

<P>
Amendment No. 64 and the various subsections in clause 21 could be interpreted as being a surrogate announcement of the Government's intentions. The Government may want to flag up the fact that they may want to create a regulation that will place a requirement on certain classes of people who manage an establishment or agency, unless they appear on one of the registers that will operate under the provisions of clause 52(1).

<P>
The specificity of the amendment's proposals appears to involve a problem. For example, people may be prohibited from running a nursing agency, or another class of establishment or agency, unless they appear on another register, which is kept under the terms not of clause 52(1) but of other legislation. I do not doubt that the general power in clause 21 will give the Government the ability to make such a provision. The Government may be flagging up the possibility of requiring someone to be registered on the registers that will be created under the terms of clause 52(1). However, not referring to the possibility of requiring a person to be registered on the registers that are kept by the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting sends a confusing signal. I am sure that the Minister does not intend to exclude the possibility of being required to be registered as a nurse, but I do not see the logic that lies behind the amendment. I wonder whether the Minister can shed further light on this matter.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): Amendment No. 139 raises a point of concern, which we have already considered to an extent. It involves institutions that provide several different kinds of care that are capable of being registered under the commission's remit. It is worth seeing whether such multiple registration, and its consequent costs, can be avoided in such a way as to minimise the burden for the operators, while ensuring a good standard of inspection and registration across the board.

<P>
Amendment No. 64 is a useful amendment, on which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge opened up an interesting line of argument. He said that clause 21 gives the Government a sufficiently general power so that they do not need to employ a list of about 12 items to stipulate how that power will be used. Liberal Democrat Members often take the opposite point of view and argue that the Government should include more detail in the Bill and be more willing to make commitments to the Committee about their future intentions. I would not, therefore, argue against the Government providing the list as well as the general power.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the obvious point that Opposition Members' natural keenness to know what the Government are and are not going to do may be an argument for including all the specific regulation-making powers in the Bill, but not for overlaying them with a general power-which, incidentally, was not in the original draft. It was inserted in the House of Lords.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point.

<P>
I want to refer briefly to training. On Saturday, I attended the annual general meeting of Larkin housing association, where, during a discussion about the Bill, one of the professionals present put the following point to me. The Government rightly want more people to take up training opportunities so as to increase the number of people who are qualified to provide care in care homes. However, the evidence to date shows that people who gain the benefit of additional qualifications tend not to stay in care homes, where the pay is relatively low, but move on to social work or other parts of the social care sector. I was asked how on earth the problems of recruitment and retention are to be overcome.

<P>
If the Government are to achieve a 40 to 50 per cent. level of trained staff in the residential care homes sector-which is what they are seeking through the training opportunities scheme-they must recognise that that will mean giving staff packages that make it worth their while to remain in the sector. That may be a question not only of pay, but of other aspects of terms and conditions of employment. As the number of qualified staff is driven up, retention will become a challenge that it is difficult to meet in the context of the existing levels of income that many care homes live on. I had the benefit of looking at the balance sheet of the care home represented at the AGM, and could clearly see how its training reserves were being run down in order to keep it afloat. Are the Government mindful of that concern?

<P>
How will the timing of the registration of managers be effected? Care home managers of a certain generation-many of whom do a very good job, some of whom have a questionable record-are coming to the end of their working lives. Are the Government saying that all those people will need to be subject to the registration requirements of the council, or will a transitional mechanism be provided? Otherwise, there is a risk that skilled people who are not qualified will haemorrhage from this area, which may again cause the sector problems, certainly in the short term.

<P>
What time scale will apply to the inclusion of managers into the council? Will it be done within a year or so of the council being set up, or will it take longer? It is intended to have a transitional arrangement for those for whom the year spent in training may be the last year of their service, which would have no point? If the Minister can answer those questions, it will help the Committee and, I suspect, a number outside it, too.

<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall deal first with the hon. Gentleman's last point about the time scale. I shall avoid setting today a time scale of a year, 18 months or two years. That would not be a sensible way to address his proper concerns. We want to do it as quickly as we can, because it will add safeguards and protection for the public, which is what the exercise is all about. We would have to take advice from the General Social Care Council on when we could do it. An advisory group is meeting to prepare for its introduction, and we shall have to ensure that we do it in an orderly and effective way but as quickly as possible. I am not convinced that there is a danger of a haemorrhage of people from the sector because of the amendment.

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): This debate would be more pertinent on clause 52, but I share my hon. Friend's concern that some of the experienced people working in this sector would find it extremely threatening to have to take formal qualifications and might well opt out altogether. I hope that, when we reach clause 52, we will have an indication of the General Social Care Council's line of thinking on whether prescribed experience will count as much as academic qualification.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Again, that is a fair point. The hon. Gentleman is asking us to have the debate later in the Bill, and that is probably the place to have it. He asks for a preview of the General Social Care Council's thinking. We have not yet set up the council. [
Interruption.] Of course, we are setting up a General Social Care Council under the Bill. That is obvious. The hon. Gentleman asked me specifically whether its thinking on this issue could be available when we reached clause 52. Clearly it will not be, because the council will not have been set up. However, the hon. Gentleman has made a fair point about recognising existing experience, which we must consider as we develop the proposals in conjunction with the council.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised several concerns. He thought that, in view of the broad sweep of clause 21, we did not need any more specific regulation-making powers and that the general power was adequate. In moving the amendment, I tried to argue that it was necessary because of the way in which clause 21(2)(a) and (b) are drafted. Paragraph (a) deals with managers and (b) deals with staff, and they are treated separately. Therefore, unless we make it clear in the Bill, there could be some doubt whether clause 21(3) could extend to managers as well as to staff. To avoid that doubt, we considered it necessary to clarify the meaning of that part of clause 21. We are not taking extra regulation-making powers for the sake of it or to amuse ourselves; we are doing it simply because we did not consider that clause 21(2)(a) and (b) were clear enough to enable us to do what we intended to do, which was to have a regulatory arrangement in place for managers.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Minister telling the Committee that the inclusion of the specific provisions in clause 21(2)(a), (b) and so on constrain the general regulation-making power under clause 21(1)?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The question was not so much whether those provisions restrict the power as how those regulation-making powers would be interpreted. For the avoidance of doubt, we wanted to make it clear that we could use the powers in the Bill in the way intended.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a number of other points. He referred to the GSCC registration in clause 21, but not others. Regulations under clause 21(2)(a) could, for example, require that a nursing agency be managed by a qualified nurse. The power is sufficiently broad to enable that, but we are inserting the GSCC provision because we want to make a specific link between the two parts of the Bill. Taken to its extreme, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge's argument could suggest that there is nothing in clause 21 beyond subsection (1), and we want to avoid that particular hazard.

<P>
We are not legislating unnecessarily-amendment No. 64 contains a very important point. When the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spoke to amendment No. 139, he repeated his earlier argument that someone who runs, say, a children's home and a number of other residential care homes-perhaps a day care centre, or a domiciliary care agency-could make a single application in respect of those enterprises. However, most Committee members will accept that it would be difficult to do that. By their nature, and given the way in which they are defined in the Bill, the various types of establishment differ greatly.

<P>
In general, it is clear that separate applications will be required for different categories of establishment, irrespective of whether they are offered on the same site or run by the same organisation. For example, different establishments-such as an acute hospital and an independent clinic-provide different services and will therefore need to meet different regulatory requirements. Each application will need to set out appropriate information, so that the registration authority can satisfy itself that standards are being, or will be, met.

<P>
I can probably meet the hon. Gentleman's concerns half way. It is clear that, where the same person applies to register two different establishments, certain regulatory work for one establishment could be relevant to the other, and we would want to take that into account. There is a further point about which the hon. Gentleman is right to be concerned. The structure of the regulatory fees may be able to take into account an applicant who makes a number of separate applications, and the applicant may not be expected to pay the full costs of what would be separate applications. I am sure that the requirements to register can be operated in a sensible way, and in the least bureaucratic manner possible. That is certainly the intention that we have consistently pursued.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would be a step too far. It would not be acceptable to the Government, and should he choose to divide the Committee, I urge my hon. Friends to vote against it. Common sense requires that there should be separate application processes for different establishments. The hon. Gentleman will know that, under the Bill, different national minimum standards and regulations for those establishments will be put in place. It is a matter of common sense that we should take that approach, but I can reassure him that we do not intend to impose unnecessary and burdensome bureaucratic requirements on those who register with the Care Standards Commission. I am sure that the commission will work actively to ensure that its procedures are streamlined and effective, and involve the minimum possible bureaucracy. The hon. Gentleman's amendment pushes us a little too far, and I hope that he will not press it to a vote.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

No. 142, in page 7, line 42, at end add-

<P>
No. 143, in page 7, line 43, leave out subsection (3).

<P>
No. 12, in page 8, line 1, at end insert ``conditional or unconditional''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This group of amendments, pertaining to the clause which handles the issue of grant or refusal of registration, addresses questions of natural justice.

<P>
The amendments seek to ensure a clear, consistent and transparent regime for granting or refusing registration across the tens of thousands of decisions that will be made by different regional bodies. If there is to be consistency, there must be clear and objective criteria for registration or refusal of registration. I have already mentioned the questions that will arise in relation to the Human Rights Act 1998, with regard to the deprivation of the livelihood of an individual. The four amendments seek to rewrite subsections (2) and (3) to meet the requirements that I have just outlined.

<P>
Amendment No. 140 would delete the reference to continuation of compliance. As we go through clause 12, we read a series of objective tests. Is the registration authority satisfied that the requirements of regulations under section 21 are being complied with? Is it satisfied that the requirements of any other enactment which appears to it to be relevant are being complied with? We then read that it must be satisfied that those requirements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>will continue to be complied with.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
How is a registration authority to make an objective assessment as to whether requirements will continue to be complied with? I have a sneaking suspicion that that might be an invitation to the registration authority to look at the size and status of the applicant. I do not want to overstate the case, but if the applicant were a local authority or large corporate body, there might, perhaps, be an assumption that requirements already being complied with would continue to be complied with. However, more reassurance might be sought from an independent applicant. It would be unfortunate if, having set out to create a level playing field, we inadvertently inserted requirements into the procedure that effectively discriminated against certain classes of applicant.

<P>
To ask a registration authority to rule or give an opinion on matters on which it cannot have a sensible and objective opinion is to grant too wide a discretion. There are, in any case, many provisions available for the cancellation of registration if requirements cease to be complied with. If a large corporate provider was complying with certain standards today but went bankrupt tomorrow, there would be adequate provision for cancellation of registration, or whatever other steps were necessary. It would be unfortunate if we asked the commission to second guess what was going to happen tomorrow, next month or next year.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 141, 142 and 143 seek to change the clause so that, if an applicant were strictly compliant with the regulations made under section 21, and with any other enactments which appeared to the registration authority to be relevant, he would have to be registered unconditionally. If he were not strictly compliant, the registration authority could either reject his application for registration or register him subject to conditions. I have in mind a situation in which he might be non-compliant, but in which the non-compliance was technical and could be remedied to the registration authority's satisfaction.

<P>
In a proper, transparent, objective and even-handed regime, there is no reason to register a compliant applicant subject to conditions. Either he is complying with the regulations or he is not. If someone complies with the regulations and there is a good reason for not registering him, the regulations are wrongly drafted. They must be drafted in such a way that the decision can be made objectively and much of the undesirable discretion is removed.

<P>
The point of being able to apply conditions to a registration is to leave sensible discretion in the case of technical non-compliance. That is important because people's livelihoods are at stake. I hope that the Minister will accept the principle of this group of amendments.

<P>

</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 12 and to explore how we can ensure that we have the transparent system to which the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred. The clause provides for conditional or unconditional registration, but it is not clear in the Bill whether the registration certificate will state whether there are conditions. Age Concern believes that those who want to purchase care, including local authorities and many others, need to know whether care home providers have had conditions placed on them. It is important that care home providers are required to display their certificates and that the brochures that they must publish also describe what the certificates state and whether there are conditions on the home.

<P>
The flexibility provided in the clause is important for care home owners and also for those who are considering taking a place in care homes. It is important for people to know what conditions have been imposed on homes. If details are included on the registration certificate, they can make an informed choice.

<P>
Flexibility is important also to care home owners, managers and so on because it will enable them sensibly to address issues such as room sizes and standards, which regularly come up in the objections to ``Fit for the Future?'', and to make any necessary changes. It may be decided that any conditions imposed following a registration inspection could be met over a period and it is important that full information is available to those who are considering homes.

<P>
I have a couple of specific questions that have been raised by the National Care Homes Association and others. Clause 12(5)(a) and (b) allow the National Care Standards Commission to vary conditions on existing establishments. If they have been registered in the past, changes could be made, for example, to the number of people who are permitted to be resident in the property. There is concern that that might have a serious impact on the viability of some smaller care homes, and the point was made to me last weekend at the AGM of the Larkin housing association. There is no dispute about the need for the power, but there should be recognition of past registrations and some flexibility in introducing new standards.

<P>
Will the appeal procedures outlined later in the Bill apply when there is an existing registration and a condition is changed or a new condition is imposed? It is not clear from the Bill whether that is so and it would be helpful if the Minister would tell us whether it is.

<P>
It would also be useful if the Minister could make it clear how the inspection regime will operate. When I asked about the time scale earlier, he was, understandably, reluctant to go into the specific number of years and so on. However, perhaps he will tell us whether the commission will publish national performance standards for its inspection units so that it is clear how long it takes from application for registration to completion of the process and the issue of a certificate. That would be useful management information against which performance can be monitored and it would be a useful mechanism for care home owners and others to judge and to seek redress if the agency behaves inefficiently or ineffectively. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us whether there will be performance standards and to what extent they can be used as a mechanism for seeking redress if they are not met.

<P>
On resuming-

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall try to deal with all the amendments in turn.

<P>
Amendment No. 140 removes the provision that allows the registration authority to refuse a registration if it is not satisfied that the registration requirements will continue to be complied with. Amendment No. 12 provides that an authority would have to issue a conditional or unconditional certificate of registration. Amendments Nos. 141, 142 and 143 would have no effect whatsoever. We believe that they are simply suggested drafting changes, and I shall say one or two words about that.

<P>
On amendment No. 140, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, may have misunderstood the purpose and the nature of the provision. There is little point in registering a service if action has to be taken to de-register it shortly afterwards. The hon. Gentleman said that that would allow the National Care Standards Commission to second-guess or predict certain things when it was not in a position to do so. No one would expect the power to be used in that way, but let me give the hon. Gentleman one or two specific examples that have arisen and which arise from time to time.

<P>
For example, an applicant may want to set up a home in a leased building and the commission may discover that the lease had only a couple of years left to run, or a year or 18 months. It would be justified in that case in rejecting the application, because older people entering a care home are, sadly, likely to live there for the rest of their lives, and it would not be right if they were forced to move after a relatively short time. In such circumstances the commission should have the power to refuse a registration, instead of having to go through the process of withdrawing it a short time later.

<P>
It is not uncommon for small children's homes to be set up in rented buildings with short leases, because they are cheap to acquire and run. Nothing can be done about that at present, as such homes are not required to register, but they will be required to do so under the Bill. I am sure that the Committee will agree that it would be inappropriate for the registration authority to register premises with short leases only. Therefore, the amendment is not acceptable, because there is no point in registering the home if action to de-register it must be taken soon after. I think that most people would regard that as sensible.

<P>
I do not want to be too unkind to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, but amendment No. 12, which he tabled, adds nothing of substantive value to the clause, because subsection (3) already provides for conditions to be imposed on registrations. It may at best be a tidying-up amendment. It does not add anything of substance or anything new, because the power that he sought is already in the Bill.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 141 and 143 make drafting changes. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me whether we accepted the principle behind that. We do.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I apologise for letting the Minister move on before I intervened, but I wanted to make sure that I was clear when I did intervene.

<P>
The point that I was seeking to make through the amendment, which the Minister says is adequately addressed in the clause, was that, when the certificate is produced following registration, it should make it clear whether the home is conditionally or unconditionally registered. For the record, will the Minister confirm that that is indeed what the certificate will do and that care home owners will be obliged to provide that information in their brochures and so on?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The simple answer to that question is yes: of course we shall make sure that that is the case. If conditions are attached to the certificate, they must be clear on the certificate, and we shall make sure that they are.

<P>
In relation to amendments Nos. 141, 142 and 143, clause 15(1)(b) provides for regulations to be made in relation to the contents of certificates of registration, which will include the conditions of registration as stated on the certificate. The amendments do not change the meaning of the clause or add anything useful to it. They are an alternative and are less accurate in their drafting and I can find no reason to support them.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked me two specific questions. The first was whether an effort would be made to ensure that applications were dealt with reasonably promptly. Yes, of course it will. We shall set targets for the National Care Standards Commission to cover that issue and we expect it to deal with applications as speedily as possible. We shall monitor its performance closely. He also asked whether there would be an opportunity to appeal under clause 20 if the National Care Standards Commission varied or imposed a condition or conditions under the clause. The answer is yes.

<P>
Therefore, briefly, the amendments are either unnecessary or inappropriate, and I hope that the Committee will not accept them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not entirely persuaded by the Minister's argument and want to go away and think about his specific example of a short lease with only a couple of years to run. The concern at the back of my mind is that he is creating a barrier to entry to the business for someone who is seeking, without becoming involved in a long-term lease, to establish himself in business. The Minister may be interfering in a way that he has not considered in the relative negotiating power between landlord and tenant.

<P>
As it would be best if I were to go away and think about what the Minister has said, and perhaps probe him further on Report, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There seems to be a conflict between the wording of clauses 12 and 22. Clause 12 states that the registration authority shall register the application if it is satisfied that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the requirements of regulations under section 21  are being and will continue to be complied with.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has made it clear that he envisages that the statements of standards set out in clause 22 will be incorporated into regulations under clause 21, so the requirement can be read as embracing those statements of standards. However, clause 22(4)(a) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The standards shall be taken into account-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) in the making of any decision by the registration authority under this Part.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That latter phrase is either redundant or in direct conflict with clause 12. If the standards are incorporated into the regulations, they are either an objective test as to whether the applicant is compliant or something that must be taken into account, as clause 22(4)(a) suggests. My understanding of the use of language is that the words ``taken into account'' are less rigid and imply some flexibility. I should appreciate clarification on that point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am sure that we would all appreciate clarification on that point and I suspect that the best place for that would be in our debate on clause 22 on Thursday, because that is where the hon. Gentleman's substantive point arises.

<P>
The clause is an important part of the fabric of the Bill, because the success of regulation will depend on registering only suitable persons in respect of services that meet the regulatory standards. Furthermore, it provides registration authorities with grounds for refusing unsuitable applications and accepting appropriate applications. The registration authority will accept applications only if a service meets the regulations made under clause 21 and relevant reuqirements under any other enactment-for example, health and safety legislation. The registration authority will also need to respond flexibly to changes in a service's circumstances. The clause therefore provides for the authority to impose additional conditions or to vary existing conditions imposed on registration. We are trying to be helpful to owners of establishments and agencies and not to impose any unnecessary re-registration burdens and obligations on them.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 8, line 12, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where the convicted person was, at the time of the offence, in the opinion of the registration authority under the control or direction of the registered person'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Clause 13(1)(b) states that registration may be cancelled
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on the ground that any other person-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, any person other than the registered person-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has been convicted of  an offence in relation to the establishment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed simply to ensure that it is clear that the other person should be someone who was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>at the time of the offence, in the opinion of the registration authority under the control or direction of the registered person.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It seems to me that that is the intention of the clause: essentially, we are talking about a member of staff.

<P>
We should draft the clause in such a way that it does not inadvertently apply to a third party-a workman doing some building work at the home, perhaps. It would be unreasonable if the commission of an offence by a third party resulted in deregistration and loss of livelihood for the person who is carrying on the establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman's amendment will allow me to clarify for him the purpose and intent of this part of the Bill. I understand the purpose behind the amendment, but there is a slight problem. Introducing terms such as ``control'' or ``direction'' into the Bill could raise difficult issues, particularly, perhaps, in relation to a weak manager, who might be able to argue that he was so weak that he was not, in fact, controlling or directing the work of that member of staff. That would be an unfortunate and unintended by-product of the amendment. If such a defence were allowed, it could drive a coach and horses through the regulatory arrangements.

<P>
The provision is not new. It mirrors equivalent provisions in sections 10 and 28 of the Registered Homes Act 1984 and would not cause any of the adverse consequences to which the hon. Gentleman alluded. It is unlikely that the fact that an independent contractor who happens to be on the site has been convicted of an offence would be taken into account when the commission decides about registration of the home. The relevant offences are those covered by the provisions of the Bill-non-compliance with regulations, for example.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Perhaps I can give the Minister a more realistic example. What happens if the local GP who visits regularly turns out to be Harold Shipman?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not entirely sure that that would constitute an offence under the Bill. If the man is committing murder, that is, obviously, a fairly serious issue. However, to return to the example of an independent contractor-possibly a GP-who is on the site, it is not my understanding that the clause would cover such a person. The Registered Homes Act 1984 has never been interpreted in the way that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. He has done the Committee a service by drawing attention to a possible problem, but I am not sure that he has identified the problem correctly. The offences to which the clause refers are offences under this Bill, and I do not think that we need to get into an argument about whether murdering someone would be a contravention of regulations.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I shall not pick up the allusion to my erstwhile colleague from up north, but I shall give the Minister a different example. What if an employee of an organisation that manages a care home deliberately refuses to follow instructions and does not feed back information on, for instance, whether there is an adequate number of staff or whether the wakeful staff are doing the ironing? Will such people be caught and debarred from running residential homes. Does ``may'' mean may or shall?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I think that we are all aware of the difference between may and shall.

<P>
I shall give an example to illustrate what the provision is intended to achieve. If a member of the care staff in an establishment or agency was convicted of an offence covered by the clause, and the manager, or person running the establishment or agency, refused to dismiss them or remove them from the relevant area, that would give rise to serious concern about the way in which the establishment or agency was being run. It would therefore be a proper matter for the commission to take into account. That is precisely what is allowed under subsection (1)(b).

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a fair point about the scope of the provision. I hope that I have reassured him that, during the 15 years or so in which they have been on the statute book, the measures have not generated the kinds of problems to which he alluded. There is ample reason for leaving this part of the Bill as it stands.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am somewhat reassured by the Minister's comments. However, I do not completely accept his weak manager example. Definitions relating to one person being under the control or direction of another person are well established in our legislative system-for example, in the Companies Acts and measures relating to taxes. In his final example, the Minister assumed that the person was an employee, and implied that, provided that they were dismissed on discovery, it was unlikely that cancellation of registration would ensue. That is an important matter, which is not clearly covered in the Bill. I should like to reconsider it with a view to tabling an amendment on Report that makes explicit the scenario that the Minister outlined. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 8, line 13, after ``being'' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or has at any time been,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government new clause 22-Children's homes: temporary provision about cancellation of registration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The purpose of the amendment and the new clause is to close a significant loophole in the existing legislation, which allows a home owner to escape deregistration and subsequent disqualification simply by closing down a home before he or she can be deregistered.

<P>
The loophole was highlighted by the recent High Court judgment of Lynn Craig v. Shropshire county council. The case concerns Creative Choices children's home, which was run by Lynn Craig. I do not want to go into the details, but Shropshire county council decided to take action to close down the home. Unfortunately, owing to legal wrangles, the deregistration process was very lengthy, and the owners sold the home before deregistration was achieved. The council decided to continue with the deregistration because it wanted to ensure that the owner was disqualified from running a children's home in future. However, Lynn Craig appealed on the basis that the home no longer existed, and her appeal was upheld.

<P>
We have sought to close the loophole in two ways. First, the Bill requires the person carrying on the home and the manager, if there is one, to be registered, rather than the home itself. Secondly, registration will continue until either it is cancelled by the commission or the registered person applies for voluntary cancellation. Clause 14(2) specifically prevents a person from applying to have their registration cancelled if the registration authority has already served a notice of its proposal to cancel that registration. That should prevent an unscrupulous home owner from voluntarily surrendering their registration once they know that the commission is planning to take action to deregister them. That would be an unacceptable loophole in the framework of protection that we are trying to construct.

<P>
However, the commission will not be ready to take over its regulatory responsibilities until April 2002. In the meantime, assuming that the Bill receives Royal Assent, we intend to commence clause 38. That will require small children's homes, which are not currently registered, to register with local authorities until such time as the commission takes over regulatory responsibilities from those authorities. Those small children's homes, which take fewer than four children, have been allowed to operate in effect without regulation for many years, which is totally unacceptable.

<P>
Shropshire council, the Association of Directors of Social Services and others have been concerned for some time about the fact that 18 months or so will elapse between the commencement of clause 38 and the full implementation of the rest of part II, which may mean that the loophole that I have described will remain open. Those small children's homes are quick and easy to set up and to close down-they often operate out of leased property, which is easily disposed of. The concern is that during that 18-month period unscrupulous home owners, recognising that they might lose their registration, will simply close the home, escape the consequences of disqualification and open up their service elsewhere in the country. We should not allow that to happen. The new clause will solve that problem in the short term and allow us to close that loophole in the Children Act 1989 as soon as the Bill receives Royal Assent. The amendment has the full support of Shropshire council and the Association of Directors of Social Services. I am sure that Committee members will also want to support it.

<P>
The need for the amendment was also prompted by the Shropshire case. The decision in that case relied heavily on the present tense in the phrase, ``is being carried on'', which appears in the 1989 Act. We therefore feel it would be useful to amend clause
13(1)(b) to make it clear that the registration authority can cancel registration on the ground that relevant requirements were violated at a time that was earlier than the time at which the registration authority made its decision to deregister.

<P>
I hope that Committee members will agree to these important additional amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Notwithstanding the Shropshire case, the Government's approach develops a theme that has run through recent legislation. During the passage of the Protection of Children Act 1999, we discussed the problem of people who escape justice and slip out of the net by ceasing to practice or to remain in a position that might require them to be reported on. In a recent private Member's Bill on the health service commissioners, we examined the same problem, which is created by people who cease to practice. We discussed whether the wording in the legislation should be in the present tense, or whether the present tense should include the past tense. The Minister appears to want to bring the Bill into line with a concern that has become increasingly focused during the past couple of years. We shall doubtless have to go through current legislation to establish whether the same problem could recur. Do we need an omnibus amendment Bill that would amend the use of the present tense in relevant legislation to include the past tense? I have no problem with the Minister's perfectly sensible response to this perceived loophole.

<P>
The Minister explained why the Bill uses the somewhat tortuous phrase ``registering persons'' rather than ``establishments''. I am sure that we are all grateful to him for his elucidation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I fully support the thinking that lies behind the new clause and amendment No. 63. Will a time limit be imposed? Someone might be convicted on a technicality for running a home 20 years previously-I assume that he had not committed a heinous crime-but, even if he had mended his ways, would he be debarred for ever from carrying out similar work?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about that. He may be confusing two separate issues-the commission's coming to a decision about whether someone is a fit and proper person to run an establishment and the problem that arose in the Lynn Craig case in Shropshire. That case involved a person who closed down a home before the deregistration process had been completed, in an attempt to avoid deregistration. Such a person would be free to register other homes from that point onwards. The hon. Gentleman's point involved the period during which previous convictions could be taken into account when deciding whether someone should be registered in the first instance as an appropriate person. I do not know the answer to that question. If he will be patient, I shall furnish him with an answer in the near future.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 13, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Applications by registered persons</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 8, line 30, after ``variation'', insert ``or release''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 165, in clause 16, page 9, line 35, after ``vary'', insert ``or release''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The purpose of the amendment is to elicit what I hope will be a one-word answer from the Minister. Can he confirm that, in relation to a condition, the term ``variation'' will include the complete release of that condition?

<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting his argument so succinctly. In both cases, it is intended that the term ``variation'' should include revoking a condition, but we shall further consider whether the Bill is sufficiently clear in that respect. If necessary, we shall table an amendment on Report to tidy up any problems.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that answer, and for taking on board that point. I look forward to learning the result of his deliberations in due course, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 9, line 13, leave out from ``(2)'' to ``no''.

<P>
The only problem with going at such speed is that it is sometimes difficult to gather together one's notes sufficiently quickly.

<P>
The amendment would remove part of subsection (2). As drafted, subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regulations may provide that no application for registration under this Part may be made in respect of a fostering agency, or a voluntary adoption agency, which is an unincorporated body.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
During a discussion on clause 4(8), the Minister made it clear that, if the definition in that clause is to work, registered persons must not be unincorporated bodies. In the light of that necessary requirement, we should remove from clause 15(2) the phrase ``Regulations may provide'', so that the Bill gives effect to the Minister's reassurance.

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing the Committee's attention to this issue, and I understand his argument. However, I shall briefly explain why we may need to take additional soundings on the matter before accepting his amendment.

<P>
In the main, clause 15(2) re-enacts an existing power-in section 9 of the Adoption Act 1976-to make regulations preventing unincorporated bodies from acting as voluntary adoption agencies. This provision was therefore dealt with through the 1976 Act, and regulations have been made-most recently, in 1983-that require all adoption agencies to be incorporated bodies. All adoption agencies are now incorporated bodies, and that requirement has been in place for many years.

<P>
In respect of the Bill and the regulation of independent fostering agencies-this is the first time that they have been regulated-the question arose as to whether such agencies should also be required to be incorporated bodies. I think it likely that we shall make that a requirement. Many voluntary adoption agencies are also fostering agencies, and it seems sensible to have the same requirements for both sectors. The discussions that we have had so far with the sectors certainly provide support for that view. However, we do not want to place burdens that do not have a genuine purpose on regulated services.

<P>
The history of the requirement for adoption agencies to be incorporated is a slightly complex one, and it relates largely to the vesting of parental responsibilities in adoption agencies by the Adoption Act 1976. Those provisions were then changed by the Children Act 1989. The clear accountability structures that come from being an incorporated body have been another important feature in the requirement placed on adoption agencies. However, the Bill's mechanisms-providing for a clearly identified registered person for every regulated service-would also provide clear accountability.

<P>
We intend to consult further the representatives of the adoption and fostering sectors, and to explore further the benefits and burdens of placing this requirement on independent fostering agencies. All adoption agencies already comply with it, and we need to ascertain whether it would be sensible to make the requirement the same across adoption and fostering in this regard. Because of the need to consult further on this matter, we need the flexibility to make this requirement through regulations rather than in the Bill. I have explained why the provision looks like this, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I understand the substance of what the Minister has said. However, clause 4(8) provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The person who carries on a fostering agency falling within subsection (4)(b) shall be taken to be the voluntary organisation itself.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister does not bring forward regulations under clause 15(2), which states that a voluntary fostering agency must be a body corporate or an individual person, there will be problems with the definition in clause 4(8). I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that there would be problems if a person were defined as an unincorporated body. I did not think that that was possible according to the way in which our laws were drafted. Perhaps the Minister can correct me, and tell me that an unincorporated body can be a person, in law. However, I am not aware that that is the case.

<P>
I raise this point to highlight that internal inconsistency in the Bill. I recognise that by making regulations in respect of both adoption and fostering agencies, the Minister will be able to correct the situation, but it seems proper that the Bill should be internally consistent before any regulations are made. I appreciate the Minister's willingness to consider this matter further, and I look forward to hearing his decision in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 9, leave out lines 17 and 18 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an annual fee set by the registration authority at a level which the authority shall estimate from time to time as being sufficient to ensure that the aggregate of such fees shall meet the cost to the authority of maintaining the register of persons registered under this Part.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 148, in page 9, line 17, leave out ``an'' and insert ``a nominal''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendments deal with a simple point on the levels of annual fees. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam suggests that the annual fee should be nominal.

<P>
However, I am persuaded, as the Minister suggested earlier, that fees should be set at a level at which they are self-financing. Amendment No. 164 seeks, therefore, to set them at that level. I see nothing in the Bill that would prevent the fees from being set at a much higher level. Although I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam that they should be set at a nominal level, I would argue strongly that they must be set not at a penal level, but at a level that will recover the full cost of the service provided. The amendment is designed to achieve that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Amendment No. 148 is a probing amendment, rather like that of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, designed to determine the Government's attitude towards the regulations that will govern the levels of fees that can be set annually, whether at a nominal level or not. There is great concern among care home owners that the measure will provide for high fee levels to be set that are wholly disproportionate to the costs incurred, partly to cross-subsidise other aspects of the work. I hope that the Minister can tell us what the Government's intentions are and what regulations he expects to introduce that would govern the setting of fees in this respect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 164 in the name of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. As I understand it, the amendment would transfer from the Secretary of State to the National Care Standards Commission the ability to set the fees for its work. It is better to leave that responsibility with the Secretary of State, who will set the fees at a level that covers the reasonable costs of regulation and ensures that the commission operates within its means and makes the most effective use of its resources.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Where does it say that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am trying to explain how we intend the procedure to develop in the future. I hope that, at least in part, he is reassured by what I have said.

<P>
Amendment No. 148 in the name of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is highly problematic, as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge identified. It is the Government's policy to recover the reasonable costs of regulation through regulatory fees, as successive Governments have done for some time. For example, it was stated by the Administration in Her Majesty's Treasury's ``Fees and Charges Guidance'', which was published in 1992. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam asked me to make the Government's intentions clear. We have already done so. We have made it clear-for example in the White Paper ``Modernising Social Services''-that we want the commission fully to recover the cost of regulation.

<P>
Like all members of the Committee, we are aware that the costs of the present regulatory system are not met by the current regulatory fees, but we are putting in place a new system that will register and inspect some services that have not been regulated before. There is, therefore, clearly still much work to be done, and no decision has yet been made about the level of fees. However, the level and structure of regulatory fees will be as fair as possible. We must always remember that there are benefits to providers from good regulation.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Can the Minister say whether they will be national fee levels or whether there will be local variation, depending on the cost of the registration procedure in different regions?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should be intrigued if the cost of registering varied from one region to another.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister was surprised that that suggestion could even be made, but as different fee levels are being charged by care homes and as there are differences between one part of the country and another-because of the way the economy operates-surely there is a need for sensitivity about the additional cost burdens being placed on care homes. Is the Minister willing to recognise that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is confusing a number of matters. The fees that a care home contracts with a local authority are one issue. They vary from one part of the country to another and often vary substantially in the same authority. But that is not what we are talking about here. We are talking about the cost to the National Care Standards Commission of performing its regulatory functions, and I would not expect that to differ from one part of the country to another.

<P>
I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a scheme of charges set by the National Care Standards Commission, which would vary substantially from one part of the country to another, is a model that would find much support in this place, or most importantly, in the care home sector. However, I can reassure him that the Government will consult over proposals for the structure and level of fees.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister has answered the essential point and has taken the opportunity to outline what the Government have in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The two amendments return to the theme of ensuring that deregistration and procedures leading to deregistration occur only where there has been a breach of the regulations. If the Minster is satisfied that the circumstances in which the registration authority can start the process leading to cancellation of registration will occur only when there is a breach of regulations under clause 21, he has got it wrong. There are big issues at stake, including people's livelihoods, so it is important that the provision is written objectively.

<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendment No. 169 would insert into clause 19 a third test that a justice of the peace must take into account, before issuing an order for an immediate cancellation of registration. Thus, the registration authority must have applied for the cancellation order, it must appear to the justice that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>unless the order is made, there will be a serious risk to a person's life, health or well-being<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it must also appear to the justice that there has been a breach of the requirements of regulations under clause 21, or other relevant regulations.

<P>
In other words, the Bill should not be used to shut down an establishment for an unrelated purpose. As it stands, clause 19 could be used to shut down an establishment that is in breach of health and safety legislation. That is a serious issue, but is not sufficient to justify the sanctions in the Bill. We want to ensure that there must be a breach-or an apparent breach- of the regulations made under the Bill, before steps are taken to deregister the establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendment seeks to limit the circumstances in which the commission can propose to cancel registration, vary the conditions of registration or impose a new condition, if the regulations, under clause 21 or the requirements of other legislation are breached. It is unnecessary, as the grounds for cancellation are already set out specifically in clause 13.

<P>
In general, we would expect the commission to vary a condition of registration, or impose a new condition, only if someone is in breach of regulations made under clause 21. It is important to keep open the possibility for the commission to take action in other circumstances. For example, the commission might want to change the registration of a home for 16 to 25-year-olds, so that it is for over-18s only. The commission must always act reasonably, and all its decisions will be open to review by the independent tribunal.

<P>
Amendment No. 169 would impose similar limits on a justice's powers to grant an order for urgent cancellation, variation of conditions or imposition of a new condition. In addition to being satisfied that there is a serious risk to a person's life, health or well-being, a justice would also have to be satisfied that a regulation was being breached. As the hon. Gentleman will concede, that would impose an additional test, before an urgent order could be granted. I am not convinced that that is necessary or appropriate. The key test is whether there is a serious risk to someone; that is what matters. There is no justification or purpose for requiring that a justice must also be satisfied that a particular regulation is being breached. Imposing such a condition would build unnecessary and potentially dangerous delays into the process. I shall not say that that would apply in all cases, but there is a potential for that. In saving someone's life, speed is of the essence.

<P>
I would say to the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 166 is not strictly necessary and that amendment No. 169 would be undesirable.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am afraid that I am not convinced by the Minister's comments. It is easy to become emotive and say that protecting a person's life or welfare is the most important factor, which is obviously true. However, it would be wholly wrong if the clause were to be used to cancel registration in respect of something totally outwith the scope of the Bill. That possibility currently exists; I cited the example of health and safety legislation. This is very important, given that we are talking about the cancellation of somebody's livelihood.

<P>
Having heard the Minister, I should like to reconsider the matter and return to it on Report. Time is limited in Committee, and it merits further attention. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 9, line 44, leave out ``written''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 168, in page 9, line 46, at end add-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) Representations under subsection (1) above may be made in writing or in person and an opportunity shall be afforded to a person served with a notice under section 16 to make representations in person in the manner prescribed by regulations.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> This is an important group of amendments. Clause 17 provides that a person who is threatened with deregistration has the right to make only written representations. That runs contrary to the widespread view that one has a fundamental right to appear in person when something as important as one's livelihood is at stake. Furthermore, I have been furnished with the view that the clause, as currently drafted, may fall foul of the Human Rights Act 1998. [
Interruption.] The point may have been raised before, but the Government were very keen to introduce that Act, and must accept the many read-across implications that are bound to arise. My advice is that the failure to provide a right to appear in person at that stage of the proceedings may be a breach of the Act and will almost inevitably be tested in the courts.

<P>
The Minister may say that the requirement for appearance in person is satisfied by the tribunal procedures that follow an appeal, but that is not a wholly convincing argument. A business would be fatally damaged by a public decision to deregister, and a person whose business reputation-and perhaps much more than that-had been publicly challenged would derive relatively little comfort from the knowledge that he could go through an appeal process. Someone who is threatened with the loss of his livelihood must have the right to present his case in person.

<P>
I could say more in the context of the Government's proposals on jury trial, but unfortunately lack of time prevents me from doing so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am not happy with the amendment, and cannot recommend its acceptance.

<P>
Oral representations are allowed under the Registered Homes Act 1984, but there is plenty of evidence that they are a source of unnecessary delay in the taking of appropriate enforcement action. The initial potential for delay concerns the date of the hearing. It can be very difficult to fix a date that is convenient for all the parties concerned-and, of course, the registered person has every incentive to find problems with the proposed dates.

<P>
The practice has developed for treating such representation hearings as appeall hearings. Registered persons against whom the action is proposed increasingly tend to involve lawyers, produce reams of paperwork in their defence, insist on witnesses being called, and so on. Consequently, hearings can go on for days, and are, in effect, a dry run for the tribunal hearing that often follows. That is not at all what was intended by the 1984 Act. The purpose of the Bill is to introduce a new and improved regulatory procedure, and this is one of the many potential improvements to the current system that we have identified.

<P>
I draw the Committee's attention to the report of the independent Longcare inquiry, which was published in June 1998. They will remember that that inquiry involved a home in Buckinghamshire for people with learning disabilities. It was eventually closed down as a result of police action, rather than enforcement action by the local authority. Among other matters, the inquiry identified a problem of delay, which was caused by oral representations. Recommendation 31 of its report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The right to make representations under section 13 of the Act-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the Registered Homes Act 1984-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>should be limited to representations in writing.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I accept that, as do the Government.

<P>
If, having considered the written representations, the registration authority decides to continue with the proposed action, the registered person will of course have the right of appeal to the new independent tribunal, which will be set up by clause 20. Except in the case of urgent procedures under clause 19, the decision will not take effect until after the tribunal has considered the appeal. I am confident that that represents a sufficient check on the commission and will ensure that its decisions are reasonable. I do not swallow the hon. Gentleman's argument that removing the right to oral representations at this stage would compromise the Human Rights Act 1998.

<P>
We have all heard too many stories about the abuse of vulnerable people-children and adults-continuing unchecked for months or, in many cases, years, and after the authorities have heard about it. The Government are determined to do everything in their power to put a stop to that. The amendment would seriously hinder our attempt to correct the balance in favour of vulnerable people rather than registered persons, and I urge Committee members to reject it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am disappointed. No one condones the use of legal mechanisms to delay procedures. The Minister identified a problem, which may need to be dealt with in some way. To refer to a fundamental human right as a source of delay and inconvenience to the system, rather like jury trials, is not entirely convincing. We have certain fundamental human rights in our legal system, which are often messy, inconvenient, time consuming and sometimes costly to deal with, but which exist for good reason. We should be on a slippery slope if we said that every time something caused a delay, we should consider scrapping it in the interests of expediency. I do not suppose that many aspects of our current legal system would last long on that basis.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that he is caricaturing my arguments. We acted on clear recommendations from the Longcare inquiry, which said that the oral representation procedures were getting in the way of effective regulation and our efforts to prevent the abuse of vulnerable people. That is why we acted-we did not do so because we do not value civil liberties.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what the Minister says. I shall go away and consider the valid points that he made, and consider whether there are other ways to deal with them without scrapping the right to oral representations. Perhaps a strict timetable could be used. Meanwhile, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> This group of amendments, which deals with the interests of people who are resident in a care home and of other service users in other care settings, follows on from the previous group which dealt with the interests of the owner of a care home.

<P>
These amendments are intended to establish whether the Government will add to the Bill clear requirements about the consultation arrangements with service users, which should ensure that the appeals tribunal and other parts of the process, including the appeals mechanism, are taken into account. There is concern that the clause's drafting assumes that those who receive a service are passive recipients, to whom services are done or delivered, rather than active participants who can be involved in promoting the quality of the service that they receive. Will the Government give assurances about the extent to which service users will be involved in the processes of review, deregistration and appeal? Their views should have some weight in the process.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The views of service users on service provision are important, but we have grave reservations about introducing something as political as the views of a large number of people into what should be a quasi-judicial process. I hope that the Government will advise the Committee to resist the amendments.

<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge must have seen my speaking note. I do not want to disappoint him and I shall urge the Committee to resist the amendments. However, I want to reassure the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam because he has raised an important point on the inspection process.

<P>
We expect the National Care Standards Commission and the regulatory arm of the National Assembly for Wales to take full account of the views of service users and other relevant parties in all that they do and not just when they have issued a notice of proposal. The registration authority will base its decision on whether to cancel a registration or to impose or vary a condition of registration on the outcome of inspection visits. Talking to service users and their supporters, as well as to managers and staff, will be an integral part of inspections under the new system. The hon. Gentleman referred to clause 69(6), which defines only vulnerable adults and excludes any reference to children. When service users are children, it will be just as important for the commission to listen to them.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point about the tribunal, which is an independent judicial body to ensure that people can obtain a fair and public hearing of their appeals against decisions by the regulatory bodies. The appeal process relates only to specific cases and to points of law, and it is important to bear that in mind. The tribunal will take evidence relating to the case from relevant parties, such as the appellant or the regulatory authority, and that evidence may include information from residents of homes and other service users and their relatives.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is reassured about that at least. However, for the reasons that I have given, I cannot accept his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am partly reassured and accept some of the reservations expressed by the Minister and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I would not want the amendment to be drafted so tightly as to exclude children and young people from the consultation process. However, I wonder whether there might be circumstances in which the interests of a third party-that is, those who are receiving the service-might become relevant at a tribunal hearing. Those interests may be different from those of the inspection and regulation regime and those who are operating it. It would be regrettable if that were not reflected in the tribunal's decision-making process and we shall return to the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
