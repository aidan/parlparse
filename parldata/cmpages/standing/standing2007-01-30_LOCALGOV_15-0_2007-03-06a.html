						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000306"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> As we enter the last rounds, we come to two quite
significant amendments that would introduce issues of access and
patient journey times to the matters to be considered by local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="07030637000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
major omissions from clause 153 as it stands. A big issue for patients
is not so much the delivery of services but the reconfigurations that
are going on throughout the land, which the Government say will
continue. Medical changes might also dictate that the reconfigurations
continue. Financial pressures and the payment by results system will
also ensure a degree of change. The general policy is to move care from
the secondary care sector to the primary care sector and to centralise
around centres of excellence. All of those factors bound together will
produce a rearrangement of the health landscape in any one area. That
has specific consequences for patients, because it affects their
journey paths to services.</div>
					<a name="07030637000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">The journey to health care is
often the very core or essence of people&#146;s anxieties. People do
not doubt that they will receive quality services once they get there,
but they sometimes wonder how easy it will be to get there or, in the
case of emergency services, whether they will get there in time. It is
particularly an issue for the elderly, the socially excluded and people
with children. The matter is at the core of debates about community
hospitals, of which there have been many in this place, and of debates
about urban and suburban reconfigurations, but it is often ignored by
the health establishment. Sometimes, public transport authorities and
highways authorities seem to live in a parallel universe to health
authorities, given the limited amount of consultation and interaction
between them.</div>
					<a name="07030637000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In my area,
health services were reconfigured and services were moved from one
hospital to another as a result of an extensive medical report, the
Shields report. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 490</div>In it, Professor Shields said that such changes would create problems in
accessing services, but that those were not problems for the health
service&#151;in other words, the problems could be deposited
elsewhere. However, the changes have created problems for patients, and
if there is to be a genuine and useful patient consultative body, it
must take those problems on board.</div>
					<a name="07030637000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I understand
that we are not going to have a stand part debate on the clause, so I
wish to make a few general comments. At the heart of the proposals is
the fact that, as far as I can see, no lever of power is taken out of
the hands of the quangos and given to the community. We are going to
have a long and extensive debate about the shape of the consultative
body, but the fact of the matter is that the lever of power will remain
almost exclusively in the hands of the quangos. I am sure that the
Minister will understand what I am trying to say if I compare the
almost platonic model on which health service governance is based,
whereby governance is left to the experts and is not given or handed to
the people, with the local authority governance model presented in the
Bill. The Department for Communities and Local Government allows the
public, through electoral and other arrangements, to have an
involvement in emergency services, transport, social care and so on,
but when it comes to health services, the approach is altogether
different.</div>
					<a name="07030637000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I accept that
the Bill attempts to put a certain amount of power in the hands of the
public in so far as they will be consulted a little bit more. The
Government are inching in the right direction; but they are only
inching&#151;they are moving very slowly. With the amendment I am
trying to persuade them to go a little further. They can take a step by
accepting the amendment, which asks them to take on board a serious
concern for patients&#151;the transport arrangements for getting to
health services.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000307"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):
						</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for moving the
amendment in such a constructive way. He seeks to amend clause 153,
which requires local authorities to make contractual arrangements to
ensure that local involvement network functions can be carried out in
the relevant areas. Establishment of host organisations is relevant to
that. It might also assist if I remind the Committee that the clause
will oblige local authorities to facilitate LINKs
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07030637000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause refers to all local authorities, but clause 159 limits the
applicability of the clause to those with social services
responsibilities, and only English authorities are relevant. In plain
English, therefore, we are not concerned with districts. The LINK
function definition which the hon. Gentleman seeks to amend is
</div>
					<a name="07030637000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;promoting, and
supporting, the involvement of people in the commissioning, provision
and scrutiny of&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">health
and social care services. The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
observed that that should include monitoring as well, and I have
undertaken to consider that, because the Government see the
sensein it.</div>
					<a name="07030637000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">A second, and important, part
of the function as defined involves</div>
					<a name="07030637000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;obtaining the views of people
about their needs for, and their experiences of&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column491" />Column number: 491</div>
					<a name="07030637000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">health and social care services. An
additional element involves making those views known
to</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;persons responsible for
commissioning, providing, managing or scrutinising local care
services&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">and making of
reports and recommendations to such people about how provision of
health and social care services could be improved. As has been
mentioned, a regulation-making power is needed to allow the Secretary
of State to amend, add to or delete such activities. However, my hon.
Friend the Member for Bedford will have something to say about that
later in the debate, and we shall be able to consider it
then.</div>
					<a name="07030637000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Government believe that it is vital to promote user involvement in
health and social care, because it is only through seeking out the
views and experiences of those who use the services that we shall be
able to improve them. In fact, it is not the only way, but it is a
necessary way&#151;if not a sufficient one. It is also a way to make
services more user focused, which is what the hon. Member for Southport
desires&#151;to look at things not from the point of view of the
provider, but from the point of view of the patient or would-be
patient. In summary, the clause requires that councils with social
services responsibilities make contractual arrangements&#151;we shall
debate later with whom, and how&#151;to ensure that there are means
by which a local involvement network activity can be carried out in the
council&#146;s area.</div>
					<a name="07030637000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We are
debating amendment No. 227, which thehon. Gentleman addressed
directly, and amendment No. 226, which would broaden the range of
responsibilities. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Highways Agency, I
believe, or was it highways
authorities?</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000308"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> Highways
authorities.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000309"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						I am sure that all hon. Members
would echo his views in that respect. It is important that such public
sector agencies work together and in partnership. However, although I
do not disagree with the purpose of the amendments, I do not believe
that they are necessary.</div>
					<a name="07030637000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 227 would add the
activity of</div>
					<a name="07030637000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;notifying
relevant transport bodies of any problems or improvements in access to
care
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
is unnecessary because the clause provides that the key organisations
that will receive reports and recommendations from LINKs are the
commissioners, providers, managers and scrutineers of care services.
LINKs will certainly collect information that is important for other
organisations too, and there is nothing in the Bill to prevent them
from passing that information on. LINKs, in the first instance,
could&#151;I would argue that they should&#151;report any access
problems to the commissioner of those services so that it can take
account of those matters in its commissioning decisions and when it
influences other local partners through mechanisms such as local
strategic partnerships. LINKs will also be able to refer matters of
concern, such as accessibility, to the relevant overview and scrutiny
committee. Therefore, I agree with the intention of the hon. Member for
Southport, but argue that it is already covered.</div>
					<a name="07030637000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 226 similarly
aims to extend the activities to explicitly include obtaining
people&#146;s views on their access to services. However, that is
already captured in subsection (2)(b), which refers
to</div>
					<a name="07030637000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;obtaining the views
of people, about their needs for, and their experiences of, local care
services.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column492" />Column number: 492</div>
					<a name="07030637000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">A key part of obtaining people&#146;s
views on access to services will be the extent to which their needs
have been met and how they have experienced the services they have
received. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham gave a very good
example of the practical impact of that. In a survey of her community,
it was pointed out that access to the local GP was not being used to
the extent that the health service expected; instead, patients were
travelling a further distance to use the hospital. When asked why that
was the case, people pointed to the blindingly obvious fact that there
was a bus route to the hospital and none to the GP. Access to services,
as the hon. Member for Southport says, is the type of issue that
Members of Parliament deal with, but it is more commonly dealt with by
local councillors. The example of my hon. Friend the Member for West
Ham graphically illustrated that point.</div>
					<a name="07030637000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that the hon.
Gentleman makes about access to services has been well heard. It is
part of the rationale behind the framework that we have created to
solve those problems. That is why I believe that the clause as it
stands covers the desirable consequences that the hon. Gentleman seeks.
I ask him, therefore, to consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000310"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>
						I thank the Minister for
that clarification. I think that what he is saying is that the phrase
&#147;experiences of&#148; in subsection (2)(b) includes
experiences of getting to the services as well as going through the
services. Therefore, I am prepared to consider withdrawing the
amendment for the moment, but I will seek further clarification on the
matter from other colleagues at a later stage. However, what I would
emphasise is that the problems are often unsolved in particular areas,
and it is not clear who owns the problems. I have sat in debates in
which members from Hertfordshire, for example, have complained about
the reconfiguration of their services. They have drawn attention to the
fact that when the health service directs some patients to Watford, it
is completely unaware of problems caused by football traffic, for
example&#151;although that problem might be reduced next
season.</div>
					<a name="07030637000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						My point is
that the problems are genuine and widespread, but when they do occur,
it is not obvious whose job it is to resolve them. There can be a
certain amount of buck passing in which the health authority puts the
onus on the transport authority to produce a better bus service, for
example, but the transport authority then says that it was not advised
properly when the reconfiguration first went through. The holes in the
Bill as it stands leave certain problems unaddressed. None the less,
for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

					<a name="07030637000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and to patients
and the
public&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07030637000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendment relates to the powers of LINKs to publicise their work. There
is concern that, if the Bill does not specifically mention that, there
may be a supposition that all the LINKs do is to report to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 493</div>commissioners because that is all that is mentioned. The Minister of
State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Doncaster,
Central (Ms Winterton), sent the Committee a helpful note on how she
envisages LINKs with work. Indeed, in the draft policy statement, under
the section entitled &#147;Make reports and recommendations and
receive a response within a specified timescale&#148;, the right hon.
Lady sets out what she intends to put in regulations. The draft
states:</div>
					
					
					<a name="07030637000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulations will specify the LINks&#146; power to make reports and
recommendations and will specify...who they can make them to&#151;NHS
and social care commissioners and providers in their geographical
area&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030637000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">and nothing
else.</div>
					<a name="07030637000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
straightforward reason why the matter has not been mentioned might be
that it is intended that the work of LINKs should be published and, if
they want to bring something to the attention of commissioners and
others, they should feel perfectly free to make that information
available to the public. However, that is not in the Bill. If
regulations are tight and specify not a permissive power regarding to
whom the LINKs may make submissions, but a restrictive power so that
they make reports and submissions only to certain bodies,
patients&#146; ability to make clear to the public what is going on
will be stifled.</div>
					<a name="07030637000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the amendment is to draw out from the Minister a clear
statement either that there will be an expectation that LINKs and other
bodies will report to the public; or that the Government will make that
clear by putting it on the face of the Bill. Naturally the
accountability of LINKs to the public needs to be tested, which is a
good reason for publication, but the accountability of the bodies that
they are looking into on behalf of patients should be clear to the
public. I should be grateful if the Minister will explain what he
thinks and say whether my concerns are unnecessary or whether it would
be helpful to have such a provision in the
Bill.</div>

Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): To add a rider to that, will
the Minister clarify whether ambulance trusts would be included in the
scope of local services? As ambulance services have been regionalised,
there is in relation to access to acute hospitals concern about whether
ambulance services are capable of being scrutinised by LINKs through
this process.</div>

							<a name="07030637000317"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						The answers to the questions are
yes, yes and yes. Ambulance trusts are covered, as is clearly
desirable. The hon. Member for Ludlow makes the point that they cover a
wider area than the local authority. It is, of course, up to the
contractor bodies to make arrangements across the area of the ambulance
trust. That is one reason why we need to be flexible. Similarly, a
primary care trust might extend beyond one of two local authorities. In
some cases, local authorities are not coterminous with PCTs. The
Government, through their consultation on the reconfiguration of PCTs,
faced criticism in respect of that exercise and chopping and changing,
but part of our objective was to ensure greater geographical
coterminosity between PCTs and local authority areas. My colleagues at
the Department of Health consulted in anticipation of the policy that
we have now brought forward. That is joined-up Government, although it
did not look like it at the time. Seriously though, there is 80 per
cent. coterminosity in England now. The answer to the point that the
hon. Gentleman made about ambulance trusts is
yes.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
hon. Member for Southport makes the valid point that part of the
objective for LINKs and health scrutiny is to involve not only
patients, but those who may have been or still are patients. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is important. However, I shall resist the
amendment and will give my reasoning for doing so in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="07030637000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is clearly desirable to achieve what the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire is talking about. We expect that LINKs will publish such
information in a way that makes it available to its public. Clause 158
sets out the process for the annual report, which it is desirable to
include in the Bill. It is quite common, as hon. Members will know, for
us to receive hefty envelopes containing annual reports that Parliament
has required various bodies to produce. We want to provide those bodies
with flexibility, so we do not wish to go further and specify the
information and the process of providing it, but we do expect them to
provide the relevant information and we intend that that would be
covered in the notices and guidance that we
issue.</div>

						</b> No one would want an already bulky document at the
annual general meeting to include all the individual reports that LINKs
may have wanted to produce on their work during the year. The draft
note from the Minister, which we have seen, does not include reference
to publication. If the Minister took back to his colleagues the
suggestion that the draft guidance should make explicit the need to
make those reports public, that might do the
job.</div>

					<a name="07030637000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
is a wide power that would effectively render neutral the discussions
that we have just had about what LINKs should do, because, no matter
what the Bill says, if the Secretary of State decided in
future&#151;perhaps after complaints from health authorities or
others&#151;that the powers given to LINKs are too extreme, then
instead of returning to the House to agree primary legislation to
change the Bill, the Secretary of State may, by order, simply remove
those powers.</div>
					<a name="07030637000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
not just we who are concerned about this provision. I should like to
quote two other bodies. In relation to subsection (3), the London
Network of Patients&#146; Forums said in its
briefing:</div>
					<a name="07030637000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
is far too wide. It gives the present or any future Government of any
political complexion the power to abolish all involvement of people in
commissioning, providing or scrutiny of local care
services...without further recourse to Parliament. It was probably
drawn by an overzealous
draftsmen&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030637000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear
hon. Members say, &#147;Surely
not.&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030637000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;but
it reminds one of the original proposal to abolish the Community Health
Councils...without replacing them. It was parliamentary pressure
that caused the Patients&#146; Forums to be created as a replacement
of the
CHCs.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
London network is plainly concerned, but the Commission for Patient and
Public Involvement in Health is, too. I draw the Minister&#146;s
attention to its briefing, which specifically raises concern about this
clause:</div>
					<a name="07030637000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Clause
153(3) gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations to add
to, omit or vary any of the activities above for the time being,
whereas the legislation establishing Patients Forums...gave the
Secretary of State no power or limit to vary the functions of PPI
forums.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continues:</div>
					<a name="07030637000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Bill does not give the Secretary of State power to make regulations on
any other important matters, such as membership or governance rules and
would therefore have no ability to intervene in the future, without
amending the primary legislation, even if significant problems or
concerns rose on such
matters.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
is the power in the Bill? What is the reason for the concerns of the
CPPIH and of members of patients forums? I should be grateful if the

						</b>
						As you can see, Mr.
Chope, I am following the Committee&#146;s orchestral score a little
more carefully now, although I was in danger of being distracted by yet
another reference to a champagne moment by the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire. They keep clocking up. I hope that careful
note has been taken of that so that we are rewarded at the
end.</div>
					<a name="07030637000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asking
you, Mr. Chope, if I might range a little wider, as you have
kindly allowed others to do, as I would like to acknowledge the good
and hard work of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column496" />Column number: 496</div>patients forums&#146; members up and down the land. I have met a
number of patients forums&#146; members through the all-party
parliamentary group on patient and public involvement in health,
assisted by the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in
Health. We recently held two sessions, one in Parliament in October and
another just outside this building last January, to enable patients
forums&#146; members to have their say and to express their hopes and
fears about LINKs. The week before last, I also had a meeting with
members of the Bedfordshire patients forum.</div>
					<a name="07030637000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is remarkable that there are
threads and strong issues held in common right across the piece. I was
struck by the energy and commitment of the people. They are volunteers
and they contribute a great deal of time and effort. They are also very
well informed and their views are worth listening to. That is the
purpose of having an all-party group&#151;to hear what people outside
this House have to say. Indeed, that is also the basis of our job as
Members of Parliament. Those people wish to serve the community for the
common good and have sought to do so through the mechanism of patients
forums. Whatever happens, we must take great care not to lose the
commitment, energy and qualities of people who are understandably a
little concerned about what will happen. There is a role, and there
will continue to be a strong and growing role, for patient involvement
in health, whatever mechanism is designed to deliver it.</div>
					<a name="07030637000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We should
approach this matter from the viewpoint of the ground upon which we
stand and build from where we are. There is a lot of perplexity among
patients forums&#146; members about their abolition&#151;it is
indeed abolition that we are talking about. Although no one at the
Bedfordshire forum meeting said that they loved what is happening, I
was none the less encouraged to find that the forum had prepared a
paper, a copy of which I will pass on to Ministers, especially those in
the Department of Health, expressing the view that although the page is
a little blank&#151;the canvas is sketchy and almost
empty&#151;that provides an opportunity to help to shape what will
happen. I thought that that was an optimistic and positive
view.</div>

						I
hope that my hon. Friends fully understand patients forum
members&#146; disappointment, particularly with the decision to
abolish the forums, and that Ministers will welcome their positive
suggestions and others&#146; about the road to take. My approach to
part 11 will be to seek through a number of probing amendments to
encourage debate and thought and to encourage the Government to help us
to colour in the many gaps on the canvas, because it is difficult to
identify the architecture.</div>
					<a name="07030637000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Last Thursday
during our afternoon sitting, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove sought to
gain the sympathy of the Committee by admitting that he had been too
busy to have his lunch. I said nothing at the time, but at lunch that
day, I was given for the first time a copy of a long-awaited draft
model contract between local councils and host organisations, together
with a restricted set of papers dealing with how LINKs will function.
The bundle made reference to promised guidance on governance and
&#147;engagement activities&#148; that will be published only when
the Bill receives Royal Assent. That rich larder of information served
as my lunch. I did not eat it, but I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column497" />Column number: 497</div>did not have time to eat anything else. I am sure that I will now have
some well earned sympathy, and perhaps another notch up on the
champagne
later.</div>
					<a name="07030637000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although some
time has elapsed since Thursday, I must confess that I have not read
those documents from cover to cover, although I have had the
opportunity to examine them more. Looking at them, I have no doubt that
the Government have strong ambitions for LINKs, that hosts will play a
strong role and that there will have to be a lot more consultation
before the architecture is built more clearly. There is a lot more to
be done. It is important to consider the documents in the context of
the amendments. Nearly all the amendments moved were prepared and
tabled before we knew of the documents. None the less, our debate will
be important.</div>
					<a name="07030637000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
also fall for the assumption made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove
that the words on the face of a Bill mean what they say&#151;that the
English used means what I understand English in common-sense terms to
mean. That is why I am pressing amendment No. 182. I shall assume, as
subsection (2) says, that the purpose of LINKs is to promote and
support</div>
					<a name="07030637000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the involvement
of people in the commissioning, provision and scrutiny of local care
services&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07030637000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
obtain</div>
					<a name="07030637000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the views of
people about their needs for, and their experiences of, local care
services&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">and to make
such views known in</div>
					<a name="07030637000265"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reports and
recommendations...to persons responsible for commissioning,
providing, managing or scrutinising local care
services&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07030637000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						That
seems absolutely fine. I do not know how else one could describe in a
nutshell what a public involvement organisation should do, whatever one
calls it. That is fine, but as has been mentioned, subsection (3) risks
undermining that function entirely. The Conservatives wish to delete
the subsection altogether, but I think that that would be too
restrictive. It is sensible to be able to vary or perhaps add to the
measures. Indeed, when they are established, LINKs might wish anyway
for a mechanism to do so without going through all kinds of
complicated, time-consuming bureaucratic procedures.</div>
					<a name="07030637000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, to
allow the Secretary of State to omit any of the activities in
subsection (2), even if they must consult on that omission, seems
inappropriate. It goes too far. It could send a negative or
destabilising signal at a time when people need to be reassured that
there will be a firm foundation for patient and public involvement in
health. My amendment seeks to reduce that uncertainty. I look forward
to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000325"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b> As I understand the amendments, they are very
different. Amendment No. 198 would ensure that the powers defined in
the Bill could not be varied by the Secretary of State, while amendment
No. 182 would just ensure that they could not be varied to omit any of
the LINKs&#146; existing functions or roles. The ministerial
position, in contrast to the amendments, appears to be to reserve the
right in subsection (3) for unfettered varying.</div>
					<a name="07030637000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am in favour of the Secretary
of State&#146;s having some power to add to and to refine
LINKs&#146; powers. I do not anticipate that he would give LINKs
extreme power, as the Conservative spokesman suggested&#151;I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column498" />Column number: 498</div>think that, if the Government did that, we would be amazed&#151;but
there is clearly a drive in the Committee to understand what the
variation might mean, given that no guidelines have been laid down on
it. The most acceptable outcome, from the Liberal Democrats&#146;
point of view, would be variation governed by certain guidelines and
restrictions.</div>

							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I support my hon.
Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire. I referred in our
discussions last week to some of the concerns raised by my patients
forum, and this is one of them. There was concern that part of the
unspoken, hidden rationale was the feeling that successful patients
forums had rubbed people the wrong way.</div>
					<a name="07030637000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">If patients forums or the
proposed LINKs are to do their jobs properly, it will sometimes be
necessary for them to deliver messages that are
uncomfortable&#151;uncomfortable for health service managers, for the
Department and maybe for local authorities. They must be able to do so
in the full confidence that, if their messages are
uncomfortable&#151;if they sometimes say things that are harsh but
necessary&#151;there will not be a tendency, as sometimes happens, to
say, &#147;Let&#146;s get rid of this rather awkward, turbulent
priest and be done with it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a suspicion at the
moment that that is partly what has happened to the current patients
forums. If they are to be successful in the guise of LINKs, they must
have guarantees of independence. There is a concern about independence
of funding, to which we can return later, and about how they will have
the independence to inspect rigorously without being obstructed. There
is also a concern that their functions should not be chopped and
changed in a way that could at the very least emasculate their
effectiveness.</div>
					<a name="07030637000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sure that that is not in the minds of the Ministers here today, but who
knows how such things will proceed? There are always pressures, and
although I appreciate that the ability to remove the turbulent priest
by statutory instrument is an improvement on Henry II&#146;s method,
the principle is just as unpleasant and inconvenient. If people are to
have confidence in the volunteers whom we want to involve, surely they
are entitled to know that the goalposts will not be changed as
punishment for being effective and delivering harsh but necessary
messages.</div>

					<a name="07030637000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
shall explain what the Government are trying to do in clause 153. The
experience of the patients forums, as the Government acknowledge, was
that their role and functions were too tightly prescribed in primary
legislation. Changes in health that occurred more quickly than some
might have expected meant that the forums were unable to adapt to fit
the changing circumstances and their working environment as well as
they and we would have liked. Therefore, it is important to retain the
power to amend the specified activities. That is not unusual when
establishing bodies. It will enable Parliament to adjust the role of
LINKs on proposals from the Secretary of State when they are necessary
to reflect changes in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column499" />Column number: 499</div>health and social care. I agree with the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst in that we have to pass legislation for a sustained and
unforeseen period, not only for circumstances as they exist. It is
perfectly possible that new functions and areas of health and social
care will come about as a result of technological developments, or as a
result of localised changes and the devolutionary powers that health
and social care services have.</div>
					<a name="07030637000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the Committee that
both Houses of Parliament will make the decision on future proposals,
which will be subject to the affirmative procedure. Our intention is
for LINKs to remain up to date, which is why we wanted subsection (3).
As I said, it is not unusual that Parliament and the Secretary of State
should retain such powers.</div>
					<a name="07030637000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The Committee
has a problem with the word &#147;omitting&#148;. The intention of
having that word in subsection (3) is to account for possible changes
in local circumstances, or for functions that are carried out at the
moment but which might not be necessary in the future. I was told, when
I entered Parliament, that it was still illegal not to practise archery
on a Sunday. I have always believed that post-legislative scrutiny
should get rid of laws as well as build them up. That was the entirely
honourable intention behind the word &#147;omitting&#148;. My hon.
Friend the Member for Bedford and Opposition Members have identified
circumstances in which the power may cause disquiet among the people
that we are trying to encourage, but mention of Henry II is going too

the wording of amendment No. 182. Should we accept it, the clause would
not read properly because of the comma&#151;a tiny, technical point,
but striving for perfection is a good thing. The Government agree with
the intention of amendment No. 182 as regards the word
&#147;omitting&#148;. However, we believe that amendment No. 198
goes too far because, if accepted, the Secretary of State and
Parliament would not be allowed to bring the measures up to date when
circumstances require. There is also the issue of how LINKs will
develop. They may be required for support functions such as training
that are not prescribed but which may become necessary. I would like,
with the patience of the Committee, to find a way of getting rid of the
word &#147;omitting&#148; while making the Bill read

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(4A) The

incurred by that local authority in making contractual arrangements
specified under subsection

					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(4B) Nothing in this

					<a name="07030637000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment has a number of aims. It provides, first, that the Secretary
of State should make available to local authorities sufficient funds to
deliver effective local LINKs; secondly, that councils are welcome to
be generous and to add to that sum if they wish; thirdly, that
information about the funding made available to each local authority
should be open to scrutiny by the public, councillors and Members of
Parliament; and, fourthly, that local authorities should use the
funding that is made available by the Secretary of State to support
LINKs and hosts, not for other purposes. The amendment is designed to
meet concerns raised by forum members and by others.</div>
					<a name="07030637000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Ministers
have said, and it should be repeated, that patient and public
involvement in health and social care will involve a vast number of
people and organisations&#151;not only the patients forum members.
Concerns have been raised across the piece that, as is often the case,
funding will be insufficient. Whatever the state of the economy or of
the settlements for local government, local councillors&#151;I have
been one&#151;always say that funding is insufficient. Unless things
are nailed down there is a temptation to use funds for other purposes,
and the fear is that the funding for LINKs will not be ring-fenced and
could be used for other purposes. I accept that there might be more
that is wrong with the amendment than merely a comma. It probably would
not succeed in achieving ring-fencing, but its purpose is to generate a
debate and probe the issues.</div>
					<a name="07030637000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						A lot of the
talk about costs is speculative, and I would appreciate some guidance
from Ministers on the funds that might be made available. If that is
too much to do now, perhaps the Minister could write to me later. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column502" />Column number: 502</div>All sorts of figures are being bandied around. For example, it is being
said that community health councils cost, in their last one or two
years, an average of &#163;150,000 each. People have said that each
LINK, and each host that sets one up, will get that amount, but I do
not think that that can be correct, because there were many more
community health councils than the proposed 152 LINKs. The amount that
is currently spent on patient forums is also being mentioned. I believe
that that is &#163;26 million, which equates to &#163;170,000 per
new LINK. If the central costs of the Commission for Public and Patient
Involvement in Health are added to that&#151;I am informed that they
are &#163;1.5 million&#151;the average figure increases to
&#163;184,000 per LINK. The commission itself estimates that an
average budget of &#163;400,000 will be required for LINKs to carry
out the vast range of tasks that have been set for them&#151;tasks
that we have just discussed. That would produce a national total of
more than &#163;60 million.</div>
					<a name="07030637000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whatever happens, LINKs will
not come cheap, and there will be high expectations of the new system.
They will cost money, and people will want to see that money being used
cost effectively. Whatever the amount is, it will all be needed for
LINKs, and it will not be acceptable for it to be frittered away in
other directions. The amendment is intended to avoid
that.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Brake</b> (Carshalton and Wallington) (LD):
						Does the hon. Gentleman agree with ring-fencing in
principle? Is it the appropriate way for local government finances to
be managed? I admit that it is an unlikely scenario, but I encourage
him to consider a situation in which LINKs had worked so
effectively&#151;with embedding of processes in parts of the health
service&#151;that they were no longer required. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would mean that there would have to be a
certain amount of spending on them nevertheless. Will he consider
that?</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000344"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> We may have a clue as to whether it is needed after
a few decades of studying how the new system has worked. However, I
find it difficult to imagine that there will cease to be a need for
patient and public involvement in health and social care&#151;I
really do not see that need disappearing. Given the pace of change in
the welfare system&#151;technological, scientific, medical and in
other ways&#151;I envisage an increase in the need, rather than a
decrease.</div>
					<a name="07030637000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
principle of ring-fencing ensures that taxpayers&#146; money, which
comes from the Government for these purposes, is delivered through
local councils to host organisations. There is a specific purpose for
the money and, in principle, I do not see any harm in ensuring that the
money is delivered for that purpose. Ring-fencing is the sort of
mechanism that has occasionally been used before to ensure that a job
is done. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that we have the
opportunity to debate that matter and to hear what the Government are
thinking.</div>

							<a name="07030637000345"></a>Dr.
Pugh:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>
						We support the thrust of
the amendment if not its actual fine detail. I think that it will be
well received by treasurers of local authorities who are used to local
authorities being given extra responsibilities and then being told by
the Secretary of State that the cheque is in the post. Sometimes they
have difficulty 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column503" />Column number: 503</div>finding the cheque for the sum that they incurred when they took on the
new responsibility. It seems to me that the hon. Member for Bedford is
suggesting housekeeping measures that will have to be agreed to at some
time anyway. It is really a question of how it is done and whether it
is done by adding a schedule to the Bill, by making provision elsewhere
in the Bill or by a Minister&#151;or more probably a civil
servant&#151;on a Friday afternoon. I think that I prefer the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s solution to the
problem.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): Mr. Chope, I hope
that you will give me licence to raise one or two points that might
more properly be discussed on clause stand part. I will refer to the
amendment, but I understand that it is not your intention to allow a
clause stand part debate.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be grateful if the
Minister confirmed for me that when the amendment refers to local
authorities, that means local authorities with social services
departments. In two-tier areas such as my own, that would be the county
council rather than the district
council.</div>
					<a name="07030637000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
Minister pointed out that approximately 80 per cent. of PCTs are now
coterminous with local authorities. In my constituency, our PCT is one
of the 20 per cent. that are not. In Tameside and Glossop PCT, Glossop
comes under Derbyshire LINK, and the rest of the PCT area comes under
Tameside metropolitan borough council&#146;s LINK. In those
situations, the local authorities and the LINKs must be obliged to talk
to each other if they are discussing services and constituents who live
in their area. That leads me to ask another question: if someone lives
in Glossop, and therefore comes under Derbyshire county council and
Derbyshire LINK, but uses a service in Tameside, which is within the
same PCT but outside their LINK area, would they take their problem to
the Derbyshire LINK, which covers where they live, or to the Tameside
LINK, which covers the area where the facility is provided? In other
words, are the inspections on behalf of the residents or of the
facilities?</div>
					<a name="07030637000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point relating to that and the amendment is that the administrative
costs in those LINKs that are dealing with more than one PCT area will
presumably be significantly higher than those in which there is a
one-to-one relationship. Will the Minister give an assurance that where
LINKs have to deal with more health bodies than would be the case in a
coterminous situation, the additional funding will be
supplied?</div>

							<a name="07030637000347"></a>Mr.
Dunne:
						</b> I share the concerns raised by the hon. Member for
High Peak, particularly in relation to LINKs covering a relatively
narrow geographical area. The issue that comes to my mind is of
services that go beyond the scope of the general PCT. I refer here to
specialist services. In my area, for example, the mental health service
has been taken out of Shropshire County PCT and now comes under the
South Staffordshire Healthcare Trust, which has responsibility not only
for mental health services within South Staffordshire but also across
the Prison Service. I understand that the trust looks after mental
health services in more than50 prisons, including on the Isle
of Wight. Has the Minister considered how a trust that develops
activities way beyond its historic area will interact with LINKs? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column504" />Column number: 504</div>In particular, has he given consideration to how LINKs can fund their
activities if they wish to go across
boundary?</div>

						Finally,
I wish to ask the Minister from where will the funding come? As it is
to come as a result of the Bill, I assume that it will come from his
Department. Was the &#163;26 million of PPI forum funding to which
the hon. Member for Bedford referred a Department of Health budget? Can
all local authorities be secure in the knowledge that the funding will
be provided to them through their relationship with their own
Department rather than from the Department of
Health?</div>

							<a name="07030637000348"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I want to reinforce my hon. Friend&#146;s point
about prison medical services. I practised as a barrister in the
criminal courts for 25 years and I sometimes had a great deal to do
with the recipients of prison medical services, so that strikes a
important chord. There is real concern among legal professionals, the
judiciary and the probation service about the variable quality of
medical services in prisons, how they are provided and their
accessibility. There is a difficulty with transparency and patient
voice in prison medical services. I do not expect the Minister to have
an answer now, but I flag up the matter because it is of real concern,
particularly given the linkage and the large number of people in prison
who suffer from mental health
problems.</div>
					<a name="07030637000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
concern about the difficulty in finding means by which we can keep up
consistent pressure to improve the quality of services, especially
when, for example, prisoners on remand may be moved from one
institution to another and therefore come under the care of more than
one trust as the provider. There is a complete lack of transparency and
accountability in those circumstances. People in prison, by its nature,
often do not have the constituency base to argue for them that there is
in the general
community.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000349"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Last week, I visited a prison and saw its medical
services. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the cost implications for
LINKs set up in an area with prisons are significant? The process of
consulting prisoners will clearly be more challenging than consulting
the public
generally.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000350"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> Indeed&#151;the hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right. LINKs may not be the solution for prison medical services, but
we must have something that will safeguard the interests of prisoners,
either on remand or convicted, who are also patients. Inadequate
treatment of a number of problems, particularly mental health, is
sometimes a significant trigger in reoffending, as we all know. It is
important that the matter is taken away and looked at and, perhaps
before the Bill is discussed on Report, we can receive more assurance
about how overview and scrutiny of medical services in prisons will be
dealt
with.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000351"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their comments because
they really show the value of Bill scrutiny. Many of the points that
have been made and the questions that they throw up provide reasons why

<div class="Column"><a name="Column505" />Column number: 505</div>the precise prescription in the amendment is not desirable. I think that
my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford accepts that. The arguments that
have been made are very pertinent to the consideration of the
Sustainable Communities Bill. In essence, we have heard the experience
of Members of Parliament in the real world and how we have to adapt to
that to make mechanisms
work.</div>
					<a name="07030637000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of
Parliament make representations on behalf of their constituents to
service providers that are sometimes at the other end of the country or
overseas. They sometimes make representations on behalf of people whose
last known address was in their constituency, but are now overseas or
serving &#147;at Her Majesty&#146;s pleasure&#148;, if I could
put it that way. The arrangements are important and I am grateful to
members of the Committee for raising
them.</div>
					<a name="07030637000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I confirm to my
hon. Friend the Member for High Peak that we are talking about social
services authorities. Two-tier district authorities that do not provide
social services would not be covered. In consideration of his point
about what we do in areas that are not coterminous, I was casting
around for the most difficult example in the country; I then realised
that it was Glossop in Derbyshire and in the same thought, realised
that my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak was on the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07030637000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
Committee Members who know that part of the world will know that there
is a natural community in the north-west of Derbyshire that pulls
towards the Greater Manchester area in terms of travel-to-work
arrangements, but that the rest of the constituency of Derbyshire pulls
towards the rural and beautiful county of Derbyshire. Indeed, my hon.
Friend&#146;s mental health trust is shared with other local
authority areas in the Greater Manchester area, including my own.
Therefore, he raises a very good point.</div>
					<a name="07030637000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington has raised the point about prison medical services. In
those circumstances, other things being equal, the costs would be
higher. That is why we believe that the mechanism of grant distribution
should not be as tightly ring-fenced as my hon. Friend the Member for
Bedford&#146;s amendment would have it.</div>
					<a name="07030637000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments and the debates
around this clause strike at the very principles that underpin local
government funding. Promising the end of ring-fenced funding is an easy
way to get a round of applause at the Local Government Association
conference, as the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr.
Cameron) discovered last July. It is a different thing altogether when
one looks at some of the many functions that local government provides,
especially under a regime of devolution and partnership working. In
practice, one applies pragmatics to the deliberations. Local councils,
as has already been said, will always present a gross bill for their
new functions. In my experience, they have never presented a net bill
of the savings as well as the new costs. I do not expect them to do so,
but I always hope that they will. We therefore have to be wary in our
implementation of the new burdens policy&#151;a policy to which the
Government are committed and for which, as has already been
established, we do deliver the money.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>
					<a name="07030637000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall deliver the money for
the LINKs function, but one has to be has to be realistic in preparing
new burdens grants and ensure that that they are meeting net costs and
not paying an invoice that has arrived from 150-plus local authorities
around the country. I am not suggesting that treasurers would over-egg
the pudding&#151;they do not need me to suggest that. They put
together the most ingenious, innovative reasons why every one is
unique. Sometimes they are right&#151;sometimes there are real needs,
as described by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak. It would
therefore not be sensible to make legislation that precisely prescribed
a mechanism that would result in, in effect, a blank cheque. On the
other hand, it is entirely desirable that the functions are properly
financed, both in their establishment and in their operation. Let me
explain how we propose to do
that.</div>
					<a name="07030637000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are four parts to amendment No.180. The first proposes that a
requirement be put on the Secretary of State to ensure sufficient funds
are available to cover a local authority&#146;s costs in its work to
put in place contractual arrangements that enable the establishment of
LINKs. The intention, as the Committee knows, is that the Secretary of
State will make a grant to each local authority to enable it to fund
its activities to procure a host organisation&#151;those are the
establishment costs&#151;and subsequently to fund the
activities of the LINK itself. We propose that the grant should be made
under section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003. The grant will be
explicitly targeted to provide funding for the purpose of making
arrangements to establish a LINK. In relation to this part of the Bill,
it is Department of Health money that I am spending on the
champagne.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000353"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> We have better than cava in our
Department.</div>
					<a name="07030637000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In
making the grant, the Secretary of State will assess what levels of
funding will be necessary for each local authority to cover its costs
and ensure that there are sufficient funds to enable arrangements to be
made to fulfil the activities set out in the Bill. The grant will go to
the council in recognition of the fact that the council has a statutory
duty to fulfil those activities, but will not prescribe the money too
tightly, as ring-fenced budgets in other areas do. That will give the
local authority some flexibility in making arrangements.</div>
					<a name="07030637000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">In anticipation of the new
arrangements, we are working with local councils and with the Local
Government Association, which is once again carrying out an essential
function on councils&#146; behalf, to determine the costs associated
with administering and monitoring contracts between councils and host
organisations, which will vary according to the nature of the area and
the local authority&#146;s infrastructure. Funding will be allocated
to local authorities according to a mechanism that takes into account
factors such as variations in size and arrangements with health
care-providing organisations. We believe that to put all that on the
face of the Bill would create a self-fulfilling prophecy of
complications and bureaucracy. At the end of the day, it would not give
the taxpayer the best value for money.</div>

						</b> May I ask the Minister to note that an issue about
formula funding in health care and local authority matters is arising
in rural and semi-rural areas? There is a concern that formula funding
does not properly take into account some of the problems of such areas,
such as distance and isolation. I am keen for him to indicate that any
formula should take into account such issues, because there is a
debatable point about how they are currently handled, and I want that
to be
noted.</div>

						</b>
						The ears of my hon. Friend the
Member for Wigan are twitching after that intervention. He represents
Wigan and the metropolitan authorities and he is conscious that if I
answer in the affirmative, the metropolitan authorities will get a
smaller slice of the cake, other things being equal. That is the
problem faced by any Government in distributing funds&#151;a point
that I urge hon. Members to raise with proponents of the Sustainable
Communities Bill, as that fact of basic arithmetic seems to have gone
missing. My answer is yes: sparsity is a factor in the proposed
distribution calculation.</div>
					<a name="07030637000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members will point out the
apparent differences between the health funding formula and the social
care funding formula. Under the social care funding formula, we take
into account the number of people over 90 in an area, but I believe
that in health funding the cut-off age is 85. That represents a
sensible policy relating to prevention and health. As health and social
care are brought closer together, funding formulas must be rational and
transparent. We all desire that. What we do not want to do in
recognising the different pressures on different areas is to create a
complicated formula, because complicated formulas are the enemy of
transparency and accountability. They are also the enemy of a happy
state of mind for Ministers for Local
Government.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000356"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> The formula, complicated or otherwise, is to do with
the amount granted to a local council to set up hosts and LINKs. My
question is not only about whether that amount will be enough, but
whether the money will be used for the purposes for which it is
allocated.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000357"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The answer is that yes it will. Special grants
over and above the revenue support grant are often described as
ring-fenced. When there is flexibility, the money is given in the
expectation that a council will carry out a function. We do not
prescribe and create a situation in which if x amount of money is
given, it must be spent specifically on certain expenditures because
there are different ways in which functions can be undertaken. For
example, if one wants good use of buildings, one might enter into an
arrangement with a health authority to rent one. Is the money involved
to be accounted for by LINK, or should the accounting of it be
proportionate to the fact that the building might be used by another
part of the health and social care service, or by an independent
tenant?</div>
					<a name="07030637000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The formula
and special grant, under the 2003 Act, does not prescribe exactly; it
meets the purposes that my hon. Friend, on behalf of LINKs and the
people hoping to be involved, quite rightly outlined. Can we guarantee
that the money given to a council will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column508" />Column number: 508</div>passed on to LINKs, or does the fact that councils control the money
give them sway over LINKs that may be detrimental to independent
scrutiny and accountability? I give my hon. Friend the assurance that
the mechanisms of the grant-making powers in the 2003 Act are designed
to do the former. That is also why I teased my hon. Friend the Member
for Wigan when he talked about the abolition of ring-fenced grants:
there is a general predilection against them when one talks to local
councils, and a general predilection in favour when one talks to
pressure groups and charities.</div>
					<a name="07030637000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The 2003 Act
provides for a mature way in which to fund councils, whereby there is
an expectation that functions are delivered without the unnecessary
bureaucracy that the present and previous Governments have imposed in
the past.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000358"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> May I bring the Minister back to the subject of
complex formulae? He expressed a preference for simple formulae. Do I
take it from that that the presence of a prison will not influence the
amount of funding for a
LINK?</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000359"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The most extreme example I can remember of an
argument for change to a funding formula in social care involved a
local authority, which said that because it had an above-average number
of blocks of flats with an above-average number of stairs, it took
social workers in the area longer to meet clients than elsewhere. The
hon. Gentleman knows&#151;we have debated this before&#151;that
formulae cannot be too complicated. I said simple formulae, not very
simple formulae; that is important. The judgment will be based on
factors such as the size of an area, the nature of the population,
demographics and so on. It will perhaps also be determined by factors
such as the one he mentions.</div>
					<a name="07030637000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the hon. Member for Bromley
and Chislehurst, I can confirm that prison medical services will be
covered by LINKs. LINKs will make representations about and will cover
prison medical services on behalf of the patient, which is to say the
prisoner, not the prison. Therefore, what matters is how many prisoners
a local authority area has, not whether they are imprisoned in their
local authority. I am certainly not going to suggest that some local
authority areas have more people in prison than others, but hon.
Members will be aware of the delicate
balance.</div>

						I do not want to hold up
proceedings unduly and the Minister may not be able to answer this
question just now. Yarl&#146;s Wood, which is the largest asylum
detention centre in Europe, is in my constituency. It has had some
issues relating to medical and health care. What provision is being
made to ensure that detained asylum seekers and their representatives
have access to health LINKs? I do not expect the Minister to have the

and for many years he has argued&#151;very conscientiously in my
view&#151;on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column509" />Column number: 509</div>behalf of the asylum seekers or failed asylum seekers when it would be
easy for him not to do so. I will give him an answer on that important

						<b class="B"> </b>I just want to make a helpful passing
comment to the Minister. The issues being raised by the hon. Member for
North-East Bedfordshire are not any different to those in respect of
patient advice and liaison services. When an individual has a complaint
that they want make, they use the PALS procedure. It is already
established that PALS will take a complaint from anyone who lives

						<b class="B"> </b>I appreciate the spirit in which the
Minister has approached the question of prisons, and I hear what he
says about funding. My intervention also relates to access, which is a
point my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire has raised
as well. There is concern among the prison population in particular
that prisoners can be transferred between a number of institutions and
moved from the care of one trust that is providing for a number of
prisons into the care of another. There is a long-standing concern
about the handover of prison records to ensure continuity of treatment,
medication and so on. Again, I appreciate that the Minister will not
have the answer at his fingertips, but can we have some assurances in
writing about how LINKs will work to ensure that there is scrutiny of
the prison medical service, and about how prisoners and their families
can get access? Their specialist advisers will need access as well
because they may need the right medical reports to put before a
court.</div>

							<a name="07030637000365"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>The hon. Gentleman makes a good and fair
point. He will know also of the circumstancesin which a prison
can commission a number of health providers. Even when the prisoner and
patient isunder their jurisdiction, they are not necessarily
in the same hospital. Therefore, I will comply with his
request.</div>
					<a name="07030637000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">In proposed
subsection (4B), it seems that my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford is
aiming to allow local authorities to spend more on making contractual
arrangements than the allocation provided by the Health Secretary.
There is nothing in the Bill to prevent councils from making additional
funds available for LINK activities. I hope that my hon. Friend
willagree that the amendment is not necessary in that
respect.</div>
					<a name="07030637000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see
what is being proposed in subsection (4C). It is a means by which a
local council can be identified if it has chosen to use some of the
funds provided on expenditure that is not LINKs related. As I have
said, I think that it is right that local councils be able to spend
funds in a way that best enables them to make appropriate arrangements.
That they have to make the arrangements is what the Bill is designed to
ensure.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column510" />Column number: 510</div>
					<a name="07030637000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Secretary of State
makes grants to fund LINKs to local authorities, the amount of the
grant is in the public domain. As it is a special grant, unlike the
revenue support grant, it is possible to identify how much has been
allocated. That is not the case for other items. The most recent
example that occurs to me is the concessionary bus fare scheme, in
respect of which money was put through the revenue support grant
formula. It is not possible to identify specifically how much is being
given in such cases, but it is possible in the present case, which is
the reason for having chosen the funding mechanism that has been
adopted.</div>
					<a name="07030637000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">It follows
that local authorities will have to account for their monies, and the
monies that they make available to fund LINK activities will be covered
by the annual audit. LINKs will be able to say how much money local
authorities made available to fund their arrangements, and they will
know how much the Secretary of State provided. I imagine that they will
be professional and vigilant in holding any diversion to
account.</div>
					<a name="07030637000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
problem on subsection (4D)&#151;my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford
acknowledged it&#151;is that the resulting process for arranging
statements and national auditing might be too complicated. Money will
be made available to local authorities, and they will be accountable.
They will have to make decisions in line with the thrust of the Bill,
which is designed to give greater local freedoms and flexibilities. The
Government will ensure that grants are open and transparent, and LINKs
will know how much money has been made available.</div>
					<a name="07030637000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe that the Bill
achieves approximately the right balance, and I hope that my hon.

been helpful. My hon. Friend did not refer to the total sums that might
be available, and I cannot quite understand that. There is a lot of
speculation about whether that total will correspond to the amount
spent on patients forums and on the commission, or be equivalent to
community health council spending. Although the Minister might not be
able to state the amount now, I hope that he will write to me to give a
broad indication.</div>

The answer is that the amount is not yet known, because we are entering
discussions with local authorities to identify their needs. There is an
obligation to provide sufficient funding, however. The budget for the
Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health for 2006-07 is
&#163;28 million. If the Bill passes, that money would be taken into

of people&#146;s understandable fears will be answered when people
consider what he said about section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003

know that there will be a great deal of interest in such matters as the
time approaches, and I am sure that they will wish to ensure that the

						</b> This group of amendments relates to the membership
of LINKs. The Bill&#146;s ambiguity on membership is an issue about
which our consultation with forums and their members indicates
concern.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 199 addresses a point that I hope can be quickly dismissed, which
is that there is nothing in the Bill requiring LINKs to be comprised of
real people, so LINKs could comprise an entirely virtual
arrangement&#151;a concept that is not unusual nowadays. The whole
process could be undertaken not with individual people operating in a
personal capacity, but by means of the web, or another virtual
mechanism. Colleagues will remember that Elizabeth Manero and Sally
Brearley of Health Link gave witness evidence earlier in our
deliberations. A website could be a means of carrying out the
activities of a LINK. Our amendments set out clearly that people should
be involved in LINKs, but I hope that the Minister can reassure us
quickly about such
matters.</div>

					<a name="07030637000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
amendments also specify our concern about who might be on a LINK. On 8
February in Westminster Hall, I had a meeting with 23 representatives
of individual patients forums throughout the country. It was organised
by Ruth Marsden, the chair of the PPI forum for Hull and East Yorkshire
Hospitals Trust and the lead member of the associated forums of London,
Leicester, Rutland, Yorkshire, Humberside and Teesside. We had a good
cross-section of members of patients forums in Westminster Hall that
day. Their concern ranged across the board from the abolition of forums
to the introduction of LINKs. I have referred to some of their worries
in earlier debates and I shall be using them in
future.</div>
					<a name="07030637000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two concerns
were expressed about membership. They were worried that the membership
of LINKs is moving away from pinpointing patients&#146; concerns and
patient involvement with those members from a much wider group who have
an interest in health services and social care services. The specific
concern was that the views of patients will be swamped by the views of
those representing professional organisations. A member of the forum
from Dorset said at the Westminster Hall meeting:</div>
					<a name="07030637000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Dorset is an early
adopted project for LINKs. There was a meeting in January. only two
forum members were there. A few were other people, all outnumbered by
loads of health care
professionals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Individual
patient representatives are worried that the new expansion of LINKs,
which is full of the right wording about involving more people,
actually means diluting the emphasis that is being placed on the voices
and needs of patients. That is terribly easy to do in a health care
context. We all know how easy it is to sit round a large table when
those whose profession it is to talk and represent others daily can be
intimidating for ordinary members of the public who do not do it very
often. Even if they become skilled, they can still feel that they are
in the presence of those who can make life difficult for
them.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000372"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that individual
patients, as we know from contact in our surgeries, often feel
threatened about the presence of some professionals, especially if at
some point they need to go back into the health service and perhaps
encounter the same people about whom they wanted to make a
complaint?</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000373"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. There is a further
variation of what he said. It is worth noting and is serious enough for
the Minister to have in mind. Also at the Westminster Hall meeting and
in discussion with representatives of patients forums, the fact was
raised that they receive a number of complaints and concerns from
members of staff in hospitals and trusts. They find themselves a
valuable sounding board for those who, for one reason or another, feel
uncomfortable about voicing their concerns about what is happening in a
trust through the formal trust mechanism because they might be
identified. We all know how the world works: no one wants to be
identified as a troublemaker or anything else. The involvement of
health care professionals sitting round the table may make it less
likely that the forums are used as a necessary safety valve by members
of staff in the NHS to make their
points.</div>
					<a name="07030637000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a separate
point, there was great concern about the loss of expertise. Everybody
mentioned the fact that it is not easy these days to get people to come
forward to take part in mechanisms such as the patients forum. It took
painstaking work to bring people on board. We have discussed
people&#146;s concern that the abolition of forums means somehow that
their views and efforts have been cast aside&#151;we might return to
that point when we debate clause 160 stand part&#151;but many forum
members also mentioned the difficulty of bringing people on board and
keeping them there.</div>
					<a name="07030637000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hence, amendment No. 200 would
passport existing forum members to the new LINKs. They do not want to
apply for positions to find that those responsible for setting up the
new LINKs are picking out individuals and saying, &#147;They may have
caused trouble in the past, so we&#146;re not going to put them
on.&#148; We have evidence from people who have been excluded from
forums. There is concern about that, so amendment No. 200 would
passport existing members of the forum.</div>
					<a name="07030637000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
accept the amendment. When his colleague and counterpart the Minister
of State, Department of Health, the right hon. Member for Doncaster,
Central (Ms Winterton), came before the Committee as a witness, she
said that she hoped that everybody who was already a forum member would
come forward to ask to be a member of a LINK. We could make her wish
come true by removing an element of the application and simply bringing
into the LINKs all those who are already forum
members.</div>
					<a name="07030637000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
point to make about numbers. Worcestershire patient and public
involvement in health forum sent the Committee a note dated12
February that
said:</div>
					<a name="07030637000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Meredith
Vivian&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030637000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">a senior
official at the Department of
Health&#151;</div>
					<a name="07030637000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is on
record as saying that he envisages up to 1,000 people/organisations
being involved in a local LINK. There are great risks with such a large
body, particularly in decision
making&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07030637000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that we all agree that once a body gets so large, it can be a
great talking shop, but its ability to do something will be hampered.
How large will the LINKs be? How will we get the necessary balance
between involving Uncle Tom Cobleigh and all and forming a small group
of people experienced enough to go into trusts and do the job that they
are required to do? How easy will it be for trusts to say, &#147;This
body is too large 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column514" />Column number: 514</div>and unwieldy, and there aren&#146;t enough people with specific
experience, so we won&#146;t give them access to our premises because
we don&#146;t believe that they&#146;ll be capable of doing the
job&#148;?</div>
					<a name="07030637000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues are serious. If LINKs are too large, how will the training be
done? Where will the funding come from for new, expanded LINKs taking
in so many people? The figure was that 1,000 people in an area will
have an interest in health and will therefore be eligible to join a
LINK. How on earth will that number be restricted and made more
manageable? Nothing in the Bill indicates
it.</div>
					<a name="07030637000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having raised
those issues, I shall mention one further point. I have looked at the
evidence to the Select Committee on Health dealing with patient and
public involvement in the NHS. This debate gives me an opportunity to
say again how concerned forum members are that the Bill has been
introduced when the Select Committee has not completed its
deliberations on the very issues that the Bill deals with. If the
Minister dips into the evidence, as I am sure he has, he will
understand the reasons for it. I cannot claim that I have read every
word in the extensive volume of written evidence to the Committee; I
have not needed to. If he dips his thumb into a submission by virtually
any forum, he will find a familiar range of concerns illustrated. I
pick out two for reasons of time.</div>
					<a name="07030637000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first comes from evidence
submitted by the Kettering general hospital forum. It
says:</div>
					<a name="07030637000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
membership is too large, LINKs will be unwieldy and expensive and not
good value for
money.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Evidence
submitted on membership by the Kingston forum
says:</div>
					<a name="07030637000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This is
a very grey area. In order to prevent interest groups taking over,
independent members should be a majority. Very unclear as to which
voluntary organisations should be members&#151;no definition of
membership.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07030637000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Minister dips into this volume, he will find similar comments
replicated all the way through, but at least they are public. Evidence
has not been published from the Department of Health&#146;s
consultation process on a stronger local voice, in which information
was submitted by forums. The Department of Health has not made
available to this Committee, or to anyone else, information on the
feelings of forum members. I close on that because I do not want to go
on too long and we still have more clauses to
come.</div>

colleague in the Whips&#146; mafia. My points are serious, how is it
to be decided? How is this expertise to be retained? How are the
individual voices of patients not to be swamped by those of
professionals in the health service? In terms of size, how are LINKs
going to be manageable? How is training&#151;and funding for
it&#151;going to be available to ensure that people can do their
jobs?</div>

						I echo the comments that the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire has made about much of our debate
being informed by the views of patients forum members, as I said myself
earlier this morning. Indeed, the amendments tabled in my name are
inspired by discussions with patients forum members.</div>
					<a name="07030637000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is important to
recall&#151;and I think I have mentioned this&#151;that matters of
public involvement in health and social care are not only the property
of patients forum members. I have thanked patients forum members for
their excellent work and dedication, and for being so well informed.
However, many others who are involved in local voluntary organisations
and members of the public, particularly the latter, rarely, if ever,
dip into these matters. Therefore, I commend the Government for trying
to embrace them and givethem an opportunity to be heard. That
raises many questions that are the purpose both of the amendments and
the scrutiny under which this Bill is being placed today.</div>
					<a name="07030637000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause
16, tabled in my name, deals with regulations. The Bill, as drafted,
does not allow the Secretary of State to make regulations on membership
and governance of LINKs. The new clause provides the Secretary of State
with those powers so that should there be concerns in the future about
matters of membership and governance&#151;which inevitably there will
be up and down the land&#151;he or she will not be able to intervene.
It will be for others to resolve those matters. There is always a risk
that if there are no national criteria&#151;minimum
standards&#151;to avoid inconsistency in membership and governance
arrangements around the country, there will be greater necessity to
have recourse to the courts to deal with those matters. That is always
open to people but it would be better if we made it necessary or at
least closed down the number of opportunities or requirements to do
it.</div>

						Having
no statutory basis for rules governing membership and governance might
lead to a perception that the bodies that are so set up, are in some
ways weaker than if those matters were dealt with on a statutory basis.
I note that the draft documents were made available last
week&#151;the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire may not have
had the chance to read them cover to cover any more than I
have&#151;none the less, their existence shows that the Government
intend to address some of those matters. Page 4&#151;from paragraph
221 onwards&#151;of one of those draft &#147;do not copy&#148;
documents touches on Government arrangements, but it is a very light
touch. Presumably, as I said earlier, the intention is to consult
before publishing guidance, but, as mentioned elsewhere in the
documents, it will not be prepared until after the Bill receives Royal
Assent.</div>

						</b> Indeed. That is why we are debating and probing
those matters in Committee. Significant elements of the landscape and
architecture might become clear to us later, but the plan is that the
descriptions and guidance will not be made available until after Royal
Assent. That is why I am raising those issues now. We have been
promised detail after Royal Assent, but that will come too late for
legislative scrutiny. We need a bit more detail
now.</div>
					<a name="07030637000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
am hoping that my hon. Friend the Minister will be as helpful as he
can, as indeed he always is, and provide an explanation. There are
difficulties because it is not planned to make some things available
until after the Bill has proceeded through Parliament. That raises one
question: why can he not accept the new clause? Presumably, the draft
policy documents and so on will deal with the same matters.
Furthermore, what are his views on LINKs having a minimum number of
members&#151;a core or board as it were? Some or all of them could be
checked by the Criminal Records Bureau. The hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire referred to patients forum members&#151;they are checked
by the CRB. Making use of such people would have advantages for time
and bureaucracy. However, they should be used only if they want to be
made use of. They should not be compelled, which is possibly the
implication of earlier
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07030637000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
ensure that LINKs have sufficient people to carry out their functions,
which would mean having people checked by the CRB in that way. How does
my hon. Friend the Minister think that we can ensure that potential
conflicts of interest can be identified? For example, a voluntary
organisation might want to be part of a LINK and to get a contract from
the local council to deliver care services. That might make sense.
However, how can we ensure that a LINK is not used by a local campaign
that is very intense for a few months, whose members join and take over
the LINK, achieve their one-off objective and then disappear again?
Obviously, that is not the intention of the provisions, but we need to
probe those matters and ensure that there is some protection to allow
the LINK to continue with its main task as well as to take on board
concerns raised by the public, as will happen now and then.</div>
					<a name="07030637000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are all sorts of
questions, and all sorts of solutions. We have mentioned a core
governing body, around which there could be a federal structure
involving different people and organisations concerned with different
topics, which could be opened up to greater numbers of people as
needed. Will there be a requirement on LINKs to operate according to
standards such as those advocated by the Independent Commission on Good
Governance in Public Services? I have a few documents from the
commission that set out some of the standards that it advocates. A
number of questions have been raised today about those matters and it
is important that they are answered or, at least, that the direction of
travel is indicated so that we can be confident that the LINKs will
achieve the Government&#146;s
ambitions.</div>

							<a name="07030637000379"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Clause 154, which hon. Members are seeking to
amend, deals with how a LINK is established by a council and how the
host organisation is set up. Subsection (4) proscribes who cannot be
involved in the LINK. It sets out who the third party is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column517" />Column number: 517</div>to support the LINK, and that the host organisation may not be the LINK
itself. We are talking, therefore, about three bodies. The first is the
local authority that commissions and contracts with the host. The
second is the host organisation, which may be a voluntary body. In
response to later amendments, we will debate what cannot be a host
organisation. Thirdly, the clause describes how a LINK can be
established.</div>
					<a name="07030637000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I was
looking for a populist headline&#151;and I have never knowingly not
done so&#151;I would say that we are scrapping a &#163;28 million
quango and giving the money to local voluntary groups so that they can
hold their health and care services to account. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.
Members:</span> &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] Thank you. I am
convinced that if the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire had said
that, Opposition Members would have said &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;
Often, Members listen not to what is being said, but to who is saying
it&#151;but that is a debating
point.</div>
					<a name="07030637000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
clause enables the local authority to make payments to the body that
hosts the LINK and provides its administrative support. It also
requires it to make arrangements that include provision for annual
reports, which I have mentioned before. The amendments relate directly
not to the contracted arrangements in clause 154, but to what is being
contracted&#151;what its function is, and how we can ensure that
there are regulations to set boundaries for its
activities.</div>
					<a name="07030637000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
point, there is a difference in opinion. The Government intend LINKs to
be flexible enough to fit the circumstances that work locally, and
free, as far as possible, from central control. That is partly because
we want to ensure that they are independent, and are seen to be so, and
partly because it is a devolutionary measure and therefore the
necessary regulation&#151;I am not talking about formal
regulations&#151;should be subject to different mechanisms. We intend
to give each local authority with responsibility for social services
guidance on and procedures for how the contracts should be drawn
up.</div>
					<a name="07030637000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
believe that it is vital that any system supporting user and public
involvement is independent from external control, either from the
health service and social care, or from political influence. LINKs will
be established at the level of local authorities but will not be run by
them. The clause makes it explicit that the local authorities will not
host them directly. That is important in ensuring their independence.
It is intended that the host organisation for each LINK should be
procured through a tendering process. We are putting no limits on what
type of organisation can perform this role&#151;although there are
some limits that we will come on to&#151;but we think it likely that
voluntary or community sector organisations will be well placed to
demonstrate the local knowledge essential successfully to undertake
this contract.</div>
					<a name="07030637000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
host organisation will be required to use its funds to support and
promote the activities of its LINK. It will spend the funds as the
LINK&#146;s governance structure directs. We come, therefore, to the
points that hon. Members made in their amendments about how such
arrangements can be delivered&#151;I shall not use the word
&#147;controlled&#148;, because that would have an unfair
implication&#151;and how we can ensure fairness, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column518" />Column number: 518</div>probity and so on. The Government take the view that LINKs should not be
subject to diktat from the centre and we therefore want flexible
arrangements. The means of influencing the arrangements would therefore
be the contract between the local authority and the host, as well as
the guidance that is issued.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I therefore
return to the point that I made on a previous amendment: the experience
of patients forums was that the legislation was overly prescriptive and
limited their ability to adapt to local needs or changes in
circumstances. For example, the statutory nature of membership has
limited the diversity of their membership and their ability to involve
a wider range of people, although that is not at all to devalue their
work.</div>
					<a name="07030637000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">That goes to
the heart of the point that the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire
made in moving his amendment. He seeks to protect LINKs from being
influenced by professional bodies and perhaps organised infiltration,
if I can use that emotive
phrase.</div>

Woolas:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman does not like that phrase, and
the Government certainly do not. My argument, however, is that too
narrow a definition of membership will not allow the public as a whole
to be involved. The draft contract and the guidance therefore contain
the idea that not only individuals, but voluntary organisations should
be involved. We are trying to harness the vast knowledge, energy and
benefits that individuals and groups can bring to the health and social
care services. Let us imagine all the support groups and informal and
formal networks that exist in our constituencies&#151;the stroke
associations, diabetes associations and disabled users&#146;
organisations. A whole range of people and voluntary organisations can
therefore become involved in LINKs.</div>

							<a name="07030637000382"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> I understand what my hon. Friend is saying about
vast numbers of individuals and groups becoming more formally involved
with LINKs, but he must be sensitive to the strongly held view among
many patients forum members up and down the land that they have already
established such links&#151;if I can use that term&#151;and that
their forums&#146; constitutions and set-ups have not prevented them
from making a vast range of contacts with local voluntary
organisations. I am not saying that that is the case throughout the
country or that the situation should not be improved on, but my hon.
Friend must be aware that there are people out there who think that
they are already doing much of what he
says.</div>

Woolas:
						</b>
						That is of course the case,
which is why evolution, and our debate last week about how to describe
these things, is important. However, we should not be too prescriptive
or centralist, and we should recognise&#151;this is an important
point, which came out of the contribution by my hon. Friend the Member
for High Peak&#151;the different natures and health needs of
different areas. The statutory nature of membership has limited
diversity, and we want LINKs to be more flexible to reflect the nature
of their local communities. We do not want, as new clause 16 does, to
prescribe details of membership such as the proportion of members who
should be individuals or voluntary organisations.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>
					<a name="07030637000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Bedford is right to ask whether LINKs are covered by the good practice
and probity models. Of course, they are statutory institutions, and
interests must be declared in accordance with standards in public life,
under the Nolan principle. Conflicts of interest are important, which
raises the question of what people do if the charity or voluntary
organisation is a service provider and an advocate, as is often the
case. That is why it is important that that point is dealt
with.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000384"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> I do not want this essential point to be lost. As
the hon. Member for Bedford said, nothing that currently happens in the
health service prevents the various organisations and representative
bodies that the Minister has spoken about from being involved with
their local health service and making all the representations that they
need to make. In addition to the access that they already have, a
distinct patient voice exists in the forum. However, the new LINKs do
not add anything to the representative organisations&#146; ability to
do their job and they remove the mechanism for the distinctive patient
voice to be heard on its own. That is the members&#146; fear. If
there is no provision to ensure that, say, individual patient members
constitute a majority of LINKs, that voice will be lost. The fear out
there is based on the concern that this grit in the oyster can be
uncomfortable. If the patient voice is subsumed in a larger body, it
will be diluted and eventually lost. That is the reason for pressing
for the distinctive patient voice, which will not be heard in the
larger LINK proposed by the
Government.</div>
					
					<a name="07030637000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000385"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I understand the concern that the hon. Gentleman
has expressed on behalf of some of the patients forums. I said at the
beginning that there is an honest disagreement here. Judging by the
evidence that has been given, there is certainly fear in patients
forums that that voice would be diluted. However, large numbers of
people do not feel that they have access to advance their point of
view. Organisations that are often loosely based and without
professional back-up, and which often do not have knowledge of or
access to computers, are facing the daily struggle to care for family
members&#151;and they have to consider the range of health and social
care provision. Those people are not often minded to be involved in
formalised membership
organisations.</div>
					<a name="07030637000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
approach provides the flexibility to ensure that local areas can have
the best of both worlds and that, through the guidance and the draft
contract, provision is made for the establishment of the sorts of rules
that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, under which the number of members
and the board would be prescribed, as would the different functions of
LINKs, through which there may be a focus on the patient experience of
transport access, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
said. The LINKs might want to consider the provision for patients with
a certain condition, such as stroke victims, and how health and social
care could cope with them. They might wish to look at a local
hospital&#146;s catering provision. That broader flexibility allows
the LINKs to have the best of both worlds.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>
					<a name="07030637000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">One has to be realistic about
fears that the patient&#146;s voice would be lost. There is the voice
of the patient in general, which is the voice of the public, and there
is the voice of the patient in assessing needs and experiences, which
this part of the Bill addresses. In a debate on an earlier clause I
said that this is about the interface between participation and
representative democracy. Prescribing how constitutions, rules,
standing orders and structures should be made would not achieve the
objectives that Committee members wish to be
achieved.</div>
					<a name="07030637000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 200 seeks automatic transfer for forum members. I hope that I will
not be interpreted as being anything other than supportive and
appreciative of what has been done, but to prescribe terms of
membership in that way would, again, take away flexibility. Forum
members can become members of LINKs, and we will encourage them to do
so. I imagine that in many cases they will need no encouragement.
However, I recognise, as in the evidence, that there may be individuals
who feel that their work is not being valued and that they do not want
to take part in LINKs, which we would not at all want to
encourage.</div>
					<a name="07030637000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">At heart,
there really is a disagreement as to what we are trying to do, which is
why I feel unable to serve any champagne. I believe that the points
made in local areas will come to fruition through the contractual
arrangements agreed and through the obvious necessity to balance
participation against probity and fairness. Automatic transfer would
cut against practicalities and against the idea of a bottom-up
structure instead of a top-down one. I hope that those who expressed
their desire for devolution&#151;such as the hon. Gentleman who is
about to intervene&#151;will support my point of view and not the
amendment.</div>

approach. However, given the diversity of the LINKs that will no doubt
emerge, would he reflect on how it might be possible to ensure a
national view of what is happening in those diverse
LINKs?</div>

							<a name="07030637000387"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That brief intervention takes us down an avenue
that I think is covered elsewhere in the Bill, but the hon. Gentleman
makes an important point. My answer is to call on Parliament, because
that is Parliament&#146;s job in part. He has a serious point; the
Bill does not prescribe for a national LINKs, although it does not take
away the possibility&#151;or the probability. Because of the overlap
of boundaries&#151;the High Peak or Glossop point, as opposed to the
Bedford point, if I may put it that way&#151;in many areas such
arrangements will need to be put in place. However, Mr.
Chope, I think you would stop me if I strayed down that road. I give
way, very

						</b> The Minister has forgotten one part of the argument,
which was the business of whether or not a LINK is a virtual body or
one of a different sort. The clause says that a local involvement
network is either to be &#147;a person&#148; or constituted by
&#147;(b) any other means&#148;. I understand that there was a
discussion about this during oral evidence to the Select Committee on
Health; the two chief architects of the policy, Harry Cayton and
Meredith Vivian, appeared to differ in
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>their views on that important question, unable to decide between them
whether the question should be left to local discretion or whether a
LINK must have members. Would the Minister enlighten us as to precisely
what &#147;(b) any other means&#148; might mean? Is it the
intention of the Government that there should be virtual LINKs in some
areas, rather than real people doing a real
job?</div>

						</b> I have to correct myself in two ways. First, it is
not logical to be very final&#151;one can be final or not final. I
apologise. Secondly, I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his powers of
scrutiny, because there is indeed an &#147;or&#148; in there. Under
the enlightened, modern, devolutionary legislation, setting up a
virtual LINK is possible. That is not going to happen, but it is
technically possible. LINKs could be carried out virtually, but that is
clearly not our intention. The Bill allows for some flexibility, but I
cannot imagine circumstances in which a LINK would be exclusively
virtual. Thanks to the geography of certain areas, there might be
advantages in the procedures, and we would want to ensure that there
was fair access to such virtual arrangements. In any event, I
congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his powers of scrutiny in
discovering the &#147;or&#148; between paragraphs (a) and (b) of
clause
154(2).</div>

have listened carefully to the Minister&#146;s explanations, but I do
not think that they do the job of satisfying the many people who are
profoundly concerned about the way in which the Bill is going. Let me
make it clear that I shall withdraw the amendment only because I intend
to return to the matter and to vote against the abolition of the

that we are having. I am not willing to divide the Committee, because
that takes time and we have other things to do, but I am not satisfied
with the answers, nor do I think that those outside this place will be.

						</b> This amendment is intended to ensure that those who

commissioning health services&#151;that is to say those who are not
named in clause 154(4). Because health services are now commissioned by
more than just the statutory providers with which we are familiar, it
has to be made clear that those who commission or provide local care
services privately cannot also host a LINK. That is the purpose of the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07030637000394"></a>Patrick
Hall:
						</b> If I had caught your eye on the last set of
amendments, Mr. Chope, I would have asked my hon. Friend the
Minister about the points that he has just made on the guidance on
governance structures that he plans to make available after Royal
Assent. Would he consider making available, as the Government have
helpfully done on the draft contracts, an advance copy or outline of
that guidance, so that we can get answers on certain matters?</div>
					<a name="07030637000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 15
seeks to do something to address an issue that is frequently raised by
patients forum members and others in the context of LINKs. That is the
absence, to which my hon. Friend has already alluded, of a national
body. The new clause would introduce such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>body to serve local involvement networks. That would constitute the
rebirth of a quango, so would be another opportunity for my hon.
Friend&#146;s press office to launch a populist campaign against it.
The role of a national body would be to promote co-ordination, to share
work, to improve communications between LINKs, to provide information,
to organise training and support for LINKs across the country and, in
so doing, to achieve the efficiencies and cost-effectiveness that 152
separate organisations would struggle to achieve.</div>
					<a name="07030637000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to share
information and improve communication among organisations across the
country, because many issues are not just local. Many health and social
care issues are regional and national in nature, and it might make
sense for local examples to be considered and reflected upon in the
national context. Some things are best done from the viewpoint of a
national
dimension.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07030637000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07030637000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
under the present organisational system of commissioning, patients
forums have recently carried out two national surveys into hospital
bedside telephone services and hospital catering. These surveys, known
as Fair Talk and Food Watch, were assisted by the existence of a
national organisation&#151;the Commission for Patient and Public
Involvement in Health&#151;which advised participating forums on how
to conduct a survey, and how to collate and to publish its outcome. As
I understand it, a similar survey is being undertaken this month by
patients forums in England into patient dignity on hospital
wards.</div>
					<a name="07030637000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The telephone
service exercise asked hospital patients and visitors about the cost of
making outgoing phone calls using bedside telephone equipment. That
certainly highlighted an issue of national concern, yet it was done in
local areas up and down the country. The survey found widespread
unhappiness with the high cost of calls, and that work contributed to
the Department of Health patient power review group&#146;s
examination of those matters. A national body would also assist in
scrutinising decisions that have a regional or national dimension, of
which, as we know, there are many in the national health
service.</div>
					<a name="07030637000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given time,
it is true that, in the absence of a national organisation, LINKs would
themselves want to develop mechanisms to communicate across the regions
and nationally&#151;and that might be sooner rather than later. I
think that my hon. Friend the Minister was alluding to that a few
minutes ago. A membership body is an alternative approach, but that
does not exist yet, and in order to set one up the component members
need to have enough resource to contribute to it. Although I am not
certain of this, there is a question mark over whether a voluntary
membership body that is not set down in statute is the weaker for
it.</div>
					<a name="07030637000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However it is
dealt with, whether in the Bill by setting up an organisation, or by a
grassroots-up membership body, it is vital for LINKs to have a national
voice. I do not see how LINKs can be at all effective unless that
develops. The national health service is going through radical change,
to which the Minister already referred. That internal reconfiguration
is partly based on medical and scientific improvements, as well as the
need for reform. For some, that is presented as a threat; it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>certainly controversial. Yet while it has the potential to deliver
better health services, what is required at every step of the way is
for as many people as possible to be informed&#151;that is, not only
seeing what is happening in their towns or villages, but putting that
into the wider context of their region or country. Every area is, or
will be affected by that.</div>
					<a name="07030637000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">Patients forums are already
engaged in these matters and, later, LINKs will continue to be. They
will have to be deeply involved&#151;and they must be, if the voice
of the public is to be heard while being informed. While much of that
work will rest upon local context and knowledge, one cannot address
these matters unless there is a wider dimension. Indeed, the driver
behind much of this comes from the Department of Health, through
strategic health authorities; therefore, it goes beyond the local
straight away. There needs to be scrutiny on a wider geographical basis
than is envisaged by the 152 LINKs dealing with these things
independently. It is important to plug the bigger picture into the
local network of LINKs, and I hope that the Minister will take that
point fully on board.</div>
					<a name="07030637000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tabled two other
amendments. Amendment No. 183 is dependent upon new clause 15 being
accepted and there being a national body. It would allow a local
authority to enter into a contract with the national body in order to
act as the host of a LINK, should that be the best way of doing it. In
some parts of the country there may not necessarily be a suitable local
voluntary organisation to act as a host. There may be some that are
capable of doing it. It is also possible that such organisations may
already be contracting with the local authority to deliver social care,
for example. The amendment simply offers that
option.</div>
					<a name="07030637000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
184 touches on the point that the hon. Member for North-East
Bedfordshire raised earlier in giving a general view of these matters.
Its purpose is to give LINKs physical, rather than virtual form. In the
draft document that was made available last week, there was a reference
in paragraph 4 on page 8 to premises and venues for meetings. But that
is in a section dealing with hosts. The document says that hosts should
have premises, which should exist. It does not go on to say anything
about the LINK. Because of the way that that is written&#151;I
confess that I have not read the document from cover to
cover&#151;there is a danger that LINKs might be regarded as
secondary to the hosts.</div>
					<a name="07030637000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hosts will have an office,
but LINKs might not have to. Hosts will look after the LINKs budget,
too. The LINKs might not have a bank account, I suppose. There are a
number of issues here that I look to the Minister to address. If some
of them entail looking at that document and writing to me, I will be
happy to accept that. He may not have read it from cover to cover over
the weekend, missing breakfast, lunch and dinner in order to do
so.</div>

					<a name="07030637000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
criticisms that members of Committees often make of Ministers is that
we are against something on the ground that it was not invented here. I
find myself in the interesting situation that, although 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>my Department is not the author of these policies, in preparing for the

						</b> We are not getting anywhere near
jeroboams.</div>
					<a name="07030637000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
amazed by the cynicism of members of the Committee and the idea that
Ministers would not consider whether they agreed with the policy. The
more I have thought this policy through over the past few months, the
more I commend it to the Committee. This is a way that we believe we
can have participation in these affairs without adopting a top-down
approach. There is some consistency here. When we debated the clauses
on the Valuation Tribunal Service, we said that we did not wish to set
up by statute a national body of members of tribunals. The Valuation
Tribunal Service would be national&#151;the civil service of the
tribunals&#151;but we did not think that it was right to set up on a
top-down basis a national body of members of tribunals. Such a body
would exist and would be an important part of the function of
tribunals, but it would be created from the bottom up.</div>
					<a name="07030637000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Similarly, if
the LINKs wish to establish&#151;and I imagine they will&#151;a
regional or national structure, perhaps to examine specific issues, I
am sure that that will happen. However, to prescribe it on a top-down
basis would lead to the accusation that the Government are creating
quangos, and a public belief that the body in question is not
independent of the state or Government.</div>
					<a name="07030637000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are as a country to
improve participatory democracy we must ensure that relevant bodies are
not only independent but seen and believed to be so, so that the people
who make their views known do not think that they must persuade the men
and women in suits in the statutory bodies, but can instead access the
organisations in question. There is a genuine difference. I believe
that in practice regional and national groups will be established for
the sharing of experience and findings. Nothing in the Bill prevents
that, and there is indeed some encouragement from the Government in the
relevant policy area for such proper help for LINKs. The Department of
Health has recently contracted with a consortium led by the university
of Warwick to provide advice and guidance on patient and public
involvement. The NHS Centre for Involvement will perform some, not all,
of the activities that are listed in new clause 15&#151;in particular
providing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div>advice and good practice on patient and public involvement and reporting
to the Secretary of State on how patient and public involvement is
working.</div>
					<a name="07030637000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall go
on to debate the future of the Commission for Patient and Public
Involvement in Health and I respect the remarks made by the hon. Member
for North-East Bedfordshire on his last group of amendments; I think
that it is clause 160 that gives us the opportunity. In any event LINKs
are, as we have discussed, very different from patients forums, and to
establish another body like the commission would be to set up an
organisation not best fitted to the job that LINKs members would want
to do. We are clear that there will be many local bodies able to
provide the support needed by LINKs. Procurement will be through an
open tendering exercise and the bodies will need to show that they have
the qualities necessary to perform the role that is being contracted.
Funding a national corporate body&#151;even if such a body were
necessary centrally&#151;would represent a major diversion of funds
that are needed at local level. I am sure that there will be no
shortage of voluntary and community-sector organisations ready and
willing to bid for the job of supporting LINKs. We certainly would not
want to fund another body to perform that role when the capacity, local
knowledge and familiarity with health and social care services is
already available.</div>
					<a name="07030637000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Amendment No.
183 would provide local authorities with the power to decide whether to
choose the national health service health involvement network that
would be set up under new clause 15, or an organisation that the local
authority believed to be well placed and equipped to do the job. I have
already spoken about the suggested national health involvement network,
and I agree that local authorities should be able to choose the
organisation that they think is best equipped to carry out the
functions of the host of a LINK. We are clear that local authorities
should be left to make those decisions themselves. That is precisely
why we are giving them the money and freedom to make the assessment of
the necessary arrangements themselves. I do not believe that the
amendment is necessary, because, by providing the funds, we are telling
local authorities &#147;Over to you&#148; and leaving it to them to
get the best organisation for the
job.</div>
