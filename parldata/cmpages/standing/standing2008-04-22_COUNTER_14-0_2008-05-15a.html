Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing
(Mr. Tony McNulty):
						</b> On a point of order,
Mr. O&#146;Hara. It is more a point of information.
Members of the Committee will see that I have tabled a letter to you
and to Mr. Bercow, your co-Chairman. I am glad to see that
the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has a copy, because, as I
promised, it refers specifically to &#147;noxious things&#148;.
There is also a reference to jurisdiction and the retrospective nature.
But I draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the comments on
jurisdiction in relation to Northern Ireland: there is a remote
possibility that such a transfer of jurisdiction could include the
Diplock provisions. I do not want that to be the case, and nor does the
Committee. I therefore draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the
part of the letter that says that I shall table an amendment on Report
to ensure that that potential, however remote, does not occur in the
context of the relevant clauses. I hope that that is helpful to the
Committee.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.

Further to that point of order, Mr.
O&#146;Hara. The Minister&#146;s statement was extremely helpful.
It is essential that we have sufficient time on Report to cover this
now expansive range of issues. If there is any attempt to truncate the
time available on Report, we will be in the same situation as we were
with proceedings on the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act
2008.</div>

applying for judicial review. The provision might have serious

to be given proper scrutiny by Parliament.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000369"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I tend to agree with the hon. and learned
Gentleman. If anyone had any doubt about the deficiencies of the
negative procedure, they would only have to have been at business
questions this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for North
Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes) pointed out how
extraordinary it is that orders can be made that are
subject to that procedure, and despite there being a
prayer against such orders, they can come into effect and be in effect
for some time prior to any debate taking place in the House. On Tuesday
evening, a Minister agreed that an order was deficient and offered to
come back with a new one, despite the fact that it had been in place
for some time. Such procedural matters are not for the Committee, but
they nevertheless need to be addressed in the near
future.</div>
					<a name="0805165000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000370"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> When I was a member of the Joint
Committee on Statutory Instruments, I learned that although the
Committee can consider an instrument and regard it as defective, it
does not prevent the Government from going ahead and implementing it
under the negative procedure.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000371"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman is
absolutely right. These are not matters that we can consider now, but
he underlines the point that the negative procedure is not satisfactory
for making rules and regulations that could materially affect the
interests of an individual or a
company.</div>
					<a name="0805165000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000372"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> It is an interesting debate, and one for which I
have some degree of sympathy. Any number of times on Committee I have
flipped from the negative to the affirmative in the interests of
scrutiny, but I am not going to do so on this one. The matters
concerned are of such importance that the sooner, for example, the
police are deployed to a particular location, the better.
The negative procedure approval mechanism is
appropriate in this case. However, I do have a lot of sympathy for what
has been said.</div>
					<a name="0805165000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I never
had the dubious pleasure of being on the Joint Committee on Statutory
Instruments, but I am sure that it is very interesting. We have had
some fun quite recently with a statutory instrument that it sent back
about 10 times as deficient, and we did not lay it until we got it in
order for the JCSI&#151;that is the Home Office being cutting-edge as
usual in terms of the primacy of parliamentary scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="0805165000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
substance of the amendment, notwithstanding the importance of the
potential impact on a designated individual, the negative procedure is
appropriate. While the Under-Secretary of State for the Home
Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling and I have anything
to do with it, we will deal with the matter when and if such an order
is prayed against. For all the reasons outlined, I would rather resist
the amendment and stick with the negative procedure in this case,
although I have some sympathy with the broader ideals.</div>

							<a name="0805165000377"></a>Mr.

treat this as a clause stand part debate as well,
effectively.</div>
					<a name="0805165000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 80
provides the means for a designated gas transporter to recover any
payment or cost that he has incurred with respect to the provision of
extra policing at gas facilities. A designated gas transporter will be
able to recover any payments he has made or costs that he has incurred
from consumers via the regulatory arrangements in place for the term of
the gas transporter&#146;s transmission charges. We wish to ensure
that the recovery of any payments made or costs incurred by a
transporter is without detriment to the transporter&#146;s finances
and is not at risk of a future change of view as to how those payments
or costs are to be treated by the industry regulator.</div>
					<a name="0805165000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">In crafting
the recovery mechanism, we have provided that the mechanism applies
despite anything in the gas transporter&#146;s licence, issued under
section 7 of the Gas Act 1986, that would prevent the transporter from
recovering such payments or
costs.</div>
					<a name="0805165000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
203 would remove the provision in subsection (3) which disapplies any
licence condition that would hinder or obstruct the recovery of payment
or costs made or incurred by the gas transporter. In addition, our
consultations with the industry show that they desire
certainty&#151;quite naturally&#151;and have agreed to this
recovery mechanism on the assurance that there would be no obstacles to
them being able to get reimbursement of the policing costs placed on
them by the Secretary of State. As a result, removal of the provision
could seriously impede the ability of the Secretary of State to recover
the costs of extra policing.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column506" />Column number: 506</div>
					<a name="0805165000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 204 appears to
attempt to restrict the Secretary of State&#146;s means to implement
cost recovery for police deployment. To facilitate the recovery of
payments made or charges incurred by the gas transporter, subsection
(4) of clause 80 provides a means for the Secretary of State to direct
the industry regulator to allow the payments made and costs incurred by
the gas transporter to be taken into account in determining the
transporter&#146;s charges, either in determining its current year
charges or by allowing the designated transporter to take the costs
into account as an allowable regulatory cost over an agreed longer
period.</div>
					<a name="0805165000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">In short, the
provision allows the Secretary of State to direct the regulator to
ensure that the designated gas transporter is able to recover its costs
for policing. The amendment removes the ability of the Secretary of
State to direct the regulator to treat the costs of the designated gas
transporter in a particular way&#151;for example, as if they were
operating expenditure for the purposes of the regular price control
mechanism. That would negate the proposed recovery mechanisms of
clauses 79 to 82, so I would ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="0805165000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
difficulty is imposing a recovery mechanism on an
industry that, quite rightly, already has a rather complex regulatory
framework under Ofgem. I apologise for the clumsiness of the
architecture, but we are trying to deal with existing law, the
regulatory framework and the new elements, and that explains the
complexity. In that context, I would ask that the amendment be
withdrawn.</div>

							<a name="0805165000382"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Clause 81 places on the Secretary of State the
statutory obligation to consult both the
regulator&#151;Ofgem&#151;and the designated gas transporter before
requiring the payment of any costs under clauses 77 or 78. In so
consulting, the Secretary of State is not required by subsection (2)(a)
of this clause to take into account, as the hon. and learned Gentleman
says, any representations made after 28 days. In effect, this provision
sets a 28-day cut-off date for representations to the Secretary of
State, so that discussions of the details of the cost recovery
mechanism can proceed quickly&#151;which, I think, is in
everybody&#146;s interests&#151;based on the issues raised by the
affected main parties, namely the transporter and the regulator, during
the consultation period. The hon. and learned Gentleman asked quite
fairly whether that was enough: in our view, the answer is
yes.</div>
					<a name="0805165000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 206 seeks to
remove the relevant subsection entirely. That would create a conflict
between the principal objective and general duties of the Secretary of
State and the authority in this area, and the exercise of the functions
under clauses 77 to 81 of the Bill. The deletion of the subsection
might prevent the Secretary of State and the industry regulator from
using the powers under these provisions. The subsection allows the
regulator to permit the cost of recovery arrangement for the specific
purpose, without being in breach of its own obligations.
As with the complexities we talked of earlier, we now have
not only the law governing gas regulators but the
provisions in this Bill; not only the regulatory framework that the
designated transporter operates on, but the law and the statutory
obligations that the regulator has. Despite its complexities, the
provision is intended to afford the regulator the right to disapply its
own obligations in the course of allowing the designated transporter to
recover its policing costs. That sounded complex even when I said it,
and the drafting of it is equally complex. I apologise for that, but it
needs to be that way to allow choreography between the position and
obligations of the Secretary of State and the regulator, and to allow
their relationship with the designated
transporter.</div>

							<a name="0805165000388"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Although amendment No. 77 is the
lead amendment, it is simply a consequential
amendment, giving effect to new clause 4, which rectifies an error in
schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000. Paragraph 9 of that schedule
refers to</div>
					<a name="0805165000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the consequence
specified in paragraph
8(5)(c).&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">However&#151;I
am surprised that the Liberal Democrats have not noticed this, as they
are usually good at such things&#151;there is no paragraph 8(5)(c).
It is a little over the top, since that paragraph was substituted by
section 456 and paragraph 39(1) of schedule 11 to the Proceeds of Crime
Act 2002. The purpose of the amendment is to rectify that appalling
error, which was caused by the 2002 Act failing to make the necessary
consequential amendment. That horrified me, as I am sure that it
horrifies everybody
else.</div>
					<a name="0805165000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
subsection (2) of new clause 4 is more substantive. Schedule 1 to the
Bill amends the 2000 Act to provide for the new reserve power in
relation to pre-charge detention in terrorism cases. The new provisions
will require any application further to extend the period of pre-charge
detention to be made to a senior judge. For England and Wales, that is
defined as a High Court judge or a circuit judge designated by the Lord
Chief Justice. For Northern Ireland, it is a High Court or county court
judge designated by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. That
designation is because when we have discussed terrorism legislation and
considered judicial oversight in the past, we have got rather hung up
on judges&#146; status rather than their experience.</div>
					<a name="0805165000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Lord Chief Justice has
written to us and said that it is not very useful to go for a circuit
judge or High Court judge if their experience, such as it is, is in
civil or matrimonial law, for instance. It is not their status that
matters, but their experience. That, principally, is what we refer to
in proposed subsection (2), which is why we think it more than
appropriate that, yes, it should be a High Court or circuit judge, but
it should be one designated by the Lord Chief Justice, who knows far
better than the House about the experience of individuals. That is what
new clause 4(2) does, and I hope that both measures are greeted with
the equanimity that they
deserve.</div>

Grieve:
						</b> These amendments concern the
commencement orders in clause 90 and the opportunity it gives to us
here to consider whether we wish to introduce any impediments to those
commencement orders. Both amendments are designed to do that. Although
I have moved the lead amendment, perhaps it would have been more proper
for my right hon. and learned Friend to have done so. Without in any
way wishing to object to the generality of the provisions, particularly
with regard to pre-charge detention, in relation to which the Minister
knows our views, it seems to us that in the case of both pre-charge
detention and post-charge questioning, it would be wrong for the power
to come into operation, unless new codes of practice under section 66
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 regulating such detention
are approved by a resolution of both Houses of
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="0805165000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder
whether it is possible for the Minister to accept that, because in
practical terms I do not see how either could be properly implemented
unless those rules have first been approved. It is therefore a fairly
simple issue. As I have said, that does not in any way diminish our
objection in principle to the changes on pre-charge detention, and
although we are in favour of post-charge questioning, both ought to be
subject to a provision so that they cannot operate until we have
resolutions from both Houses of Parliament in favour of the
regulations. That will be absolutely key to whether this works
properly, as we debated earlier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000397"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> These amendments, particularly as they refer to
post-charge questioning, are entirely in line with our earlier debate.
The Minster made it perfectly plain that the amendments to the PACE
codes of conduct were needed and that it would not be possible for the
measure to be implemented until they were in place. Indeed, he
suggested that he would make every endeavour to ensure that the draft
PACE codes of conduct were available to us before Report. He resisted
the view in the first instance that the Bill should include an explicit
requirement with regard to the PACE codes, but he undertook to consider
it in the period between the Committee&#146;s proceedings and
Report.</div>
					<a name="0805165000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">We did not
have identical undertakings with regard to pre-charge
detention, because the debate on pre-charge detention took a rather
different course and there were more substantive issues to be
discussed, but exactly the same arguments apply in both cases.
Therefore, I entirely support the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham. His amendments seem to have been hijacked
by his Front-Bench colleague, but he will nevertheless have an
opportunity to speak in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="0805165000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000398"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The only reason why they were hijacked was because
I was unaware that my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham had metamorphosed behind me at that moment,
and I wanted to ensure that they were
discussed.</div>
					<a name="0805165000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000399"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The right hon. and learned Gentleman
has most certainly metamorphosed, or at least
appeared, and will no doubt wish to add his comments in just a moment.
The amendment is sensible. In material terms, it probably makes little
difference, because I think that the Minister will give a clear
undertaking in any case, so that there cannot be implementation until
the PACE codes have been amended. That being the case, given that he
has reassured Members on this side of the Committee and that it is the
last sitting of the Committee, the Minister might be predisposed to
accept the amendments as proposed, although I have a nagging doubt that
that will not be the case.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Douglas Hogg</b> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con): I am
grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, and
indeed for the hijacking by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Beaconsfield. It is important to have the codes of practice enforced
before the relevant parts of the Bill are enacted and come into force,
because clearly the powers that are being taken are far-reaching, and
it would be quite wrong for those powers to be in existence without the
codes that will prevent the abuse of detained
people.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="0805165000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has
said on a number of occasions that he intends the codes to be passed
before the relevant parts of the Bill become law. I hope he will
forgive my observing that parliamentary time is not at his exclusive
disposal. Ultimately, the Leader of the House and the usual channels
will determine when the codes will be subject to affirmative procedure.
Today, the Leader of the House explained that she did not know why a
statutory instrument had not been debated long 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column512" />Column number: 512</div>after it had been brought into force. I therefore think that the
Minister ought to accept that the relevant parts of the Bill will not
come into force until the codes have received the approval of both
Houses, as prescribed by amendment No.
224.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000401"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> We are in danger of confusing
ourselves on the issue of pre-charge detention. There is a well
established PACE regime for pre-charge detention, not much of which
will need to be substantially changed if schedule 1 becomes law. There
may be some minor matters under code H regarding the protection of
detained persons in matters such as transfers to prison and access to
solicitors. Much of the paraphernalia is already in place for the
28-day regime. The changes might be so minor that they do not even
require a statutory
instrument.</div>
					<a name="0805165000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must not confuse and conflate the two arguments. There is a substantive
argument before the Committee on post-charge questioning, but hon.
Members will remember that I am deciding whether we can attach
sufficient safeguards through the PACE codes or whether they need to be
included in the Bill. Because I have not had much time, I have not
reconciled myself to which option is best. It would be rather curious
if I were to adopt an amendment committing to amendments to PACE but
agree on Report with the thrust of our debate on post-charge
questioning and the view of Liberty that the safeguards should be in
the Bill. At the least, the first part of the amendment referring to
pre-charge detention is unnecessary and the second is
precipitate.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000402"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> The Minister is saying what I expected. However, he
is not entirely right that amendment No. 224 pre-empts the decision
that he is considering. Even if his view was that there should be
safeguards in the Bill, there would still need to be revisions of the
PACE codes, which would still have to be brought forward by statutory
instrument. Therefore the argument that implementation should not take
place until the PACE codes are published would still
hold.</div>
					<a name="0805165000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000403"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, it would not. There is a
substantive debate&#151;I hesitate to say in the real
world&#151;outside this House that post-charge questioning will work
only if there is a statutory model of safeguards in primary
legislation, entirely outwith the PACE regulations. I do not know
whether that is where we will end up, but if it is and the amendment is
passed, we will be saying that having determined as a House that the
post-charge questioning regime is better put in primary legislation
completely separate from PACE, we cannot commence that part of the Bill
until the PACE regulations have been suitably
amended.</div>
					<a name="0805165000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I satisfy
the House, as I expect that I will, that PACE is the principal
instrument&#151;although perhaps not the exclusive
instrument&#151;for oversight and safeguards on post-charge
questioning, the subsequent statutory instruments will be passed by
affirmative procedure, as they always have been. We should be able to
capture the concerns of hon. Members at that point, rather than
now.</div>
					<a name="0805165000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first part
of the amendment relating to pre-charge detention is not necessary at
all; if, subsequent to investigation after the Bill has been passed, or
if, during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column513" />Column number: 513</div>our deliberations it seems that there have been more substantive changes
to PACE from what after all is an extension to an existing regime
already covered by code H, that is something that we would have to
return to. It is a little premature to insist on PACE provision for
post-charge questioning, because in the end that may not be the route
that we collectively decide to take for oversight and safeguards. On
that basis, the amendment should be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="0805165000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000404"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I am not persuaded by the Minister&#146;s
argument. He makes a good point when he says that in reality an
extension from 28 to 42 days may require only minor amendments to the
existing code. It will certainly require some
amendments, I think, but I accept that they may be of a minor nature.
Nevertheless, they will have to have been done before the change
starts. I was therefore puzzled by his comments about post-charge
questioning not being handled under PACE at all. I suppose that it is
possible that a separate set of rules could be introduced for it, but I
would have thought that it would be sensible for it to be dealt with as
an amendment to PACE and have never envisaged otherwise. It is
essential that those codes are in
place.</div>
					<a name="0805165000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Minister
is prepared to give me an undertaking that he can give assurances to
the House on Report that there will be codes in place
prior to any introduction of the measures, I will withdraw the
amendment. If he is not, I shall press it to a vote to mark the point
that many on the Committee are concerned about this matter.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000405"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I can, with a degree of confidence, give that
undertaking. I was not suggesting that post-charge questioning,
whatever regime we settle on, should be all outwith PACE; I am merely
saying that there is a debate about whether that is the way to deal
with the problem for the security of the defendant, rather than through
PACE. That is not my view, but it is a view that is out
there.</div>

although he has

there should be a degree of judicial supervision for the post-charge

still need regulations for covering how it is carried out. I never saw
that issue as being a case of either/or, and I see the Minister nodding

							<a name="0805165000410"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I want to refer to a point that I have already made,
namely that the Bill applies to every part of the United Kingdom. The
debate has conducted largely by hon. Members who represent
constituencies in England and Wales, and it is of course true that
those parts of the UK are perhaps the most primarily affected, but I am
uneasy about the fact that so far as I am aware, we have had no
contribution of any kind from the Northern Ireland Office. While I
acknowledge that there is an hon.
Member<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i>&#151;no, my hon. Friend the
Member for Reigate is not a Northern Ireland spokesman. While I
acknowledge the fact that there is a Scottish member of the Committee,
that hon. Member has not played a huge part in the debate, and I am
uneasy about that. We are legislating without input from other parts of
the United Kingdom. I therefore suggest that as a matter of general
practice, we should invite written evidence from the relevant
Departments&#151;in this case the Scotland Office and the Northern
Ireland Office&#151;with regard to the clauses that bite on Northern
Ireland and Scotland. It is unsatisfactory that the Committee has had
no substantive input from those two Departments, when the Bill affects
them.</div>

Scotland. We had, by common consent, a very productive and illuminating
session with the Lord Advocate, who more than adequately covered most
of the Scottish dimension. I am not, on this occasion, offending the
hon. Member for Reigate, but the usual channels were asked by the
Democratic Unionist party, &#147;If your side would give up one place

							<a name="0805165000414"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> We now come to the big missing segment of the
Bill&#151;the use in criminal trials of intercept evidence and the
admissibility of such evidence. This is a matter which has been raised
repeatedly over the years and which many of us feel very strongly ought
to be part of the apparatus available to prosecutors in order to bring
successful prosecutions. That certainly applies in terrorism cases
where there is a strong argument for it, but I also believe that it
would make a significant contribution to the fight against organised
crime.</div>
					<a name="0805165000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hitherto,
Governments have always been extremely reluctant to accede to such
requests. That reluctance has been because of strongly held views from
the security services about the effect on the operability of their
systems in the event of disclosure. I understand those concerns and the
reservations that have been expressed but I have always felt that it is
not impossible to create a legal architecture that would allow for the
admissibility of evidence in some cases that would be of benefit to the
prosecution of those offences. Although it is always very comforting to
look at the experience of other jurisdictions and to say that if they
can do it we can do it, I recognise that that is not necessarily as
simple as it seems. Very few jurisdictions approach such subjects
identically. Nevertheless, my party&#146;s view, and I believe that
of the Conservative party, has been for some time that that is
something for which we must make arrangements for the security of our
country and to ensure that the police, the intelligence services and
our prosecutors can do their jobs in the most effective
way.</div>
				
					<a name="0805165000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45
pm</div>
					<a name="0805165000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clauses
are not of my own construction but are taken from new clauses or
amendments tabled by Lord Lloyd of Berwick and debated in another place
in the context of previous Bills. I thought that they would be a useful
platform on which we could hold this debate. Since I tabled the new
clauses we have had an extremely useful seminar. Can I say again how
grateful I am to the Minister for arranging that seminar and for the
clarity and openness of the senior officials who attended and spoke to
us about the issues that they face? I found it illuminating as, I
suspect, did other members of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805165000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also have the new clause and
schedule in the name of the hon. and learned Member
for Beaconsfield. There is a substantive difference between his and
mine in that he seeks to provide a timetable for the implementation of
the admissibility. That has a lot to commend it. I will not steal his
thunder by speaking to his new clause before he has the opportunity to
do so but, when I look at his proposal and my proposal, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column519" />Column number: 519</div>think that his has more merit, in that it means that the Government
stick to the assurances given.</div>
					<a name="0805165000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difference between the
situation now and the situation when these or similar new clauses and
amendments were first tabled is that we have had the Chilcot review,
which was extremely useful because it addressed these issues seriously.
For the record, that was the Privy Council review of intercept as
evidence under the chairmanship of Sir John Chilcot with his colleagues
Lord Archer of Sandwell, Lord Hurd of Westwell and my right hon. Friend
the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith). They looked
in considerable depth at the operational and legislative obstacles to
the adoption of new procedures which the Prime Minister has now
indicated that he wishes to see.
</div>
					<a name="0805165000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that when the Chilcot review considered the matter
in detail it came to the conclusion that there were risks to the
strategic capability of the UK&#146;s intelligence agencies but that
they could be overcome by appropriate legislative and operational
measures. It set out in very clear terms the requirements for intercept
as evidence to be operationally workable, not why it could not be
implemented but how it could be implemented and how the difficulties
which they recognised could be circumvented. It set out:</div>
					<a name="0805165000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The intercepting agency
shall decide whether a prosecution involving their intercepted material
shall
proceed&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0805165000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">not
whether the prosecution should proceed but whether a prosecution
involving their intercepted material should proceed.</div>
					<a name="0805165000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it said:</div>
					<a name="0805165000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Intercepted
material originating from the intelligence agencies shall not be
disclosed beyond cleared judges, prosecutors, or special (defence)
advocates, except in a form agreed by the
originator&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0805165000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">a
proposal that one would expect in that context.</div>
					<a name="0805165000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Material intercepted (by
any agency) through the use of sensitive Sigint techniques shall not be
disclosed unless the Secretary of State is satisfied that disclosure
will not put the capability and techniques at
risk.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
important safeguard for the operational integrity of some of the
processes used.</div>
					<a name="0805165000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No intelligence or law
enforcement agency shall be required to retain raw intercepted material
for significantly more or less time than needed for operational
purposes (which may include using the material as
evidence).&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
recognises the huge churning, the turnover of this sort of material,
and the fact that the intelligence agencies have a specific purpose in
looking at that intercept material. It is not for some archiving
purpose; it is to see whether there is evidence of criminal activity,
either now or envisaged in the future. Therefore, it is not normally
retained, and nor should we expect vast quantities of material to be
retained.</div>
					<a name="0805165000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The next
point is:</div>
					<a name="0805165000150"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
intelligence or law enforcement agency shall be required to examine,
transcribe or make notes of intercepted material to a substantially
higher standard than it believes is required to meet its objectives
(which may include, but are not limited to, using material as
evidence)&#148;&#151;</div>
					<a name="0805165000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">again,
a practical point to ensure that we do not put a bureaucratic burden on
our intelligence services that they cannot possibly meet.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column520" />Column number: 520</div>
					<a name="0805165000152"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Intelligence and law
enforcement agencies shall be able to carry out real time tactical
interception in order to disrupt, interdict or prevent terrorist and
criminal activity, as effectively as they do now.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would all hope that that is the case,
as it is essential that the security services are able to do their
work, particularly when it is possible to prevent a
catastrophic event happening. We do not want them looking over their
shoulder to consider what we have passed in this Committee, or
elsewhere, and that getting in the way of their work.</div>
					<a name="0805165000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Law enforcement agencies
shall be able to use interception to provide strategic intelligence on
criminal enterprises, and retain the intelligence sometimes for a
number of years, regardless of the progress of specific criminal cases.
Interception from the same lines may serve both tactical and strategic
purposes; if it does, it shall be handled in a manner appropriate to
both.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that is
perfectly sensible.</div>
					<a name="0805165000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Intelligence agencies
must be able to support law enforcement by carrying out interception,
for &#147;serious crime&#148; purposes, of targets nominated by law
enforcement, and to provide the product or reports on it to those
agencies. Anything so provided shall be subject to the same disclosure
obligations as other intelligence intercept.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that goes beyond the activities of
a limited number of people who are engaged in terrorism, into a wider
field of serious crime.</div>
					<a name="0805165000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, the review
stated:</div>
					<a name="0805165000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At
trials (whether or not intercept is adduced as evidence) the defence
shall not be able conduct successful &#145;fishing
expeditions&#146; against intercept alleged to be held by any
agency.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a major
concern for the security services, but it is one that can be prevented
by appropriate rules for the use and disclosure of the material in
court.</div>
					<a name="0805165000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chilcot
review set out clearly the parameters in which the work should go
forward. In the seminar, we heard that that work is going forward, and
I was encouraged by that. I take what we were told at face value: that
very serious consideration has been given to find an appropriate legal
model, and that having designed such a legal model, it would be tested,
and provided that it was tested and found to be appropriate, it would
be implemented through the legislation.</div>
					<a name="0805165000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are well
down the road, both in terms of intention and the work that has already
been commissioned, in achieving our objective to ensure that intercept
evidence is available as a further tool for investigation and
prosecution. What remains to be determined is the time scale in which
that work will proceed, and the legislative vehicle which will be used
and whether that involves further delay.</div>
					<a name="0805165000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The glib comment would be that
we have a criminal justice Bill every year so there is certainly no
problem in finding the legislative vehicle. It is a very rare year
indeed when we do not have an array of Home Office and Ministry of
Justice Bills to deal with, so I am certainly confident that there will
be legislative vehicles. But I do need assurances from the Minister
that a time scale is both envisaged and will be kept to for this. This
is a very serious matter for many Members on both sides of the House,
who really cannot understand why we should forgo such an effective
evidential tool if there are ways of getting around the undoubted
operational
difficulties.</div>
					<a name="0805165000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need a
very clear understanding that that work is not only proceeding but will
reach a rapid conclusion, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column521" />Column number: 521</div>and that it is the clear intention of Ministers to make sure that that
does happen rather than find ways for it not to happen&#151;I am
reassured on that. We need to be clear that there are no agencies who
effectively have the veto on this process and can stymie what has been
recommended, not just by those who consider it from the point of view
of securing convictions, but those who are directly involved in
gathering criminal intelligence&#151;certainly on the police
side&#151;and can see the advantage of it. We need to set
aside the reservations apparently expressed by the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, and his view that this was going to be years hence,
which, I have to say, was a very discouraging statement, and not in
keeping with what we heard from the Home
Office.</div>
					<a name="0805165000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000415"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I would say that it is mystifying when one
compares it with the briefing we then had at the Home Office. It left
me slightly with the sense that the Metropolitan Police Commissioner
sometimes seems to say whatever comes into his head at the
time.</div>
					<a name="0805165000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000416"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I must say that it is not the first time that I
have been puzzled by evidence provided by the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner. He does seem to occasionally shoot from the hip and make
comments which have not been fully considered. It worries me that he is
not party to the work that is going ahead&#151;at high
speed&#151;and that he is not aware that Ministers&#146; clear
intention is to proceed in that way. If he is not party to that, then
someone should take him aside and say &#147;This is what is going on,
Commissioner. Perhaps next time you make a public utterance on this
issue, you might be a little more helpful to our processes, rather than
suggesting quite the reverse of what we were told was the case in the
seminar we attended.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805165000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to go through the
arguments in support of intercept evidence because both sides of the
House have already agreed that this is where we intend to go. What
remains are the legislative hurdles and the architecture of rules that
need to be developed, tested and implemented. Our concern is that there
is not yet any clarity about the
timetable&#151;thrown into sharp relief by the words of the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner. I therefore hope that we will hear
clear assurances from the Minister in that respect.</div>
					<a name="0805165000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">If those assurances are not
forthcoming, I will be tempted to support not my own new clause, which
I do not intend to press to a Division, but the proposal from the hon.
and learned Member for Beaconsfield, which provides a clear timetable
for implementation, which is what everybody wants to
see.</div>
				
					<a name="0805165000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000417"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome
rightly said, there is in reality very little difference between his
amendment and my own. In its scope, it is to all intents and purposes
identical on the schedule, and the only difference is the question
whether it should be implemented now or later. I am on record on
numerous occasions as saying that I wish to see intercept evidence
introduced as soon as possible in terrorist cases. I agree with him
that using it in cases of serious crime might also be beneficial. Even
confining my remarks to the question of terrorism and terrorist 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column522" />Column number: 522</div>cases, I see a powerful argument for wanting to have it introduced
immediately, particularly because I have this sense of silence from the
Government&#146;s side about whether there was a serious intent to
implement the Chilcot report.</div>
					<a name="0805165000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fairness to the Minister and
to the Government, I found the briefing we received at the Home Office
both illuminating and heartening. It seemed to me we had a clear
indication that there was a strong desire to implement the
recommendations, that work was taking place to bring about
implementation and that we were dealing with a time frame rather than
anything else. I recollect&#151;I hope I remember this
properly&#151;that at one stage of the briefing we were told that a
time frame of about a year to 18 months was being worked
to.</div>
					<a name="0805165000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that reason, I
selected 31 July 2010 as the date by which the regulations ought to
come into force to implement the use of intercept evidence. I toyed
with the idea of deferring it until 1 January 2011, but thought that
that was probably too far away and wanted at least to stimulate debate
on the feasibility of moving forward at a reasonable
pace.</div>
					<a name="0805165000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are in danger
of missing an opportunity in the passage of this legislation if we do
not do something about this area. After all, the Government have
already, in the legislation, done something about inquiries and
inquests in relation to the use of intercept evidence. As the Minister
acknowledged, that is in many ways a major step forward in the use of
intercept material.</div>
					<a name="0805165000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that the problems associated with using intercept material in
inquiries and inquests in the new form wanted by the Government are
rather different from those that arise in the context of a criminal
trial. However, I remain firmly of the view that the
difficulties that undoubtedly exist are not insurmountable, and I have
a compelling feeling of regret that this was not tackled properly four,
five or six years ago when it became clear that the rise of a new kind
of terrorism was going to require us to take sensible steps to try to
ensure that we can bring to justice the perpetrators of outrages and
those who are planning appalling offences.</div>
					<a name="0805165000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The longer we delay doing it,
the more we are forced to rely on administrative
sanctions, whether it be control orders or the Belmarsh detention
regime&#151;all of which, as I think the Minister acknowledges, are
flawed and unsatisfactory even if they may be necessary. That necessity
should not blind us to the equal necessity of trying to do everything
to get rid of those systems.</div>
					<a name="0805165000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am the first to accept that
intercept evidence is not a panacea, because human
intelligence&#151;which is of course a very separate thing from
intercept evidence&#151;may often be the source of information that
tells the Government what is going on. It remains a very difficult area
to adduce in court, and therefore there may still remain cases where
intercept evidence does not solve the problem. But the Government
would be on much stronger ground in arguing for the
administrative alternatives that they have put forward over the last
five or six years if they were in a position to say that they had done
everything in their power to bring within the umbrella of the criminal
justice system powers to get convictions and there still remained a
problem rather than the current position where they are unable to give
that reassurance to the public or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column523" />Column number: 523</div>Parliament. For that reason, I strongly commend the introduction of
intercept
evidence.</div>
					<a name="0805165000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
very few western democracies where intercept evidence is not used.
There are other common law jurisdictions where it is used. There is no
compelling evidence from those countries that the use of that material
is leading to serious problems for the intelligence and security
services in collating and obtaining material. We live in a
sophisticated age. If one wants to understand how intercept is carried
out, there are all sort of places on the internet where one will find a
mine of information. Some of it will be inaccurate, but some will be
accurate. My feeling has always been that those who dabble in the
fields of terrorism and serious crime are probably very well aware of
where their communications are likely to be intercepted. Doubtless, as
technology advances, there is always a hope from the intelligence
services that they will keep one step ahead of their
quarry.</div>
					<a name="0805165000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to move
forward and I hope that the Minister can give us some positive
responses this afternoon so that we are in a better position on Report
to evaluate some of the other difficult areas that the Government are
arguing about. Whether or not we go down the road of 42-day pre-charge
detention, to which I remain utterly opposed, the sooner intercept
evidence can be used in court, the
better.</div>
					<a name="0805165000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<b class="B">Mr.
Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): The first rule
of advocacy is that one should not put a question to the witness unless
one knows what answer will be received. When I put a question to Sir
Ian Blair, I was flabbergasted at the response, not just at its
content, but because it was delivered almost as if I was wasting
everybody&#146;s time in talking about intercept evidence. That
contrasted dramatically with the Home Office briefing. I add my thanks
for that facility having being made available to us. We had a candid
and full exchange about the progress and the difficulties that need to
be dealt with.</div>
					<a name="0805165000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Like
other Committee members, I feel that intercept evidence is vital. I,
too, find it difficult to comprehend why other common law countries can
use it without compromising sources. That is an important matter, which
I have no doubt is uppermost in the minds of Home Office officials. I
appended my name to new schedule 1 before we had the briefing and I
take it that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome will not
press it to a vote because I would be slightly embarrassed, having
heard from the Home Office
officials.</div>
					<a name="0805165000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
preferable proposal might be new schedule 4, which would impose a time
frame. I echo what the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield said on
that. Lord Carlile in effect said that this is not a silver bullet, but
part of the armoury. It will help in many cases, but not in all. We
should have it in the armoury because of the seriousness of the threat.
I was encouraged by what I heard in the Home Office and I have no
reason to doubt what was said. I hope that in applying what the
officials candidly described to us, the Minister will look favourably
on new schedule 4. It allows a longer period than was anticipated by
officials, within which pilot schemes and the necessary investigations
will have been 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column524" />Column number: 524</div>concluded. I support the idea advanced by the hon. Member for Somerton
and Frome, but it has been somewhat overtaken by events. I encourage
the Minister to look carefully at new schedule
4.</div>
					<a name="0805165000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000419"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I am grateful to hon. Members for their
appreciation of the seminar, which was clearly illuminating. I shall be
having words later with officials. If they were far too candid and
open, they will not be doing it again. In all seriousness, I am
grateful to them for making it so open and candid that people could
understand what is happening. None the less, I should make clear where
we are.</div>
					<a name="0805165000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">A cross-party
group deliberated extensively on the matter and reported to the House
last summer. The Prime Minister fully accepted what the Chilcot report
said. As hon. Members will have heard, fairly soon thereafter an
implementation group, or whatever it is called, was set to work on the
not inconsiderable barriers to which Chilcot referred. It was a long
and daunting list, but the starting premise was that if we could get
there, we should.</div>
					<a name="0805165000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
cannot accept the reheated amendment of Lord Lloyd of
Berwick tabled by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome because,
counter to Chilcot, it relies upon public interest immunity. Chilcot
clearly said that he was not convinced&#151;actually, he went much
further&#151;that PII in its current form was appropriate. He spoke
of a PII-plus system, which is part of what is being worked upon. There
must be something about Berwick: we had the right hon. Member for
Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) on the Committee and Lord
Lloyd of Berwick in the other place. The amendment is premature, to say
the least, and it should be resisted. If permitted and implemented, it
would result in a far worse position than that which Chilcot, the right
hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and others have suggested is the
position that we need to get to. In that context, I would also resist
the new schedule.</div>
					<a name="0805165000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that it was made clear at the Home Office seminar that, in
discussion with Chilcot, the 2009-10 Session is precisely when we hope
to legislate on the matter. However, that rather presumes that all the
work will have been done and that all the areas that we hope to have
dispatched, and all the road blocks and obstacles that we need to have
overcome are overcome and dispatched. I do not know when that will be;
nor, with respect, does the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield. I
do not want to hold the Government to a date, as I simply do not know
whether it can be met.
</div>
					<a name="0805165000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not entirely sure
what formulation will be put in place to ensure that the House is kept
broadly up to date with the progress of the Chilcot advisory group. I
shall certainly take that matter away and explore it. It is a sensitive
and serious issue. The Prime Minister has made a significant statement
on it. We have set up the group. It is not necessary to let the House
know every nook and cranny, every detail, of its work and
deliberations, but it is only fair to have a system in place to tell
the House what level of progress is being
made.</div>

							<b class="B">Martin
Salter</b> (Reading, West) (Lab): Does the Minister agree that
there is a danger of hon. Members appearing churlish, given the growing
consensus about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column525" />Column number: 525</div>intercept evidence in the House and the Committee?
The Home Affairs Committee recommended it, and in evidence to that
Committee, Assistant Commissioner Hayman said that he believed that
there is a case for its use. We do not need to overcomplicate the
matter. Policy is moving precisely in the right
direction.</div>

					<a name="0805165000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are on

now under way will be consistent with legislation if the operational
tests can be met. I do not diminish the seriousness of those
operational and legal tests, but we expect to debate the matter during
the 2009-10 Session. We believe that the issues raised by Chilcot
should be capable of resolution, but there is no guarantee that they
will be met without a significant further reworking of the
model&#151;or met at all. As my hon. Friend the Member for Reading,
West implied, the new clause would completely pre-empt that, being
inconsistent not only with the Government&#146;s position or that of
the respective select committees, but also with the cross-party Chilcot
report itself. It is unnecessary either to lock us into a date that no
one in this House or Committee knows whether we can
keep&#151;&#151;I repeat the assurance that we seek to achieve it
by 2009-10, all going well&#151;or into what is clearly, according to
Lord Lloyd of Berwick, an inferior model that relies on a PII system
that Lord Chilcot has traduced himself.</div>

							<a name="0805165000423"></a>Mr.

						</b> Oops&#151;maybe I have given something away
there.</div>
					<a name="0805165000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not a
sufficient legal framework to build such a process on, if all the
operational matters do come to fruition. But let us be very clear: the
points&#151;not made churlishly&#151;about Blair were relevant.
Actually, Blair has been one of the loudest and most vociferous
proponents of intercept as evidence, as in his Berlin speech about six
to nine months ago, which at the time was much to my annoyance, but
with which now, of course, I wholeheartedly agree. If he was confused
at our session, then that was a lack, but an
uncharacteristic lack. He has made very clear, as did Andy Hayman, the
previous head of anti-terrorism, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Reading, West pointed out, that they favour intercept
evidence.</div>
					<a name="0805165000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be
very clear. It is not the panacea. On the closest parallel we have had,
and I think Lord Chilcot referred to this, in US and UK cases that were
roughly comparable in their use of intercept, the highest arrest to
conviction rate as a result of interception between 1996 and 2006 in
the US was 56.4 per cent. In the UK, a Metropolitan police study of
operations carried out in 2006-07 involving intercept intelligence
only, found there was an 88 per cent. charge to conviction rate of
completed cases.</div>
					<a name="0805165000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
argument put that somehow we are lacking in our
prosecutorial system because we do not use intercept as evidence is not
as black and white as people imagine. Because we do not use intercept
as evidence, there is far, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column526" />Column number: 526</div>far more that our intelligence and law enforcement people do together in
the pursuit of crime, and terrorist crime in particular, that they
would not do if intercept as evidence were introduced. I am not
offering that as an objection to bringing intercept evidence in; I am
simply saying it is not the black and white position people
imply.</div>
					<a name="0805165000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chilcot
report itself highlighted that, in a review of nine
current or former control order cases conducted by independent senior
criminal counsel, the ability to use intercept material in evidence
would not have enabled a criminal prosecution to be brought in any of
the case studies. I am not saying this of the hon. and learned Member
for Beaconsfield or the hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome&#151;though there are plenty in his ranks&#151;but there are
those who have said that, with intercept evidence and post-charge
questioning, there would in an instant be no need for pre-charge
detention or control orders. That is simply far too simplistic. I do
not want to cast aspersions on anyone in particular in the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s ranks, but he need look no further than his right
hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg),
who has made that point on a number of occasions. It completely
misconstrues the import of what we are discussing. Will it help? It
may. I would put it no stronger than
that.</div>
					<a name="0805165000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
need to understand very clearly the distinction between communication
data, bugging and the use of intercept evidence, which I am sure
everyone here does. I do not think the distinction between those is
quite so clear-cut out in the real world, and that adds to the
confusion.</div>
					<a name="0805165000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us take a
simple bug put in a car or in somebody&#146;s room. All of a sudden,
when the court case comes, we get the transcript and hear the tape, and
people will say &#147;I thought we did not use intercept
evidence.&#148; It goes to the provenance of the location of the
intelligence. A bug in a car is easily dealt with in terms of going
back to the source, but some elements of intercept, and how we got it,
will not be. That will not be fixed by Chilcot either, by the
way.</div>
					<a name="0805165000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Communications
data are used all the time as well. In court cases, we see the police
have gone through people&#146;s phone records and everything else,
linking who people have been talking to&#151;not the substance or
detail of any of the conversations, but simply the traffic. The same
applies to
e-mail.</div>
					<a name="0805165000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
closer we get to the implementation of Chilcot&#151;&#151;not on
the back of this Bill, I hasten to add&#151;the more there needs to
be further discussion about what we mean by intercept as evidence. I
would not want to diminish what especially US law enforcement can do
but while more often than not, they are very enthusiastic about it,
they tell you in the next breath that in most of the serious crime
cases&#151;terrorism, less so&#151;they have cracked using
intercept as evidence have involved intercepted evidence right from the
beginning of the process. This is why cases are run increasingly on a
sting basis and why much of what gets through the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organisations Act and other legislation uses intercept as
part of the investigatory process rather than simply as part of the
discovery.</div>
					<a name="0805165000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Chilcot
review discussed all that. I say that to reinforce the point that it is
not the panacea that people suggest. Cases have been
studied&#151;including the one referred to by the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#151;as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column527" />Column number: 527</div>part of a review of intercept as evidence. I cannot say, hand on heart,
in every significant case of terrorism over the last five to eight
years intercept as evidence would not have been of use. Intercept has
been of enormous use but it is not fair to imply that we have fought
and disrupted those plots in a deficient way because of the absence of
intercept as evidence. One cannot claim that causality given what has
come to court and the success we have had through the courts.</div>
					<a name="0805165000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will it, like all the other
elements of this Bill, add to the array of devices and activities we
have in the fight against terrorism? It will. The sooner we get there,
the better. At the very least, the sooner we get to see whether all
that Chilcot describes as impediments can be overcome and then
legislate, the better. We are at one with
that.</div>
					<a name="0805165000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">These new clauses
and schedules are premature given the processes that are unfolding and
I ask that they be
resisted.</div>
					<a name="0805165000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000424"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> This is an important issue. The Minister is right
that this is one element among a range of tools that should be
available. No one has ever suggested that it is the one tool which is
going to be efficacious when nothing else is. It is part of an array
which we have been assembling in order to fight terrorism effectively.
It is reasonable that we argue that when we have all the elements in
place we can question whether other less satisfactory suggestions are
required. That is the basis of the argument on 42 days or any other
extension of pre-charge questioning but that is a debate we have had
and will have and not the one we are engaged in now.</div>
					<a name="0805165000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is also right to
say there is widespread confusion about what we mean by intercept
evidence. That is one reason people are very
confused; not because they think all intercept evidence is not
admissible but because they know that some is. They question why when
one bit of electronic kit picks up evidence it can be put in front of a
court but when another bit of electronic kit picks up the same
conversation it cannot be. That has added to the confusion and the
sense that this is not a sensible position to be in.</div>
					<a name="0805165000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said earlier
that the matter has ramifications beyond terrorist cases. It is also an
important weapon in fighting serious organised crime. An Italian
Government official recently asked me, unofficially, why on earth we do
not allow intercept evidence, as it is a crucial part of the fight
against organised crime in his country. Of course, they have some
experience of fighting organised crime. There are anomalies, such as
allowing some types of intercept evidence to be admissible in court but
not others, or the fact that other democracies, including those with a
common law jurisdiction, can apparently get round the problems that
prove so difficult for us to deal with. There is a nagging suspicion
that although this is not a panacea or silver bullet&#151;one could
use all the clich(c)s that can be adduced&#151;it is
nevertheless an important tool within the array, and it should be
possible to deploy it. For a long time, all those arguments hit a brick
wall. There was simply no question of the admissibility of intercept
evidence because important and highly placed officials within the
security services advised against it. We are entitled to take that into
account when assessing the present progress, which I agree is entirely
to be welcomed.</div>

							<a name="0805165000425"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> Lord Goldsmith conducted a
considerable review of that in the not-too-distant past, and although I
cannot remember the names involved, I am pretty sure that there has
been, at least under the Thatcher Government, some exploration of
utilising the two. Even though those have not gone on to fruition or
been as public as the Chilcot review, it is unfair to say that previous
Governments have not explored in some detail the potential use of
intercept
evidence.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000426"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> If I gave that impression, I will quickly dispel
it. I know that previous Governments, and indeed this Government, have
looked carefully at that issue in the past, but they have always
concluded that it cannot proceed, and that is why the Chilcot review
and the work that has come from it is now welcome. However, I do not
think that it is entirely right to use that right parliamentary
expression, &#147;churlish&#148;. When do we ever say
&#147;churlish&#148; outside of the House? Never, but when one
expresses the mildest disagreement with any other Member, one is
accused of being churlish. It is not churlish to say that although the
progress is now welcome, it has been a long time coming and we have
been pushing this case hard for a long time. Among those pushing for
that case has been Lord Lloyd of Berwick, along with many noble Members
in another place who have been completely convinced of the merits of
the case but who have so far been repulsed.</div>
					<a name="0805165000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am confident that we are
making progress, and the Minister has said he has a clear timetable in
mind. I understand that he cannot commit to that because it is
a work in progress and new difficulties might be
discovered. Members of the Committee are entitled to ask for those
commitments, and the Minister said earlier that he must find a way of
telling the House how progress is being maintained, which will be very
important. It would reassure many Members who feel strongly about that
if a factual report on progress could be presented to the House in some
form that is yet to be
devised.</div>

of a Minister of State to give that undertaking, but it would be
extremely helpful. The Minister might want to refer that back to the
Home Secretary as something that would be of value. Given that I
anticipate that we will reach Report stage before the summer recess, we
need to find an opportunity on Report for the sort of report that the
Minister gave today to be updated to take into account work between now
and then. I hope that we are in any way overplaying our hand on this
issue, given the agreement on all sides to try to make progress, if we
find a vehicle through amendment that would enable that report to the
House to be made.</div>

ahead. That being the case, I shall seek to withdraw the new clause,
but it is important that we have had this debate and that we commit
ourselves to adding the measure to the armoury of weapons available to
the investigating and prosecuting authorities in terrorism cases. Until

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000433"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The Bill&#146;s passage offers
us an opportunity to look at other aspects of previous terrorism Acts,
particularly the Terrorism Act 2000, in respect of proscribed
organisations. The Minister will be aware that there has been some
anxiety expressed in the House that, in the past, Ministers, including
the last Prime Minister, indicated the necessity, or desirability at
least, of proscribing certain organisations that were linked to
terrorism, but having the told House that action would be taken,
nothing has happened and it has gradually emerged that there are doubts
about whether the organisations concerned fit the bill for
proscription. In one case the arguments advanced in the Commons have
centred around Hizb ut-Tahrir and its association with terrorism. The
concerns expressed about that have not, however, led to it being
banned.</div>
					<a name="0805165000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems that
when one considers the wording of the Terrorism Act 2000, it is at
least arguable that it does not deal adequately with organisations that
have in the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column530" />Column number: 530</div>past supported terrorism&#151;and in some
circumstances actively carried it out&#151;but have successfully
stepped to one side for the purpose of maintaining their public
credibility and maintained a stark ambiguity as to their present
status. For that reason, we thought it right for the purposes of
stimulating debate to table two possible models for dealing with the
problem, one of which would allow the proscription of an organisation
that has been involved in support or acts of terrorism&#151;new
clause 5. Having tabled that, I was concerned about it because it
seemed to me that it was capable of drawing the net too widely,
particularly because it would, for example, catch organisations such as
Sinn Fein which have undoubtedly supported terrorism in the past but
have now unequivocally abandoned
it.</div>
				
					<a name="0805165000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The better model we might
therefore choose to follow is that in new clause 11 which
adds&#151;this is my preferred model&#151;to the words of new
clause 5</div>
					<a name="0805165000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has been
involved in support or acts of terrorism and has not unequivocally
renounced support of terrorism&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805165000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we were to adopt such
a model it seems that organisations that have, in many cases, a proven
link with terrorism, but have not acquired an ambiguous status which
often appears to be entirely deliberate, could, if necessary be put on
the proscribed list by the Government.</div>
					<a name="0805165000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware that arguments are
sometimes advanced that it is better not to proscribe organisations
because it keeps them out in the open. There are some intelligence
and policing advantages from doing so, but
nevertheless we have a number of organisations, some of which are
located in this country, with agendas that appear to be extremely
closely associated with terrorism.</div>
					<a name="0805165000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">In seeking to put this forward,
I do not in any way wish to suggest that it is not possible for
organisations to change their spots. After all, the Government have
just lost a case concerning an organisation linked to Iran. I have
taken the view over the past two years that there was quite compelling
evidence to suggest that it was no longer associated with terrorism at
all, and it appears to have satisfied a court of that fact, although
the Government remain unhappy about that and are appealing the matter.
I shall not touch on that further; I simply put it forward as an
illustration of one of the sorts of areas that we have to look
at.</div>
					<a name="0805165000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving that
particular example to one side, the amendment in new clause 11 would be
neutral in that case. If an organisation can show
that it has unequivocally renounced terrorism, is not actively
supporting it, or carrying out acts of terrorism, there would be no
grounds for its proscription. But if it could still be shown that they
have displayed a continuing ambivalence when, in the past, they have
either supported terrorism or perpetrated acts of terrorism themselves,
it would provide the Government with an extra weapon by which it could,
if necessary, bring a motion for proscription before the House of
Commons.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000434"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield was
right to say that new clause 5 was too widely drafted. However, perhaps
some of the concerns we have about new clause 5 are equally applicable
to new clause 11 in terms of an organisation being able to demonstrate
that it</div>
					<a name="0805165000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;has not
unequivocally renounced support of
terrorism&#148;.</div>
					<a name="0805165000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do
not know whether there is a legal definition for unequivocally
renouncing something. I assume that there is not. Therefore to be able
to demonstrate that, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column531" />Column number: 531</div>for example, the leading lights of an organisation
have unequivocally renounced support for terrorism but individual
members have not, just as with new clause 5, there are concerns about
the drafting of that and how broad it is. Because of our concerns about
being able to demonstrate how an organisation has unequivocally
renounced support of terrorism, should the hon. and learned Gentleman
be minded to press the matter to a vote, we will not be supporting
him.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000435"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> The purpose of this new clause is not only to
stimulate debate and to listen to what the Minister has to say; it goes
beyond that. I took the words &#147;unequivocally renounced&#148;
because those were the words used in the context of the Northern
Ireland peace process about the IRA and Sinn Fein. Although it can
clearly always remain a subject of debate and polemic, there came a
point where it became fairly apparent that there had been an
unequivocal renunciation. That seemed to be as good a term as I was
likely to find.</div>
					<a name="0805165000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000436"></a>Tom
Brake:
						</b> I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for
explaining that. He made a good choice. However, what is also
illustrated is that in arriving at the point where it was agreed that
Sinn Fein had unequivocally renounced support for terrorism, there were
a large number of staging posts along the way where some argued that it
had, and others that it had not. Because of the problems about agreeing
where the point of unequivocal renunciation arises, we are not inclined
to support the measure.</div>
					<a name="0805165000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000437"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> Does not the new clause have one great
advantage? If, for example, the Government were
minded to proscribe an organisation, and that organisation considered
that it fell within the exemption as it had renounced terrorism, the
process of proscription would enable that organisation to demonstrate
that it had indeed renounced it. To that extent, it would be a helpful
process.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000439"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> It worries me that this widens
the possibility of proscription. I rarely say that Ministers should be
given the benefit of the doubt, but when they are in possession of the
intelligence reports and the advice of the police agencies, they can
make an assessment about whether an organisation is engaged in
terrorism or is a supporter of it. The new clauses do not add anything
other than encouraging the view that a national clamour through the
press, or through MPs, can apply pressure on Ministers to proscribe an
organisation that their intelligence tells them should not be
proscribed.</div>
					<a name="0805165000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000440"></a>Tom

							<a name="0805165000441"></a>Mr.

						</b> I want to thank two Conservative members who
approached me on this matter some time ago, asking
whether this might be an appropriate occasion to explore it. I am
grateful to them, particularly&#151;without 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column532" />Column number: 532</div>being invidious and naming names&#151;to the hon. Member for Lancaster
and Wyrewho spoke to me some time ago, and fair play to him. The only
problem was timing&#151;not his, but timing more generally.</div>
					<a name="0805165000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. and learned Member for
Beaconsfield quite fairly pointed out that we have just had a recent
judgment from the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission with
regard to the People&#146;s Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran, on which
we are appealing. As a result of both the Court of Appeal judgment,
which we now have, and the original POAC judgment, we may seek to make
some changes to the law on proscription in the Bill on Report. New
clause 11, rather than new clause 5&#151;as the hon. and learned
Gentleman rightly said&#151;might be worthy of consideration. I agree
with him that even if the wrong organisation is captured, were this to
be part of such an amendment on Report, the process would be that
organisation&#146;s opportunity to renounce as fully as possible.
<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i> I know that we lost the appeal, I
have worked that out. I was referring to reviewing the Court of Appeal
judgment as well as POAC&#146;s original judgment. I am painfully
aware that we have lost. We are at an appropriate stage to review both
elements of those documents and the entire architecture of the
proscription legislation, and as part of that review process, I
undertake to take the import of new clause 11 away and, if appropriate,
to come back on Report with a conclusion to our deliberations on what
is a very serious new clause. Again I am grateful that it has been
tabled, but I should like it to be
un-tabled.</div>

proceedings of the Committee. This is an important issue. New clause 11
could well provide the basis of a formula that could be of considerable
assistance to the Government in dealing with some organisations on the
fringes of terrorism, in cases where there seems to be a considerable
amount of evidence that they are fellow travellers with terrorism, even
if they have found it convenient for their own purposes to step to one
side and claim that their hands are clean. For those reasons, I very
much hope that the Minister&#146;s assurance is that the issue has

right. The maximum is about one third for the earliest possible
indication of a plea of guilty. I think that that is right and should
apply to terrorist offences as to any
other.</div>
					<a name="0805165000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (1)
could apply not just to a terrorism Bill, but to any
criminal justice Bill, because there is considerable merit in allowing
pre-trial plea bargaining. As a matter of fact, pre-trial plea
bargaining has existed for a very long time and still exists&#151;and
a very good thing too. There is very frequently discussion between
defence and prosecution counsel as to what plea might be acceptable.
Very often, too, one can go to the judge and gain an indication as to
what would be the appropriate sentence on the basis of an agreed set of
facts.</div>
					<a name="0805165000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">There probably
is merit in some statutory or quasi-statutory framework, and there are
one or two things that have to be provided for within such a framework.
First, there must be some provision whereby a defendant&#146;s
interests cannot be prejudiced. I have known of a number of cases where
defendants have been advised of the desirability of pleading guilty,
have indicated a willingness to do so, and then start ratting on the
deal. Everybody is rather shafted by that process, so one does have to
address it so that the defendant is not misled and, incidentally, other
people are not prejudiced by the defendant subsequently
ratting.</div>
					<a name="0805165000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
very important to ensure that there is an agreed basis for the plea,
and the process has to be worked out. If necessary, there may have to
be what is referred to as a Newton trial or a Newton process to
determine the basic facts. That needs to be provided for in the
regulations, as does a process whereby the judge is brought into the
discussion so that he can give a fairly binding
indication of what the appropriate sentence would be. Those matters all
have to be addressed by the regulations, and other criteria too may
need to be incorporated, but that there should be a process of
pre-trial plea bargaining seems quite plain. I see no reason why it
should be confined to terrorism, and it is probably a good thing to
give it a quasi-statutory basis, and I commend the motion to the
Committee.</div>

							<a name="0805165000444"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> I, too, am rather disappointed that the hon.
Member for Newark is not here because I know that this is a subject
that exercises him. There may be some merit in exploring it further,
but not in the context of this new clause. As the right hon. and
learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has said, either it
rather lamely describes what already prevails, in circumstances such as
R <i class="I">v</i>. Goodyear, or&#151;I am not sure whether this is in the
mind of the hon. Member for Newark&#151;if it aims to allow
prosecutors to accept a plea on a lesser charge than is justified by
the alleged offending, the new clause is objectionable in principle. If
he is trying to go for the full-on American-type system, as I described
earlier, we object to it in principle.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column534" />Column number: 534</div>
					<a name="0805165000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right hon. and learned
Gentleman will know that we are looking closely at the results of a
plea negotiation framework for fraud cases, which is quite separate
from this Bill. If that comes up with any ideas in the area of plea
negotiation that we think will be useful in combating terrorism, we
will take them forward. He quite reasonably says that there is already
a plea negotiation process in our due process and I am not sure how
much beyond that the hon. Gentleman was seeking to
go.</div>
					<a name="0805165000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will explore the idea further, taking into consideration the framework
for fraud cases. I do not know whether I will be able to say anything
further on the matter on Report, but it may well be in the
Committee&#146;s interests for the motion to be withdrawn. Perhaps
the hon. Gentleman will be allowed to enlighten us on Report. I have
some sympathy with the thrust of the new clause, but I do not agree
with the intent as it has been perceived in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
absence. I ask that the motion be
withdrawn.</div>
					<a name="0805165000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000445"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I shall withdraw the motion and I hope that my hon.
Friend the Member for Newark will have an opportunity on Report to deal
with the matter. I will, however, make two brief comments. First, I do
not dismiss as rapidly as the Minister the proposition that one should
be able to accept a plea for an offence less than that which the
evidence discloses. There is sometimes merit in accepting pleas for
lesser offences. Never forget that by doing so one is sparing witnesses
the trauma of giving evidence and saving a huge amount of money. It is
sometimes pretty artificial whether a person is charged with A or B.
There is a discretion and sometimes there is merit in not charging for
the maximum offence. I hope that the Minister will not be quite so
dismissive of that
proposition.</div>
					<a name="0805165000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly
and differently, while I welcome the fact that plea bargaining
considerations are taking place in the context of fraud cases, I hope
that the Minister will not turn his face from widening the scope of any
changes that are brought forward to include offences other than fraud.
Truth to say, while fraud is a recognisable category, the issues
revolving around fraud, other than the evidential problems, are not in
any sense sui generis. I would have thought that if one was going to
approve a process for plea bargaining in relation to fraud cases, it is
very difficult to see why it should not be extended across the spectrum
of criminal law. I hope that he will take a rather more flexible
approach than his intervention indicated. Subject to those two
observations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000446"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
					<a name="0805165000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is the last
of the new clauses that we have to consider. It follows on in many ways
from the debate that we had on Tuesday so I need not take up too much
of the Committee&#146;s time. It offers the Government the
opportunity to look at a formula that provides, by relatively minor
tweaking of the Bill, for the Secretary of State to
make an application to the Lord Chief Justice for an inquest to be held
without a jury rather than a certificate being issued, as is proposed
by the Government. I hope that in the 48 hours since we last debated
this matter, the Minister will have been tempted into a greater
understanding of how important it is that any changes to the coroners
inquest process to allow the use of intercept and intelligence evidence
should be subject to judicial discretion.</div>
					<a name="0805165000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Government are
right&#151;and the Minister made a powerful case on Tuesday&#151;as
to the necessity in some cases of abandoning the current inquisitorial
system with a jury because of the advantage of putting material in
front of a coroner that will be conclusive and very helpful, at least
to the coroner coming up with the right answers to what happened, then
persuading a court of the necessity of departing from the current
practice, appears to be the absolute foundation for doing
that.</div>
					<a name="0805165000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am perfectly
satisfied that the Government may be able to tell me, even today, that
the new clause is flawed in a number of technical respects&#151;for
which I can only apologise, I did my best to redraft it as I
could&#151;it nevertheless allows for such a model. If that model 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column536" />Column number: 536</div>were also linked to the obvious safeguards&#151;which we were asked
for but which I have not sought to tackle in new clause
13&#151;needed for the appointment of coroners themselves, that will
already start to go a very long way indeed to meeting some of the
anxieties expressed. I obviously reserve my position on this as to
whether we would have to continue our
opposition.</div>
					<a name="0805165000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
that there is one area in the course of the passage of this
Bill&#151;42 days pre-charge detention&#151;where I suspect that a
meeting of minds will remain absolutely impossible for a variety of
reasons. But I have to say that on this matter, which in a sense took
us by surprise, there is a danger of there being substantial
disagreement leading to us seeking to remove this part of the Bill
entirely on Report. Certainly I wonder whether it will survive in the
other place in its present form&#151;I think it most unlikely. The
Government will have to take urgent steps to persuade the House of
Commons, and ultimately to persuade the House of Lords, that the
changes they are bringing about have adequate safeguards and will not
prejudice the complete review in the course of the coroners Bill,
which, since the Prime Minister&#146;s announcement yesterday, we now
know we are going to be getting next year. It would be much better if
all of this could be put off until the coroners Bill, particularly in
light of what the Government have said. In that case, I would urge the
Minister not to go down the road of new clause 13, but simply to take
the opportunity on Report to remove the references to inquests in the
Bill with an assurance that the House will return to the matter in the
course of next year. That would be my preferred course. I have been
trying to show the Minister a common road that we can follow, because I
am mindful of the fact that the Minister has raised an important issue
here, and the Home Office briefing made me realise its importance. At
the same time, the protections afforded by coroners inquests and juries
should not be allowed to be forfeited or removed
lightly.</div>
					<a name="0805165000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000447"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I rise to support new clause 13. I really have only
three observations to make. First, I agree with what my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said about the coroners
Bill. The changes in this part of the Bill are much better placed in
the context of a coroners Bill and I would be content if we did not
deal with it in this Bill at
all.</div>
					<a name="0805165000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, and
differently, for the reasons that I previously advanced earlier, I do
not believe that the public will ever be content with a process whereby
the Secretary of State, acting alone and through certificate, can
prevent a hearing before a jury. I do not think that the public will
accept that, and I think the public would be right not to accept it.
That being so, if we are going to go down this road at all, we have to
find some other process whereby the certificate is issued.</div>
					<a name="0805165000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believe&#151;it was in my
amendments that we discussed some time ago&#151;that the role of the
Lord Chief Justice would provide the necessary reassurance. I think my
hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield is to be
congratulated on the way in which he has drafted his new clause,
subject to the third point that I am going to make.</div>
					<a name="0805165000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it very difficult to
believe that I will ever be persuaded that the phrase &#147;otherwise
in the public interest&#148; should form part of the criteria. We
debated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column537" />Column number: 537</div>this some time ago when I set out the reasons why I am against it and I
will not repeat them today. It is far too
wide.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000448"></a>Mr.
Grieve:
						</b> I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend.
Having tabled the new clause, I rather regretted that I had not sought
further to change the original text.</div>
					<a name="0805165000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are strong arguments,
particularly in the context of this debate, for the criteria to be
either the interests of national security or some
other overwhelming reason, given the need to allow intercept evidence
to be adduced. The criteria should include nothing else, and certainly
not the interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and
another country, which has always struck me as one of the more bizarre
aspects of the
proposal.</div>
					<a name="0805165000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000449"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for
making that point. We are as one on this matter.</div>
					<a name="0805165000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Minister will
take the matter away and examine whether another formula can be arrived
at, either for this Bill or the coroners Bill. I, and
I suspect most of my party, have enormous difficulty with any proposal
that allows the Secretary of State to issue the certificate or which
allows such
criteria.</div>
					<a name="0805165000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000450"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> I remind the Committee that the
Attorney-General&#146;s general guidelines in respect of every
prosecution contain a public interest element. Why do we need the
provision expressly in the Bill? It seems unnecessary. Are we to take
it that there are different sets of public interest considerations from
the ordinary ones of the Attorney-General&#146;s
guidelines?</div>
					<a name="0805165000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000451"></a>Mr.
Hogg:
						</b> I suspect that the answer is that once the
provision is in the Bill it is capable of a wider
interpretation. The point is fairly raised, but I do not know the
answer. Perhaps the Minister does. The phrase is very wide and, as it
has such dramatic consequences, I would be reluctant to give it any
kind of tacit
support.</div>
					<a name="0805165000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000452"></a>Mr.
Heath:
						</b> I was going to say that we had already
debated this new clause and therefore it was
unnecessary to replicate the arguments, save for a reservation, which
the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham has
now expressed. I still cannot be doing with subsection (1)(b) and
(c)&#151;I regretted that it was included in the new clause, but
apparently the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield does too, so we
are at one.</div>
					<a name="0805165000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. and learned Gentleman has said, we are capable of finding a
resolution on this issue if the Government are so disposed. If we do
not, it is unlikely that the provision will make it through both
Houses. There is still the option of using the coroners Bill as the
vehicle, which will occasion a delay, but perhaps not an insurmountable
one.</div>
					<a name="0805165000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we want to go
ahead now, two issues need to be addressed. One is the certification by
a Secretary of State that a matter can be held without a jury without
judicial oversight or involvement. The second, which I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column538" />Column number: 538</div>find reprehensible, is the suggestion that a Secretary of State should
appoint a special coroner, rather than the appointment being subject to
judicial independence.</div>
					<a name="0805165000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we can deal
with both issues&#151;the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s new
clause deals with one of them&#151;then we are a long way towards a
meeting of minds. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of
the new clause as proposed and supported from the Opposition Benches,
and that he will find a suitable
resolution.</div>
					<a name="0805165000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000453"></a>Mr.
McNulty:
						</b> No, I do not accept it, but I appreciate that
this mini-debate and our debate on Tuesday have shown that the
Committee recognises the need for a resolution. I said then that I
would take away part 6 and have a look at its architecture, and that
must continue to be my refrain. I take very seriously the notion that
we should be able to move forward on a consensual basis. I am told that
there is at least one and possibly other compelling cases that mean
that we should do this now rather than wait for the now publicly
flaunted coroners Bill in the next Session.</div>
					<a name="0805165000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also made the point&#151;I
am not sure whether it was in Committee or outside it&#151;that were
something of that order to pass in part 6, a very strong link would be
made to it eventually being subsumed into the coroners reform Bill.
That is perfectly logical. I am up for getting us all to a stage where,
having agreed that there is an issue, we can overcome it. I will
reflect on this and other sections of part 6 and potentially discuss
them further with Committee members before Report.</div>
					<a name="0805165000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that

another contentious move, but it gives me the opportunity to thank you,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, for your time 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column543" />Column number: 543</div>as Chair. Your patience and indulgence&#151;not
least of me as the Minister&#151;have been very well received, and I
am very grateful for them. May we, through you, send our best wishes to
our other Chairman, Mr. Bercow, who, when he was with us,
was just as excellent? I am sure that the entire Committee would
endorse that fully, especially the hon. Member for Reigate. We also
wish Mr. Bercow well because, on the days when you have been
chairing our proceedings, he has been enjoying paternity leave with the
third addition to his family, and we wish him the very best with
that.</div>
					<a name="0805165000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologise again
to the Committee for my little breakfast tantrum, because the hon. and
learned Member for Beaconsfield was entirely right. Despite the import,
substance and, sometimes, contention of our proceedings, they have been
carried out in a very temperate and well-mannered fashion, for which I
am enormously grateful to everybody. The hon. Member for Somerton and
Frome has shown that he is a deadly loss to the Liberal Democrat Front
Bench. He has done a very good imitation of a Front Bencher and a Back
Bencher during our deliberations, while his hon. Friend the Member for
Carshalton and Wallington has done a very good imitation of a no
Bencher, since he has not been with us for much of the
deliberation.

					<a name="0805165000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">During our deliberations, the
most significant role that the hon. Member for Gravesham played was as
a Tory splitter. He defied the Whip and decided that the future of
British politics lies with the right hon. and learned Member for
Sleaford and North Hykeham, rather than with his Front Bench, and I
wish him well in that judgment. It was such a memorable and significant
split that I cannot remember what the headlines were, but I remember
the no vote. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his subsequent no
vote&#151;I am sure that that pregnant pause between the
&#147;no&#148; and the &#147;vote&#148; will not be reflected
in <i class="I">Hansard</i> as meaning quite what it did to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805165000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
other two ex-soldiers, who are not with us today&#151;the hon.
Members for Lancaster and Wyre and for Newark&#151;for colouring our
deliberations with their contributions. Perhaps unusually for
politicians on Committees, they made significant contributions when
they could and shut up when they had nothing to say, which we were
grateful for&#151;the first point, not the second. That was good of
them.</div>
					<a name="0805165000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rather
strange contributions made every now and then by the hon. Member for
Monmouth were entertaining, although not as informative as those of his
Welsh confrre. We now understand that the Tory policy, at least
in Monmouth, is to have a Taser in every household and compulsory
target practice for the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column544" />Column number: 544</div>under-60s, or something of that order. I am not
entirely sure, but maybe he was making a bid to replace the outgoing
right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) with
regard to toughening up the law and order team on the Conservative
Front Bench. I wish him well in that endeavour, because the notion that
he might adorn the Conservative Front Bench as a law and order and Home
Office spokesman cheers us up enormously. The sooner that can happen,
the better.</div>
					<a name="0805165000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me say
to the Conservative Front Bench that things have been done in an
overwhelmingly effective and efficient fashion through the usual
channels. The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield has given an
excellent display, once again, of his knowledge, good manners,
astuteness, erudition, and of course his efficacit(c) as a member
of the Conservative Front Bench. I thank him for his courtesy and
kindness. It is always a pleasure to appear opposite
him.</div>
					<a name="0805165000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the
hon. Member for Gedling was not called upon much, I am grateful in many
different ways that he was here, because it helps enormously. It almost
helped this morning, and perhaps it should have done, given my fit of
temper. I am grateful that he was here to be called upon should the
necessity arise. When someone asked me why there were two Ministers on
the Committee, I said rather unkindly that it was better than being
fitted with a catheter, and that is at least part of the
reason&#151;nature calls at the most inappropriate times, although
not terribly much in this case. I am also grateful to him for all his
background work on the Bill before it came to Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805165000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful
to all my hon. Friends for their contributions, not least during the
evidence sessions. The questioning of witnesses was done well by
everyone concerned, and it collectively gave us a good deal of
information, for which I am enormously grateful. With as much grace and
courtesy as I can, I thank everyone on the Committee for their
contributions and deliberations. I hope that we stay as courteous, and
move towards consensus&#151;which I certainly remain convinced should
not escape us&#151;in terms of every single aspect of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="0805165000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">My last point is
quite deliberately left to the end. I thank very much my hon. Friend
the Whip&#151;if I do not, he will kill
me&#151;who has kept us in order and has done it very well and in
substantial fashion. Apparently&#151;this is getting like a wedding

appreciation of yourself, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and also of
Mr. Bercow, for chairing our Committee proceedings. I also
echo the Minister&#146;s thanks to all the officials and the Clerk of
the Committee, who have helped to make these proceedings so easy. This
is the first time that I have served on a Committee with
evidence-taking sessions, and the first time that I can recall having
had departmental briefing sessions during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column545" />Column number: 545</div>the Bill&#146;s passage. All those seemed to me to
be useful and productive, and also provided an opportunity for the
involvement of all members of the Committee in its proceedings, which
has not always happened in the
past.</div>
					<a name="0805165000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also like
to thank the military contingent who have backed me
up from the Back Benches in the course of these proceedings&#151;my
hon. Friends the Members for Gravesham, for Newark and for Lancaster
and Wyre, who came on to this Committee precisely because they wished
to provide their specific experience&#151;particularly in security
matters&#151;for which I am very grateful.</div>
					<a name="0805165000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also grateful to my hon.
Friend the Member for Monmouth. I remind the Minister that there was
once a time when, for the security of the realm, particularly in
counties such as Monmouthshire where Welsh archery originated, it was
compulsory to practise at the butts with one&#146;s bows and
arrows&#151;so substituting Tasers may only be a technological
development, and nothing more. They started them
young.</div>
					<a name="0805165000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also thank my
right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham, who has brought his legal expertise and long experience as a
Member of this House to bear on the proceedings of this Committee, and
my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate, for helping facilitate the
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="0805165000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope I
will be forgiven if I do not do a round. I am grateful to the Liberal
Democrats and to the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy for his
input. I was greatly cheered during the course of the
proceedings when the hon. Member for Nottingham, East, of whom I have
long experience as the silent person in Committee when he was a Whip,
succeeded in showing us that being deprogrammed from being a Whip is a
very difficult thing, when his instinctive reaction to the suggestion
that anybody might be voting aye to an amendment was to object to it
automatically, thereby showing that his ability to keep abreast of the
proceedings and to intervene at the right moment before something
terrible happened has not been lost at all on his return to the Back
Benches. With those remarks, Mr. O&#146;Hara, and again
with thanks to yourself, I am happy to support the motion moved by the
Minister.</div>

O&#146;Hara, and Mr. Bercow, for your roles in ensuring
that our proceedings have been conducted in a fair and considered
manner. I also welcome the fact that it is possible for Mr.
Bercow to go on paternity leave: that is a positive development in
itself.</div>
					<a name="0805165000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
has dispatched the Bill with efficacit(c)&#151;an oft-used
word&#151;and he has displayed some emollience, although there was a
lapse this morning followed by another this afternoon, which I thought
uncharacteristic of
him.</div>
					<a name="0805165000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a word of
advice for the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the
hon. Member for Gedling, who has played a supporting role. If my
children are getting tetchy after a long day at school, a chocolate
biscuit and a drink usually do the job, so I recommend that he comes
armed with those in future. <i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Interruption.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
						<i class="I">
</i>He should ensure that he has those on his person in
future.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column546" />Column number: 546</div>
					<a name="0805165000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have watched with admiration
the Labour Whip, who has managed to contain any
Back-Bench rebellions with such ease. It was
clearly a real struggle. There was no hand-picking of the Back Benchers
who sat on this
Committee.</div>
					<a name="0805165000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">A consensus
has emerged on certain issues, such as post-charge
questioning and intercept evidence. However, it is very clear that we
will have to return to the issue of pre-charge detention because no
common ground has been identified. We will organise in support of the
official Opposition, other parties and Labour Members who are not
represented here to ensure that the right thing is done on the argument
of 28 versus 42 days.</div>
					<a name="0805165000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am very pleased with how our proceedings have been conducted,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, and that we have finished on
time.</div>
					<a name="0805165000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000460"></a>Mr.
Llwyd:
						</b> Briefly, on behalf of my micro-party, which is in
government in Cardiff, I congratulate you,
Mr. O&#146;Hara, and thank you for
shepherding the Committee through the last couple of weeks. I also
express gratitude to Mr.
Bercow.</div>
					<a name="0805165000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
Minister&#146;s profuse apology for his alleged behaviour this
morning, I tell him that I have seen far worse. I
once had a colleague who was very badly affected by lack of food on
occasion, such that he ended up with the unfortunate nickname of
Nosebag. I caution the Minister against making any public utterances
about that again.</div>
					<a name="0805165000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
debates have been informed and both sides have consistently tried to
engage constructively. That is not always the case in Public Bill
Committees. Despite the vehement differences of opinion on various
provisions of the Bill, they were expressed in good part, with good
humour and hon. Members were genuinely respectful of other
people&#146;s views. This has been a worthwhile experience, which is
often not the case in such
Committees.</div>
					<a name="0805165000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805165000461"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>In making my remarks from this end
of the floor, may I say that my co-Chairman,
Mr. Bercow, has taken a major share of the chairmanship
duties in terms of time and the difficulty of the business, a
distribution of duties that was entirely dictated by his happy family
circumstances, and I will pass on the remarks that have been made to
him.</div>
					<a name="0805165000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Starting
at this end of the Floor, I thank <i class="I">Hansard</i>, which I am sure has
kept a correct record of the occasional spoonerisms that Chairmen
commit. I thank the Clerks at my elbow for their constant assistance.
On my right, those who are seen but not heard have conducted themselves
with exceptional dignity and propriety in this Committee, unlike in
other Committees
sometimes.</div>
					<a name="0805165000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In referring
to the members of the Committee, I run out of complimentary adjectives.
This has been a very impressive Committee to chair in terms of the
general mastery of the briefs on both sides&#151;disciplined,
restrained, with an avoidance of repetition, succinct, constructive,
courteous, respectful, with give and take, and constant good humour.
That has led to a high level of debate, as befits the seriousness of
the subject matter before us, and has made it easy for me to conduct
the efficient dispatch of our
business.</div>
