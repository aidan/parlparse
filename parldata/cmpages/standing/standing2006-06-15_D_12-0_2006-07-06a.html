<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000314"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We move on to part 36, which deals with
transparency obligations. It replaces three clauses in the original
Bill; the Government introduced it in the Lords because those previous
clauses were ambiguous. It now accurately implements the transparency
directive 2004/109/EC, which harmonises transparency 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column475" />Column number: 476</div>requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities
were admitted to trading on a regulated market, and amending directive
2001/34/EC.</div><a name="06070664000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We propose
two technical amendments, which were suggested by the Law Society.
Amendment No. 422 would amend the definition of voter information in
proposed new section 89B(2). The current definition puts &#147;in
respect of voting shares&#148; before &#147;means&#148;, which
does not fit well with the use of the expression in proposed new
sections 89A(3), 89B(3) and (4), and 89C(3) and (4), where the words
&#147;in respect of voting shares&#148; are not used.</div>
<a name="06070664000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">In proposed new section 89B(3)
and (4), the expression &#147;voteholder information&#148; is
followed by the words &#147;relating to a person&#148;, and in
proposed new section 89C(3) and (4), it is followed by the
words</div> <a name="06070664000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relating to the
proportion of voting rights held by an issuer in respect of voting
shares in the
issuer&#148;.</div><a name="06070664000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting of
those provisions would be improved if the definition suggested in the
amendment were adopted and the necessary consequential amendments
made.</div><a name="06070664000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment No.
430, we suggest that the words &#147;a person&#148; in proposed new
section 89C(5) should be replaced by the word &#147;an
issuer&#148;.</div> <a name="06070664000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are technical. We believe that they deserve consideration
for purposes of
clarification.</div><a name="06070664000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000315"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The amendments are technical, and I shall address
them in turn. Amendment No. 422 would change the definition of
&#147;voteholder information&#148; in proposed new section 89B(2)
by deleting the
words</div><a name="06070664000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relating to the
proportion of voting right held by a person in respect of the
shares&#148;</div><a name="06070664000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
inserting</div><a name="06070664000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;means
information relating to the proportion of voting rights held by a
person in respect of voting
shares.&#148;</div><a name="06070664000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would clarify the definition of information on the proportion
of voting rights held to ensure that it related to voting rights in
voting shares rather than, for example, in non-voting shares. It would
be an unnecessary addition, because it is already clear that the only
shares capable of being referred to in the clause are voting shares.
That is made clear from the reference to &#147;the shares&#148; at
the end of proposed new section 89B(2), which refers back to
&#147;voting shares&#148; referred to earlier in that subsection.
In our view, therefore, the amendment is not
required.</div><a name="06070664000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 430 would substitute the term &#147;issuer&#148; for the term
&#147;person&#148; in proposed new section 89C(5). Subsection (5)
defines a &#147;notifiable change&#148; in the proportion of voting
rights held for the purposes of subsection (4), which, in turn, sets
out the circumstances in which the transparency rules may
require</div> <a name="06070664000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;notification of
voteholder information relating to the proportion of voting rights held
by an issuer&#148;</div><a name="06070664000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">in respect
of the issuer&#146;s own shares. Thus, the provision deals with a
narrow and specialised area of rules governing disclosure when an
issuer owns some of its own
shares.</div><a name="06070664000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 89C(5) uses the more general term &#147;person&#148; when
defining by whom the voting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 477</div>rights must be held. That word achieves the desired purpose of covering
the classes of issuer referred to in proposed new section 89C(4).
Moreover, it does so more succinctly than would be the case by
repeating the words in that proposed section, which
are</div><a name="06070664000264"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;voting rights held
by an issuer in respect of voting shares in the
issuer&#148;.</div><a name="06070664000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
430, which would replace the words &#147;a person&#148; with
&#147;the issuer&#148;, would leave the clause no more complete, as
the provisions relate not to all issuers, but only to an issuer in
respect of voting shares in the issuer. The amendment is therefore not
required. </div><a name="06070664000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome
scrutiny to improve technical drafting and have considered the
amendments carefully, but it is clear that they are not necessary to
achieve the desired purpose. I hope that, with that explanation, the
hon. Gentleman will agree not to press
them.</div><a name="06070664000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000316"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification and
the explanation, which I understood and with which I agree. On that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000063"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave,
withdrawn.</i></div><a name="06070664000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000317"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 415, in
clause 895, page 441, line 5, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(2) The
effectiveness for the purposes of section 155 of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (consultation on proposed rules) of things done by
the Financial Services Authority before this section comes into force
with a view to making transparency rules (as defined in the provisions
to be inserted in that Act by subsection (1) above) is not affected by
the fact that those provisions were not then in
force.&#146;.</div><a name="06070664000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is necessary to ensure that the Government can meet their
obligation to implement the transparency directive by 20 January 2007.
The UK is doing so through provisions in the Bill and through the
transparency rules to be made by the Financial Services Authority under
powers contained in those provisions. Such rules must come into force
by 20 January
2007.</div><a name="06070664000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA has its
own statutory consultative process for making rules, contained in
section 155 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, so the only
way for it to meet that deadline is by consulting on the proposals at
the same time as the Bill is proceeding through Parliament. It is in
fact doing so now. However, under the provisions of the Bill that give
the FSA the power to make transparency rules, it is unclear whether its
current consultation meets the requirements of the 2000 Act. That is
not because the consultation is technically deficient in any way, but
because the Bill does not make it clear that a consultation taking
place before it comes into force is valid.</div>
<a name="06070664000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Serious consequences would
arise if the provisions were not amended. Either the necessary rules
would not be made until the consultation process was repeated after the
Act came into force, or the status of any rules that were made would be
open to question. In the former case, rules made under a process
starting after Royal Assent would necessarily not be made in time for
the directive to be enforced by 20 January next year. As a result, we
would breach our obligations under the directive and the European
Community treaty.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column477" />Column number: 478</div><a name="06070664000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the latter case, the FSA
rules governing the disclosure of periodic financial information and
shareholdings in companies trading on a regulated market in the UK
could be open to challenge as being ultra vires. If the rules were
found to be invalid, that would impose material costs on stakeholders
and, in particular, provide a defence against any attempt by the FSA to
enforce the rules. Again, the Government would be in breach of their EU
obligations and the Commission could start infraction proceedings
against the UK. I therefore hope that, following that very good
explanation, hon. Members will agree to the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000318"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I understand where the Government are coming
from and I do not disagree with the principle of the proposal. Would it
not be slightly more elegant to make regulations rather than include in
the Bill a holding position that will remain for ever
more?</div><a name="06070664000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000319"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks an interesting question. On
the whole, hon. Members do not like regulations because they feel that
their ability to question the Government and hold them to account is
more limited. We need the amendment because the implications were not
realised earlier. I believe that that answers the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s question, which is one of how we wish Members of
Parliament to have oversight. On the whole, people prefer such
provisions to be in Bills, although we could have done it either
way.</div><a name="06070664000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000320"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I thought that the Minister&#146;s
point&#151;she can clarify this&#151;was that because of timing
problems, provisions are overlapping, and the measure is therefore a
failsafe to ensure that the consultation is taken on board. I
appreciate that and I am not saying that the Government are wrong, but
why should the provision be left in the Bill after it has all happened?
Why cannot this be done by regulation, which would fall away, leaving
the law, rather than merely a necessary holding procedure, in the
Bill?</div>

categories of obligation are imposed under the directive: companies
should treat the holders of shares equally, companies should make
public information on their financial position and holders of votes
should notify companies when the number of votes reaches a specified
proportion of the total. The amount specified under the Companies Act
1985 is 3 per cent. Will that rule remain or be
changed?</div><a name="06070664000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that

professional privilege. Clause 896 will introduce new section 89G of
the 2000 Act, which will give the competent authority&#151;the
FSA&#151;the power to call for
information.</div><a name="06070664000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under new
subsection 89G(3), if a document is produced in response to a
requirement imposed under the section, the competent authority can
require any relevant person to provide an explanation of the document.
The term &#147;relevant person&#148; is defined to include a
lawyer, instructed by the person, who is required to produce the
document. It would not be appropriate for a lawyer to be required to
disclose information in respect of which he was entitled to legal
professional privilege. The amendment reproduces a similar exemption in
clause 647(10) on the subject of
takeovers.</div><a name="06070664000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000325"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause inserts sections in the 2000 Act that
give the competent authority, the FSA, the power to require information
from persons or companies when reasonably exercising its functions
under the transparency rules. The FSA will be able to take copies of or
extracts from documents that are produced in its investigations. The
FSA will also be able to ask for an explanation of a document. However,
the powers will be limited by section 413 of the 2000 Act, the effect
of which is that a person may not be required to disclose
communications between a professional legal adviser and his client or
any person representing his client. It is our view that the powers that
the Opposition seek to limit are already limited. In the light of that,
I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000084"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000327"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Proposed new section 89M of the 2000 Act gives
the &#147;competent authority&#148;&#151;the FSA&#151;a power
to make rules implementing European Community obligations on corporate
governance.</div> <a name="06070664000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
will the Minister confirm how that will interplay with the combined
code? Subsection (3) provides that burdens imposed on issuers whose
securities are traded outside the UK must not be greater than those
imposed on issuers with securities on UK markets. As the combined code
is the most advanced set of corporate governance rules in Europe, will
that require changes to
it?</div><a name="06070664000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, will the
Minister confirm to what extent the provisions, if at all, enable
corporate governance measures to be put on alternative investment
market listed companies? Only this week, I read a report that Sir Derek
Higgs had given a speech in which he advocated a combined code being
imposed on AIM listed companies. That was a bolt from the blue. Will
the Minister advise us on whether the Government are considering
that?</div><a name="06070664000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000328"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The corporate governance power provided for in
clause 898 is an enabling power that will allow the competent
authority&#151;the FSA&#151;to make rules to allow the
implementation of Community obligations on corporate governance for
issuers on a regulated market in the European
Union.</div><a name="06070664000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current UK
requirements on corporate governance are set out in the combined code
issued by the Financial Reporting Council and enforced through the
listing rules by the FSA. The listing rules require that companies
listed in the UK state how they comply with the code, or explain how
they deviate from it. I shall take this opportunity to assure the
Committee that the Government support wholeheartedly that model and the
non-statutory approach to corporate governance under the combined
code.</div><a name="06070664000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The combined
code has successfully driven up corporate governance standards in the
UK. The recent FRC review of the combined code found that since the
introduction of the new code in 2003 companies and investors have
reported that dialogue between boards and shareholders has improved.
Overall disclosure in annual reports continues to improve.</div>
<a name="06070664000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The non-statutory nature of the
combined code is rightly held up as a key strength of the UK corporate
governance regime. However, sometimes the non-statutory approach of the
code and its scope of application are insufficient to implement our
corporate governance obligations under European law. In such instances,
reference to provisions of the code might offer the most logical and
proportional approach to implementation. For example, let us consider
the audit committee requirements in the eighth company law directive on
auditing. In that instance, the combined code already includes
equivalent provisions on audit committees and is referred to in the
listing rules.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column480" />Column number: 481</div><a name="06070664000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power in the proposed new
section will simply allow the FSA to make rules referring to the code
to be applied to UK companies trading on a regulated market in the UK
and on non-UK markets. Our intention is that the power will provide one
possible approach to implementation of our obligations and will be used
only when it is broadly accepted that FSA rules offer the best approach
consistent with our obligations and following full stakeholder
consultation. That way, we will preserve a central role for the code
and meet our European obligations to implement the
directive.</div><a name="06070664000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000329"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Are the Government considering anything at the
moment?</div><a name="06070664000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000330"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> No. The hon. Gentleman asked whether this will
require changes to the combined code. The answer is no, but not because
of differences between the UK and other standards. Some adjustments may
be needed to reflect the provisions that the clause is designed to
implement.</div><a name="06070664000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked whether this will be extended to the AIM. The combined
code does not apply to AIM listed companies and there is no plan that
it should do so. The AIM is free to apply if it so wishes. The report
by Sir Derek Higgs on non-executive directors said that he hoped that
some measures would be equally relevant to AIM listed
companies.</div><a name="06070664000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

for false or misleading statements in certain

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000331"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 416, in
clause 899, page 446, line 29, leave
out from &#145;of&#146; to &#145;and&#146; in line 30 and
insert</div><a name="06070664000266"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;loss suffered as
a result of reliance by any person
on&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(i) an untrue or misleading
statement in a publication to which this section applies,
or</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel3">(ii) the omission from any
such publication of any matter required to be included in
it,&#146;.</div>
<a name="06070664000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is necessary to
ensure that the statutory liability regime governing the transparency
directive disclosures has appropriate boundaries and in particular that
it covers all claims for damages in respect of losses suffered as a
result of the reliance on transparency directive disclosures.</div>
<a name="06070664000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The background to the amendment
is the Government&#146;s decision&#151;strongly supported by a wide
range of stakeholder opinion and taken during the Bill&#146;s passage
through the other place&#151;to introduce a statutory liability
regime to cover disclosures required by the transparency directive and
the narrative reporting requirements by UK companies. That was
necessary to remove uncertainty over the liability regime, which risked
constraining important disclosures by companies in, for example, the
narrative reports to be included in annual reports, thus reducing their
effectiveness and the accountability of directors.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column481" />Column number: 482</div><a name="06070664000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly, following
discussion with stakeholders, liability provisions were introduced in
the other place. However, in the light of our more detailed
consideration of those provisions, it has become apparent that they do
not fully capture the scope of the intended liability regime. In
particular, they would provide a statutory liability regime that
covered only shareholders who made decisions relying on those
disclosures. As I said, the regime is supposed to provide a statutory
liability regime and give the benefit of certainty in all cases in
which someone has made decisions relying on those disclosures. The
regime should apply to shareholders and non-shareholders alike, and the
amendment will correct that
omission.</div><a name="06070664000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is needed to ensure that the liability regime has the correct
scope, as discussed with stakeholders. It will ensure that issuers and
investors, actual and potential, face a clear and consistent statutory
liability regime with regard to losses arising from reliance on
periodic financial information disclosed under the transparency
directive.</div><a name="06070664000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
completeness, hon. Members will note that there are still certain
stringent conditions that must be met before losses can be recovered by
those parties within the scope of the statutory liability regime. The
losses must be suffered as a result of reliance on a transparency
directive disclosure; the disclosure must contain statements that are
untrue, misleading or made recklessly, or omissions that dishonestly
concealed material facts; and the person suffering loss must be a
shareholder and suffer loss as a result of acting in reliance on such a
statement, at a time and in circumstances in which it was reasonable so
to
rely.</div><a name="06070664000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
requirements reflect a number of circumstances, including the
Government&#146;s desire to avoid radical change to the law in this
area, to respect the preferences of stakeholders and, especially, to
ensure that company resources are not inappropriately diverted from
shareholders, employees and creditors to the benefit of a much wider
group of actual and potential
investors.</div><a name="06070664000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
the Committee will support the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000110"></a>

Transparency Rules,</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b)
companies with securities quoted on the Alternative Investment Market

law is the applicable
law.&#146;.</div><a name="06070664000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
FSA is satisfied with the clause, which deals with liability for false
or misleading statements in certain publications, and said that it was
watertight in legal terms. However, the Institute of Directors raised a
problem with its narrow scope. It welcomed the Government&#146;s
willingness to introduce some limitation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column482" />Column number: 483</div>on directors&#146; liability in respect of narrative reports and
statements, but recognised that defining the scope of the limitation in
the area of transparency obligations is not helped by the parallel
development of such obligations. It also said that it is important to
extend protection to all companies, including alternative investment
market and European economic area companies that have to make such
disclosures. It believes that that could be achieved by the wording in
the amendment.</div><a name="06070664000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
position was backed up recently by the CBI, which said that it strongly
welcomed the Government amendments introduced on House of Lords Third
Reading for some limitation on the legal liability of companies and
directors under companies legislation, and amendments to the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 in connection with implementation of the
EU transparency obligation
directive.</div><a name="06070664000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the CBI believes that the provisions on liability in clause 899 should
extend to</div><a name="06070664000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;preliminary
statements of results and other announcements to the market by listed
companies permitted or required by the Disclosure Rules and the
Transparency
Rules&#148;</div><a name="06070664000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">issued by the FSA.
It strongly believes that the same liability regime should apply to
requirements and obligations under both sets of rules to ensure
fairness and
consistency.</div><a name="06070664000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
liability regime should also extend to companies with securities quoted
on the alternative investment market so that such companies and their
directors are treated in an equivalent and fair manner. There is also a
wish from those companies affected that a liability regime should
extend to companies trading on an EEA-regulated market in situations
where UK law is the applicable
law.</div><a name="06070664000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">There seems to be
a consistent message coming from business, with which we agree, that a
wider variety of documents should attach the same liability as
documents subject to the clause, and that that liability should attach
to all listed companies rather than just fully listed
companies.</div><a name="06070664000119"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000334"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The amendment proposes several changes to extend
the scope of the liability provisions beyond that required to address
the risks of liability of issuers and their senior management in
damages that may arise. It may be helpful to give some history of why
we have introduced the
clause.</div><a name="06070664000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s decision to propose statutory provisions governing
liability in damages arising from transparency disclosures was
determined by specific circumstances. The wording of the transparency
directive led the Government to conclude that, were they not to
implement a statutory liability regime, there would be a substantial
risk that the courts would decide that the Government had not
implemented the directive correctly. However, the same situation does
not apply to the classes of disclosure to which the amendment would
extend the liability
regime.</div><a name="06070664000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Liability is a
complex issue. It is linked to other aspects of the Bill, such as
directors&#146; duties and the purposes for which statutory reports
are produced. A statutory liability regime clearly has the potential to

<div class="Column"><a name="Column483" />Column number: 484</div>provide greater certainty than one resting on common law, but
implementing one in areas related to, and with different contexts from,
the transparency directive is a difficult matter, which may carry with
it many disadvantages. For that reason, a regime in those other areas
would be different from, although broadly similar in structure to, the
provisions of the clause, which deal purely with potential liability
flowing from the implementation of our obligations under the
transparency
directive.</div><a name="06070664000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The classes
of disclosure to which the amendment would extend the directive
statutory liability regime vary in their purposes, formats, content,
standards for disclosure and the level of reliance placed on them. All
those factors need to be considered when determining the scope of any
liability for disclosures. A statutory liability regime may establish
liability in areas that currently have no or very low risks of
liability. Introducing a statutory regime also risks losing the
flexibility that might be associated with the common law and regulatory
liability regime. Those risks have led the Government to limit the
scope of the proposed statutory liability regime to those disclosures
for which a compelling case has been made. A compelling case has not
yet been made to increase the scope in the areas that are the subject
of the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
arguments have been advanced that suggest that there may be some
advantages&#151;as the hon. Gentleman laid out&#151;in introducing
a broader liability regime to cover some of those areas. With that in
mind, the Government are considering the matter further in close
liaison with stakeholders, and will advise on the outcome of that
consideration. We hope to do so on Report.</div>
<a name="06070664000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000335"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister says that the Government hope to
return to the matter on Report. I do not think that there is
anything after Report, so I hope that they do so before we
discuss the Bill then and that we might hear from them over the summer
so that we can prepare for our
deliberations.</div><a name="06070664000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000336"></a>Margaret

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000337"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Government say that they have done the
minimum, and clearly they have. We are pleased to hear that, but a
number of business organisations have raised valid points. When I sat
down and looked at what they were saying, I could see that they had a
fair point. Why should the clause apply only to some documents and not
others? Why should a director not get cover because he happens to be a
director of a named company rather than a fully listed
company?</div><a name="06070664000127"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070664000338"></a><b class="B">James
Brokenshire</b> (Hornchurch) (Con): Does my hon. Friend agree
that although there are some differences in terms of the overall
membership of alternative investment market listed companies as
contrasted with officially listed companies, quite often similar
institutions do exist, so it seems a strange paradox that one regime
may operate for one type of company and a different regime for another
type?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column484" />Column number: 485</div><a name="06070664000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000339"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Yes. Of course, there are different regimes for
the two markets, and I will not say that they should be merged, because
this country obtains a huge competitive advantage from having a
different regime. However, I cannot see an argument for the liability
that attaches to directors when producing company documentation being
greater in respect of writing wrong things in one document than in
respect of doing so in another. Likewise, the protection that directors
have should be
similar.</div><a name="06070664000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000340"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> My hon. Friend is right to highlight the
different regimes and the fact that AIM is intended to be lighter-touch
regulation. In many ways, that acts in a very competitive way in the
capital markets on an international basis, but one of the clear threats
is the robustness of the market to ensure that people can rely on
documentation and that the market is not drawn into disrepute.
Provisions to ensure that there are proper protections and that
documents are correct and can be relied on are important in that
context.</div><a name="06070664000130"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000346"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Amendment No. 456 would amend part 9 of the
Enterprise Act 2002, to enable public authorities to disclose
information for the purpose of establishing or defending legal rights.
Section 237, in part 9 of the 2002 Act, generally obliges public
authorities to keep certain information confidential during the
lifetime of an individual or a business. Part 9 allows disclosure of
information, notwithstanding section 237, in connection with criminal
proceedings. Amendment No. 456 would extend the protection to civil
proceedings, including in prospective proceedings and for the purposes
of obtaining legal advice in relation to such proceedings.</div>
<a name="06070664000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Section 242(3) contains a
proviso:</div><a name="06070664000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
public authority must not make a disclosure under this section unless
it is satisfied that the making of the disclosure is proportionate to
what is sought to be achieved by
it.&#148;</div><a name="06070664000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been pointed
out to us by solicitors at Farrer that no such proviso is included in
proposed new section 241A of the 2002 Act, but their view is that one
should be. That is particularly important, in view of the nature of
civil proceedings and the wide scope of the clause, which includes
prospective proceedings.</div>
<a name="06070664000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 457, 418 and
419 come from the CBI. In the Grand Committee in the Lords, Lord
Hodgson tabled amendments to limit the amendment of part 9 by proposed
new section 241A to intellectual property rights. Currently, proposed
new section 241A, provided by clause 906, gives wide powers to amend
part 9 in respect of all kinds of legal proceedings. That is because
the Government want to include consumer rights within the gateway. They
consulted on that last year, but have not given an adequate
justification to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column486" />Column number: 487</div>extend the gateway under part 9 to consumer rights, which CBI members
oppose. On the other hand, there is general agreement that part 9
should extend to information concerning IP rights and IP proceedings to
counter the ever increasing problems of counterfeiting and
piracy.</div><a name="06070664000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="06070664000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The CBI has
told us that it has been in discussion with the Department of Trade and
Industry on those issues, which says that the scope of the amendments
to part 9 can be debated in the context of the secondary legislation to
amend part 9, on which it will consult in due course. However, in view
of its members&#146; opposition to any amendment to part 9 beyond
intellectual property rights, the CBI wants clause 906 itself to give
powers only in respect of intellectual property rights. We are told
that CBI members strongly oppose any further reform that would weaken
the part 9 safeguards and seriously undermine business confidence in
the arrangements under the 2002 Act.</div>
<a name="06070664000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">The consumer and competition
enforcement regime rests on the fact that a wide range of information
is provided to public authorities by business on the basis that it will
not be disclosed. In general, the gateways work well. There is no
justification for making any wider changes than those needed against
infringers of IP rights. As the Government wish also to include
consumer rights in the scope of the secondary legislation, they have
refused the CBI&#146;s request to limit clause 906 to IP
rights.</div>
<a name="06070664000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, on
Report in the House of Lords, the Government tabled some drafting
amendments to the clause. Those were also suggested by the CBI and
formed part of Lord Hodgson&#146;s earlier proposed amendments,
including making reference to prospective legal proceedings in proposed
new section 241A(1)(b) of the 2002 Act, which the CBI welcomes.
However, as a minimum, it wants amendments Nos. 418 and 419 to be
considered.</div>
<a name="06070664000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
section 241A(1)(b) needs amendment to refer to IP proceedings in any
jurisdiction, not limited to the United Kingdom. It is often the case
that counterfeits found on the market in the UK have been imported. For
brand owners to take effective action to reduce the trade in
counterfeits, they need to be able to pursue everyone in the supply
chain, including the manufacturer. That might involve criminal,
administrative or civil action, depending on the local laws
applicable.</div><a name="06070664000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also essential to be able to use such information to feed into the
worldwide intelligence gathering exercise. In that connection, it is
important to emphasise that, apart from amendment No. 457, there is no
other impact on section 243 of the 2002 Act concerning overseas
disclosures, in particular subsection (3). Those provisions are vital
to having, and maintaining, an effective part 9 regime, and section 243
should not otherwise be affected by clause 906, or any secondary
legislation to be introduced.</div>
<a name="06070664000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, the secondary
legislation proposed by the Government under clause 906 should be
subject to full and formal prior public consultation and debate in
Parliament, and be subject to affirmative resolution of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column487" />Column number: 488</div>each House, not negative resolution as currently provided. That is the
background to amendments Nos. 418 and
419.</div><a name="06070664000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
any secondary legislation introduced pursuant to the clause should be
subject to the inclusion of effective safeguards against wrongful
disclosure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000347"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I am aware of the business concerns about the
order-making power of the clause and my officials have met with CBI
representatives to discuss those concerns further. We also amended the
clause on Report in another place, following helpful proposals from the
Opposition.</div><a name="06070664000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 418 was discussed in Committee in another place. At that time, we
explained that this procedure has been chosen because it is consistent
with the other order-making powers in part 9 of the 2002 Act, which may
be used to provide for wider disclosure of information. We therefore
see no good reason to distinguish between those powers and this
one.</div><a name="06070664000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I recognise that
stakeholders want an opportunity to consider and comment on the detail
of the secondary legislation. That is reasonable and we have already
committed to speaking to all interested parties before drafting the
secondary legislation. We will also have the normal short public
consultation on the draft order. I therefore do not believe it
necessary to have a requirement for a public consultation, as proposed
in amendment No. 419. In the light of those assurances on consultation,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is content with the
position.</div><a name="06070664000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 456 is unnecessary, because section 244 of the 2002 Act will apply
to disclosures under the new gateway, in the same way as it applies to
disclosures under other gateways in the 2002 Act. Section 244 sets out
three considerations to which an authority proposing to disclose
information must have regard. They are, first, the need to exclude from
disclosure, so far as practicable, information that is contrary to the
public interest; secondly, the need to exclude from disclosure, so far
as practicable, commercial or personal information; and, thirdly, the
extent to which disclosure of commercial or personal information is
necessary for the purpose for which the disclosure is
made.</div><a name="06070664000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
457 would allow the disclosure of information for civil proceedings in
respect of intellectual property rights outside the UK. We have
reflected on that, and I hear the argument that the hon. Gentleman has
made. With that in mind, my officials will discuss the matter with a
wide range of stakeholders to see whether there are any benefits or
implications for business and consumers in general. I hope we can
return to the issue on
Report.</div><a name="06070664000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000348"></a>Mr.

consideration of the amendments and their implications. In relation to
amendments Nos. 418 and 419, the full affirmative resolution procedure
would be preferable, but I hear what she says about her intention to
have full and careful consultation on proposed secondary legislation.
That will be appreciated by business and, I hope, provide an adequate
way forward.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000349"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I rise to seek clarification on the clause,
which gives a power to the Secretary of State or the Treasury
to</div>
<a name="06070664000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;make...provision amending,
repealing or revoking any
enactment&#148;,</div><a name="06070664000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">which can be
used in circumstances where it is considered</div>
<a name="06070664000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;necessary or expedient in
consequence of any provision made by or under this
Act.&#148;</div><a name="06070664000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
appears to extend to any enactment made before the passing of the Bill
or any enactment contained in it. I seek clarification on the breadth
of subsections (1) and (2) to ensure that we are not inadvertently
reincorporating some company law reform provisions that were in a
previous draft of the Bill, which were dropped in another place, and
that this is not a mechanism to try to recreate those provisions
through the back
door.</div><a name="06070664000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that
subsection (3) gives power to extend the ambit of the Bill&#146;s
provisions to organisations other than companies. I am concerned that
that power should not be used lightly&#151;the Bill is likely to have
more than 1,000 clauses by the time Parliament has finished with
it&#151;because it will clearly impose a significant burden on other
organisations if they find themselves subject to the Bill&#146;s
provisions and requirements.</div>
<a name="06070664000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would help if the Minister
provided guidance and said what types of organisation she or her
Department had in mind when introducing subsection (3), so that we may
gain some feel for how widely it might be utilised and why it was
thought necessary to reserve that power to extend the operation of the
Bill to organisations other than companies. Some assistance would be
helpful.</div><a name="06070664000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
provision allows for the affirmative resolution procedure, clarity is
required before we can state that it is acceptable. I hope that the
Minister can provide some clarity and assurance, because the drafting
suggests that the provision is wide
ranging.</div>
<a name="06070664000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000350"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I shall make three brief points. First,
consequential amendments will arise as a result of other provisions in
the Bill. That limits the scope for such amendments being made.
Secondly, as the hon. Gentleman said, amendments made in consequence of
other provisions will be subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure; they will therefore have to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column489" />Column number: 490</div>considered by the House. Thirdly, he asked what organisations we had in
mind. The main example is the limited liability partnership, to which
many aspects of company law
apply.</div><a name="06070664000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000351"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. My concern is that the provision should not be used to
extend the ambit of the Bill. I hear what she says about consequential
amendments&#151;in essence, the tidying up of other legislation so
that it is consistent with the Bill. It is helpful to be certain how
the power is to be used.</div>
<a name="06070664000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister spoke about
partnerships. Yes, there is broad equivalence and similarity between
the main types of mechanism for establishing business operations,
whether through the limited liability partnership, the plc or the
limited liability company. Each approach has its relative merits and
demerits. Given her explanation of the ambit and intention of
subsection (3), I have no further objection to the clause.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000352"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> The relevant point in this regard is to find
out when the Secretary of State will make draft proposals. A particular
sensitivity arises in the context of company secretaries. In previous
debates, the Minister said that the Government will make transitional
provisions and other arrangements, particularly to deal with the
existing company secretaries of limited liability companies. The
indication was that some form of transitional saving or relief will be
applied to limited liability company secretaries to ensure that an
automatic approach to their being considered authorised signatories is
encompassed in the transitional
provisions.</div><a name="06070664000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">When will
those provisions be fleshed out and set out in greater detail? What
opportunity will there be for proper consultation on the arrangements,
given that they will touch on important and wide-ranging issues? What
is the likely timing for their implementation once the relevant
regulations have been considered, consulted on and, I hope, agreed
to?</div><a name="06070664000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">My comments are
without prejudice to any further representations that we might wish to
make on the broader issue of company secretaries as we continue to
consider the
Bill.</div><a name="06070664000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="06070664000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000353"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> This is an important, though short, clause. It will
lead to a set of arrangements across a range of issues as we make the
transition from the old provisions and case law to the new
legislation.</div><a name="06070664000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend
to consult in the summer break on the main elements of our approach to
transitional arrangements and I will ensure that all members of the
Committee get copies of the consultation documents. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column490" />Column number: 491</div>We intend to follow that up with a full consultation on the regulations
making the transitional arrangements, which will come into effect after
Royal Assent. Our current plan is to commence most of the provisions by
October 2007, although some will have to be commenced earlier,
particularly those relating to the transparency and takeover directives
and the amendments to the first company law
directive.</div><a name="06070664000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked specific questions about company secretaries. Following
our discussions on authorised signatories, we propose to make
transitional arrangements so that private company secretaries in office
when the Bill comes into force will be deemed authorised signatories
until a company makes its next annual return. That is intended to
address any uncertainty of companies or third parties on whether an
existing company secretary will continue to have the authority to
authenticate documents on behalf of the company. I understand the
importance of the provision and assure the hon. Gentleman that there
will be full
consultation.</div><a name="06070664000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000354"></a>James
Brokenshire:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
clarification. On her last point, on company secretaries, I note that
the regime is likely only to apply to a period from the date of the
introduction of the Bill to the next filing date for an annual return.
That is a little more detail than we have had thus far on the
Government&#146;s intentions, and to that extent it is welcome.
However, it still does not address my fundamental concerns on the
matter. That period of time could be quite limited, because after the
Bill comes into force a company might have an annual return date a
month or a few weeks ahead.</div>
<a name="06070664000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I caution further
consideration, because the transitional provision may not provide much
comfort to a number of companies that will be faced with a difficult
situation, particularly holding companies with a large number of
subsidiaries that are trying desperately to sort out an authorised
signatory regime. If they find that they have an annual return date
only a month after the introduction of the Bill, they might feel that
the matter needs further consideration. I hope that the Government will
further reflect on the matter and that, rather than for a fixed period,
the arrangements might be allowed to run for twelve months as a bare
minimum. I maintain that the complications that arise from doing away
with the concept of a limited liability company secretary will raise a
raft of issues, but I fully recognise that that is a wider debate that
we have already had. It might be appropriate to return to the matter on
Report, as part of that wider
debate.</div><a name="06070664000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

perhaps less technical amendment. It is a small point, but in many
respects an important historical point in the context of companies
legislation. Obviously, the title of the Bill is the Company Law Reform
Bill, which of course would become the Company Law Reform Act, if
enacted and approved. The small point made by the amendment is whether
that is the most appropriate title, particularly given the current
desire that all companies legislation be consolidated in one place. We
felt that it would be more appropriate for the Bill to be referred to
as the Companies Bill, reflecting the historical approach towards
companies legislation. All the main companies statutes, such as the
1948 Act or the 1985 Act, are known as Companies Acts rather than
Company Law Reform Acts.</div>
<a name="06070664000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although that is a small point
compared with some of the more substantive issues that we will no doubt
come on to later today&#151;I do not intend to delay the Committee
for an extended time&#151;I ask the Minister to consider my proposal
and its historical context. It must be clear that the Bill is the
primary piece of legislation governing company law in this country, and
therefore its most appropriate title would be the Companies Bill rather
than the Company Law Reform Bill.</div>

persuasive. The first point is a sentimental one: legislation of this
type has always been called the Companies Act. I think that that should
continue. There is no need to diverge from the practice of a century
and a half&#151;going back to the era of the Liberal Governments who
introduced such
legislation.</div><a name="06070664000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point is a more serious one: since the Government have decided to
incorporate a large amount of existing companies legislation into
theBill, it is no longer simply a reform Bill. As previous
Bills have been, it is part consolidation and part reform Bill. I think
that that should be indicated by using the traditional
term.</div><a name="06070664000202"></a>

The argument put when selecting the title was that the Bill is a pretty
radical reform and &#147;company law reform&#148; reflects the fact
that we had the company law review; the name retains that connection. I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000378"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> After that historical moment&#151;I was
delighted to hear the result&#151;we moved to the privilege
amendment. I thought that we all went home after that. Fortunately,
that is not the case and we now come to clause
140.</div><a name="06070664000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
things stand, companies can have directors who are themselves
companies. The clause provides that one of them&#151;presumably the
only one if it is a private company with a single director&#151;must
be a natural person. Would the Minister please provide the
justification for the change and say what representations she has
received on the issue in order to explain
it?</div><a name="06070664000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000379"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The hon. Gentleman went through his comments rather
fast. If he asks his question again, I may be able to give him an
answer.</div>
<a name="06070664000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000380"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> At present, a director does not have to be a
natural person. The proposal is that there will have to be a director
who is a natural person. I thought it would be appropriate to put on
the record the reason why the Government included that change in the
Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column493" />Column number: 494</div><a name="06070664000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000381"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> Okay; my notes tell me that we are doing that, but
not why.</div>
<a name="06070664000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06070664000382"></a><b class="B">Paul
Farrelly</b> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab): May I
commend the Minister on this amendment? All too frequently, in my
experience, when trying to trace the directors or owners of companies
one comes across an endless chain of post-box companies and it is often
difficult to find out who is behind them, especially if one is
investigating fraud or financial crime. I commend the
Government on making this very sensible
amendment.</div>
<a name="06070664000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000383"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I
wanted to answer the question properly. There are two reasons for the
change: first, as the hon. Gentleman said, there are difficulties of
enforcement of obligations on directors who are not individuals.
Sanctions lack bite against corporate directors, because ultimately it
is the shareholders of the corporate director who pay any fine while
the threat of imprisonment is ineffectual.</div>
<a name="06070664000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, when companies have
corporate directors it is difficult to trace who controls them. An
example is that of company A being the sole director of company B, B
being the sole director of company C, and C being the sole director of
company A. In practice, things are more complicated but it is clear
that those intending to commit fraud may use a company with corporate
directors to help to obscure the identities of the individuals
involved. That can be a particular problem with the corporate directors
of companies established in overseas jurisdictions with poor records of
transparency and corporate law enforcement. I again thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) for his
helpful
intervention.</div><a name="06070664000240"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

requiring company to make

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000384"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 265, in clause 141,
page 63, line 6, at end insert</div>
<a name="06070664000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;save where the Secretary of State
has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the company is carrying on
criminal activity in which event the period may be less than one month,
as circumstances
require.&#148;.</div><a name="06070664000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
generally agree with the Minister&#146;s explanation on the previous
clause, but my overall thoughts are that there is not necessarily a
problem in having non-natural persons as directors. Indeed, for certain
types of company&#151;management companies come to mind&#151;it can
often be helpful in providing administrative benefits and so on.
However, in circumstances in which it is suspected that the company is
involved in criminal activity, the DTI will wish to have the record put
right, quickly, and possibly much sooner than the one month proposed in
subsection (2)&#151;hence the reason for the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000385"></a>Margaret
Hodge:</b> The clause gives a minimum of a month, as it may be
impossible for a company to make 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column494" />Column number: 495</div>an appointment in a shorter period. I believe that the hon. Gentleman
would accept that in most cases where a company is in breach of its
requirement to have directors, it is usually because it is in its death
throes and about to fall apart. In the case of active companies,
somebody must act as a
director.</div><a name="06070664000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure that the amendment is an appropriate provision to deal with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument about criminal activity, given the
difficulties of appointing directors that quickly. People involved in
criminal activities would be pursued in other ways. I accept
that it is easier to trace culpable people if a director is appointed,
but having a director in place does not necessarily inhibit the
criminal activity. The argument goes the other way. Concertinaing the
time would make things too difficult and impractical for
companies.</div><a name="06070664000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000386"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I hear what the Minister has to say but simply
point out that criminals can move quickly&#151;certainly more quickly
than a month&#151;so I would have thought that there should be
provision to deal with any hint of criminal activity. Obviously, we are
not discussing an everyday occurrence, but on the basis of what the
Minister said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06070664000247"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="Column"><a name="Column495" />Column number: 496</div><a name="06070664000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06070664000389"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Clause 142 is one of the more innovative clauses
in the Bill. It provides that people must be 16 to become directors.
For the most part, notwithstanding the fact that parents are required
to sign until the child is 18 and that children are immune from
prosecution, it is a good idea. However, the answer to my written
question of 31 January revealed that on 31 December last year there
were 431 directors under the age of 16, all in England and
Wales&#151;apparently Scotland is not very entrepreneurial at that
age&#151;and that some 200 were under
10.</div><a name="06070664000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can envisage
circumstances where controlling family companies or trust arrangements
from wills drafted many years ago requires that a child be appointed a
director, and that not to do so would involve losing assets or causing
problems in respect of inheritance. Would the Secretary of State make
an exception under clause 143 in such circumstances, which involve an
individual rather than some class basis of
individuals?</div><a name="06070664000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
reading of subsection (5) is that a child who owned all the shares of a
company&#151;for example, a 14-year-old who had some bright idea and
incorporated&#151; and had his parents as directors and told them
what to do presumably could be treated as a shadow director if he could
not be a director. I am not sure that that follows logically. If the
child is considered not old enough to take decisions as a director
before he or she is 16, how can we then say that they have the nous to
act as a shadow director? Surely in such circumstances it is incumbent
on the real directors not to allow the minor to act as a shadow
director. Amendment No. 148, which is a probing amendment, seeks
clarification on that
issue.</div><a name="06070664000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
149 would delete the
words</div><a name="06070664000278"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
regulations may make different provision for different parts of the
United Kingdom.&#148;</div><a name="06070664000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
sure why they should be included in the Bill. I thought that we were
considering UK corporate law, so why should it be acceptable to allow
directors under 16 in some parts of the country? That seems
inconsistent and
illogical.</div><a name="06070664000257"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
