<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome the Committee to its 23rd sitting to consider the Bill, and to London on a pleasant and almost spring-like day. Before we resume debate, I should report that Macclesfield Town defeated Northampton Town two nil on Saturday. I commiserate with the Minister for London and Construction, who is a strong supporter of the Cobblers, and I hope that both Macclesfield and Northampton avoid relegation to the third division.
<P>
I believe that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) was seeking to catch my eye at the end of the previous sitting. Does he still wish to do so?
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): No longer, Mr. Winterton.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I was trying to catch your eye, Mr. Winterton, shortly before 7 o'clock last Thursday. The Committee will be enormously relieved to hear that I, rather like the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood have found that the passage of five days has largely obliterated what was on the wax front of my mind.
<P>
I am conscious in opening the debate that the Committee is entering the final straight. It is a long final straight, but I know that I speak on the Committee's behalf when I say that we are delighted that you, Mr. Winterton, are still the clerk of the course.
<P>
I have not studied closely the speech of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) on Thursday evening, but I think that he said that the Liberal Democrats were going to eschew lists. I have looked at their amendments, and God knows what they would be doing if they embarked on their approach on a large scale.
<P>
I shall speak to amendment No. 1227, which I tabled. During debate on clause 34, the Minister for Transport in London gave assurances about consultation with business. The business interests that might be consulted--I am speaking in slightly coded language--feel that the Minister for London and Construction may be resiling from those commitments. Will the Minister restate the Government's position on clause 34, and, incidentally, comment on my amendment?
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction </B>(Mr. Nick Raynsford): I should like to offer you, Mr. Winterton, my congratulations on the success of Macclesfield Town on Saturday. I have supported the Cobblers through good years and bad--and there have been rather more of the latter than of the former during the past 35 years--so I am used to disappointments. My only consolation is that Northampton remains ahead of Macclesfield at the foot of the second division, if only by a very narrow margin.
The clause is intended to provide clear and open consultation arrangements that are consistent with the requirements of the planning system and with the objective of avoiding over-lengthy and over-complex procedures.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1086, 1087 and 1088 would require the mayor to carry out two full and separate consultation exercises with the boroughs and other external interests. That is wholly unnecessary and is a recipe for delay. We want the mayor to be able to produce the SDS relatively quickly and not to get bogged down in over-bureaucratic consultation procedures that would require him or her to undertake a full external consultation first on an initial set of proposals and then on a draft SDS.
<P>
Hon. Members may not have fully understood the purpose of subsection (1), which will ensure that the assembly and the GLA functional bodies have an input into the development of the mayor's proposals before the more formal consultation begins. That is obviously desirable because it will ensure consistency within the GLA. That is the purpose of the first-stage consultation. It is not an external consultation, but it will ensure that all the GLA functional bodies and the assembly are involved in the initial preparation of the draft for consultation.
<P>
Of course, any sensible mayor is likely to take care to consult the boroughs and other stakeholders from the outset. That can, however, be done informally, without the need for a second formal consultation process involving the boroughs. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) recognises that the amendments are neither desirable nor conducive to efficient administration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow (Sutton and Cheam):</B> I entirely accept the Minister's point about the need for there to be internal consistency and a process by which the various policies can be reconciled before the draft goes public. That is entirely acceptable and is what would happen in a local authority. My concern, however, is that as soon as we reach the next stage and the draft is published in the public domain, it will become an emerging policy and a material consideration--albeit a weak one--that will determine planning applications. Is that the case? If so, perhaps the boroughs should be involved before the draft becomes a material consideration.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right to ask about that. The answer is that the draft will become a material consideration. As the hon. Gentleman will recognise, however, the weight that is attached to documents will increase through the process. The weight that is attached to a newly emerging document that has not been the subject of external consultation will be small by comparison with the weight that will be attached to documents later, when consultation with the boroughs has taken place. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman that it is impossible for an emerging document that the assembly will be able to see before the formal consultation process begins to be denied as a potential material consideration. That would be improper and wrong. I hope, however, that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied by my comments about the weight that will be attached to it.
<P>
Amendment No. 1110 would require the mayor to undertake a full public consultation exercise. It is unnecessary and the drafting is unspecific; it is not clear whether the statement would add anything to the Bill's provisions for a full and thorough consultation exercise.
<P>
Amendment No. 1227, which the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke) tabled, would include specific mention of representatives of business in the list of consultees. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that there is no question of the Government resiling from the commitments that they have already given about full consultation with business interests in all the work of the mayor and the GLA. That is a clear commitment, which we intend absolutely to carry through in every respect.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman will, however, recall that, when we debated clauses in part II, we gave an undertaking to examine again the precise drafting of consultation arrangements to guarantee they were consistent and truly achieved the Government's stated objective of ensuring that representatives of business, community groups, the voluntary sector and other interested bodies were consulted at all appropriate stages. I hope that he recognises that we will return to the matter on Report with our thoughts on how to give greater clarity and focus to the consultation commitments. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If I may continue to speak in coded language, has the Minister's correspondence with one of the bodies interested in this subject, which has been responsible for putting forward amendments about the consultation of business interests, been directed towards the aim that he has just described?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman is referring to correspondence with the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, we have indicated to that body that we are totally committed to a procedure for consultation with business. However, we do not support the principle of naming organisations representative of business because, inevitably, there will be occasions when it is appropriate for the mayor to seek to consult more widely. It is right that representatives of business organisations other than those formally affiliated to the LCCI should have an opportunity to express their views. We intend that organisations such as London First and the Confederation of British Industry London region should also be fully engaged in the consultation processes with business interests in London.
<P>
I turn to amendments Nos. 1111 and 1112. I have no problem with the idea of the mayor consulting anyone who he or she considers to be appropriate. However, I do not believe that the Bill needs to be specific about that. The clause stipulates a minimum list of those who must always be considered, and more detailed provisions can be set out in regulations made under clause 236. In any case, I would not wish to provide that the assembly should be able to determine the mayor's consultation arrangements. Therefore, I am not minded to accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 1090 is unduly restrictive. The Bill provides for the time period for consultation on, and objection to, the SDS to be defined in secondary legislation through the regulation-making provisions in clause 236. Secondary legislation is normally used for defining the prescribed period for development plans such as UDPs and structure plans, and I see no good reason to depart from that practice. On the contrary, as we are creating a new type of planning instrument, it is even more appropriate not to enshrine such provisions in primary legislation, where they cannot easily be adapted in the light of experience. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1113 and 1114 would specify that all the parties that have been statutorily consulted during the preparation of the SDS should be formally informed of its withdrawal. In practice, I expect that all such bodies that have made representations will be covered by the existing proposals. However, I do not object to the principle that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam seeks to put into the Bill. If he is willing to withdraw the amendment, I will be happy to consider the matter further to ensure that the Bill is clear that the bodies that have made representations in response to the initial draft of the SDS should be informed if it is withdrawn. In the light of those assurances, I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will agree that the amendments should be withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments and look forward to seeing appropriate amendments being tabled in due course.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Publication</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 106, in page 116, leave out line 19.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 107, in page 116, line 35, leave out from beginning to end of line 8 on page 117.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendments deal with issues relating to the power of the mayor. Amendment No. 106 would delete from clause 229 subsection (2)(b), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any direction given under subsection (6) below and not withdrawn".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would slightly reduce the mayor's discretion about the spatial development plan in relation to the boroughs. We are anxious to address that.
<P>
Amendment No. 107 would remove the power of the Secretary of State to give the mayor directions to amend the strategy. It would delete a substantial part of the clause as drafted--subsections (5) to (7), which deal with powers of the Secretary of State to direct the mayor. Those provisions need to be further considered by the Government, because the Secretary of State does not need the power to force the mayor to amend the strategy. We want some explanation from the Government as to why they believe that those powers are necessary. The amendments are intended to clarify and to probe; we do not necessarily intend to press them. We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> The hon. Gentleman spoke of the power to force the mayor that is inherent in the clause. The amendments would remove the Secretary of State's power to direct the mayor to amend the SDS. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, we have based our proposals on normal planning provisions, which allow the Secretary of State to direct development plans elsewhere.
<P>
Although the mayor will be responsible for planning in London, there may be occasions when the SDS has ramifications for wider regional or national policies that have not fully been considered. The mayor will be placed by clause 235 under a duty to have regard to such matters, and we fully expect the mayor to act responsibly in this respect. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam would agree that in the event of agreement not being reached, there must be a way to protect those wider interests.
<P>
The power already vested with the Secretary of State has been used only in exceptional circumstances. I trust that my reply will cause the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> That is helpful; I am grateful to the Minister for setting that out. I fully appreciate that such powers exist in respect of producing structure plans and unitary development plans. With the Minister's comments in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1091, in page 116, line 20, leave out "findings" and insert "recommendations".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 1093, in clause 230, page 117, line 36, leave out "findings" and insert "recommendations".
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendments say the same thing: they would both remove "findings" and insert "recommendations". At present, the mayor can modify the SDS before final publication, to take account of any findings of the examination in public panel provided before in clause 230. The effect of the amendments would be to strengthen the provision and allow the EIP to make recommendations--changes--rather than just findings.
<P>
Examinations in public tend to make recommendations on structure plans that the public authority must accept or reject. The word "findings" does not necessarily include proposing changes to the strategy. The mayor could therefore override or skate over the EIP's report. The amendments would bring the GLA process in line with that of the structure plans.
<P>
As I expect that the Minister is aware, that difference was pointed out by Professor Malcolm Grant, the editor of the "Encyclopedia of Planning Law and Practice" and chairman of the Local Government Commission. Will the Minister confirm that she intends the mayor to be able to override the examination in public, if he so wishes?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My response to the final question of the hon. Member for Croydon, South is, as I am sure he knows, that it is always open for planning authorities to override such matters, and there is no difference in this case. However, I think that the hon. Gentleman's essential concern is on the use of the word "findings" as opposed to "recommendations".
<P>
We believe that "findings" is the correct term. There will be a requirement on the panel to report its findings, and a requirement on the mayor to take into account all the panel's findings. That is wider than requiring the mayor merely to consider matters that were the subject of formal recommendations. The word "findings" is also used elsewhere in the Bill.
<P>
Although I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns, in this instance they are unfounded. There is a broad requirement for the mayor to take into account all the findings of the panel, and we believe that that comprehensive term would include all forms of recommendation. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister must explain two things. First, why did Professor Grant not agree with her? He is considered to be quite an authority in this area, and he thinks that the provisions leave a loophole whereby the mayor could ignore a finding if he so wished. Professor Grant's opinion should be taken into account.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister said that this is what goes on in local authorities at present. Perhaps she will correct me if I am wrong, but it is the other way round; at the moment, when an examination in public produces a structure plan, recommendations--a word that has been taken out of other planning obligations--are made to the planning authority.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but I am sorry that I did not manage to convince him that "findings", which appears elsewhere in the Bill, deals with them. We perceive the provision as being sufficiently widely encompassing to ensure that all recommendations will be included in those findings.
<P>
I listened to what the hon. Gentleman said about the gentleman to whom he referred, who is an expert in planning. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not claim that the professor is the only expert in these matters. As with everything else, there must be a balance between opinions from a variety of sources. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the purpose of this part of the Bill is to ensure that the concerns that he has touched on are adequately addressed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the Minister assures me that my concerns have no foundation, obviously I accept her word. I suggest, however, that before the final stages of the Bill, she considers the point that I have made. For now, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1176, in page 116, line 38, leave out "or regional policies" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Policies or relevant regional planning guidance".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following Government amendments Nos. 1178 and 1179.
<P>
Government new clause 84--Mayor's functions in relation to planning Greater London.
<P>
Government amendment No. 1180.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Amendments Nos. 1176 and 1178 remove an inconsistency in the use of the terms "regional policies" and "regional planning guidance" by omitting the reference to regional policies. They therefore make it clear that the mayor and Secretary of State should be considering regional planning guidance.
<P>
I should again make it clear that by regional planning guidance, we are not referring to the guidance for London that is currently issued by the Secretary of State. That will be replaced by the SDS. We have in mind regional planning guidance for the south-east, which currently sets the context for London guidance and should be considered equally by the mayor when preparing the SDS and the Secretary of State in considering whether there is a need for any direction to protect interests outside London.
<P>
On Government amendments Nos. 1179 and 1180, clauses 229(9) and 235(1) currently envisage that the Secretary of State may issue regional planning guidance applying only to London. As I said, the SDS will take the place of regional planning guidance for London, which is currently issued by the Secretary of State.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 1179 and 1180 therefore amend the definition of regional planning guidance to remove the words "consists of" in relation to Greater London. They leave in place a requirement for the mayor to have regard to any RPG that may be in force for an area that adjoins or includes Greater London. As I have made clear, the latter relates to RPG for the south-east, which currently sets the context for London guidance, and should also have a bearing on the mayor's consideration of the SDS.
<P>
I now turn to new clause 84, which provides for the mayor to represent the planning interests of London in discussions about broader regional planning matters in the south-east, with neighbouring regions or with neighbouring local planning authorities.
<P>
As the Committee may know, the London Planning Advisory Committee, the joint planning committee for Greater London, which will be abolished by the Bill, has exercised a similar function. The new clause is broadly based on similar provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which placed responsibility on LPAC. The mayor should represent the views of London, but the clause also makes provision to ensure that the boroughs are consulted in the exercise of that function.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I wanted to ask a couple of questions about new clause 84. First, at present, the London boroughs are directly involved in Serplan. Will the new clause stop the boroughs continuing to participate in Serplan? That is an important link; the boroughs benefit from it in drawing up their UDPs and from their ability through Serplan to influence the wider regional planning guidance that the Minister has just mentioned.
<P>
Secondly, can the formalised manner in which the mayor will issue his views be regarded as adding further material considerations to the determination of planning applications? It would be useful if the Minister would clarify whether that will be a consequence of the new clause; if so, the mayor's views must be published. [Interruption.] I gather that we do not need to be concerned about that, but it would be useful to have that assurance on the record.
<P>
The new clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Mayor shall inform . . . local planning authorities for areas in the vicinity of Greater London . . . of his views concerning any matters of common interest, whether general or specific, relating to . . . planning or development".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Given that the mayor has the central role and is responsible for the SDS, surely his utterances may well have an effect on the interpretation of the SDS, thus shaping material considerations in determining applications. We need to be clear about what that could mean in practice, and how appellants may choose to take that into account during appeal procedures--and, indeed, when presenting applications to planning committees in the first place.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give us the necessary clarification on those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I rise briefly to support Government amendment No. 1176, especially given the assurances that the Minister gave my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam on amendment No. 107. It is important that a higher authority--in this case, the Secretary of State--can ensure that planning policies at different levels are consistent. It is appropriate that that power be left with the Secretary of State. I wanted to make that point because it is an unusual one for a Liberal Democrat member of the Committee to make.
<P>
I have personal experience in my constituency of the importance of a higher authority ensuring consistency. There has been a planning dispute in Surbiton about the future of some filter beds by the River Thames, opposite Hampton Court. A developer who works with Thames Water, which owns the site, wants to build four blocks of flats right by the river. I have been working with local people to oppose that plan. In doing so, I have learned a great deal about how planning law can become inconsistent with the regional planning guidance that the Government, through the amendment, want to ensure is in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The UDP plan for Kingston would allow some residential development on the Surbition filter bed site. When the UDP was proposed, it was in line with the strategic planning guidance for London that was published in 1989 by the--[Interruption.] It was published by the then Secretary of State, the late Nicholas Ridley. His SPG for London in relation to the River Thames contained just nine lines of guidance about how development along the Thames should take into account a regional strategy. That was on page 22 of the Department of the Environment's SPG. The UDP was formed on that basis.
<P>
When the council came to examine the planning application that I mentioned and to consider whether the site was sensible, it had to take into account the UDP, which had not been updated by subsequent strategic planning guidance--namely, the SPG for the River Thames, which a subsequent Conservative Secretary of State issued in 1997. If that planning guidance had updated the UDP, the development would not even have been considered and the developers would not have made the planning application. I made that point to the planning inquiry.
<P>
The planning inspector's report is before Ministers and they are considering it. I hope that they follow through the logic of the amendment in their judgment of the application and of the report. If they do, they will make it clear that the UDP of Kingston is deemed to have been updated by the SPG that the previous Government issued and that the planning application to build flats by the River Thames should be struck out. If Ministers refer to the report and to the inquiry, they will see the great sense in the amendment. I hope and expect that a future Secretary of State, working with the mayor, will ensure that inconsistencies such as those that I have described never occur again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I simply want to associate Conservative Members with the pertinent questions asked by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. We look forward with interest to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson rose--</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I think that it will be simpler if I put my question to the Minister before the Minister responds; otherwise, she would have to have supernatural powers.
<P>
Government new clause 81(4) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contributions towards defraying the expenses of any body on which the Authority is represented".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is concern--I am thinking ahead to clause 237(9)--that if the mayor is consulted on an application and directs a refusal, that will lead to additional delays, which we have discussed, and to increased costs. Those costs will be added to by the provision of information to the mayor under a monitoring scheme that collects information for the monitoring, review, alteration and implementation of the SDS. All of that is admirable, but it will give little benefit to the boroughs. My concern is about where the cost will fall and whether Government new clause 84(4) is intended in any way to deal with that issue.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> First, I shall touch on the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who is worried about what he perceives to be a possible lack of information in the future. As my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction said in Committee last Thursday, Serplan is not a statutory body. The precise arrangements for effective regional planning in the south-east have therefore to be a matter for discussion. We are entering an era of regional development and regional development authorities, and these issues must obviously be considered.
<P>
The Town and Country Planning Acts do not define what a material consideration is. That is a matter for the courts, if proceedings go that far. The mayor will have a published SDS. It could therefore be argued--as I am now doing--that anything other than what is in that strategy could be deemed to be a material consideration. We are entering an era in which such considerations, which will be very much in the public domain, must be taken on board as part and parcel of these matters. The hon. Gentleman's concerns cannot conceivably be addressed in the Bill. However, I guarantee to look at the matter to make doubly sure that there is no possible danger.
<P>
I thank the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) for his compliment, but I point out for future reference that the pithiest compliments are always the best ones. Perhaps that will inform some of his later contributions.
<P>
It would be improper for me or my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction to make any comment about the specific constituency issue to which he referred, given that the Secretary of State has a quasi-judicial position in such matters. In terms of any later guidance that is issued by the Secretary of State and the mayor with regard to the SDS, the material considerations will essentially be those that are outside the definitions of the SDS. I have already guaranteed that I will examine the issue to ensure that there are no inherent dangers.
<P>
In reply to the question that was asked by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, we shall consider the matter more fully when we reach clause 238. I trust that we will be able to give the right hon. Gentleman more detailed responses at that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her answers. I hope that when she has completed her examinations she will write to members of the Committee with her conclusions. It would be very helpful if she could do so. I look forward to receiving that letter in due course, and hope that it clarifies the matter.
<P>
On the broader issue of the spatial development plan, the Minister for London and Construction told us last week that it is an evolving area. The Bill will take us into uncharted territory in the sense that factors that have not hitherto been material to planning decisions, such as noise and air quality, will be taken into account strategically. That means that in expressing his opinion on some issues, the mayor could inadvertently move into the position of the Secretary of State. That is why Secretaries of State are always cautious about planning issues in terms of saying something that will be used in determining applications. That issue will need to be carefully reflected on over time.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall of course write to all Committee members after I have made inquiries. The hon. Gentleman is right to highlight the fact that we are moving into uncharted territory. That is part of the exciting approach that is being taken. We are aware of those concerns and considerations and we will be examining in some detail the matters with regard to noise pollution and air quality, on which the hon. Gentleman touched.
<P>
I repeat, however, that it is not as though we are doing any of this in the dark, behind closed doors and without everybody being made aware; there are major changes coming, but everyone in London will be aware of those changes and must consider their own approaches to these issues in the same way.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1177, in page 117, line 15, leave out "before, or" and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or announced before, or otherwise".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As all hon. Members will know, national policy is not always or exclusively set out in formally published documentation which is laid before or presented to either House in this Parliament. For example, the current call-in policy was announced through a response to a parliamentary question. The amendment alters the current definition of national policy in the Bill so as to include policies that are announced before Parliament. It clarifies those policies to which the mayor will have to have regard in preparing the spatial development strategy and the form that they will have to take for the Secretary of State to base any possible direction on them. I commend the amendment to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that that brings into line the principles in earlier clauses--
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister nods yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief, but for a moment I thought that this might be described as the Boothroyd amendment. It is a description of how national policy should be defined. However, the Minister omitted to mention occasions when national policy has been announced on the "Today" programme.
<P>
The word "before" clearly has both a temporal and geographical connotation. There was a moment when--not least because "before" was succeeded by a comma--I thought that it might be meant in a temporal sense. However, I note that it is in fact geographical. I raise no objection to that, but it is a pity that Madam Speaker's views on these matters was not strengthened in the course of the clause.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I presume--I have no doubt that the right hon. Gentleman will correct me if my presumption is incorrect--that when he referred to an announcement of policy on the "Today" programme, he was thinking of the interview that was given by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on the publication today of our bus document. I should point out that that is not new policy; it is one of eight documents that we announced would be published following the publication of our white Paper and the integrated transport policy document.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The Minister must think that I have an extremely narrow life if it is totally focused on what happened on the "Today" programme today. I am alluding to the national policies that have been announced on the "Today" programme since May 1997.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I can speak only for the actions of my Government. I note that the previous Administration set a fashion for such announcements, but it has certainly been the policy of this Government that all important announcements are made in the first instance to the House, as properly they should be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Those words are going to haunt the Minister.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not sure that Hansard picked up that comment, but it was made from a sedentary position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> They were the words of a ghost!
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman said that my words would haunt me, but I have never had any fear of the afterlife or, indeed, apparitions therefrom. I have always regarded ghosts as being in the main quite friendly.
<P>
I was glad that I was able to reassure the hon. Member for Croydon, South even before he had finished his question, but I should add that similar amendments will need to be made throughout the remainder of the Bill to ensure the conformity to which he referred.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I rise only to make a probing point. Subsection (1) of the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It shall be the duty of the Mayor to review the spatial development strategy from time to time."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the Minister clarify the time involved, and tell us when such reviews should occur? Should we expect them to be carried out on a quinquennial or septennial basis? What sort of period does the Minister think appropriate? Londoners should know in advance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The telepathy that links Ruislip-Northwood with the two Cities has been at work again, as I wanted to speak about the same matter. The phrase "from time to time" has a quality of aristocratic languor. An aunt of mine once called on a rural parish whose clergyman was an earl. As he was a forebear of a former Member of Parliament, and in the light of the note that I am about to describe, I shall not identify him. I should tell the Committee, however, that I am speaking of events that occurred in this century. The church porch contained a note. Its words were to the effect that "There is no set hour for evensong. Peasants will be summoned from the field by a few strokes on the angelus." The subsection to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) referred has the same quality of timelessness. I shall put my question even more precisely than my hon. Friend. Does the Minister believe that it would be appropriate for reviews to be conducted at least once every four years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The updating of the SDS is essential to take account of changing circumstances, but it would be wrong to set an unduly prescriptive time scale because a number of other considerations inevitably have to be taken into account. They include the issuing of new planning guidance by the Secretary of State and the emergence of UDPs, which have to be modified to take account of the SDS. For those reasons, we do not believe that it is right to be unduly prescriptive about when the SDS will be reviewed.
<P>
The Bill contains a safeguard: it enables the Secretary of State to direct a review of the SDS if we believe that it is in need of updating and has not been updated by the mayor. It would probably be difficult to plan a rigid time scale in any meaningful way to take account of the considerations that I have outlined. I must, therefore, disappoint the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I can, however, assure the right hon. Gentleman that it is not aristocratic languor that leads us to our conclusion but simple pragmatism.
<P>
It is a nice thought that a few strokes on the angelus might announce the emergence of a new spatial development strategy. That will, however, depend on whether it is possible for the mayor to incorporate in Sir Norman Foster's marvellous building a bell that could be sounded at the appropriate moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The extension of the Lutine bell from outside my constituency to Greater London is an attractive concept.
<P>
The Minister might reasonably say in response to my question that if there was no review of the spatial development strategy for four years, the Secretary of State might think that enough was enough and that there ought to be one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks simply because a premature revision of the SDS that was triggered simply by the fact that a set period of time had been specified in legislation would probably be inconvenient and result in significant abortive costs to the London boroughs if they were in the process of revising their UDPs in the light of the previous SDS. That is why we do not specify such a period, but have a fall-back provision under which the Secretary of State will have the power to intervene when it becomes clear that there is a need for a review of the SDS and that the mayor has failed to undertake one.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to query the necessity for the clause. It seems to give the Secretary of State the power to determine the typeface, point size and cover design of the spatial development strategy. It seems unnecessarily prescriptive as regards the way in which the mayor should put the SDS together. Given that clause 226, which we have debated, clearly sets out what must be in the SDS, it appears unnecessary to give the Secretary of State a further power to specify--line by line and paragraph by paragraph--how the document is to be presented to the public. I am sure that the mayor will be perfectly capable of taking advice and choosing a suitable form for publication that is accessible to the public and useful to those for whom it will be a tool for taking decisions on planning applications.
<P>
I want the Minister to explain why it is necessary to have such a prescriptive clause in the Bill, and not just to tell us that the provision appears in other legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to you for calling me, Mr. Winterton, as I appended my name to amendment No. 110, tabled by the Liberal Democrats--the sympathy of my forebears in the previous century was asserting itself. I am especially glad to speak after the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam because he made so brief a speech this time.
<P>
I think that other members of the Committee share my sense that dotted throughout the Bill are Henry VIII clauses to give the Secretary of State power to override the mayor. They are especially oppressive in this part of the Bill, so I, too, will be interested to hear the Minister's explanation as to why this prescriptive provision is necessary.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the Minister, I must remind the Committee that no amendment was selected for debate; we are having a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I say to both the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that the regulations mirror equivalent existing provisions with regard to structure plans. They are familiar to anyone who has anything to do with the planning system. I point out that such regulations are not exclusively for the benefit of the planning authority--in this instance, the mayor. They also benefit boroughs, developers and the public, because they make it clear how the relevant planning authority is expected to behave and what is their role in the planning process.
<P>
As I said, the provision for the Secretary of State to produce regulations covering the procedures mentioned is equivalent to existing provisions with regard to structure plans. The regulations are not dictatorial. Underlining the requirement for everyone to know precisely what is going on, they cover minimum publicity arrangements and procedures and the documentation that should accompany the strategy. The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam made a slightly flippant remark about typefaces, but we are discussing planning, and I should have thought that maps would be an especially important part of any decision-making process. We are discussing a strategic approach, and strategic maps will be needed. The regulations also make provision for how the SDS will be kept up to date once in place.
<P>
I hope that I have managed to calm the fears of the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, and convinced them that the clause should stand part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The debate will constitute a palindrome if the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam speaks after me, with the Minister at its heart.
<P>
I understand what the Minister is saying, but I hope that she will forgive me for gently saying that one problem that Opposition members of the Committee have in responding to the Bill is that when we suggest that perhaps the unprecedented powers to be given to the mayor are inappropriate, the Government are quick to jump to their feet to say, "Ah, but this is an unprecedented and radical Bill, and you must allow for the fact that we are doing things for the first time." However, as soon as we enter into the spirit of the exercise and seek to support the mayor, the Minister jumps up and says, "Ah, but the powers that exist are standard powers and there is no way that we are going to do away with them." However, I do not in any way seek to divide the Committee. I am delighted to sit down and let the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam speak.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> It is quite disturbing to note that it appears that a telepathic link is being established between the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and myself. Nevertheless, the right hon. Gentleman's points are absolutely right. The clause will grant the Secretary of State very wide-ranging powers in respect of preparing an SDS.
<P>
Sometimes the shortest clauses with the briefest phrases are the ones that contain items requiring the most careful examination. In that respect, I also note that subsection (2) provides that regulations may apply differently to different parts of Greater London. That surprises me, because clause 237 requires general conformity in the application of the SDS across London and that the general strategy will have general application in London. I would still be concerned to see that in the Bill, but there is a provision for it to be done in different ways in different parts of London. How can it be right that there should be different standards in terms of the publication of maps or anything else?
<P>
Although I remain sceptical of the Minister's assurances, I will not divide the Committee. However, I hope that Ministers will examine the clause again, particularly subsection (2). It seems unnecessary to provide for regulations that can be applied in different ways.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster castigated us for opting for what appeared to him to be two diametrically opposed approaches to the proposals. The powers that are granted to the Secretary of State by the clause are not new. I have already mentioned that the clause mirrors equivalent provisions elsewhere.
<P>
There must be a balance between using what is known, tried and tested, which is part and parcel of many of the structures of the Bill, and the opportunity to develop something new; that is equally important. We believe that that will be of great benefit to London and Londoners. We are fully aware of the need for that balance, but it is right and proper that Committee members should draw to our attention occasions when they believe that perhaps that balance has veered slightly too far in one direction.
<P>
With regard to what the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam said about what appears to him to be a lack of uniformity of approach, the Committee has already considered some issues that reflect not only a strategic approach to planning matters in London, but our attempt to ensure that the variations that are inherent within this great city should also be maintained within that overall strategic approach. That should not be taken to the level of acknowledging that London is a sequence of linked villages; but with regard to relevant floor space for office buildings, for example, there are differences in relation to proposals that would have to be examined by the mayor as between the City of London, inner London and other parts of Greater London. There will, of course, inevitably be differences in any planning approach that has to do with the River Thames.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I entirely accept that there need to be different treatments for different cases in different parts of London. However, the clause is about the form and content of the SDS, the nature of the documents, including maps, and the procedures that need to be followed for preparation, withdrawal and publication. It is not about different classes of planning application or different cases--it is about the process. Why do the Government need the power to make regulations making different provision for different parts of Greater London?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is perhaps labouring the point. I have already said that we want the strategic plan to be flexible in acknowledging the variety and variation that is inherent in London, which planning should reflect. We do not want to see in future the kinds of excrescences that have disfigured parts of London in the past. I have touched on the issue of the River Thames. There may be special regulations or a special approach to guard what is central and essential in the maintenance of the river. I return to the point about maps. A map that has to do with planning for a river can be very different from a map that has to do with planning for an office block in the centre of London. It would surely not be in the best interests of London and Londoners if the ability to be flexible was not inherent in the mayor's powers. I see that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam is nodding his head--I trust that that means that he agrees with me. Now he is waving his fingers, and I am not so sure.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1098, in page 119, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) In section 12 (preparation of unitary, development plan) after subsection (6)(a) there shall be inserted--
<P>
 '(aa) if the authority is a London borough, the spatial development strategy;'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 1097, in page 119, leave out from the beginning of line 30 to the end of line 11 on page 121.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will be able to support the amendment, because it deletes the requirement for there to be general conformity with the SDS.
<P>
Amendment No. 1098 would impose an obligation for the boroughs to have regard to the SDS. At present, the boroughs are obliged to have regard to strategic planning guidance--that is, RPG3 in London--but they are not obliged to follow it. Any difference may have to be justified in the development plan inquiry. Requirements of general conformity unduly limit the independence of the boroughs, which could have damaging results. I have previously given illustrations of how wealth creation could be distorted. For example, the borough of Croydon may want to have a conference centre and put it into their UDP. If there was general conformity with the SDS, and the mayor wanted to have a conference centre somewhere north of the river, that would reduce Croydon's drive to produce its own conference centre. The amendment would put the SDS on the same footing as the present RPG3 arrangements.
<P>
To take a broader example, it is well known that LPAC opposed the construction of terminal 5. The reason that it gave for doing that was its concern about the distorting effect that it will have on wealth generation in the south-east generally. It believes that prosperity will be taken away from other parts of the region. If that is LPAC's attitude now, the same people, who I imagine may end up working in the GLA, would take the same approach in considering Croydon's conference centre. I therefore hope that the Minister will think hard about this matter, and adapt the general conformity requirement to comply with the present arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The clause and the amendments that have been tabled to it cover a number of important issues about the way in which this part of the Bill works and its impact on the boroughs, particularly on the way in which they exercise and discharge their responsibilities in respect of their UDPs.
<P>
There are several aspects that need to be explored, and the two amendments represent a good place to start. We must address the relationship between the boroughs and the mayor and the power that the clause confers on the mayor to require UDPs to be in general conformity with the spatial development strategy.
<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South instead place a duty on the London boroughs to have regard for the SDS. Although I have served for some years on a planning Committee, I must be honest and say that I am slightly at a loss as to which words would be more important and given greater weight both when a planning Committee was determining an application and when an inspector was conducting an appeal. It seems to me that the effect of requiring the boroughs to have regard for the SDS would be much the same as requiring the UDPs to be in general conformity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am advised by those who know far more about the subject than the hon. Gentleman or I that boroughs would not be obliged to follow the SDS. That is the essential difference that the amendment would make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I had guessed that that was the logic underlying the amendment. From some experience of sitting in witness boxes and attending inquiries into planning applications, I can say that RPGS become material considerations, and are certainly prayed in aid by appellants if they are unhappy with decisions taken by a planning authority. It is an important point but a fine one whether general conformity with or having regard for the SDS is the most appropriate way to proceed with determining applications.
<P>
We have given some thought to the issues raised by the amendments, and we think it important for the mayor's ability effectively to deliver his or her vision of London that he or she can require general conformity. However--this is an important qualification--the interpretation of what "general conformity" means, how much latitude that will give the boroughs and how much diversity there can be between UDPs will be crucial. I will listen closely to what the Minister has to say about that.
<P>
We still want to maintain boroughs' ability to pursue distinctive policies and test out different approaches to their planning policies--which may in turn be learnt from and adopted by others in future. We would not want the mayor to be able to stifle that diversity across London. The Minister's response to the amendments will be crucial in determining how we cast our votes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I rise briefly to speak in support of my hon. Friend. I happened to be talking to an architect from the centre of London at a London First event. Unsolicited, he made just that point--that we need to ensure that conformity does not descend on what we do around London. He warned us that that was the trend that he sensed at present, and, not knowing that the subject was coming up for debate today--until I told him--asked that we made that point strongly on the profession's behalf, to ensure that the city is exciting for the next generation, not increasingly unexciting in architectural and life space terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The concern that my hon. Friend reports from outside the Committee is important. Some London boroughs will feel that more acutely than others. I dare say that we will be told that, because of the flexibility in the way that the Secretary of State will define those matters which the mayor can call in, to direct a refusal, diversity will still be allowed. We will also be told that the SDS will be drafted in such a way as to allow different cases to be made for different areas.
<P>
We will not know whether that is true until the first SDS is published in draft form. However, the Minister can today clarify what the Government regard as being "general conformity" with the SDS. The matter should be tested, and as much detail as possible should be put on record now to give guidance to the mayor in drawing up the SDS and to the boroughs about what they can and cannot do in preparing their UDPs. The amendments are helpful in teasing out those issues.
<P>
11.45 am
<P>
 During the previous sitting, the hon. Member for Croydon, South moved amendment No. 1084, which proposed that the SDS should be based on London boroughs' views. Presumably, the amendment would have caused the mayor to base his SDS on the boroughs' UDPs. If amendment No. 1084 had been accepted and the amendment before us were also agreed to, the SDS would be based on the UDPs and in turn would have to inform them. That proposed arrangement seems a little circular, although I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will explain otherwise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman was present when I spoke to amendment No. 1084, so he will be aware that I based it on the words of the Deputy Prime Minister. It did not represent my policy but that of the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Sadly, on that occasion the Ministers were not minded to accept the wisdom of their Secretary of State or to provide for it in the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Whether the amendment contained the Secretary of State's wisdom or the hon. Gentleman's own view, it would, in conjunction with amendment No. 1098, have created a circular process that would have been confusing for everyone.
<P>
We need to establish clearly the meaning of general conformity and to ascertain how it differs from having regard to the SDS in determining planning applications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I suspect that the Committee's debate on the amendments is one of the most significant that will arise during the remaining hours during which we may consider the Bill. The amendments encapsulate the very heart of the Opposition's approach, which is that planning should originate in the expression at borough level of local people's will, which is, of course, translated by the boroughs into their UDPs.
<P>
The Government appear to be hellbent on general conformity, the meaning of which is clear to me at any rate. They are saying that the UDPs shall conform and be configured to ensure that they do not involve planning policy that diverges in any significant way from that laid down in general terms by the mayoralty in the SDS.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South rightly tabled the amendments to try to eliminate the general conformity that the Government are seeking to impose, which is a potential force for considerable damage to Londoners' quality of life. Appropriately, my hon. Friend referred to a specific example to make a general point. He spoke about LPAC's Opposition to the proposed development of a fifth terminal at Heathrow. It suggests that such a development could be prejudicial to the development of other airports in Greater London.
<P>
The mayor will have a material interest in the decision on the recommendations of the inspector regarding terminal 5. We do not know about the time scale involved, but the decision on the fifth terminal will certainly not be made before the installation of the GLA, so the mayor will have a material interest. I shall take the example a little further. The mayor's SDS could be an attempt to develop further Biggin Hill and City airport and to downgrade the fifth terminal at Heathrow. That is a clear example of the way in which the mayoralty could interfere with a process of great significance to particular areas of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I do not want to interrupt my hon. Friend's flow; he is making important points about airports. My point was that LPAC opposed terminal 5 because of the impact that development would have on efforts to regenerate the more deprived areas of the south-east. I am not saying that that is relative vis-a-vis other airfields. That is not to take anything away from my hon. Friend's point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I think that I understand his point, but perhaps I did not advance my own argument clearly. Understandably, the London Planning Advisory Committee is concerned about the potential economic imbalance that the fifth terminal could produce if it were allowed to go ahead. At present, that is a matter for it to express a view on. It is, however, the sort of matter on which the mayoralty will express a view in formulating its SDS. It is also a matter of the greatest concern to local people within the borough in which the fifth terminal will be located--the borough of Hillingdon.
<P>
We might consider other particular planning issues that are relevant to my borough--I want to move from the particular to the general. My borough has more farms, countryside, public open space and green belt than any other in Greater London. The mayoralty may produce a SDS that suggests that much of that land should be utilised for industrial development, transport projects and conference centres, or that it should be designated for housing. That would represent a fundamental shift of power and planning responsibility from the local community--represented by the borough council, which formulates its UDP--to the central authority of the mayoralty, over which local people will have virtually no control. The drafting of the Bill makes it clear that general conformity shall apply. To me--if not to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)--conformity means doing what the SDS says. In a general sense, that means that there can be no significant deviation from it anywhere in London.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South advocated a looser, more flexible approach. In the system that we already have, RPG3 guidance for planning in London is keyed in, noted and--in many instances, although not necessarily--followed by London boroughs when they formulate their UDPs. That is infinitely more appropriate and infinitely more democratic than the Government's approach. There is all the difference in the world between having general regard to a SDS--as is the case with RPG3--and having to apply the general conformity that is required of the mayoralty in implementing a UDP.
<P>
I am extremely glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South has made a stand for the quality of life of individual communities throughout London. The Minister's answer will be extremely interesting because it will clarify what we already believe to be the case--that the Government are hellbent on centralising planning power within London and that that could be to the detriment of local communities, the quality of life and the environment of individual boroughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South has again reminded us of the views of the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope that you will not regard me as mischievous, Mr. Winterton, if I say that this particular national policy was announced on the Floor of the House of Commons and not on the "Today" programme. The Government might have paid more attention to it if it had been announced on "Today". In fact, one of the Deputy Prime Minister's predecessors, the great and late Nick Ridley, once said that the most confidential place in the world to say anything was the Floor of the House of Commons, so perhaps it is no surprise that it has been lost on the Government Benches.
<P>
There is a French precedent--among others--to the office of mayor. One of the glories of the city in which most of us live and work is that it has remained a series of villages--Baron Haussmann has not taken over our affairs. All of us are anxious that the mayor should not take on the baron's mantle. Of course I recognise, in the context of a book such as that by the late Sir John Summerson on Georgian London, that some architectural styles are so distinctive and distinguished that they inevitably spread across the whole city; I remark parenthetically that when a style has passed in London, one will still find it being built 20 or 30 years later in the Welsh Marches or in Lincolnshire--I am going back a century or two. Rural practices only caught up with a style thereafter.
<P>
I can remember going round London in the 1960s with a distinguished American architect, now dead, who remarked on the efforts of what I suppose was the Greater London council or the London boroughs combined, to speed up traffic in London; a large number of one-way streets had been incorporated in the capital's traffic system, which had raised the average speed in London to 15 miles an hour. He that his architectural predecessors had designed those buildings to be seen from every direction, but that now planners were deciding that the buildings would be seen by a large number of people from only one direction, because they were going to be subject to a one-way street system.
<P>
I very much support the views that have been expressed by a wide variety of my hon. Friends. I, too, am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.

<P>

<B>Sir Sydney Chapman </B>(Chipping Barnet): My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood gave a definition of spatial development implying that it meant developing open space, of which there is much in his constituency. One could take the opposite view--that spatial development means encouraging space in development. Those definitions, being at opposite ends of the spectrum, emphasise the confusion that will be caused by the use of that phrase. I would far rather return to terms such as development or town and country planning development.
<P>
The debate has raised an important issue on which I invite the Minister to comment, if she will. People have called into evidence a fifth terminal for Heathrow. A decision will be made on that after a five-year public inquiry. I will not raise the blood pressure of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood by asking what would happen if they wanted to build a sixth terminal at Heathrow in the future. But the issue is a good example from which to question the powers of the Secretary of State vis-a-vis the power of the mayor in relation to significant developments in the Greater London area.
<P>
Terminal 5, because of its profound significance not only in London--I think that it is just inside London, although part of it was not until the recent boundary changes--was naturally called in by the Secretary of State for a public inquiry. However, under the powers that the Bill will confer on the mayor, such an application would have to be called in by the mayor; he or she would have a power to direct that the application be turned down. In a previous debate, I asked whether those significant applications that would be referred to the mayor, and to which he had a power to direct disapproval or refusal, should trigger the inability of the Secretary of State then to call in that application. Confusion may arise from the direct contradiction between the Secretary of State's power to call in a significant planning application in London and the mayor's right to make a decision--not an affirmative decision--on whether he should direct the local planning authority to turn the application down, That gets right to the root of the problem: confusion is incipient in the Bill. I invite the Minister to comment on that point.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The issue that is troubling those of us who have read the clause and the amendments to the earlier legislation that the clause covers centres on the fact that we are creating what the Minister rightly describes as a new form of government that is neither regional nor local, although it is technically defined as local government.
<P>
I should like to put the issue that we are considering in an even simpler form. When we have the new structure in London, will somebody set out the Government's view of the hierarchy of decision making, call in and appeal? Those of us who have had experience of the planning process know that there are three stages involved--application and decision; appeal for those who have had their application turned down; and the power of people from above to insist on making the decision themselves or to tell someone else how to make it. A clear picture should be painted of how Ministers envisage that process. Unless that happens, anybody who is interested in the issue after these debates will not be able to use the process to their or to London's advantage.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam referred to the jigsaw of local borough planning powers and the regional planning tier. The Secretary of State's advisers at his Bristol office have not yet worked out how those come together. I am nervous about giving people powers to direct the system that go beyond the current guidance with which people already have to comply. As my hon. Friend rightly said, the reality is that if my local council--Southwark--does not take account of the Greater London development plan, the unitary development plan or the regional planning guidance, that will always be cited as a ground in the appeal process, because the planning guidance represents the framework in which decisions are made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making a most important point. I do not disagree that the regional planning guidances and other planning guidances are germane, particularly in terms of appeals. However, there is a fundamental distinction between the discretion, which is at the heart of what my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South proposes, and the requirement to conform, which is the Government's attitude. It is essentially a question of municipal autocracy versus our principle, which is that planning should arise from the expression of the popular will at a community level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I share that view. There is a complicating factor in London, which is increasingly valid the nearer one gets to the centre of the city. As well as local and regional considerations being perfectly properly taken into account, quite often one rubs up against something called the national interest. I represent a constituency that runs along the Thames in the middle of the capital city. In Southwark, planning decisions are regularly made that are not only in the interests of the people of the borough and the local issues within its boundaries. They are made in the context of the regional planning strategy for a big city; but also on the basis that it is the capital city, which means that there is another layer of considerations--to take but one example, protecting the sight line between Greenwich observatory and St. Paul's cathedral. Extra tiers of consideration are already built into the planning system in London that do not apply elsewhere. We must ensure that we are not adding further powers to either the existing levels or other levels and taking away people's rights not to be overridden by something against which they have no right of appeal--except where there is an obvious national interest, which would apply to any part of the country, not only to London.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> To encapsulate, the contributions made by the hon. Members for Croydon, South, for Sutton and Cheam and for Ruislip-Northwood, the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster and the hon. Members for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) and for Southwark, North and Bermondsey stemmed from a little confusion as to what is actually meant by a spatial development strategy. Their two main concerns were the exclusion of a local voice--a representation of the opinion of the people of London--and that the requirement for general conformity might impose on the architectural appearance of London some form of absolute taste. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
On the perceived exclusion of the opinions of local people, of course they have will have a say. They will have the most important say of all; they will elect the mayor. The SDS must be the subject of consultation. There must be examination in public, so the chance for pertinent criticism of the strategy to be not only voiced but heard is inherent in the Bill.
<P>
I was somewhat surprised by the argument of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that planning should be exclusively an issue for local will, which the hon. Member for Croydon, South advanced in a different way. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is president of the London Green Belt Council, so he is in the best possible position to understand that certain issues have strategic significance. The SDS is a strategic plan. It is not the Greater London development plan; it is not site-specific. I have already mentioned in connection with consultation that there must be an examination in public and wide consultation.
<P>
Many contributions this morning highlighted the need for precisely what we propose in the Bill: a strategic overview; a SDS that must take account of the other strategies in the mayoral remit--transport, economic development and the environment. All those matters are part and parcel of a strategic approach, underlining the fact that London is a great city, but some of its problems can be solved only by adopting a pan-London view.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South gave an example of a problem that has bedevilled London for a long time: the perception of a local authority that what is in its interests must be the exclusive consideration. He referred to a conference centre in his constituency. That ignores the fact that other boroughs surround his constituency. It is surely naive to suppose that the siting of a conference centre or anything else that would have a major impact can be exclusively decided by the borough within the hon. Gentleman's constituency. How will people get to the conference centre? Will not that impact on boroughs around it? Such considerations will have to be part and parcel of the strategic view of spatial development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for being so generous as to let me intervene. I readily acknowledge that the emotion of the issue could well have engendered a modicum of hyperbole in my remarks. Nevertheless, does the Minister not recognise that the mayor will have the strategic function of designating whole areas--not in a prescriptive but in a generalised way--for transport development, economic development or for development that redresses an imbalance elsewhere? Those issues may accord with the mayor's personal ambitions, but they might not necessarily accord with the wishes of local communities--the villages to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster referred. The wishes of local communities could be put even more at risk by the powers in the clause. That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South sought to redress.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I understand the concerns that the hon. Gentleman and his Friend expressed. It is right that they should examine the issues exclusively from the perspective of their constituents and of their constituencies as they perceive them. However, it is not the case that the powers in the clause have never been heard of or used before. The requirement for general conformity is already found in other parts of planning legislation, and it has created no problems of ambiguity. Indeed, it underlines the duty in the Bill even more strongly than does the requirement merely to "have regard to" particular factors.
<P>
We have made it clear all along, that the SDS has to be a powerful and effective instrument in delivering the pan-London dimension to which I referred. It has to be part and parcel of the other strategies that inform the mayor's decision-making processes. There will still be the requirement on the mayor that all the strategies work within national policy; in that sense, they may not impact adversely outside the GLA boundary. If there is disagreement and there is no meeting of minds on any issue, it will still be for the Secretary of State to intervene.
<P>
The intended effect of the amendments is to reduce the effectiveness and importance of the SDS. They would emasculate or devalue the strategic nature of the SDS by ensuring that the boroughs could in effect ignore the strategic plans and carry on pursuing their own exclusive, local agendas. As I said, such actions on the part of boroughs could and do have a damaging impact on the boroughs around them.
<P>
The issue before us goes to the heart of the mayor's ability to implement a strategic vision across all the issues on which I have touched. If that power is taken away from the mayor, there will be a dramatic reduction in the delivery of improvements in the quality of life in London and in the innovative ways in which London can be developed for the benefit of all, not the few. In the light of what I have said, I ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Perhaps I might reiterate the points that were made in essence by the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Sutton and Cheam. General conformity does not mean uniformity. We are not looking to prescribe some Stalinist view of developments or the exclusion of certain materials, which we suffered from in the past. That is not what general conformity means in this context.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am sure that the Minister's last point is right. I do not think that any of us has made such an allegation or criticism. But will she answer my specific question: what cascade or hierarchy of decision and direction wil there be under the new system? As she knows, Liberal Democrats support regional government for London, but the Bill is putting a new bit of government into the system. Can she give us now--or hint at now and ask her officials to produce in graphic form later--a picture of London's planning system?
<P>
<B> Ms Jackson:</B> I think it unlikely, Mr. Winterton, that you would accord me the right to read out the eight paragraphs on planning applications of strategic importance in annex B of the document that was issued by the Government office for London on 16 March, but they list the process and time limits applying to consultation of the mayor by local planning authorities.
<P>
I would say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that quite apart from the document to which I have already referred, which is now in the public domain, the model on which we are basing our approach already applies to the relationship between county plans and local plans outside London. I repeat yet again that it will be for the Secretary of State to call in cases at any stage, although, as I said to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam when we were discussing another amendment, the powers of the Secretary of State have very rarely been exercised.
<P>
We do not believe that our proposals in any way exclude the rightful contribution that Londoners, as individuals and in groups, should make with regard to proposed plans or changes that will affect their environment and their quality of life. Equally, we believe that to protect that environment and quality of life and to promote the true regeneration of our inner cities--which, in a country with as little land mass as ours, is absolutely crucial for its future sustainable development--the sort of strategic approach to the issues that we have been discussing today is necessary and vital.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Will the Minister consider page 121, subsection (9), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Provision may be made by a development order"--<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
that is a Government order--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for enabling the Mayor of London in prescribed circumstances to direct the local planning authority for a London borough to refuse an application".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As far as I am aware, there is no such power elsewhere. I know of no county council with the power to direct that a district council has to turn down an application. No authority above a county council has authority to direct a county council, because the planning system does not work like that. Does the Minister accept that this is a new power? If so, what justification is there for giving a new intermediate authority the power to say to Sutton or to Hillingdon--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Having read the Bill and the amendments in the next group, it is my understanding that this issue can be debated when we reach those amendments. I hope that the Minister will not take long in replying to the intervention.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall just tell the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that English Heritage and, indeed, the Highways Agency have those powers. I should have thought that it was even better for a directly elected representative to have such powers.
<P>
In the light of what I have said, I trust that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Having listened to the Minister's words, I want to persuade the hon. Member for Croydon, South to press his amendment to a vote. The Committee did not receive an adequate explanation of the differences between the proposed requirement for the London boroughs to have regard for the SDS when drawing up their UDPs, and provisions currently in the Bill, which give the mayor power to object at a later stage and to lodge a formal objection with the Secretary of State, who has ultimate responsibility for signing off the UDP in question. I understand that that is how the process is meant to work--certainly that is the impression given by the explanatory notes on clauses. As I understand it, a mayor can declare that a UDP is not in general conformity, but it is the Secretary of State rather than the mayor who can cause that UDP to be rewritten, and he will have to take the objection into account. It would be better to adopt the approach that is suggested in the amendments.
<P>
I may be reading explanatory notes to another clause, but it seems to me that I have outlined the effect of the especially complicated provisions before the Committee. I believe that hon. Gentlemen who made the point about the difference between having regard for and general conformity were right to do so. The Bill should require boroughs to have regard for the SDS; it is rather vague to state simply that the UDPs should be in general conformity. On 18 March, the Minister for London and Construction told the Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The main purposes of the SDS will be to provide necessary strategic guidance on the broad location of housing, industry, new transport provision and other infrastructure that will inform the preparation of UDPs."--[Official Report, Standing Committee A, 18 March 1999; c. 1338.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is right, but the process of informing and of giving guidance would be best enabled by requiring London boroughs to have regard to the SDS.
<P>
The Minister has not given Liberal Democrat Members sufficient comfort that the requirement for general conformity is not too overbearing. I ask my hon. Friends to support the amendments, which would ensure a better balance between the role of the mayor and the rights of the boroughs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful for the Liberal Democrats' support. Indeed, it is a pity that they did not put their names to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I listened to that rather sad remark, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, I said at the start of the debate that the Liberal Democrats wanted to listen to the discussion and to hear the Minister's explanation. That explanation was inadequate, which is why we now support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Our minds were made up when we tabled the amendment.
<P>
The effects of the general conformity requirement can be illlustrated simply. If the SDS states that the borough of Camden will have an incinerator, general conformity will require Camden to have it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says no. It is important that that response is on record for people who follow such planning matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We went over this ground at great length on Thursday. I once again stress that the whole purpose of the SDS is not to be site specific about the location of particular activities, but to set a framework to ensure consistency and coherence in the development of facilities in London that have a wider than local impact. In case the hon. Gentleman goes on again about the mayor directing a local authority to build an incinerator, I should say now that he is wrong, as he was last Thursday. That is not part of the process, and I hope that he will now accept that it is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It was the Minister himself who gave the example of the incinerator. In the end, I accepted his point, but is he therefore saying that the SDS will contain no reference to incineration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Clearly the hon. Gentleman did not listen to what I said last Thursday. I shall repeat my remarks again, in the hope that they will finally go in. An incinerator was one of the examples that I gave, along with conference centres, major infrastructure developments and others, of developments that need a strategic approach. That is why such developments are within the ambit of the SDS. The SDS will not, however, be site specific, and will not impose on an individual borough an obligation to have an incinerator. I thought that I had make that point pretty clearly; I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has not recognised that, and I hope that now he will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The trouble is that the Minister thinks that he has made that point clearly, but in truth he has not. All that I want is a simple yes or no: will the SDS set out any provision for incineration?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> For the third time, because I said this in reply to the hon. Gentleman's previous question--he really should listen to my replies--incineration, along with other matters of strategic importance, such as conference centres and other major infrastructure developments that are likely to have an impact beyond the individual borough and a wider significance, are properly within the remit of the SDS. But--this is where the hon. Gentleman fails to understand the whole purpose of the SDS--the strategy is not a site-specific plan that will require boroughs to carry out developments in their areas. It is a SDS for London, with which the boroughs must ensure that their UDPs are in conformity when developing them. There is a considerable distinction between those two things, and I am sorry that it has taken the hon. Gentleman the best part of two sittings to understand that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I think that in his efforts to explain the matter, the Minister is going over the top. It is not an easy subject, and he has still not given me a straight yes or no. I think that he means to say, "Maybe."
<P>
It should be at boroughs' discretion to decide whether they want to have facilities such as sports halls or incinerators. They would probably resist an incinerator and argue for a sports hall. They will have to justify that at their UDP inquiry, at which the mayor and other boroughs can appear. If the Minister were to accept our amendment, it would still be open for the Secretary of State subsequently to intervene to direct changes to the UDP.
<P>
I am standing up for the boroughs' case. The Minister is saying that the boroughs take second place. That is the difference between the parties.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way once again. He misrepresented me. May I make it quite clear that my answer to his previous question was not "Maybe". I made it perfectly clear, as I had previously, that matters of strategic importance, which would undoubtedly include the siting of incinerators, come within the ambit of the SDS. However, I went on to say that the SDS is not a site-specific document that will impose on individual boroughs an obligation to develop a particular facility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I cannot give way to the hon. Gentleman, as I am intervening on the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
The purpose of the SDS is to set a framework, so that there can be greater coherence across London in planning matters of strategic importances and so that developments in individual boroughs are not in conflict with the wider strategic interests of London. I hope that that is now clear at this late stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister appears to be saying that while the SDS cannot be site specific about locating an incinerator in Camden, it can direct that there be an incinerator in Camden. Perhaps he would like to clarify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is clear that even now the hon. Gentleman does not understand that the SDS does not direct a particular development in a particular area. The mayor has power to direct refusal in certain circumstances, but no power to direct a borough to carry out a particular development in its area. I hope that that is now absolutely clear. All the hon. Gentleman's scaremongering about the risk of a mayor imposing an incinerator on a reluctant borough is nonsense; I hope that he will now recognise that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My hon. Friend is on to an important point, and I hope that he will not be dissuaded from pursuing it. Will not the SDS be able to designate in a very general sense? For example, a large zone of the borough of Camden could be appropriate for incinerator or transport development, factories, or some other general purpose of a strategic nature that will be decided by the mayor rather than the wishes of the people of Camden.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister was right: I do not understand what he is saying, and I do not think that many other hon. Members understand it either. I return to the lead amendment. It would delete the requirement for the UDPs to be in general conformity with the SDS and require them merely to have regard to it. It would leave the final discretion with the boroughs, provided that they can justify it at a UDP inquiry. That is not unreasonable, and it would comply with the current arrangements. We therefore seek to divide the Committee on the amendment.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 1100, in page 121, leave out lines 12 to 27.
<P>
No. 1229, in page 121, line 16, at end insert "approve or".

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Government amendents Nos. 1181, 1182, 1185 and 1183.
<P>
No. 1102, in page 121, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1D) In exercising any power of direction under subsection (1B)(a), the Mayor shall have regard to the provisions of the development plan and the spatial development strategy, so far as material to the application, and to any other material consideration.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1103, in page 121, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1E) In subsection (1B)(a), 'prescribed description' may not include any reference to the size or height of an application for planning permission within the area of the City of London, provided the height of the development proposed is 150 metres or less.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1104, in page 121, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1F) In subsection (1B)(a), 'prescribed description' may not include any development which is in accordance with the development plan.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I advise the Committee that there was a mistake in the original selection list. It stated that amendment No. 181 was to be debated--it is of course amendment No. 1181, which is a Government amendment. The lead amendment is No. 1099, which has been moved by Mr. Ottaway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> You have wisely grouped a number of amendments together, Mr. Winterton. I apologise to the Committee that it may take a few minutes to go through them all.
<P>
I turn first to amendment. No. 1099. The Bill requires neither the boroughs nor the Secretary of State to have a duty to have regard to the SDS. The amendment would require the boroughs to have regard to the SDS in determining planning applications. That would mean that the mayor's policy would be applied, along with everything else, when applications are determined, without any need for the mayor to intervene. It would expressly recognise the role of the SDS when planning applications are determined. It would also cure an omission that was described by Professor Malcolm Grant, to whom I referred earlier, as remarkable. The Minister said in an earlier intervention that there are plenty of other experts who may disagree with him.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I did not say anything of the kind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> In that case, I retract. The Minister said that there are plenty of other experts, which implied that she thought that they would disagree with Professor Grant.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> It implies that there is a variety of opinions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister says that it implies that there is a variety of opinions. Therefore, people would not be saying the same thing--that is the nature of variety. But to get back to my central point, it seems that there is a remarkable omission. I should be grateful if Ministers would tell us whether it was intentional.
<P>
Government amendment No. 1181 is especially important. It will allow the Secretary of State to instruct boroughs to ignore directions from the mayor to refuse planning permission. The direction of power on applications of strategic importance will now work as follows. A borough will resolve to grant planning permission, the mayor will direct that borough to refuse planning permission, and then the borough will be prohibited from refusing permission for a set period while the Secretary of State decides whether to intervene. Finally, the Secretary of State can exercise his discretion to prohibit the borough from acting on the mayor's direction, thus allowing it to issue permission. Most people would agree that that is a highly complex procedure. A simpler way of resolving such issues is found in our amendment No. 1100, which would delete the direction power, thus allowing the mayor to be a consultee on planning applications. The boroughs could receive and consider his views if he did not like their decision.
<P>
The clause as structured will lead to uncertainty and confusion. There are already two variables in planning applications--the local authority and the Secretary of State. This proposal adds a third, which may well be the most unpredictable. For example, the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) unashamedly and openly declared that he would use his planning powers to support his political view point. That is not an unreasonable position for him to take, but it illustrates what might happen. I am referring to an interview with the hon. Gentleman in the Estates Gazette on 12 December.
<P>
Developers have strongly opposed this power. David Ashcroft of Delta (UK) Land Development said that additional bureaucracy impedes competitiveness and that it was difficult enough to attract overseas investors. The added uncertainty that another potential planning step brings with it would make it harder still.
<P>
The circumstances in which the mayor can intervene in planning applications are not set out in the Bill; they are to be defined by development order. Amendment No. 1101 would confine the power to intervene to applications that raised matters of strategic importance to Greater London. Further limits can be imposed by the devolpment order.
<P>
Amendment No. 1102 is important. At present, the mayor is not obliged to consider any particular matters when directing refusal. The amendment would oblige him to have regard to the UDP, the SDS and all other material considerations in deciding whether to direct refusal. He must consider all the material submitted and all planning aspects of the application. He cannot refuse simply because of one particular policy aspect.
<P>
Amendment No. 1103 relates to the scope of the mayor's powers. A few weeks ago, the Minister helpfully set out the criteria by which the mayor will derive those powers. The amendment would provide that the mayor should not intervene if the height of a development is less than 150 m. The gap is closing--the original figure was 50 m, but the Minister amended it in a Parliamentary answer to 75 m. I will not push this amendment to a Division. I am glad that the Minister moved a bit, albeit not enough. Such restrictions decide whether a developer goes ahead with a development; they affect investment and hence employment decisions. Planning powers have a great impact on such matters.
<P>
On amendment No. 1104, there are no limits in current legislation on the power to direct refusal. The amendment would prevent the mayor from directing the refusal of any application that accorded with the development plan.
<P>
The amendments before us would remove much bureaucracy from the planning process. They would simplify it and make it easier to understand--the Minister and I share the desire that it should be simplified. In the circumstances, I will be most interested to hear his response to our proposals.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I should mention that there are Government amendments in the group of amendments before us. If I am in the Chair at the appropriate time, I will call the Minister towards the end of the debate so that he can respond to it and talk to the Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall speak to some of the amendments and use the opportunity to raise concerns about the subsections to which they relate.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was absolutely right to request a flow chart on decision making for the part of the Bill that we are now considering. The Bill will undoubtedly put in place a confusing set of processes to govern planning decisions in London. Elected members of local authorities and the officers who advise them would find information on those processes immensely beneficial. Developers and others who make applications to planning authorities for planning permission would also find it useful to have a clear understanding of them. It is incumbent on the Government, at an early stage, to translate the detailed text and explanations into something that can be readily picked up in flow-chart form so that people can understand how the provisions will work in practice.
<P>
On the amendments, one of the issues that the hon. Member for Croydon, South raised related to the mayor having to have regard to the boroughs' development plans and the SDS when taking planning decisions--that is dealt with in amendment No. 1102. Liberal Democrat Members take the same approach as the hon. Gentleman. We strongly take the view that the mayor must take into account some material considerations when forming a view on the issuance of guidance and direction to a local planning authority.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the next issue that I want to raise. Clause 51(10) deals with the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents in relation to the assembly. It contains a provision that means that staff who are appointed by the mayor for political purposes and to advise him or her on general issues do not have to give evidence or produce documents that relate to the advice that they gave the mayor. I want to clarify that issue because one or two organisations outside this place have flagged it as a concern. The provision in clause 51(10) could mean that the advice that leads the mayor to issue a direction to a planning authority to refuse permission would never become public. Under the process before us, the local authority is placed in the situation of having to defend the decision on appeal. The advice that the mayor takes when giving a direction will be vital in the case that the local authority has to argue.
<P>
Clause 237(9) refers to the ability to modify
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any provision of this Act relating to an appeal against a refusal of planning permission".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Presumably, that provision allows the Government to evolve the system, to learn the lessons from the mayor's early mistakes and rewrite the provisions. However, it would be far better to make the Bill clearer now as to how the mayor can exercise his power to direct refusals.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> We have discussed advisers to the mayor. If the mayor directs refusal, it is within the boroughs' remit to go to the Secretary of State. The mayor will also be required to give reasons for directing refusal; if there is any conflict of opinion on those reasons, it will be open to the conflictee to go to judicial review. The hon. Gentleman paints a bleaker picture than will ever occur.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The Minister may be right to say that we are testing the Bill--perhaps to destruction on this point. Importantly, the Minister says that the matter would ultimately be determined by judicial review. That gives rise to concern that the planning process will ultimately be resolved in the courts. I know that material considerations and so on are ultimately defined in the courts--the Minister has been at great pains to stress that point in previous debates. Nevertheless, it would be better if the clause was clear from the outset about the limits on the mayor's exercise of the power.
<P>
That is why amendment No. 1102, which would require the Mayor specifically to have regard to the borough's development plan and the SDS in issuing directions, ought to be accepted by the Government. Leaving the provision entirely general, even given the obligation on the mayor to publish his or her reasons for issuing directions, is entirely inadequate, given that the boroughs will be required to frame their UDPs in general conformity with the SDS.
<P>
Amendment No. 1099--the lead amendment--is interesting. I suspect that the hon. Member for Croydon, South will have difficulty persuading some of his colleagues to support it. It cuts to the core of some of our debates so far on this part of the Bill. If it were adopted, the planning framework would no longer be decided from the bottom up. It would require the boroughs to have regard to the SDS when determining planning permission. That would ensure that the boroughs took the SDS into account, just as they do regional planning guidance, PPGs and so on.
<P>
Last Thursday and today, I listened to the hon. Member for Ruislip--Northwood advancing a new Conservative view of planning, which is totally different to the view of the Conservative party when in government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> We are looking forward now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am told that the Conservatives are looking forward now. I do not know what they are looking forward to, because I do not think that there is good news for them. The Conservatives betray an interesting lack of recognition of the existing planning framework--many of the clauses in this part of the Bill are drafted from legislation enacted by the previous Government. While we support amendment No. 1099, because it is important that the boroughs should have regard for the SDS in determining applications, I look forward to hearing how some Conservative members of the Committee will square the amendment with their utterances so far.
<P>
My final question relates to the mayor's power to direct a refusal. My hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to costs, which were mentioned by other hon. Members. My Question can be best asked with reference to the amendments before us.
<P>
In specific circumstances, the mayor will direct the boroughs to refuse planning permission. An appeal could then be lodged and an appeal process begin. The Bill is unclear about who ultimately bears any costs awarded by an inspector against a local authority for refusing planning permission.
<P>
I spoke about the matter on Second Reading, when it did not seem to cause great concern to Ministers who did not respond in their winding-up speeches. Now that we are debating the meaning of clause 237, I hope that the Ministers will specifically answer my question--where do the costs fall? I do not believe that the mayor should be granted the power to direct refusal. If he has that power, he should pick up the tab when his judgment is wrong and a planning inspector overturns a local authority decision that he has directed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to an amendment that the Committee has not yet reached. It seeks to change the clause that we will debate next. I trust that he will terminate his remarks about the matter forthwith.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Winterton. As you rightly say, amendment No. 1105 deals with the mayor's involvement in planning inquiries.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, looking at the Bill and at the amendment, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that he appears to be speaking to amendment No. 1106, which relates to clause 238. He is perhaps speaking to a bit of each but, in any event, debate on both will come later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Duly instructed, I shall move on and away from that subject. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response at the appropriate time.
<P>
The clause belongs to a part of the Bill under which the boroughs and the mayor will rub against each other more than anywhere else, because of the way the relationships between the boroughs and the GLA will operate. As the SDS is not the same as a county structure plan, the provisions have to be got right, and they should lay down a clear set of procedures. The clause does not do that, Liberal Democrats support amendments Nos. 1099 and 1102, but we have reservations about some of the other amendments, especially that tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, which appears completely to contradict some of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> It is an extremely happy chance that you, Mr. Winterton, have invited me to speak immediately after a calumny was placed upon me by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. In our previous sitting, I tabled an amendment in the spirit of the Bill--it sought to assert the paramountcy of the mayor in strategic planning matters. The Minister for London and Construction told me that my amendment was not necessary, and saved me from conflict with my colleagues.
<P>
I should still like to speak to amendment No. 1229, and my remarks are reinforced by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, London First and the British Property Federation. All those organisations are in my constituency, and their point of view should be represented in our discussion. I do not know whether other Committee members have seen the letter that the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors sent to Mr. Simon Cox of the Government office for London on 15 October last year in response to the consultation on planning applications of strategic importance and categories of development on which the mayor should be consulted. I shall quote a paragraph from it. It states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In a similar vein, the RICS is concerned that the mayor will be unable to act proactively enough to help attract inward investment into London. Under the proposals, where a London borough turns down a planning application there is little that the mayor can do other than support an appeal to the Secretary of State. The planning authority will still be the borough. This may deter major inward investors from making planning applications if they feel that it will require a lengthy appeal process."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
He then continues in heavy type--the Hansard transcript will obviously not do so.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We therefore advocate that the mayor be given more proactive powers to recommend that the boroughs approve developments of a strategic nature, particularly for those with major employment potential. It would be made clear that such recommendations would carry considerable weight with the Secretary of State when appeals were made to him, a fact which the boroughs would have to take into account in their initial consideration of the application."<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
The actual wording of my brief amendment does not specifically address the point that the RICS was making. However, the spirit and the thrust of what I was saying is present.
<P>
I shall also cite an observation by the British Property Federation, which stated in its summary of key points on planning applications of strategic importance to London:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are disappointed to see that the mayor is apparently to be regarded as a Development Controller, whose powers are essentially negative and restrictive rather than aimed at promoting and achieving a vision."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mayor should be able to take a positive position on strategic issues rather than purely a negative one. I note the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam's comment that I should not be speaking for the official Opposition were I to express this view. Nevertheless, I do express it and believe that it is worthy of a response.

<P>

<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I begin by addressing the points that were made by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster on behalf of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. The RICS appears to be arguing for a power on the mayor's behalf to overturn a negation of permission for development by the boroughs. That strikes at the heart of the Bill's proposals. Despite the undoubted powers that will be invested in the mayor by the people of London, the desired outcomes of his strategies will, in virtually every instance, be dependent on close working relationships, co-operation and consultation between the mayor and the boroughs and many other relevant bodies. Therefore, a situation in which the mayor could arbitrarily discount the kinds of considerations, consultations and representations that have been made to boroughs for a specific planning approval does not seem to me to be the best way forward.
<P>
I am not convinced that appeal processes are necessarily lengthy, nor do I think that it would be right, merely on the basis of the argument that the RICS has put forward, to change the balance in this way. We have suffered for far too long, not only in London but all over the country, from developers attempting to play off one local authority against.the other. Serious inroads have been made into precious land, which could have been put to better purposes, by use of the argument, "If I do not get planning permission here, I will move five miles down the road where I am pretty much guaranteed to get it."
<P>
I pointed out during an earlier debate that mayoral decisions and strategies must fall within overarching national policies. Regional development will have to be part and parcel of the strategy. That will move us away from the situations that we have seen in the past whereby developers opted for a beggar-your-neighbour approach, which put undue pressure on many local authorities. We have suffered from the consequences of that for a considerable time. We are now having to readdress the issues, not least how land use planning must be considered with regard to creating proper transport infrastructures.
<P>
I turn to the good news about amendment No. 1102. I trust that the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Sutton and Cheam will regard what I am about to say as good news. The amendment would require the mayor to have regard to the provisions of the borough's development plan and to the SDS in exercising any powers that the Secretary of State may give to the mayor.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hate to stand in the way of good news, but it is 1 pm and I must adjourn the Committee. Papers and documents will be safe in the Room, which will be locked after the last Member has vacated it and opened again just before 4.30 pm.
