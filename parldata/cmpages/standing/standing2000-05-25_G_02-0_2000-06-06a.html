<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I trust that hon. Members have returned refreshed and will find the surroundings in this Room slightly more congenial than the Room in which we were previously incarcerated. I have asked for the blinds to be lifted on the basis that, in midsummer, it is better to work by daylight than by Stygian gloom. However, if any Committee members find that there is a problem, we can have the blinds drawn again. Similarly, I asked for the windows to be left open for a short time so that we might be able to breathe fresh air. Again, if anyone is cold, please say so, and I shall ask the Officers of the House to put that right.

<P>
I remind the Committee that a financial resolution is attached to the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I should also remind hon. Members that adequate notice must be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I will not call starred amendments, including any amendments that are reached during the afternoon sitting of the Committee.

<P>
At the first sitting, I said that I was minded to take the view that new clauses 3 to 19, which deal with the establishment of a children's rights commissioner, fall outside the scope of the Bill. I have given that matter further consideration and taken advice, and I can confirm that neither I nor my co-Chairman will select the new clauses for debate. I hope that taking the unusual step of making this announcement so early in our proceedings will be helpful. Of course, any hon. Member may seek advice or information on that matter, or, indeed, on any other matter, from myself or the Clerk outside the Committee and, as usual, we shall endeavour to be as helpful as possible.

<P>
Members will see from the selection list that I have selected the amendment to the order of consideration motion, but I first call the Minister to move the motion.

<P>
Motion made, and Question proposed,

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 68, Schedule 2, Clauses 69 to 102, new Clauses, Schedule 1, Schedules 3 to 5, new Schedules--<P>
</UL></FONT>[Mr. Hutton.]<P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I beg to move, as an amendment to the motion, in line 2, leave out from beginning to 'Schedules' and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'6, Schedules 1, Clauses 7 to 20, Clauses 23 to 68, Schedule 2 Clauses 69 to 102, Clauses 21 and 22, new Clauses.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Thank you, Mr. Gale, for your comments about the blinds. One of the things that I find slightly disconcerting about these Committees in summer is looking at a Minister in profile only, which is the inevitable  consequence of the sun coming in through the windows, so when I am seated I have to imagine what the expression on the Minister's face might be, unless he turns around so that I can actually see him.

<P>
I want to make a couple of explanatory points about the amendment to the order of consideration motion. First, many amendments have been tabled to the Bill and many have been selected for debate, and I am sure that many more will be tabled during the course of the Committee. Many of the amendments do not relate to great issues of fundamental concern, but deal with minor points that require clarification. They are mostly tidying-up and clarification exercises, and I envisage that we shall have a series of short debates, which are more like question and answer sessions, on those matters. I also envisage that the pace will vary considerably during the course of the Committee, because, in two or three areas, we will want to consider at length issues of more fundamental concern, which are likely to slow up our proceedings. It is also probably worth mentioning that the early clauses of the Bill tend to take a relatively long time to discuss, simply because issues of general importance are inevitably aired in the early stages. I say that for the comfort of the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson), who might otherwise start to feel that inadequate progress was being made. I hope that we will all share the desire to move rapidly through the areas in which simple clarifications are required and in which simple points need probing, focusing our time on the major debates in which issues of principle are at stake.

<P>
With that aim in mind, the amendment would do two things. First, it would re-insert schedule 1 where it belongs in the chronology of the Bill. It would be considered after clause 6, which gives effect to the schedule. I note that schedule 2 is properly inserted after clause 68 in the motion, which is where it belongs logically. I seek clarification from the Minister as to why he feels it necessary to leave schedule 1 out of sequence and to put it at the end of the order of consideration. An understanding of the structure and organisation of the National Care Standards Commission is required. The debate on schedule 1 will give us that understanding.

<P>
The logic behind the motion may be that the Government expect to have to make further substantial changes to the schedule. If that it is the case, the Minister might give us an idea of where there is still concern. Failing that, the logical and proper place for consideration of schedule 1 would be after consideration of clause 6.

<P>
Secondly, the amendment would take clauses 21 and 22 out of the chronological sequence and place them at the end. The Committee is likely to wish to spend time on those two clauses, which will give rise to serious issues of principle, requiring considerable probing of the Government's intention.

<P>
Clause 21 deals with the regulatory regime to be imposed on establishments and agencies. The Committee will deliberate that framework clause without the benefit of draft regulations or even an indication from the Government of their scope and intention. In suggesting the postponement of the discussion of those clauses for a couple of weeks, I wonder, perhaps more in hope than in expectation, whether the Minister might seize the opportunity to bring forward a rough draft regulatory framework. If he did, the Committee could have an idea of the scope of the regulations that the Government have in mind.

<P>
In many respects, clause 21 goes to the heart of the provisions for regulating private hospitals. If regulations covering all establishments under the reach of those provisions are to be brought forward as a single statutory instrument, the House will have precisely one and a half hours in a Delegated Legislation Standing Committee to consider the detailed regulatory regimes to be imposed on children's homes, hospitals, care homes, independent medical agencies and independent clinics. It seems to me and to many people outside the House that that would be insufficient time to consider a fundamental aspect of the legislation. Our concerns could be easily assuaged if the Government at least gave the scope of the regulations at this stage so that we could consider what was intended when we debate the clause.

<P>
We could extract such information rather painfully. We could ask the Minister lengthy series of questions by tabling substantial numbers of probing amendments to clause 21. We could seek to limit the scope of regulations and draw out the Government's innermost intentions and current thoughts. However, if parliamentary scrutiny is to mean anything, we must have an idea of the scope and impact of the regulations.

<P>
I suspect that the situation for clause 22 is even more dire because we will not have the opportunity to consider its secondary provisions in a Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation. Instead, the relevant Minister will issue a statement of minimum standards after consulting the appropriate people, but that will not be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It would not be true to say that we have no idea of the Government's intentions. The Centre for Policy on Ageing document "Fit for the Future?" was widely circulated and set many hares running. The Minister made it clear on Second Reading that it would be unwise and premature for people outside the House to draw any conclusions on the Government's final intentions for minimum standards by examining the broad scope of the proposals in the CPA document. In a Westminster Hall debate a couple of months ago, the Minister moderately clarified the scope of the minimum standards, but as several hon. Members said on Second Reading, the sector is blighted. Capital providers--banks and other lenders--are sitting on their hands. No money is available to improve the care homes sector. It cannot be the Government's intention to starve the sector of capital so that improvements cannot be made and new facilities cannot be built, but that is what is happening.

<P>
The Minister has the opportunity to spell out in more detail the extent of the Government's thinking on the scope of the minimum standards and the time scale involved. By setting parameters, the industry will be able to understand their intentions now, not six, eight, nine or 12 months down the line when regulations are published or statements made. I hope that, at a stroke, the Minister will be able to unblight the industry and free up the supply of capital to providers who are anxious to make improvements and implement building or modification programmes. The purpose of clause 22 is, after all, to ensure that standards of quality are properly complied with and widely available throughout the sector. I am sure the Minister would agree that continuous new investment is necessary to achieve adequate standards. That acknowledgment, however, would sit oddly with the Government's decision to allow the sector to continue to be blighted and starved of capital funds.

<P>
I implore the Minister to take up the challenge, to defer consideration of those two important clauses, and to use the intervening time to put into a from that is appropriate for circulation to Committee members the drafts that are circulating in his Department. We must hope that the Minister does not propose to make such statements and regulations without having a clear idea of their scope. I hope that he will take the opportunity of a delay of a couple of weeks to compile the document in draft form, accepting that it will not be definitive, and circulate it to the Committee, enabling us to conduct informed debates on clauses 21 and 22. Proper information will enable us to do our job of scrutinising the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. David Amess (Southend, West):</B> I should like briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond). As we discovered last year when deliberating on another Bill, the Government are increasingly operating shambolically. I hope that the Minister listened carefully to my hon. Friend, who spent a long time considering how we attend to the detail of the Bill. Given that the Government do not have their act together in that respect, the delay that he has asked for would help them. As the Minister knows, the issues involved are very real, particularly in my constituency. I hope for a consensual acceptance of my hon. Friend's sensible suggestion for reordering consideration of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton):</B> Under the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge schedule 1 would be considered after debate on clause 6, which the hon. Gentleman said was appropriate because the schedule establishes the constitution of the National Care Standards Commission. The difficulty with his argument is that, as I am sure he will know, the schedule goes much wider than that. We felt that the logical and natural sequence of the Committee's proceedings would be to debate the schedule, which also relates to the establishment of the General Social Care Council and the Care Council for Wales, after all the relevant clauses have been debated. I understand the hon. Gentleman's friendly intentions but I think that our proposal is logical.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge contradicted himself in his arguments about clauses 21 and 22. If I followed correctly, he criticised the Government for putting debate on schedule 1 out of context, but that would be the effect of deferring consideration of clauses 21 and 22 to the end. Those clauses are integral to part II, which establishes the new regulatory arrangements for care homes. The hon. Gentleman's arguments are inconsistent. The essence of the concern felt by the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) was that we would debate clauses 21 and 22 without knowing enough about the Government's intentions with respect to "Fit for the Future?" I am more than happy to ensure that the Committee can be properly briefed on that. It is very kind of the hon. Gentlemen to try to help the Government, but we do not need the benefit of the proposed delay. By the time we reach clauses 21 and 22--or, I hope, well before then--we shall be able to share with the Committee some of the detailed thinking that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has asked for. On the basis of the points I have made, I hope that the Committee will not support the amendment to the order of consideration motion, and that the hon. Gentleman will feel confident to withdraw it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Let us hope that we are getting off to a flying start in the manner in which we hope to continue. I am reassured by what the Minister says. I can see that there could be a genuine difference of interpretation, but I accept the Minister's reasoned, rational argument that schedule 1 would be better considered in a certain place, and I am quite prepared to defer to that view.

<P>
I am greatly reassured by what the Minister said about clause 22. I accept his admonition that there is something slightly inconsistent in our proposal to consider clauses 21 and 22 out of the chronological sequence. My concern was that clauses 21 and 22 are currently empty boxes, but they are such an important part of the Bill that we must have something in those boxes before we can properly scrutinise them. I am greatly reassured by his intention to outline the scope of the Government's current thinking on clause 22 when we come to that clause, and I look forward to that very much.

<P>
I was disappointed that he did not say anything about clause 21. Perhaps he could similarly give some outline of the current thinking on the regulations to be brought forward under clause 21. However, I hope that he will extend the spirit of what he said about clause 22 to embrace clause 21. In the light of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Resolved,

<P>
That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 68, Schedule 2, Clauses 69 to 102, new Clauses, Schedule 1, Schedules 3 to 5, new Schedules.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first amendment, those Members who have served on Committees that I have chaired before will be aware that I am ordinarily perfectly happy to have a wide-ranging debate at the start of a clause on the understanding that the Committee can have a stand part debate only once. We either have it at the beginning or at the end. That is for hon. Members to decide, but I do not expect to her repetitive arguments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Before we begin, may I raise one question and seek your guidance on the regular appraisals that are published in connection with Bills. In the explanatory notes to the Bill, on page 53 and running on to page 54, reference is made to a summary of the regulatory impact assessment. It points out that there will be two financial impacts of the Bill that will place burdens on business: the regulatory fees that will be payable and the compliance costs of this legislation. We do not have to spend very much time worrying about the regulatory fees. However, the Government have so far been completely silent on their estimates of cost. One of the great concerns outside this House about the Bill is that it is going to impose a very substantial burden of compliance cost. We do not know whether the Government are proposing that the public purse should meet that cost. We do not know what estimate the Government have made of the total cost. Only the Government can know that because only the Government know what the regulations are going to be.

<P>
I wonder, Mr. Gale, whether you could give me some guidance on the requirements of a regulatory impact assessment. Are you quite satisfied that the regulatory impact assessment that has been published in relation to the Bill is sufficient to meet those purposes and sufficient for members of the Committee to be able adequately to scrutinise the real impact of the Bill?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order from the Chair, as the hon. Gentleman is aware. I have allowed him to have his say in order that the Minister may hear what he has to say. The explanatory notes and their contents are entirely a matter for the Government. The House has no input into how they are framed. If the Minister wishes to write to the hon. Gentleman in response to what he has said, then I am sure he will do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Thank you very much Mr. Gale, and I will certainly try to deal with the hon. Gentleman's concerns in the usual way. Obviously we will want to keep the Committee as well informed as we can about the issues that he has raised.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>

<H4><center>Children's homes</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 37, in page 1, line 8, leave out 'This section has' and insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'Subsections (2) to (6) have'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 38, 40, 47, 48 and 50 to 55.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This group of amendments relates to the definition of a children's home in the clause and makes a series of consequential amendments. The amendments make it clear that an establishment providing care and accommodation for children is not a children's home if it provides foster care as defined by the Children Act 1989, as amended by the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 37 is purely technical and has no effect on the meaning of the clause. No one would expect a home run by a parent or relative of a child to be regulated. Therefore, we do not intend the homes of foster parents to be regulated by the National Care Standards Commission. Amendment No. 38 ensures that that is the case. We define foster carers in amendment No. 40.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 47 and 48 insert the definitions of private fostering and local authority foster parents from the Children Act into the Bill. It is important to introduce the Children Act definition of private fostering into the Bill, because otherwise we could create a loophole that allowed unscrupulous people to avoid registering their establishment as a children's home by pretending to be private foster carers. That would be contrary to one of the Bill's main purposes of strengthening and improving the regulation of children's homes. Perhaps the risk is small, but we are not prepared to accept it.

<P>
All children's homes will be registered with the commission, so the Children Act description of registered homes as private homes with four or more children is no longer relevant. Amendment No. 50 clarifies the position in relation to section 63 of the Children Act. Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 ensure that the limits on the numbers of foster children set out in the Children Act also apply in the Bill. Amendment No. 52 redefines private foster carers as those who care for children in their own homes, to create a clearer distinction between private fostering and children's homes. It also provides powers to make regulations to define when a child is being cared for in a person's own home, so that we can adjust the new definition at the margins as required.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 are consequential to the changes that we are making to the relationship between children's homes and private fostering. By making those changes, we will ensure that there is no scope for confusion about when an establishment providing care and accommodation as a children's home needs to be registered as such. There will be no scope for people to manipulate the rules and claim to be foster carers to escape effective registration. The amendments do not reflect any substantive policy change. There has always been a need for a clearer distinction between a children's home and a foster home, and we have taken the opportunity presented by the Bill to provide that. It is particularly important to get the definitions right now, as the abolition of the concept of small private children's homes that need not be registered creates the potential for confusion. The amendments will prevent any such confusion from arising.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am happy to say that we have no issues of principle with the amendments. I have just one or two questions. Amendments Nos. 38, 40, 47 and 48 are designed simply to deal with the position of foster parents. They will ensure that the Bill does not trap legitimate foster parents and that loopholes are not created for anyone seeking to avoid the Bill's requirements improperly. Would it not be better simply to define "a parent" as including "a foster parent" throughout the Bill? Does the route that the Minister has chosen have any practical significance? Does it differ from that of including foster parents in the definition of parents" I hope that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) or one of his colleagues, who tabled amendment No. 56, which concerns privately fostered children, will contribute to this short debate. That would help us to understand how that amendment interfaces with the Government's approach in this group of amendments.

<P>
I have a small technical question, which may simply be a matter of procedure in amending Bills. Amendment No. 37 restricts the effectiveness of clause 1 to subsections (2) to (6), and amendment No. 40 adds a subsection to the clause. Is it the Government's intention that that subsection--it would normally be numbered subsection (7)--should not be embraced by the reference in subsection (1), or is it merely a convention about how Bills are amended, so that we can take it as read that subsection (1) would automatically be amended to read subsections (2) to (7), thus including the subsection that the Minister proposes to introduce through amendment No. 40?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I suppose that I ought to thank the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. In common with most members of the Committee, however, I am not entirely sure that I followed his argument.

<P>
I shall deal first with the definition of a parent. We are creating a necessary new regulatory framework, which we want to be consistent with existing legislation, particularly on key aspects of terminology. The hon. Gentleman's solution--to redefine "parents" to include "foster parents"--would not achieve that because other definitions of parents do not include foster parents. The hon. Gentleman's course of events would lead to two different definitions of who could be a parent, which would be neither helpful nor useful.

<P>
Our approach in tabling these technical amendments is to ensure that the definitions are consistent, not just throughout the Bill, but with the Children Act 1989. I said in my opening remarks that we were incorporating into the Bill some of the definitions of foster parents and foster carers that appear in the 1989 legislation--the most logical means of dealing with the hon. Gentleman's points.

<P>
I am not sure that I entirely understood his second point about the numbering of the subsections in clause 1 and the effect that amendment No. 37 would have on it. I am sure, however, that the amendment is consistent with technical tidying-up amendments and that we are not creating unfortunate or hazardous consequences as a result of the re-numbering. I am prepared to have another look at it, but I can assure the Committee that no inadvertent or mistaken re-numbering will result.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): I should like to make a couple of points about amendment No. 52, which deals with private fostering. My hon. Friend the Minister acted admirably in closing up the loophole that could have existed between private fostering and small residential homes. As we heard, one of the main objectives of the Bill is to end the ability to run unregistered small homes with fewer than three children.

<P>
Does my hon. Friend accept that there is manifest and considerable concern about private fostering, and that due to the lack of adequate resources, local authorities have failed to regulate and manage the sector since the Children Act 1989? Many people are worried about children being looked after by total strangers in inadequate circumstances, which gives rise to serious public concern. Amendment No. 52 talks about the possibility of regulations, but the great demand from people across the country who recognise the Government's overwhelming commitment to the protection of children is that there should be firm and effective regulations for this sector, and that people who do not comply with them should face the full force of the law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I should like briefly to respond to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Dawson), who tabled his own amendment. We shall return to it later, which might be the most appropriate time for me to reassure him about his concerns. During the Bill's passage in another place, my noble Friend Lord Hunt outlined a number of measures that the Government will take to ensure that the existing regulations relating to private fostering are properly adhered to by local authorities. We set out a number of measures that we will take in that regard later this year.

<P>
I should just remind my hon. Friend, for the sake of accuracy, that the regulation--making power to which he referred applies when a child is looked after in a foster carer's own home. It would not change the broad sweep of regulations that protect children in private foster care. There is already substantial provision to protect such children but, like him, we have concerns about the safeguarding of children in those situations. It is precisely for that reason that my noble Friend the Under-Secretary outlined the measures that we were taking, but I am sure that we will come to that amendment in due course. I hope that hon. Members have been reassured by the points that have arisen in this debate and will accept the amendment.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 38, in page 1, line 13, at end insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or by a foster parent'--[Mr. Hutton.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 2, line 7, at end add--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) a Secure Training Centre or a Local Authority Secure Unit.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
This moves us on to a different area in the definition of children's homes. As members of the Committee will know, the newly created Youth Justice Board will have responsibility for inspecting and regulating local authority secure units and secure training centres. The purpose of tabling the amendment is to explore fully whether these entities will be caught within the definition of a children's home and what the implications are for their inspection and proper regulation.

<P>
There is some genuine misunderstanding and conflicting advice on this. In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) on 25  May, the Minister appeared to say that because the definition of a children's home will not be altered by the Bill, there have been no discussions with the Home Office or the Youth Justice Board as institutions housing young offenders do not come within the definition of a children's home. I have a briefing from a well-known children's charity that opines in the opposite direction.

<P>
According to the clause, an establishment is a children's home

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if it provides care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It is not a children's home if it is

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a health service hospital; an independent hospital; a home provided ... under section 82(5) of the Children Act 1989 ... or a residential family centre.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Unless a local authority secure centre or a secure training centre is to be defined as a home provided, equipped and maintained under section 82(5) of the Children Act--I cannot see how a local authority secure unit can be such an establishment--the Bill appears to include within the definition of a children's home, a local authority secure unit whose purpose is mainly

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to provide care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The regime under which the Youth Justice Board will operate includes provision not only for dealing with security aspects and the appropriateness of the training regime. In addition, according to the Home Secretary's written answer:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Board will monitor establishments' performance--within the Prison Service, LASUs and STCs--against specific service specifications to ensure regimes are of an appropriate standard and that the well-being of the young people is being properly addressed.--[Official Report, 29 March 2000; Vol. 347, c. 138W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
In other words, the functions of the youth justice board will include dealing with the National Care Standards Commission's concerns about children's homes outside the secure training system.

<P>
We are trying to avoid a double and possibly contradictory regime of inspection and supervision, which would undermine the role of the youth justice board. I detect from the Minister's written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury and from his facial expression during my remarks that he is going to tell the Committee that the amendment is unnecessary because local authority secure units are excluded from the definition of a children's home. If that is indeed the case, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment, but it is unclear how that point follows from the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendment No. 76 would exclude from the definition of a children's home secure training centres and local authority secure units. The amendment is unnecessary and, with respect to local authority secure units, undesirable. The Bill will require local authority secure units to register as children's homes, but will not require secure training centres to register, which is the right approach.

<P>
Despite their apparent similarity, local authority secure units and secure training centres are two distinct forms of provision. Secure accommodation is provided for the purpose of restricting liberty in accordance with section 25 of the Children Act. A children's home cannot be used as secure accommodation unless the Secretary of State approves its use as such. In addition to the nominal requirements made of any children's home, an approval process for use as secure accommodation is carried out by the social services inspectorate on behalf of the Secretary of State. That is how the process currently works, I and we intend to leave that provision in place. Secure units are essentially a form of children's home for children who, for one reason or another, need to have their liberty restricted. It is right that children in such accommodation should have the protection that comes from regulation and inspection as a children's home.

<P>
On the other hand, secure training centres provide places for persistent juvenile offenders convicted of an offence serious enough to justify a custodial sentence of not less than 12 months. A child or young person subject to a secure training order or one of the new detention and training orders is detained and given training and education in preparation for release. Secure training centres are similar in many ways to young offenders institutions.

<P>
Those institutions are not currently caught by the definition of children's home contained in the Children Act because their main purpose is not to provide care and accommodation for children. Similarly, they will not be caught by the definition of children's home in clause 1.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am listening carefully to the Minister, who used the expression, "because their main purpose is not to provide care and accommodation". That is precisely the point. Subsection (2) states:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An establishment is a children's home ... if it provides care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
It does not say "if its main purpose" is to provide care and accommodation. I therefore do not understand how the Minister's argument works.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman. In response to the hon. Member for Aylesbury, I tried to make it clear that we do not want to change the definition of a children's home in this legislation. There has been no problem--such as the one identified by the hon. Gentleman--regarding young offenders institutions and secure training centres. If there were a problem, it would have surfaced by now: the Children Act is now 11 years old. The hon. Gentleman is right to probe the Government's intentions, and I am trying to clarify how the legislation will work.

<P>
There is a strong argument for including local authority secure units as part of the registration of children's homes, but the same argument does not apply to secure training centres for the reasons that I outlined. They cannot be described as centres designed to provide care and accommodation for children. They house juvenile offenders.

<P>
 Theexisting arrangements, particularly the work of the social services inspectorate in secure training centres, provide a comprehensive and adequate framework for securing children's rights and safeguards in those institutions. As I said in a written answer to the question asked by the hon. Member for Aylesbury, we have never intended to extend the requirement to register as a children's home to those juvenile offender institutions. The statutory definitions are 11 years old. There has not been a problem with that aspect of the legislation, and we are not changing that element of the requirement to register as a children's home.

<P>
However, it is right on grounds of policy and practice to ensure that local authority secure units are required in future to register as children's homes. That strikes the right balance between protecting children and recognising the functions of institutions designed to re-educate, train and equip young offenders for a life free of crime. The current legislation draws the right distinction between those two categories of institutions that look after young people.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister at least for clarifying the Government's intentions, which are now crystal clear. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury and Bamardos have misunderstood exactly what is going on. They can now respond to what the Minister has said.

<P>
The essence of the Minister's speech is that there has not been a problem in the past. However, that is not a satisfactory response to what appears to be a gap in the Bill's armour. Under subsection (2), any establishment that provides

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children,<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
unless it is specifically excluded under subsection (4), would be defined as a children's home. The Minister says that he is not changing the legislation, but in fact he is, because the definition of a children's home in the Bill is different from the definition that he read out from the Children Act. It talks about an establishment whose main purpose is the provision of care and accommodation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I must have misled the hon. Gentleman if he has drawn that conclusion. The Bill's definition of a children's home is the same as that in the Children Act, and we are not changing it. I was trying to make the point that the nature and purpose of secure training centres would not come within the existing definition of a children's home, as we understand it. There is the power to make further exceptions by regulations. If it proved necessary, we would not hesitate to use those powers to regulate to avoid the situation that the hon. Gentleman has identified.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I thank the Minister for that clarification. The record will show whether I misheard or he misquoted the Children Act, but he has made the Government's intentions clear. We might want to consider the matter again, but there is no fundamental disagreement. The question is simply whether the intended purpose is achieved.

<P>
If I were a senior member of the newly appointed Youth Justice Board, I might feel that my responsibilities were somewhat undermined by the Minister's insistence that local authority secure units, which are supposed to be monitored and regulated by that board, still need to be dealt with separately as children's homes. That seems to imply that the Youth Justice Board is not appropriately qualified

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> to ensure regimes are of an appropriate standard and that the well-being of the young people is being properly addressed. --[Official Report, 29 March 2000; Vol. 347, c. 139W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many young people are placed in secure accommodation for protective purposes? They would not fall within the remit of the Youth Justice Board, because they have never committed criminal offences, but are in secure accommodation to deal with the serious problems of running away or self-harm.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The hon. Gentleman, who knows much more than I do about the detail of such matters, is absolutely right. Perhaps we should be asking whether the Youth Justice Board should have the role that it apparently has in relation to such establishments. I am worried that there will be two bodies, with apparently overlapping responsibility for ensuring that the well-being of young people is properly addressed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman mistakes the roles and responsibilities of the Youth Justice Board and the National Care Standards Commission. My understanding is that the board is not a registration authority, unlike the commission. Therefore, it is appropriate for the responsibility for registering those secure units to rest with the commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I hear what the Minister says, and I think that we are groping towards a solution. If we feel that an issue still needs to be clarified, we will return to the matter on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 2, line 11, leave out 'An independent' and insert 'A'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 79, in page 2, line 15, after 'proprietor', insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or, in the case of a local authority-controlled or voluntary-aided school, the Governing Body'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 81, page 2 line 18, after 'proprietor' insert

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'or, in the case of a local authority-controlled or voluntary-aided school, the Governing Body'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 77 would remove the word "independent" from the subsection dealing with the definition of a school. Amendments Nos. 79 and 81 would deal with the consequences of removing that word.

<P>
The issue that I will explore is a theme that will arise again while we consider the Bill. Why is the regime concerned with independent schools only? I suspect that we will have the same debate on independent hospitals and independent clinics, so we might as well kick it off now.

<P>
It appears that the underlying assumption is private bad, public good. The notion is that services provided by the state for the public good are high quality and do not have the same potential for problems as privately provided services have. In theory, that idea has its attractions. It is arguable that a privately provided service, particularly if it is for profit, may create conflict between the interests of the provider and the interests of the public good. Superficially, I could argue that if a public entity provided such services, it would not need to be regulated because its services were provided with good intentions and therefore the outcome would be good.

<P>
Sadly, we all know that the reality is different. Whatever the intentions behind a service provided by public authorities for the public good, many conflicts of interest arise. Sometimes, providers and consumers are in conflict. The entrenched interests of people who work in or manage a service may not be entirely aligned with the interests of the users. The Government appear to have accepted the logic of that argument given the way in which they chose to treat care homes. The Bill will create a level playing field and a unified inspection, regulation and registration system, which recognises that both public and private bodies may be good, bad or indifferent. The responsibility of the Secretary of State and the devolved entities in which he invests his power is to create a proper regulatory framework to assure the public that they may feel comfortable in all sectors, because a uniform system of minimum standards, proper regulation and proper inspection will ensure that substandard accommodation or provision cannot continue unchecked.

<P>
Practical evidence does not support the idea that services provided by public authorities for the public good are faultless, or that the managerial managed approach to dealing with problems and standards within those establishments is always effective.

<P>
I am much taken by the idea that external regulation, with an appropriately light touch, is beneficial to all sectors. It is good to have a distinction between the regulatory regime and the managerial regime that seeks to run the establishment or the authority providing it. The Government have accepted that in relation to care homes. They should accept the logic of their own argument and apply it to schools, hospitals and clinics so that the regulatory and registration function is separated from the management function across the whole spectrum of care provision. Within management I include the improvement function that has been separately identified.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman argues in favour of a consistent approach between independent and public providers and has assumed that the approach in this part of the Bill is a sign of a discriminatory intent or attitude on the part of the Government towards the independent sector. Let me remind him that the distinction between independent and state-provided schools education was contained in the Children Act 1989, which was enacted by a Conservative Government.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The Minister is right. I do not know where he seeks to go, but I am seeking to move forward, looking into the 21st century and not backwards into the  last century. When we reach clause 3, I shall have generous words to say about the Government's bold step in recognising the need for a level playing field and a unified system of regulation. I am seeking now to adduce from the Minister why he feels that that logic applies to care homes but not to schools. Why does he feel that local authority or state-provided residential schools are invulnerable to the abuse and mismanagement that would be rooted out in an independent school as a result of it being registered as a children's home?

<P>
Most of us will have read the Waterhouse report, which makes it clear that local and authority and privately run homes were equally vulnerable to the problems identified in the report. I simply seek to probe the Minister on the limits of his enthusiasm for a level playing field and a unified regime. We know that it extends to care homes. I am probing him now on schools and I shall probe him later on hospitals to ensure that a regime is in place that provides protection to all young people in schools, regardless of whether they are in the independent or the local authority sector.

<P>
There is a separate concern--I say this hesitantly as I do not want to make this the main hook on which to hang the debate--about how the regime will interface with the wider agenda in relation to publicly and privately provided education. I hope that the Government will address that concern and the others that I have raised. I also hope that they will draw the conclusions of their own logical process in relation to what they propose for care homes and create an even-handed system that will apply the same regulatory regime to the probably small number of local authority residential schools that will be applied to independent schools.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge for tabling the amendment. I shall come to the meat of his argument in a minute. The Committee should be clear that when I intervened on the hon. Gentleman, I was simply trying to explain the historical lineage of the clause. Conservative Members should not regard that as reflecting any hostility towards the independent sector--of course it does not. It is simply a reaffirmation of the existing legislation, which was introduced by the hon. Gentleman's party when it was in government. The distinction between independent schools and schools maintained in the public sector was made not by us, but by his party.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has made a good point, and I am happy to tell the Committee that we accept the amendment in principle. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Perhaps we should carry on in this vein for a short while and enjoy the moment while we can.

<P>
I take it that the intention of the amendment is to bring all boarding schools into the dual registration provision requirements--that is, those in the voluntary and state sectors, as well as the independent sector. That would be a logical step towards ensuring that children in similar settings receive the same types of safeguards. While I have some concerns about the drafting of the amendment, I accept it in principle and urge my hon. Friends to do the same.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Will my hon. Friend the Minister accept my congratulations on his acceptance of the amendment? Opposition Members have hit on an important and worthy issue, and I am extremely impressed that he is generously taking that on board.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> It is nice of my hon. Friend to make those comments. I am not sure that I will be able to be so complimentary about the amendment that he has tabled. Let us wait and see.

<P>
If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to withdraw the amendment, the Government will table appropriate amendments on Report to implement its purpose and spirit.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am surprised and gratified by the Minister's response. I readily acknowledge the fallibility of the drafting; we do not, of course, have available the expertise that the Government have. If the Minister is prepared to accept the underlying principle of the amendment, it is far better that the parliamentary draftsmen should produce a correct version. I am delighted that he has engaged in the constructive spirit with which we seek to take the Committee's deliberations forward.

<P>
As you will know, Mr. Gale, because you have chaired previous Committees on which I have served, my ambition is always to table one amendment that the Government can accept. I have tabled an amendment to a later part of the Bill that would remove a wrongly-placed apostrophe, and am living in hope that they will be able to accept that at face value.

<P>
I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his comments, and look forward to reading the Government's detailed proposals on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 2, line 14, leave out 'children' and insert 'any child'.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 80, in page 2, line 17, leave out 'children' and insert 'any child'.

<P>
Government amendment No. 39.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The amendments all concern the same issue--that is, the cut-off point at which a school becomes a children's home under the 295-day provision. During the debate in the House of Lords, it was suggested that problems could arise in relation to schools where, for example, summer school activities take place on the premises or the school operates vacation activities for pupils and arranges accommodation for them, albeit away from the school. In such circumstances, schools that were not intended to be caught by the Bill would be so caught.

<P>
The Government have sought to deal with that by tabling amendment No. 39, which introduces another four lines of text to make it clear that at least one child must be provided with accommodation for period greater than 295 days. It will not be sufficient for different children to be given accommodation at the school at different times for a total of 296 days a year. In the House of Lords, Baroness Hollis, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, said that such a change was unnecessary and the clause as drafted was perfectly clear. However, the Government have thought again and decided that it does need clarification. If I may be so bold, I suggest that the Government's aim would be more economically achieved by deleting the word "children" and replacing it with the words "any child". That would clearly distinguish between on-going provision for children, and for a specific child.

<P>
<B>Mr. Steve McCabe </B>(Birmingham, Hall Green): In the interests of economy, I want to establish whether that is true. If the word "children" were replaced with the words "any child", would not amendment No. 82 need to be altered to make it clear that the provision is not intended to cover the children of employees, caretakers and so on? The change that the hon. Gentleman proposes would not prove economical; rather, it would require additional wording.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I disagree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. Amendment No. 82 is a separate issue that Government amendment No. 39 does not address, and it needs to be dealt with separately. The aim of amendment No. 39 and amendments Nos. 78 and 80 is to make it clear that there must be a child--any child--who receives accommodation for more than 295 days a year. That is what the Government--and I--are trying to achieve. In so far as anyone in this place is taught anything, I have always been taught that a Bill's purpose should be secured through the minimum possible alteration and wording. Perhaps I have overlooked something and the Minister is going to tell me that his wording will achieve an end that mine would not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> I want to question how the figure of 295 days was reached. If we accept the generous interpretation that a sensible Opposition amendment seeks to reinforce the principle that children need protection in any setting, should not protection also be extended to children who attend residential schools for periods that are substantial, but less than 295 days? Even if children who are in residential schools for 38 weeks a year were to attend during each of those weekends, they would be in attendance for only 266 days. Does not the figure of 295 days therefore threaten to exclude the vast majority of children who attend residential schools, whether private or local authority, from the important protection that the Bill will offer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I shall respond briefly to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre. I should make it clear that we are talking about a requirement to register as a children's home, rather than ensuring that proper inspection arrangements exist in relation to boarding school provision, for example.

<P>
My hon. Friend will be aware that part VII contains provisions for the welfare inspection of all boarding schools. His concern about children not benefiting from effective inspection arrangements may be unfounded. We are concerned to ensure appropriate safeguards and the highest possible quality of care and accommodation for children in all residential settings. He is right in general terms. When one examines the ancestry of the provisions, the reference to 295 days was, as I understand it, a reference to the academic year. One could argue about the arithmetic, but that is the origin of the 295-day reference in the existing legislation, which we shall not change in relation to this provision.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, in speaking to amendments Nos. 78 and 80, largely made the points that I would have made. I have no need to repeat them. The Government accept the need to clarify the provisions in this part of the Bill. It was not our intention to require boarding schools to register as children's homes simply because they were providing holiday camps during the school holidays. Government amendment No. 39 will clarify the meaning of the Bill in that respect.

<P>
I do not want to get tribal about this, but I shall probably end up by saying that I prefer my amendment to that of the hon. Gentleman, prompting the response: "What a surprise. He would say that, wouldn't he?" I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a vote. Having taken proper advice from parliamentary counsel and from our officials, we feel that our amendment is the right one to clarify the matter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dawson:</B> Does my hon. Friend accept that it seems strange to have different standards for registration and inspection? If we do not ally the criteria for registered establishments and those that receive statutory inspections, we shall create grey areas. We do not need those in these circumstances.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not think that we are creating any grey areas. Our amendment will provide greater clarity as to when a boarding school--whether independent or not--might also need to register as a children's home. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we need to avoid grey areas; our amendment will achieve that.

<P>
We must ensure that we impose obligations on boarding schools to register as children's homes only when it is absolutely necessary as an essential element in safeguarding the welfare and interests of the children. On examining the wide range of measures in the Bill and beyond to protect the interests of children in boarding schools, I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree that a sufficient range of protection exists. We are dealing with a very specific requirement to register as a children's home, and I am sure that he has strong views about that. We feel that we should insist on that obligation to register only when it is absolutely necessary, and essential to safeguarding the interests of children. We do not accept that point in relation to these units.

<P>
We are trying to clarify the intention behind the legislation and its application. We want to avoid circumstances arising, perhaps by accident, in which a requirement could inadvertently be placed on an institution to register as a children's home because holiday camp activities were taking place there during the school holidays. That is the purpose of the amendment. I hope that my hon. Friends will be satisfied that the Bill extends the inspection arrangements effectively into boarding schools, especially through the National Care Standards Commission, which will also have a wider remit in relation to children's homes. Its expertise will be brought to bear in circumstances such as these.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will agree that my amendment is bigger than his, and therefore not press his to a vote. We accept the point that he made, and the points made in another place about the need for clarity in this part of the Bill. We believe that Government amendment No. 39 achieves that greater clarity, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There is no doubt that the Minister's amendment is bigger than mine. That was precisely my objection to it. However, this is not a tribal issue. I had already drafted my amendments before I saw the Government amendment, and my purpose in tabling them was simply to probe the Government on whether there was a distinction between what they wanted to do and what I wanted to do. The Minister has made it clear that the purpose is the same. The Minister prefers his inelegant phraseology to my economical and elegant version, and so, conceding that style is nothing and substance is all, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 82 in page 2, line 20, at end add--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'( ) Reference in subsection (6) above to provision of accommodation for children shall not include accommodation provided for the children of employees of the school as incidental to accommodation provided to those employees.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The hon. Member for Hall Green referred to this amendment in an earlier intervention. I do not believe that Government amendment No. 39 covers this small but significant situation. The Bill makes no distinctions between children accommodated in a school. It requires only that a single child be housed for more than 295 days in accommodation provided or arranged by a school for it to qualify as a children's home.

<P>
I am certain that it is not the Government's intention that the presence of the child of a master who lives in school-provided accommodation should define the school as a children's home. The point of the amendment is to make it absolutely clear that children who are living at the establishment incidentally to the provision of accommodation to their parents, as employees of that establishment, should not be included in the head count when we are deciding whether children are being accommodated for more than 295 days a year. As the Bill stands, a school could find that it has become a children's home, simply because one child--the headmaster's child--lives there for 365 days a year.

<P>
There is no obvious power in the clause to deal with such an anomaly through regulations. If he is not minded to accept the amendment, could the Minister reassure us that it is not the Government's intention to catch a school in that way and explain how the Government will make that clear?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I will not be able to recommend that the Committee accept the amendment. Although the hon. Gentleman has raised a perfectly reasonable point, his amendment is unnecessary. The hon. Gentleman is concerned that the requirement to register as a children's home could be triggered inadvertently, simply because a member of staff lived on the site with his or her children. That cannot happen, and the Bill explains why:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An establishment is not a children's home--<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
and cannot be considered to be one--

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>merely because a child is cared for and accommodated there by a parent or relative.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
 There is no question of the children of staff who live in private family accommodation on a school site being included in the number of children considered to be staying more than 295 days.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Is the Minister certain that a child in that situation would be regarded as being accommodated by his parent and not by the person who provides the housing?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is an important question of fact, and it would depend on the accommodation provided for the child. If the child of a member of the teaching staff of a school was accommodated as a boarder, it would be appropriate to include him or her in the decision on whether the school should register as a children's home. In the example given by the hon. Gentleman, in which a teacher or other employee lives with his or her children in a family setting on the school site, there is no question of those children being included in the number of children who are accommodated by the school beyond the 295-day period. When a parent or relative looks after a child at home, that home is not construed to be a children's home. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. It is certainly not our intention inadvertently to trigger the requirement for a school to register as a children's home in those circumstances. The amendment is unnecessary, because the definition of a children's home would exclude that as a possibility in the first place.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am not convinced that the situation that I have described is excluded by the wording of the Bill, but the important thing is that the Minister has expressed his clear intention, which sends the appropriate message to any over-zealous inspector or regulator. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am satisfied that the matters arising from clause 1 have been sufficiently debated during our discussion on the amendments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> There are one or two points that have not been covered by the amendments, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to put those points briefly to the Minister.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> The main point that I want to raise is whether the Minister is satisfied that no institutions will be excluded from the net because they fail the "wholly or mainly" test. Clause 1(2) provides:

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An establishment is a children's home ... if it provides care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Is the Minister satisfied that there are no residential institutions that provide mainly for an adult population but which also provide for some children, which should be regulated by the Bill, but will not fall within the definition of a children's home because of the way in which the Bill is drafted?

<P>
I am pleased to say that I am the patron of an establishment in my constituency called White Lodge. That establishment provides day accommodation for adults with learning difficulties and active therapy for children who suffer from cerebral palsy, but it also provides some overnight respite care for those children. I wonder how that sort of hybrid establishment will be treated under the Bill. That is just one example and I am sure that there are others. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify how establishments that fall under different definitions will be dealt with in the Bill. Will he also say whether he is sure that every establishment that should be included is included, and that no establishment will sneak under the wire because it does not wholly or mainly provide accommodation for children?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Briefly, the clause is an important part of the Bill, especially because it removes a significant loophole in the existing framework of registration of small children's homes. In future, all children's homes, irrespective of size, will be required to be registered and inspected by the National Care Standards Commission. That will provide an important additional safeguard for children. If I understood the hon. Gentleman's description of White Lodge correctly, I imagine that that institution would be required to register as a children's home, but I am happy to explore that in more detail if the hon. Gentleman wants to pursue the matter. However, I am confident that the Bill has been drafted in such a way as to contain no loopholes. The whole purpose of the Bill is to close loopholes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister explain to the Committee why it has been necessary to exclude a home provided by a Minister under section 82(5) of the Children Act 1989?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> That is a technical question, on which I am happy to correspond with the hon. Gentleman. My understanding is that the measure is broadly the same as the provision contained in the Children Act 1989, but I stand ready to be corrected by my officials--I sense activity. I do not know the answer to that question, but I will let the hon. Gentleman have it as soon as possible.

<P>
We are satisfied that there are no loopholes that would result in some institutions or establishments falling outside the definition of a children's home for the purposes of clause 1. We have the power to make regulations, as the hon. Gentleman knows. The system of registration will be comprehensive and will encompass all institutions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am reassured by the Minister's remarks, although they appear to contradict subsection (2). The Minister has said that, although White Lodge provides care and accommodation not wholly or mainly for children. but in conjunction with other activities, it will be required to register as a children's home. That is probably correct. If the Minister is informing me that an establishment that provides children with accommodation, but not wholly or mainly, will be required to register at least in respect of the accommodation provided to children, then I am reassured.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman has asked me to state whether the particular establishment will be registered as a children's home and I am not in position to do so definitely. I can reassure him that the definition of children's homes in earlier legislation is essentially being carried over, subject to the removal of the identified loopholes. The thrust of the clause is to cast the net as wide as necessary to ensure that establishments providing care and accommodation wholly or mainly for children are covered by the registration obligations. We are ready to consider the issues again to ensure that all the relevant institutions are covered. The Bill contains regulatory powers. We will ensure that the scope of the clause is as wide as necessary.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 2, line 22, leave out subsection (2).

<P>
No. 75, in Title, line 3, leave out first 'independent'.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> We now come to the second area where I will probe the Government on the distinction between independent and public provision. The Minister, in generously conceding the point in regard to schools, has reinforced the points that I will be raising. The Government acknowledge that all schools providing accommodation for more than 295 days ought to be dealt with under a unified regime, as should all care homes. Amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 75--the last being a consequently amendment to the title of the Bill--would eliminate the artificial distinction made between independent hospitals and NHS hospitals for the purposes of the Bill. That is a core issue. I would want to tackle the underlying assumption that independent hospitals must be regulated while NHS hospitals should not.

<P>
A two-part proposition underlies this area of the Bill. I agree with the first part, that independent hospitals need to be regulated. Previously, I took up the case of a constituent whose wife died following treatment in an independent hospital. In that case, the management of the hospital was lacking. The constituent later formed a lobby group for the better regulation of indepenent hospitals. Two or so years ago, I accompanied the constituent to a meeting with the then responsible Minister, Baroness Jay, and some of her officials. They told us that the regulation of the independent sector was not a priority for the Department. They were too busy running the NHS. I am delighted that since then the Government have recognised the need to regulate the whole of the health care delivery system. I congratulate them on that.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
The primary function of the Secretary of State for Health is to ensure a safe environment for all patients, irrespective of whether they choose to be treated privately or by the NHS, including those who are moved into privately provided facilities at the expense of the NHS--a practice that will become increasingly common. Patients are entitled to expect an equal standard of care. The Secretary of State, acting in the public interest, should ensure that a proper framework of safety measures is in place to regulate a patient's environment.

<P>
At the risk of repeating an argument that I made on independent schools, to sustain the distinction between independent and NHS hospitals, the Government need to have a particular mindset. The NHS is managed by public authorities in the public interest, and some people believe that what it delivers is always good and the way in which it works is always sound. The independent sector, however, is delivered by organisations with avowedly different and separate interests, incorporating commercial and not-for-profit organisations. It could be argued that the two sectors pursue conflicting interests. I support the need to establish a framework to regulate that, especially in light of the structural weaknesses that are present in the Organisation of some of the independent acute sector.

<P>
I share the Minister's concern about the relationship between admitting doctors and hospitals that accommodate patients, and I wholeheartedly agree with what his noble Friend Lord Hunt said in another place. It is no longer acceptable for the people who manage independent hospitals to shrug their shoulders and say that the problem is nothing to do with them, but a matter for the doctors. I am delighted to say that the independent acute sector is increasingly acknowledging that situation. Many independent providers now provide a separate line of responsibility for the clinical management of cases and the provision of accommodation and nursing care. The sector is responding to the concerns that have been voiced by the Government and others.

<P>
However, it is time for the Government to be bold and extend the concept of the level playing field from care homes, which are covered in clause 3, and schools, as set out in clause 1, to hospitals. They need to address the undoubted problems of quality provision in the NHS. Although the NHS as a matter of principle is provided out of the public purse for the public good, 1 million people work in it and it embraces thousands of different institutions and operational units. As in all large organisations, there are tensions and different pulls, and there is also a conflict between the service that the private and public sectors deliver. The progressive centralisation of the management of the NHS has been apparent over recent weeks. The attempt by Ministers and senior officials in Whitehall to micro-manage the way in which the service operates is leading to a significant loss of top managers from the major NHS trusts and the NHS Executive. It seems obvious that a 1 million-strong organisation cannot be run from the top down with a command and control system. The tendency throughout the world is in the other direction, towards devolving power and responsibility in large organisations into smaller operating and accountability units. The business world has tended for many years towards recognising that centrally-controlled organisations that are run from the top cannot be efficient. I should hate to think that the Government are swimming against the tide.

<P>
I see the future of the NHS almost inevitably-- because the Government are rightly trying to make it more efficient and more accountable--as one of greater devolution of management responsibility and accountability to operating units. That is the logical way to achieve the Government's aims and to tackle some of the issues accurately identified by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State as being at the core of the problems of the NHS. As we move away from a system of central control of every NHS activity, the argument for a distinct and separate regulatory regime, independent of the management structure of the service, becomes stronger and more convincing. In that way the people who are trying to improve and run the service and to increase its efficiency--who are trying, to put it crudely, to save money and make bed use more effective--will not be the ones to judge whether the services that they provide are acceptable.

<P>
Should not the Secretary of State adopt a more strategic role, involving setting the direction of the NHS, and a regulatory role, involving setting minimum standards, and give the people who work in the service--managers, doctors and nurses--the freedom to respond to the priorities set by him, in appropriate ways dictated by the circumstances of their organisation or unit? Should not we make a virtue of the diversity of institutions and establishments in the national health service? Should not we accept that the concept that one size fits all cannot work in an organisation with 1 million employees? There will be different ways of achieving the agreed objectives in different units according to the different circumstances. The outcome, not the detail of the delivery mechanism, is what matters to patients and what should matter in the context of ensuring proper quality, accountability and audit. I am sure that the Minister heard a former NHS senior manager on the radio the other morning saying that the amount of micro-management from Whitehall and the extent to which politicians tell senior, skilled managers not only what they should achieve but how to go about it, in detail, insults their intelligence, their managerial skill and their commitment to the service. Its effect on the senior management ranks of the service is deleterious.

<P>
There is no possibility in the long or short term of achieving the desired outcomes through a top-down model. I am confused about the Government's priorities. They talk about eliminating postcode rationing and the lottery of care. Those objectives are laudable, as they relate to unacceptable variations in service in different parts of the country and in different health authorities. However, the Government pay only lip service to the principle of local priority setting and local ownership of the health agenda. Somehow, those issues must be squared. The health service is, of course, a national service, so it is right for the Secretary of State to set national key targets and access entitlements. However, he cannot manage every detail of the service while sitting in Whitehall and by exercising command and control from there.

<P>
That is why we must probe the myth that the public sector does not need regulating. Any managerial organisation, whether public or private, needs an external regulation mechanism--preferably one with a light touch--to enable the management to pursue clearly defined objectives within a proper regulatory framework. We must not confuse the regulation side of the equation with the management side by attempting to distinguish between a regulated and a managed service. I do not accept the validity of such a distinction. Countless examples of management failure have arisen in the national health service. I do not say that as part of a point-scoring exercise; it is something that we all know to be true.

<P>
Indeed, we have seen one such example during the past few days. The Ledward case involved a clear and gross management failure. Examples of management failure have also arisen in the private sector. I am not trying to score points; I am merely pointing out the falseness of the old notion that a public service does not need any regulatory framework because public authorities will always act in the best interests of the public good. The argument that public management makes regulation superfluous and unnecessary is no longer valid, if, indeed, it ever was.

<P>
In the other place, the issues about which I am speaking were discussed during consideration of later clauses. The Minister might have expected me to address them when we came to clause 7, but I think that it is better to debate them now, in relation to the definition of a hospital, than it is to discuss them while we consider who should inspect independent acute health care providers.

<P>
It may be useful if I say a word or two about the Commission for Health Improvement and its role in relation to the NHS. Some debate in the other place and outside has been fuelled by a slight misunderstanding of the commission's role. Indeed, I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I, too, misunderstand that role.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have paid considerable attention to every word that has been said. I made it clear that I was prepared to allow a broad debate on the first amendments grouped under each clause, but I think that the hon. Gentleman is aware that he is pushing at the limits of the breadth of debate that I am prepared to tolerate. I am sure that we will thoroughly debate clause 7, so I should point out that the matters about which the hon. Gentleman is currently speaking are properly covered by that clause. I am reasonably willing to allow the current discussion to continue if it will facilitate proper debate, but only on the strict understanding that we do not have that discussion twice.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. Gale. I said that I had thought hard about whether it was better to have this debate during consideration of clause 7 or now. It is my firm view that we need to discuss whether the regulatory regime should extend to all hospitals. The Minister said that he would extend it to all schools in appropriate cases, and the Bill already appears to extend it to all care homes. Why would the Government resist that symmetry in the definitions part of the Bill?

<P>
I shall refer briefly to the Commission for Health Improvement. I found it helpful, because I take it to be a definitive statement, that Lord Hunt of Kings Heath said that

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government remain of the view that CHI's principal role has to be about helping to modernise and improve the quality of NHS services. It was brought into existence solely with that important task in mind. It does not have responsibility for the regulation of private healthcare.<P>
</UL></FONT>--[Official Report, House of Lords, 28 March 2000; Vol. 611, c. 682.]<P>


<P>
I know that we shall discuss that aspect later, but we must keep it in our minds at the outset of this debate that the Government do not conceive the CHI primarily as a regulatory body in the NHS. That is not its function.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
As I understand it, the Government's position is broadly that the NHS is a managed service; it does not need a regulatory overview as such, because the Secretary of State, acting in the public interest, not only manages the service but oversees its proper operation. I have always seen the CHI as a kind of internal management consultancy unit, which will beef up parts of the NHS needing additional support and will address specific problems to help it to improve its performance.

Conflicts of interest inevitably abound in the managed system of the NHS, as they do in any large organisation. That is not a criticism, but an observation about the way in which large organisations work. It is unreasonable to expect the NHS management to judge its own performance dispassionately. There is an overwhelming case for a light-touch, uniform, regulatory and registration system across our acute health services to ensure that there is a proper management and audit system in place and compliance with basic minimum standards. I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of NHS institutions would regularly surmount those hurdles with flying colours and would find them relatively easy targets to meet. I see no reason why we should deny the protection of a proper, transparent regulatory regime to the majority of the public who are routinely treated in the NHS, while providing it for those treated in the private sector.

<P>
However, a practical issue must be addressed, which was also discussed in the other place. The distinction between the public and private sectors has never been as clear as some would like it to be, for rhetorical purposes, and is becoming less clear all the time. We welcome that, because it represents more efficient and effective use of our total health care resources. The Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have said that it will continue and simple logic dictates that it will.

<P>
There are pay beds in the NHS--there have always been pay beds in the NHS--and there are NHS amenity beds. There are NHS private patient units and, increasingly, services provided by NHS units on a private basis. There is growing use by the NHS of the independent sector. Now the Government have found an enthusiasm for independent sector intermediate units as a means of tackling the problem of frail, elderly people who have completed their treatment in the NHS and can appropriately be cared for in specifically designed, step-down, intermediate care units in the private sector.

<P>
During the passage of the Health Act 1999 I was given the clear indication by Ministers that all units outside the NHS receiving NHS patients will come within the remit of the Commission for Health Improvement. As the service is currently evolving, that will mean that almost all private health care providers will have some contact with the CHI. In the vast majority of cases, patients will come to it from the national health service. That strongly reinforces the argument for a single uniform system of inspection and regulation, and it will lessen the divide between the public and private sectors. The fact that we have a uniform system of inspection for care homes will blur or soften the hard edge between the acute and the care home sectors. The Government's initiative on intermediate care units points the way--there should be a continuum of care levels from the acute hospital to the traditional care home, rather than a sharp distinction between the acute NHS hospital and the private care home.

<P>
The Government's logic points to a single, unified regime of regulation and inspection. There is no reason to condemn NHS patients to a second-class regime that  depends on the service's managers to identify and correct its weaknesses and deficiencies. The CHI will be involved in an auditing and review process--it is specifically called a review process rather than an inspection process--but it will go to hospitals perhaps once every four or five years. I suspect that the regime that the Government will propose for independent hospitals will involve annual inspections at least, although under the Registered Homes Act 1984 inspections should be twice a year.

<P>
There is an overpowering logic for extending the benefit of a properly constructed registration regime to all sectors. I urge the Minister to take a step in that direction--doing so would help to reduce artificial distinctions, which would allow patients to move seamlessly across health care provision in this country, and it would allow the country's full health care capacity to be effectively and safely utilised. I also hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the logic points to a future that involves a less hands-on role for the Secretary of State. Downing street appears to have realised that the days of Ministers' involvement in the minutiae of NHS management decisions are numbered.

<P>
It is time to move on to a more modern system, in which the Government have a strategic and regulatory role in publicly funded health care services. The Government announced that those services will increasingly be purchased from a range of providers from inside and outside the NHS. That process should be overseen by a uniform, independent regulatory regime that checks on quality, management capability and minimum standards across the spectrum. I do not suggest for one moment that that regime should be a substitute for the CHI, which has a separate role in the NHS--it helps the NHS to improve the quality of care that is delivered. That regime will reassure the public that wherever they choose to have their treatment, or wherever their health authority chooses to purchase treatment for them, the Secretary of State will have established a proper regulatory inspection and registration regime that will guarantee their safety.

<P>
I have so far discussed amendments Nos. 83, 84 and 75, but I want to make a couple of separate points about amendments Nos. 90 to 93. Those probing amendments deal with a different issue--they seek to clarify the Goverment's intentions and the likely effect of the wording that was inserted during the Bill's passage through the other place after the definitions of an independent clinic and an independent medical agency.

<P>
If I have understood lines 37 to 39 on page 2 correctly, their intention is to exclude NHS general practitioners' surgeries from the definition of an independent clinic. What is the practical effect of that provision? Is the Minister confident that it does not leave gaps in the Bill? Is he sure that every establishment providing general or personal medical services is effectively regulated in respect of other services that it provides? If he is, will he explain to the Committee how those services are covered? I suspect that, increasingly, other services besides GMS and PMS will be provided from GPs' premises.

<P>
Amendment No. 91 takes that issue further, perhaps not very elegantly, by making it clear that any other services that are provided should be regulated, while allowing the normal GP-provided services to be excluded from the scope of the Bill. We shall return to this point later, but if alternative and complementary therapies are being provided from a GP's premises, they would not fall within the scope of services provided

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in pursuance of the National Health Service Act 1977.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I take it that lines 37 to 39 would mean that, if GMS or PMS were provided from a GP's premises, any other services provided from those premises would not come under the definition of an independent clinic. I seek to probe the Minister on that point.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 would do the same in regard to independent medical agencies. This may be an even bigger concern. As the Bill is worded, a call-out service that undertook even the smallest amount of NHS locum work or out-of-hours cover would be excluded in respect of all its activities. That seems to me to drive a coach and horses through the intention of the Bill. If a provider of such a service who sought to avoid the regulatory regime contracted to provide only a modest amount of out-of-hours cover to a GP, he would then be excluded from the scope of the Bill. The Minister may be able to reassure us that, by virtue of providing services in pursuance of the National Health Service Act 1977, he will be caught by another regulatory procedure. However, in view of what I have just said about the absence of regulatory as opposed to management regimes in the NHS, I have my doubts about the effectiveness of that. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify that point.

<P>
It will be clear to the Committee from our earlier debates that I am not convinced that exclusion of NHS work from the regulatory regime is right in principle. However, amendments Nos. 90 to 93 do not address the issue of principle but take the Bill at face value and ask how those exclusions will work in practice. I hope that the Minister can assure us that all services provided by an establishment or agency that should, in the everyday use of the word, be regulated, will be effectively regulated, and that subsections (4) and (5) will not create the regulatory lacunae that I believe they may.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): This group of amendments--the first on which it is appropriate for me to speak--addresses the important matter of the establishment of a regulatory framework. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly alighted on this part of the Bill as the appropriate point at which to raise some relevant issues. Within the bounds that he has defined, I hope that I shall be able to do the same, while trying not to take up too much of the Committee's time.

<P>
I should like to concentrate on exploring regulation from a different angle. The Government propose a variegated system that is partly regulatory, through the National Care Standards Commission, and partly managed, through the Commission for Health Improvement and the national health service. Grey areas may emerge as a consequence of having different regimes for different parts of the care continuum that was described earlier. In some cases, a care setting will be simultaneously subject to the remit and role of the Commission for Health Improvement and part of the responsibilities of the National Care Standards Commission. The Bill does not specify how decisions will be taken on drawing the lines in that respect. Ministers helpfully tried to clarify that during the debates in the House of Lords, but I should like to explore it further now and when we reach clause 7.

<P>
During the passage of the Bill in the House of Lords, considerable discussion took place about the role of the Commission for Health Improvement in relation to the work of the National Care Standards Commission. We shall return to the Government's intentions in that respect when we reach clause 7. I, and many people outside the Committee, feel that the Government have not yet set out definitively how the two different regimes--one that is regulatory and one that is about managing performance and quality--will sit in relation to each other. I hope that the Minister will explain how those regimes will work with, and not against, each other, in the best interests of the person who is being cared for.

<P>
A situation may arise in which the Commission for Health Improvement is responsible, under the clinical governance responsibilities of the NHS, for an NHS patient's care in a private intermediate facility such as a nursing home, while the National Care Standards Commission is responsible for the bed, services and overall package of care, and for registering and inspecting the home. Either the person will benefit from over-inspection and regulation, with two agencies doing the work, or there will be doubt and confusion about which body is responsible.

<P>
As we heard during the debate on previous amendments that were tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the Government accept that the Bill covers many aspects--such as boarding schools and the home care sector--that should properly be regulated and inspected by the National Care Standards Commission. By dint of that logic, it is hard to understand why they do not accept that the regulation and inspection of health care in the United Kingdom should also come under the umbrella of one agency. Questions might then arise as to how the agency delivered that responsibility in relation to the Commission for Health Improvement. I listened to the points that were made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge when he spoke to the amendment. While I accept the logic of saying that the National Care Standards Commission should be the platform for providing a consistent framework of inspection and regulation across the health care sector, I am not convinced that there is an argument for CHI performing an entirely separate function.

<P>
During the passage of the Bill that became the Health Act 1999, we debated the role of CHI in relation to the private sector, and I think that all Opposition Members present at the time concluded that CHI has a role to play in both the public and private sectors. That role could be carried out legitimately through the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have dealt with the matter in this way because, in the light of debate in the other place and the Minister's amendments to clause 7, it has become clear that the Government are not prepared to take that route. I am trying to find another way to achieve a unified regulatory regime, while acknowledging that the Government have set their face firmly against changes to the Bill that were made in the House of Lords.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> There is a laudable purpose behind the amendments, which, in the spirit that has so far infused and enthused Committee members, I take at face value. However, the logic of the arguments of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge suggests that we should at least raise the question of CHI's role. Would CHI better fit into his framework, which we broadly support, as the agency to carry out the work?

<P>
I shall briefly address three questions. How will the system--the architecture of regulation and inspection--as envisaged work in practice? What criteria will apply when deciding who will inspect the private wing of an NHS hospital, for example? Who will regulate private hospitals--free-standing institutions that are not managed and controlled by the NHS--that are sited on NHS trust property?

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): Does my hon. Friend agree that such issues will become more prevalent in the light of private finance initiative involvement in the production of new hospitals? Often, private wings are not just managed in a different way in clinical terms; they are also separate cost centres.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. During the passage of the Bill that became the Health Act 1999, we expressed the concern that the use of the private finance initiative to provide the NHS with additional resources, and the way in which such resources will be managed, will give rise to questions about who is competent to inspect and regulate.

<P>
Under current nursing home regulations, GPs must register when treating nursing home residents who are not on their list. Because that is a matter for regulation, it is not clear whether the requirement will continue in the light of the National Care Standards Commission and the regulations that will flow from the Bill. Will inspection responsibility rest with the National Care Standards Commission? Given the current framework, one would assume so. On the other hand, it could be a matter of clinical governance that would therefore be managed through the Commission for Health Improvement. It would be useful to know whether the current arrangement will pertain in the new system, or whether something else is envisaged.

<P>
We shall return to how best to arrange the regulatory framework when we consider clause 7. However, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge was right to point out now that, although the Bill accepts the principle of consistent regulation, for reasons that are not entirely clear--in using that phrase, I am being charitable--the Government have yet to embrace the logic of their own conclusions on most other aspects of care, and accept that the NHS should be treated in the same way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made a compelling speech, which was reinforced by solid points from the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow). I should try your patience, Mr. Gale, were I to repeat the arguments that they set out so well, but it is worth enumerating some others. First, there is an anomaly in respect of the handling of hospital treatment in the public and private sectors, compared with areas such as boarding school provision, care standards in homes for the elderly, and so on, where the need for a unified regime is accepted. Secondly, there is a compelling argument that the future must lie less with heavy central management, as my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, and more with an attitude of holding the ring with sensible regulations. That on its own is an argument for moving in the direction of a unified regulatory regime for acute medicine. I shall focus on and develop the third argument, which relates to the public-private interface.

<P>
The point was made a moment ago that a geographical problem exists with the growth of private finance initiatives. More and more private wings are now to be found in hospitals, which the Conservative party welcomes. More value can be obtained from a private finance initiative if one can build a private dimension into it, and the Government are, rightly, encouraging PFIs. Given the controversial changes involved, I shall try not to stray on to controversial territory, Mr. Gale.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has no problem. He simply has to stay within the bounds of the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Brazier:</B> Indeed; I shall rightly focus on that narrow subject. You and I share an area, Mr. Gale, in which a considerable number of PFIs are planned. Indeed, a large one is already in place in your constituency. It is also an area that has had the misfortune to have three of the worst national medical scandals of the past few years, one of which my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has just mentioned. Without naming names, I want to share with the Committee a few constituency cases that will illustrate why trying to operate two different regulatory regimes will be extremely difficult.

<P>
The first case involved the cytology scandal at the Kent and Canterbury hospital in my constituency. The second concerned a Doctor Tai, and involved dozens, perhaps hundreds, of patients on pain relief in Margate, in your constituency, Mr. Gale. The worst case of all was at Ashford, involving the unbelievable story of Dr. Ledward.

<P>
It is unfortunate that, although I was courteously sent a copy of the Ritchie report by the chairman, I received it only last night, and have not had time to go through it in great detail. However, for the purposes of making a short contribution to this debate, I suggest that there are lessons to be learnt from two cases. They illustrate why this kind of split between public and private regulatory regimes would be so difficult.

<P>
I shall start with a constituency case involving Dr. Tai. A man who started out as a private patient of Dr. Tai, being treated for pain, ended up having an operation on an NHS basis in hospital. The case might, before long, form the basis of a letter to the Minister, and I am not asking for a specific comment on it. However, the complexity arose because the new trust that covers all three hospitals in the area argued that it could not take responsibility for his case under NHS rules because the man was a private patient.

<P>
By introducing a new regime to cover the treatment of private patients alongside an existing regime covering public sector patients, we shall not only continue the bad practice of the past but inject a whole new regime of complexity. A patient such as that, starting out in the private sector and ending up in the public sector, instead of working to one set of rules--in terms of access to his files, standards laid down for registration, and so on--will be caught under the new system as badly as he was under the old, but in an even more complicated fashion.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
It is unfortunate that I have been unable to go through the whole report on Dr. Ledward, but it appears that two aspects of his activities are relevant to the amendments. The first involves the technique that Dr. Ledward used to hide his wrongdoing. It appears that he sent patients who developed symptoms to different private clinics. Dispersing them in several private sector clinics made it much harder to catch up with the horrendous activities of this man, at whose hands hundreds of women suffered. It is easier to distribute people in the private system, and no private sector doctor became aware of the scale of the problem.

<P>
A new regulatory regime for private hospitals, which we have welcomed from the beginning, is sensible. If that regime does not also extend into the NHS, and if the National Care Standards Commission does not extend into the private sector, the clever method that Dr. Ledward used for many years to cover his tracks might not be eliminated. A chap who performs a mixture of public and private sector operations and who sends patients to a mixture of private and public sector locations for follow-up treatments will continue to find it easier to cover his tracks if there are two separate regimes.

<P>
The Ledward case is relevant for a second reason. Ledward was involved for some years at the Chaucer hospital, which is in my constituency. I have not had time to get the full details, but the fact that there were problems with his clinical standards was identified early on. I have not yet gone right through the Ritchie report, so it is not yet clear to me whether it picked up on the fact that remarks were sent back into the NHS system early on. It is extraordinary that although a private sector hospital had picked up the problem early on, both an NHS hospital--the William Harvey hospital at Ashford--and other private sector hospitals apparently did not heed the messages that had been sent back into the NHS. If I had read the Ritchie report, I would have been able to say more about that.

<P>
The point that I made earlier is relevant in this context. A single, unified regulatory system that overlooks NHS and private sector hospitals will make it much harder for  a man of Dr. Ledward's stamp to defeat the system by taking advantage of its fragmentation.

<P>
I should like to end with one further observation. I can anticipate the gist of the Minister's reply. He may suggest that there would be much duplication if the NHS were brought within the same regulatory framework. Extra paperwork would be generated in hospitals that already feel they are suffering from too much paperwork as a result of regulation.

<P>
This is perhaps the wrong place to deal with this concern, because the only advantage of the of the structure of the Bill is that it leaves almost everything to regulation. Therefore, our concern could be addressed in the regulations. There is nothing to prevent Ministers, when they frame the regulations, from including existing activity to avoid any manifest duplication and unnecessary extra paperwork. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the same overall regulatory regime applies in the private and the public sector. We owe it to the three patients--two of whom were women--who suffered so horrendously in the three separate cases to make sure that such scandals are not repeated. The unified public-private sector regulatory regime proposed by the amendments would go a considerable way towards achieving that.

<P>

<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I support the drift of this morning's contributions. The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) made it clear that the distinction in the acute sector is not helpful to overall patient care or, indeed, clinical governance.

<P>
I would not wish to draw an artificial distinction between acute and on-going care. The other purpose of a regime is to improve quality. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence will set the standards, but people need help and support to achieve those standards, whether they are in the NHS or in the private sector. Therefore, I would not like to see a distinction between acute, chronic and rehabilitation services, because many patients, and I suspect many of us, will at some stage go through various phases of those services.

<P>
As has been said this morning, the Government have shifted considerably since I first asked the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) about control of the private sector. He replied, "It has nothing to do with the Government. I am the Minister for the national health service. That is a matter for the General Medical Council." I am glad that we have moved a long way from that, but we still have a significant, dogmatic hang-up about it. When he gave evidence to the Health Committee, the previous Secretary of State specifically excluded a common regulatory and inspection system for the private sector on the ground that he was not in the business of putting a stamp of approval on the private sector. That is totally unacceptable in a modem national health service, and inconsistent with the direction of Government policy over the past 18 months.

<P>
The Government have had to recognise that there are different sorts of expertise in the private sector and in the national health service, and that there are roles to play, not least in bringing services closer to the community, where the private sector can be extremely helpful, provided that it has an active interface with the NHS. We have suffered a great deal in the past from the NHS saying, "You are no longer our problem, because you are being looked after by the private sector". People have languished in nursing and residential homes without the full benefit of modern, medical, rehabilitative treatment.

<P>
I hope that we can persuade the Government to look at this matter anew. I think that the arguments have been well made this morning. I am not sure whether the amendments will achieve what Opposition Members who have spoken are trying to achieve. Therefore, I look to the Minister to give a coherent, logical response to our anxieties and perhaps make some suggestions about the way in which we can achieve what we all want--a safe, logical passage for patients in the course of their treatment, whether it is in a health service acute hospital, a private hospital, rehabilitation clinic or at home.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Ms Gisela Stuart):</B> It was interesting that the Opposition chose to debate the long-term vision for the national health service at this point.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge are wholly inappropriate. They would bring NHS hospitals and other NHS services within the scope of the Bill and place them under the regulatory remit of the National Care Standards Commission.

<P>
I have a clear sense that the amendments fail to recognise that there are two different systems. The Commission for Health Improvement, is a separate tailor-made arrangement designed specifically to drive up standards in the NHS--[Interruption.] May I just develop a coherent argument? We have only a few minutes left.

<P>
The Commission for Health Improvement was set up to provide clinical governance for the national health service and to drive up standards. The Opposition voted consistently against CHI. The fundamental purpose of the Bill and of the National Care Standards Commission is the regulation of care homes and independent health care providers. Until now, independent health care providers have not been regulated, except by an outdated Act, so there is a significant loophole. The measures contained in the Bill to put that right--and the regulatory role of the commission--differ from the separate measures to ensure that there is a drive for high quality in the NHS. There is a significant difference between regulating a service and managing it.

<P>
I had the distinct impression that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, having previously rejected

 CHI, now feels that we should bring the whole hospital sector under the authority of the National Care Standards Commission. The hon. Member for Canterbury, however, seemed to think that CHI should have an extended role in the private sector--[Interruption.] I really want to develop that point, and I would urge Opposition Members to read new clause 23, if, as I suspect, they have not already done so. It will provide a more useful context in which to discuss the interface between the National Care Standards Commission and CHI. There will be areas of overlap, and the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam alluded to those areas of common interest.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Some hon. Members are looking perplexed, so I shall point out that new clause 23 was tabled last night. It is not on the selection list, but hon. Members will find it at the back of the amendment paper.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am grateful that you have reinforced the point that we will have an opportunity to take the issue further.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam spoke about grey areas and raised a specific concern about GPs working in registered homes. Any nursing home, whether it is run by a GP or by someone else, must be registered with the National Care Standards Commission and will be subject to the full range of regulatory requirements and inspections by the commission. The GP would be governed by NHS quality arrangements, including oversight by CHI.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I sought to clarify the situation in respect of someone who is not on a GP list. Would such a person be covered by the clinical governance to which the Minister has just referred? That matter is currently dealt with under the Registered Homes Act 1984.

<P>
<B>Ms Stuart:</B> As I understand it, they would be covered. It is important that that is made clear.

<P>
The hon. Member for Canterbury raised the matter of the regulation of individuals. I draw his attention to the regulatory requirements set out in clause 21(2)(b). They extend the current provisions, which simply gave admission rights, and make it clear that there is a duty on private sector operators to satisfy themselves as to the competence--

<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

<P>
Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
