<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199798/cmbills/095/1997095.htm">School Standards and Framework Bill</A></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Members of the Committee will be aware that, at our previous sitting, the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) asked when more detail would be given to the Committee on school organisation, the framework for delegation and the new regime for local management of schools, grammar school ballots and the code of practice for local education authorities.
<P>
I can now inform the Committee when it will be provided with detail on those four specific issues. It is likely that the Committee will debate the paper on school organisation in the context of clause 23 which, if we make reasonable progress today, we may be considering at our sitting on Thursday. I shall therefore provide members of the Committee with details of school organisation tomorrow, so that they will be prepared for a debate that may take place on Thursday.
<P>
Once again, if we make good progress today and at our next sitting, we may reach clause 43 on Thursday, when we can discuss the framework for delegation and the local management of schools. I shall also circulate to members of the Committee details of that issue tomorrow. Clause 95 will be the appropriate clause to debate grammer school ballots. We certainly intend to provide the appropriate details at least a day before the Committee proceedings.
<P>
Opposition Members have helpfully tabled new clause 3, which will provide a peg on which to hang a discussion although a limited discussion on the local authority code of practice. The Government believe that we need to state clearly in the Bill a statutory code of conduct for local education authorities that will go beyond the measures contained in part I. We shall be tabling a new clause that will give statutory effect to a local education authority code of practice, at which time we shall also provide the Committee with detailed regulations to underpin the new clause. I trust that that information discharges the commitment that I made at our first sitting and I hope that it is helpful to members of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. I welcome the Minister's announcements about when he will publish the information. I do not, however, endorse fully his expectations on timetabling this week, but no doubt that can be discussed through the usual channels. I welcome the fact that the Government intend to provide a statutory basis for their views on the role of an LEA. We must await the detail of the code of practice to elucidate exactly whether it, with its statutory basis, will be substantial.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Those comments were not strictly points of order for the Chair, but I am sure that the Committee will welcome such information.
<H4><center>Clause 10</center></H4>
<H4><center>Establishment of education action zones</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Willis </B>(Harrogate and Knaresborough): I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 9, line 45, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(7A) Before 
<P>
(a) making an order under this section; or
<P>
(b) the end of an Education Action Zone as specified in subsection (2) above, the Secretary of State shall have regard to the views of representatives of the relevant local education authorities.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following a pleasant lunch, the Committee should be rested and I hope that the Minister takes a positive approach to the clause and accepts what is clearly a reasonable amendment. It reflects the feeling of the Committee when my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) moved his probing amendment. He forgot to say that amendment No. 114 was a probing amendment, but it clearly was and it achieved the desired results.
<P>
The essence of amendment No. 93 is that the Secretary of State should be obliged to consult the relevant local education authorities before approving or removing an education action zone. That seems reasonable.
<P>
During this morning's sitting, an important issue was clarified it is inevitable that education action zones will leave LEAs. The Minister's comments on the third option were very important, and the Committee should not lose sight of them. If the 419 education action zones that the Secretary of State has spoken of to which reference was made this morning are created by the end of this Parliament, there will be education action zones in every LEA. That will not be the third option; it will be the first option.
<P>
For those zones to grow and prosper we Liberal Democrats hope that they will they need to get off to the best possible start. If that is to happen, LEAs must be involved. We have accepted the fact that the Committee does not support a mandatory requirement, but it is important that the Secretary of State consults LEAs when he decides whether to grant education action zone status and that the transition from LEA to education action zone is as smooth and profitable as possible.
<P>
I agree with the Under-Secretary that some schools will remain with the LEA. For example, there are no failing schools in my local authority North Yorkshire where all the primary and secondary schools, by and large, are good and have a strong relationship with the LEA, which has a light touch. I am sure that the Under-Secretary would agree that that relationship should continue and that education action zones in North Yorkshire might not be a reality.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale (Mr. Brady) proudly mentions the grammar school in his constituency at every opportunity, but the LEA there would not want to interfere in their status or bring them into education actions zones. Some of us would like that[Mr. Phil Willis]
status to change. Indeed, we would like some of the expertise in those grammar schools to become part and parcel of education action zones. However, that is a debate for another time.
<P>
In reality, the only education actions zones that will return to LEAs will be those that fail. Private finance might pull out or relationships might break down, or there will be some other reason for them to return to LEAs. That is the other part of the amendment. For that return to be successful, it is crucial that the LEA is consulted. Therefore, for the successful launch of education action zones and for the return of those that might either fail or need to return to an LEA, we ask the Ministers to accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> I want to resist the temptation to give over this morning's debate. I disagree with one or two things that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) has said, but we have the opportunity to tease them out and have a good general debate. I have obviously not had as good an afternoon as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis); he expects me to accept the amendment, but I must tell him that I will ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary. We have made it clear at every stage that we expect local authorities to be consulted. Clearly, if an application for an EAZ was made and the local authority had not expressed a view on it, we would take the initiative and ask the local authority why that was so. It is important that we are aware of the local authority's views. My hon. Friend the Minister has made it clear on other occasions that we expect LEAs in many, if not most, cases to be invited to sit on the forum.
<P>
We have tried not to be prescriptive, but to be flexible and to invite a variety of approaches. We expect local authorities to be consulted indeed, that is stated in the brochure on the subject which we distributed fairly widely but it is unnecessary and inappropriate to state that in the Bill.
<P>
I must make it clear to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that our rejection of the amendment does not imply a wish to exclude local authorities from consultation. We are unwilling to include the words in the Bill because they are unnecessary. Whenever orders such as this are made by Secretaries of State, relevant parties are consulted. I am sure that such consultation will take place, and we have said so in the literature that we have sent to would-be applicants. That is how we wish to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Is the Under-Secretary saying that the Department will not accept an application for an education action zone unless the local authority has been consulted in other words, that such consultation will be a requirement?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We would want to know the local authority's view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> With that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman,</b> being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 67, That the clause stand part of the Bill:

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> First, I assure the Committee that I intend to be exceedingly brief; secondly, these are probing amendments, for reasons that I think will be clear to the Committee.
<P>
It is important that we have a brief opportunity to tease out from the Minister his thoughts about the likely membership of education action zone forums. We need to know the Government's view about the involvement of teachers in the work of such forums. A concern lingers in the minds of many members of the Committee about the possible disapplication of the arrangements for teachers pay and conditions. The Committee will be aware that employment of teachers in community schools as they will be called will be the responsibility of the local education authority. It will clearly be difficult if the LEA were unhappy about disapplication of pay and conditions, but the forum wanted to go ahead.
<P>
It will be important to ensure that the views of teachers, whose pay and conditions will be seriously affected, are considered. Making teachers members of the forum would be one way to do that. It would be helpful to hear a little more of the Minister's thinking about likely members of the forum in particular, his thoughts on the likely background of the one or two people to be appointed by the Secretary of State. He may want to bear in mind that many people would argue that it would be helpful if someone with expertise in special educational needs were to serve on the forum.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will comment on the membership of the forum and about the disapplication of pay and conditions, which concerns many of us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I ask the Committee to resist the amendments. I hope that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) will not be too critical if I leave a more detailed discussion of the disapplication of teachers pay and conditions until later. It may be more appropriate to give details when we debate amendment No. 75 to clause 13.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is always difficult to reply to such probing amendments. Most education forums will include representatives of the local education authority because the LEA will be part of the partnership we said much about partnership this morning that promoted the education action zone. The LEA will therefore usually have a position on the forum. However, we should not be prescriptive. For instance, the LEA may not support the concept of the education action zone or the location of an EAZ within its area.
<P>
There are potential difficulties. For instance, a local education authority may have been hostile to the establishment of a forum, but might want to impose a representative or even two representatives on the forum. There are also practical difficulties with reserving places for LEA representatives, although in the majority of cases, as partners in promoting EAZs, LEAs will have a reserve position on forums.
<P>
Teachers are in a slightly different position. They do not have such a strong case as LEAs for being members of a forum, so I shall ask the Committee to resist amendment No. 133.
<P>
Some sympathy may be expressed for the argument that the Secretary of State, in exercising his power to appoint members to the forum, should consider areas such as special educational need to ensure that the forum is broadly representative of the children for which it has responsibility. It is worth noting that special schools can form part of the forum, and there are some interesting and exciting ideas about the role that we can expect special schools to play. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who has ministerial responsibility for that, is looking at extending targets to special schools. We must ensure that standards are maintained and improved in special schools as well as in other maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning </B>(Tiverton and Honiton): Subsection (3)(b) allows the Secretary of State to appoint two persons. The Minister said that in order to achieve balance on the forum, the Secretary of State might consider it appropriate to include someone with knowledge of special educational needs. Will the Secretary of State's appointees be professionals? If the Secretary of State feels that special educational needs are not represented on the forum, will he appoint a professional someone qualified in special educational needs or will he consider someone representative of that sector? The Secretary of State may likewise believe that there is a gap in other sectors of education. Will he be looking for particular appointees or for people with recognised professional credentials?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As always, the Secretary of State will be looking for the best people for the job. They may be experts although experience tells us that the best people are often not experts, but people with direct personal experience. It will vary from area to area, which is why we do not want to be prescriptive and why we shall resist the amendments. I assure the hon. Lady that the Secretary of State will not appoint political cronies. He will want to appoint the best people for the job those with knowledge of the area and the subjects involved. He will want to ensure not only that the forum discharges its responsibility and feeds information back to the centre to the Secretary of State, but that there is a dialogue between the Secretary of State and the forum.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> When the Secretary of State makes those appointments, will he be required to explain why he has chosen a particular person with a particular background or area of experience or expertise?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I can certainly give an assurance that individuals' identities will be publicised so that people are aware of the appointments certainly in regard to the Department for Education and Employment. I am sure that Opposition Members will table questions about what criteria the Secretary of State used in making those appointments. That is probably the best way of holding the Secretary of State accountable for any appointments he makes. I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 11 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Functions of Education Action Forum</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I have some general questions for the Minister to help us clarify the wording of clause 12, especially on the role of the private sector in EAZs. The Minister has named certain companies as examples of the sort of companies that might wish to be involved in EAZs and in the forum. I want to ask the Minister about the lines of accountability in any private sector involvement. Will there be types of company, for example, that will not be regarded favourably for involvement in EAZs? I have in mind the Government's ethical policy on the defence industry. If one of the major employers who wanted to be involved in an EAZ sold arms, would its application be regarded unfavourably? In my constituency if I may quote that as an example the largest private sector employer happens to be a slaughterhouse. Would that be considered unsuitable?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady, but try as I may I cannot relate the clause, which deals with the functions of the education action forum, to EAZs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I apologise for not explaining that I was talking about the role of those companies as members of the forum, in partnership with the other bodies that we have discussed. Those companies would be expected to match Government funding and one would expect them to have representation on the forum. Who or who would not be considered suitable as a member of the forum and, once accepted, what would be the lines of accountability? For example, if a particular company on the forum had identified areas where it was willing to put up significant funding it might wish to target funding carefully on certain areas of activity and innovation to whom would it be accountable to the forum or to the school or schools within the EAZ? What format would the accountability take?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady has touched on important points that give me the opportunity to explain the role that the private sector may play in the action forums, which will be responsible for the way in which an education action zone conducts its business.
<P>
Private sector involvement can take place in one of a number of ways. As the Bill makes clear, private companies will have the opportunity to sponsor an EAZ by making a œ250,000 a year contribution towards the running costs of the zone and the forum, and of appointing extra teachers on different pay levels. That money may be matched by Government funding. Those companies may provide sponsorship because they see it as part of their charitable giving. I have had discussions with the charitable trusts associated with major companies in the United Kingdom that are especially interested in supporting EAZs, even though they do not want to become directly involved. They want to provide money as part of their charitable giving.
<P>
Some companies are major local employers. They have a direct interest in an area which they may want to discharge by supporting an action zone. For example, such support could come from British Aerospace in Bristol or from what was the Swan Hunter shipyard in my constituency. Before the previous Government closed the yard, it built ships for the Royal Navy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Has it been re-opened?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am afraid not, yet. However, the yard now employs more people than it did as a naval yard under the previous Government. That is because I fear that you will soon rule me out of order, Mr. Gale a Labour council has intervened.
<P>
A major employer in the defence industry may want to support education in its local schools. Many of them do. There is no problem with that; they have a legitimate part to play and a direct interest in ensuring that people leaving the school system can benefit from the employment opportunities that they offer.
<P>
In addition, some education management consultants run schools in the United Kingdom. Nord Anglia is the prime example because it is responsible for 15 schools in the independent sector. Such consultants may want to become involved, but it is more likely that they want to make a profit for their shareholders. A forum will have to decide whether it wishes to engage the expertise that exists within a body such as Nord Anglia. That decision is, first, a matter for governing bodies, which will have to decide to give up their powers to the forum. Then, it is for the forum to decide to whom to award the contract. I have described the lines of accountability. I hope that I have made clear how they will work and the role that the private sector may play.
<P>
Interest may even be expressed by companies with experience in the United States. Some have a successful track record, but the involvement of other companies in the United States has been a disaster. We shall need to consider the track record of such companies to ensure that they have experience from whch we can benefit.
<P>
I have outlined the main areas in which the private sector will have a valid role to play. However, we seek to ensure that the interests of children will be put first. The clause, which outlines the functions of the forum, will enable us to do precisely that.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Will there be any circumstances in which a company will employ the teachers and have a formal contractual arrangement with them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> When we come to the disapplication of teachers pay and conditions, we may deal with that point in more detail. We currently take the view that teachers will be employed by their employing body, be that a local education authority or an individual school. The forum's involvement will mean that teachers, while notionally on national pay and conditions, may be able to offer additional services through the forum that will be paid for separately. That will effectively be under a separate contract that the forum will offer to them. We do not envisage teachers having different employers, but the powers that we shall give to the forum will enable it to alter the pay and conditions under which they operate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> May I clarify that? Are there circumstances in which not the company, but the forum will be the employer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It will always be for the governing body to delegate its powers onwards to the forum. That is the precise power that has been given to the governing bodies in a previous clause.
<P>

<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> All three amendments in the group would insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"foundation school or voluntary aided school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The recruitment of teachers and their pay and conditions should be treated in the same way in those schools as the Government intend for teachers employed in education action zones.
<P>
We are a little perplexed as to why the Government, having accepted that that is a good way of employing teachers, feel that they should cherry pick or restrict that method of employment to one section of education teachers in EAZs while other parts of the Bill treat the matter differently. The arrangements for recruiting staff and their pay and conditions, especially for head teachers and specialist staff, seem to be different under clause 13 than in other parts of the Bill. Advertising will be used in some cases, but the recruitment of teachers for EAZs and their pay will be subject to head hunting and negotiation.
<P>
Presumably, the Government think that that is a good idea because it is in the Bill. But why cherry pick? Why not extend the provision to foundation and voluntary-aided schools, which would certainly welcome it. Will the Minister endorse those two types of schools in the same way as the Bill endorses those that are part of EAZs?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I have no problem in supporting the amendments that have been tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton, save to say that they are perhaps a little too reasonable. I should prefer to go a little further. I have always been a proponent of rather more flexibility in teachers pay and conditions. That was allowed, to a certain extent, by the previous Government's provisions for grant-maintained schools.
<P>
It is a paradox that the Government have taken that flexibility away from grant-maintained schools, yet any school that comes within one of their education action zones can do precisely what the grant-maintained schools, in their new status, will be prevented from doing. If it is considered to be a useful measure for governing bodies to have such powers and the Government patently think that it is that flexibility should be offered to other schools as well, as proposed in the amendment. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will tell us why he believes that it is not suitable for those powers to be applied to other schools, given that he has accepted that they are useful powers.
<P>
There are a number of other issues about the way in which the disapplication of the statutory terms and conditions will be provided for, and how the system will operate. I thought that I had understood the clause, but the Minister's response to the debate on clause 12 has raised some extra issues. In particular, I am concerned about the employing body for teachers. It seems that teachers will continue to be employed by the local education authority, notwithstanding that another body, which could be from the private sector, is involved Procter and Gamble was mentioned earlier, or it could be Nord Anglia. Such companies could be given the power to run a group of schools, but they will not be the employing authority.
<P>
How does the Minister think it will be possible to run the schools if the companies are not the employing authority? When discussing pay and conditions, the Minister said that the teacher will be employed by the LEA on the previous basis, but there will be an extra contract. He did not say that the terms and conditions under which the teacher is employed will be flexible and subject to change according to the forum's decision about what is right for the schools in an education action zone. It is a recipe at best for complication and at worst for disaster, if teachers have to run two contracts of employment. Perhaps the Minister will consider the operational problems of such an outcome.
<P>
The School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991 may apply, but what, for example, will be the teachers' pensions entitlement in respect of any extra money that they earn during their period of employment in the education action zone? I realise that the pension fund arrangements with the local authority are on a notional basis, so it is not a matter of storing up funds, as it is in the private sector. The issue is whether there will be long-term recognition that the teacher has, for a period of time, been on a different contract of employment that may involve extra pay.
<P>
Flexibility in pay and conditions should be extended more generally; that is why I support the amendment in respect of foundation and voluntary-aided schools. However, the Minister must set out the operational matters in more detail. For example, how will they work in practice, especially in respect of the employing authority and the ability to vary conditions in one contract when another substantive contract is still in place?
<P>
As I said earlier, we want flexibility in terms and conditions for teachers. The concept of the Bill is correct as it provides for greater flexibility, but it should be extended to those schools that already have that flexibility, but believe that it might be removed. The Government accept the concept; they should extend it to other schools rather than saying that it should be applied only in the education action zones.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) in supporting the amendment, which is an important move towards greater flexibility. I echo the words of my hon. Friend in saying that flexibility is always a good thing and something that I would generally support. It is especially important that this amendment and others refocus the Committee's attention on the importance of applying the same kind of treatment and the same logic across the board. It is absurd to give greater flexibility to certain schools generally failing schools in the belief that it will help them to improve their standards, but to deny it to other schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman explain why, under the previous Administration, it was perfectly all right for the Government to create terms and conditions that were different for grant-maintained schools, but you are now arguing for exactly the opposite?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not arguing for anything.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am happy to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, As he well knows, grant-maintained status was available to all schools, many of which would have been delighted if such status had become universal. The previous Government followed a more democratic approach in these matters than the present Government and did not force that model on the school system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The previous Government were not seeking to impose a process of disapplication of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991, but to open that door to any school that wished to participate, whereas the Labour Government's proposals slam the door on a majority of schools while opening up this welcome freedom to some of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I agree with my right hon. Friend. I would even go slightly further and say that they also deny those freedoms to schools whose children's parents have voted for them, which is a bizarre turn of events. Subject to the Chair's ruling, we shall reach that subject on Thursday.
<P>
One of the key practical purposes and values of the amendment is surely that, although it would not help all schools, it might help schools that had been part of education action zones. One practical difficulty that I thought that I detected in the Minister's earlier comments was that, where staff terms and conditions are suspended and different terms applied, that will be done through some form of additional contract, which, presumably, would allow an additional payment for specific duties. If a member of staff were employed for three or five years on the basis that that they were to have extra duties, and extra remuneration for them, it might be difficult for them to remain in those schools if the EAZ status ended and the funding ceased to be available. The flexibility, which the amendment would increase at least in the interests of foundation and voluntary-aided schools would allow schools to maintain the pay and conditions of teachers who made an especially valuable contribution. That would be very welcome.
<P>
The EAZ is, as we know, a sort of pilot scheme, which Ministers, including the Secretary of State, may wish to extend widely. It may have been suggested that it could even form the basis for a completely new model of education, which may ultimately circumvent the role of the local education authority. Some of my hon. Friends may have considerable sympathy with the suggestion. If the so-called pilot scheme was intended as a model to be built upon, why not extend more of the powers, freedoms and flexibilities of all schools and in the context of the amendment, foundation and voluntary-aided schools especially rather than hold them within the bounds of the forum?
<P>
Finally, can the Minister tell us the scope of the envisaged exemptions? Would the hiring and firing provisions of the 1991 Act still apply if the Act were disapplied? I look forward to a specific response to those questions when the Under-Secretary sums up.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> It seems strange that many of the comments of the amendment's supporters related to giving opportunities to all schools, whereas we are giving opportunities for this type of work only to schools in EAZ areas. I note that, as drafted, the amendment would not extend those opportunities to community schools within the new framework. That provision matches the actions of the Conservatives when in government; they extended the opportunities only to grant-maintained schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> As I reminded the Minister earlier, the Government's legislation does not provide for community schools to employ their teachers, so it would be quite hard to extend the principle to those schools.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> It could have been extended to their employers had the right hon. Gentleman's Government wished it. We are making the point made by the Liberal Democrats that, when the Conservative Government had the option to make the provision available to all schools, they chose not to; they gave it only to schools in the grant-maintained sector.
<P>
Some Conservative Members have got it right the proposal involves testing out ideas that could lead to improved standards in schools. As we made clear this morning, we want to go about introducing the proposal in a measured way, monitoring it carefully to see what is happening and evaluating the consequences, because we want to get it right. The danger of not piloting it is that we may get it wrong; it is too important a matter to get wrong.
<P>
The Government are being quite reasonable in saying that in an EAZ a series of freedoms must be available to the forum and the schools within it; we want to see how the proposal works. It is possible that, at the end of the period, some of the flexibility that has come about through the ability to adjust pay and conditions will be seen to have worked, and we may wish to move further on that in the years following the EAZ, but at the moment we want to tread carefully and monitor carefully what is happening. Those are our reasons for wanting to restrict the freedom to schools in an EAZ. That is a sensible way for the Government to start taking action on a sensitive issue that is important to children in schools and their teachers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I fear that the Under-Secretary may be seeking to reinvent the wheel. Why cannot she learn from the success of grant-maintained schools and accept that these flexibilities have already been tested and shown to work. They have helped to benefit schools and raise standards. It is proven, so why do we need a new pilot exercise to see if it works again?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that only two grant-maintained schools opted to vary pay and conditions. Therefore, if we regard the GM sector as the great experiment to establish whether the flexibility to alter terms and conditions was desired, we will have to conclude that schools do not want it. The amendment is not based on the evidence of GM schools' actions when they were able to make the change.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I said, only two schools adopted the change. The legislation allows for such schools to continue. One reason they did not experiment further was that it was not part of a proper pilot scheme that could be monitored and evaluated. We are now conducting a proper pilot. It may be that altering pay and conditions is one way of improving standards in schools. However, in view of that great experiment, I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman is not proposing amendments to prevent the possibility of terms and conditions being changed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Is not the Under-Secretary destroying her own case? She is right that only two schools exercised the option, so is it sensible to move the project forward without thinking of the potentially huge consequences, particularly for schools that have to return to LEA control when their three or five years are completed?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Matters have changd since then and I shall provide the hon. Gentleman with some examples. In the past eight or nine months, the Government have placed great emphasis on out-of-school learning literacy summer schools, community schools and homework centres. All those places support learning outside what is usually regarded as a traditional school day. In the heyday of GM schools, that emphasis was not present.
<P>
The main attraction is that the project does not stand alone: it is part of an approach or package that schools or forums may or may not want to adopt in conjunction with other measures.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know from the guidelines on EAZs that we expect all zones to have literacy summer schools, homework centres and so forth. In view of children's learning experiences, it may be desirable to alter terms and conditions so that schools can provide a teaching force that is able to meet the new demands. The problem with the GM sector was that the policy was a stand-alone measure, not part of a package of wider measures providing a co-ordinated approach that could benefit teachers' teaching and children's learning.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> May I seek clarification? I am slightly confused about the Under-Secretary's comments and those of the Minister for School Standards in our earlier debate on clause 12. I had understood that the employing authority would continue to be the LEA, but the Minister for School Standards suggested that the education action forum might choose to have a separate contract to pay for extra services provided by teachers. The Under-Secretary has just implied that some of those services might be literacy summer schools, home-work centres and so forth.
<P>
I have two questions. First, as I read the Bill, the terms of employment with the LEA can be varied by the powers in the clause rather than by the addition of an extra contract. I would appreciate technical clarification of that matter. Secondly, some teachers who are involved in literacy summer schools and homework centres may not be paid extra because their terms and conditions are not altered to reflect that. Yet, in the same town, teachers working in schools under an EAZ might be paid under separate arrangements for doing the same thing. Will the Under-Secretary clarify that matter?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Teachers have never been compelled to teach in summer literary schools or homework clubs. Many choose to do that because it is an effective method of supporting their pupils and raising standards. We should give them credit for that, and thank the hundreds and thousands of teachers who undertook that task before the advent of a Government who emphasised its usefulness. The activities will continue because teachers choose to undertake them owing to their professionalism and commitment to teaching.
<P>
Education action zones are about being imaginative and can be used to ascertain, through initiatives, whether we can give our kids a better deal. If we did not dare to examine teachers' pay and conditions, we would waste an opportunity that is offered by the most innovative approach to deprived urban and rural education for many decades. The clause is drafted in that spirit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree that it is desirable to examine teachers' pay and conditions in the context of an innovative approach to specific local circumstances. However, will the Minister answer the specific question that my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead asked in her initial contribution about the comments of the Minister for School Standards on Nord Anglia or Procter and Gamble or another private-sector firm employing a teacher? The Minister seemed to rule out the employment of a teacher by such a firm, which would be responsible, under contract to the forum for providing the required education service for the children of a particular area. Do the Government rule it out? It is an important point of principle on which the Minister for School Standards seemed to cast doubt.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I shall try to clarify that. My hon. Friend will also do so when he deals with the next amendment, which covers the same point.
<P>
Teachers will continue to be employed by the LEA or the governing body, depending on the sort of school that employs them within the EAZ. The forum, not Nord Anglia or Procter and Gamble, will run the partnership. The forum may choose to employ teachers for specific tasks. For example, it may wish to employ foreign language specialists in the primary sector to prepare children for key stages 3 and 4. We lag behind in this country in providing such support for our key stage 1 and 2 youngsters.
<P>
Sometimes music is not well taught at key stages 1 and 2. The forum, not the companies, could employ a teacher to work in schools in the partnership on that subject. However, the teachers at the schools would continue to be employed by the governing body or the LEA. That is clear from the guidelines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister seems to be driving a coach and horses through the policy and the way in which it has been presented to the public, the teaching profession and the school world in the past few weeks. We have been told that forums show the Government's willingness to learn from the charter school principle as it is applied in the United States. But the principles that the Under-Secretary outlined are a million miles away from that. She said that the education action forum would operate by an obscure process of osmosis, not a[Mr. Dorrell]
direct employer-employee relationship between a private firm, responsible for education, and an individual teacher. A few teachers with a special brief may rove around the education action zone, but the Under-Secretary has undermined the central principle of the charter schools, which is making an alternative body responsible for providing education. Which version of Government policy is the Committee being asked to endorse: the newspaper account of a radical Government who are willing to consider new ideas for improving children's education, or the watered-down version that the Under-Secretary outlined?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Morris:</B> In answer to the right hon. Gentleman's intervention, I was trying to answer the question that both he and the hon. Member for Maidenhead had asked about who employs the teachers.
<P>
I gave one example of the partnership employing some teachers to work in a variety of ways. Another example might be that of home-school links. That does not take away from anything that I said previously about the radical ideas for teachers in schools within an education action zone or for terms and conditions to be varied to meet the new circumstances. Those ideas can work side by side. That is not a problem. The ideas are radical, and I sought to offer some reassurance and clarity about who employs teachers.
<P>
I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that it would be inappropriate to extend the facility to vary terms and pay to other schools. It is a pilot project and an important test of what can be done with teachers' pay and conditions. The Government want to get it right; we want to monitor and consult. A test-bed in an education action zone is the right way to do that. If the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton does not wish to withdraw the amendment, I ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It is disappointing to listen to the Minister. She seems to be moving from one argument to the other. On the one hand, we are told that the policy will free up the employment of teachers, which will inevitably lead to raised standards. On the other hand, we are told that it is a practicality, to provide peripatetic teachers who can work across an education action zone. It is either one or the other. Perhaps it is both. I would accept it if the Minister thought that it was such a good policy that it would fulfil both criteria, but she does not seem to know which one is being presented to us in the Bill. That is why we have challenged it.
<P>
The amendments were tabled from the best possible motives.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> As always.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Of course. The Government have told us that they are innovative and are introducing policies that will raise standards. They have a new, radical approach, as we have heard from the Minister this afternoon. Conservative Members have said: "We will trust you. It is such a good idea extend it to even more schools". Yet, as soon as we put that proposal to the Minister, down come the shutters and she thinks of 101 reasons why the Government's good ideas should not be extended to other schools.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): We suffered from piloting at the hands of the previous Administration, when there was no way in which the piloting was going to influence events. Has the hon. Lady realised that, if experimentation brings benefits, they can then be applied universally? We do not want to go round the country making one mistake after another, which seemed to be the model on which grant-maintained schools were based.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> If I understood the Under-Secretary correctly, she said that the provisions in the clause will form part of a pilot scheme and that it will be assessed. However, she has not said that, if it is a success she will extend it not only to the voluntary-aided and the foundation schools, as specified in the amendment, but to all schools. If she had confidence in the policy, she would hope to come to that conclusion.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Would not it be better for the hon. Lady to do some probing in more sensible areas, rather than pursuing the historically unimportant areas described in the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I seek your support, Mr. Gale. Surely it is the right of members of the Committee to probe whatever areas they deem fit. The hon. Gentleman was most discourteous in his choice of words.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Lady has the ultimate remedy. She does not have to give way. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I shall not give way to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk for a long time.
<P>
We have not achieved much clarification from the Government about the purpose of the clause. I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 11, line 37, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) No order shall be made by the Secretary of State under subsection (4) except after consultation with the following bodies:
<P>
(a) such associations of local education authorities as appear to him to be concerned and any local education authority with whom consultation appears to him to be desirable;
<P>
(b) such bodies representing the interests of governors as appear to him to be appropriate;
<P>
(c) such bodies representing school teachers as appear to him to be concerned.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
During our deliberations on the previous amendment, we heard from the Under-Secretary, that the disapplication of pay and conditions was of the nature of a pilot, that she was determined that we get it right and that the Government wanted to consult. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Private conversations should be conducted quietly, or preferably outside the Room.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> As I was saying, the Under-Secretary said that she was keen to consult. The purpose of the amendment is to raise the issue of who should be consulted about disapplication of pay and conditions and the means by which such consultation will take place.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 13 as drafted simply requires the governing bodies of the schools in a zone proposing to opt out of the teachers' pay and conditions document to consult the teachers concerned. The amendment would reproduce the requirements imposed on the Secretary of State in section 1(5)(a), (b) and (c) of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991 to consult LEAs, governors and teachers' organisations about the report of the school teachers' review body before giving effect to its recommendations. That is what has been agreed by the present Government and previous Governments: consultation should take place on issues related to pay and conditions.
<P>
As has been pointed out, there is one exception to that rule, which relates to grant-maintained schools. If a grant-maintained school wants to disapply, the requirement is only that governors consult teachers in that one school before proceeding, subject to various other requirements.
<P>
That route, which applies at present to grant-maintained schools, is inappropriate for many reasons. The Committee will be well aware that there is no direct parallel between the provisions for GM schools and those for education action zones. Indeed, the Under-Secretary has made it clear that in the vast majority of cases she cited as exceptions teachers who may be employed by the forum and teachers in foundation schools regardless of any decision taken by the education action forum, terms and conditions of employment will remain the subject of a contract between the individual teacher and the local education authority.
<P>
An education action zone could include a large number of schools perhaps 20 or more. Therefore, the procedure that applies to a single grant-maintained school choosing to disapply terms and conditions of employment is inappropriate. As we have heard, only two GM schools have bothered to use this route. We need a different route. The sheer mechanics of trying to consult all the teachers in all the schools, as the sole means of sorting the matter out, would present a logistical nightmare.
<P>
Local education authorities have found it helpful to consult organisations representing teachers. That ensures that policies are dealt with far more rationally and cogently than would be the case if all the governing bodies consulted teachers individually and then tried to bring the results together.
<P>
It could even be argued that it would breach the spirit, if not the letter, of the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, which the Government support, if organisations representative of employees were not consulted. Unless there is representation of the kind that I have described, employees will not have access to the range of expertise that they will surely need to help them form their own conclusions on such issues as equal opportunities and health and safety at work. Those issues will form part of the terms and conditions of employment that the education action forum seeks to change.
<P>
If there is no such consultation with the professional associations representing employers, somewhere down the line perhaps not immediately there will be a significantly increased need for industrial tribunal-style action, with the various problems that could arise in association with that. Bearing that in mind, as well as the fact that there is an opportunity for considerable flexibility within the existing pay and conditions legislation, I hope that Labour Members at least those on the Front Bench will see the great merit of consultation with teacher representatives and the other bodies detailed in the amendment, in addition to the proposed consultation between individual governing bodies and employees within individual schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It does not seem unreasonable to request that teacher representatives should be consulted whether that needs to be enshrined in statute is another matter. It would therefore be helpful if the Minister told us whether he believes there should be consultation, even if it is not incorporated in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I draw the Committee's attention to clause 13, which states that:
"Before making an application under subsection (1) ... " <P>

<P>
which is to disapply 
"the governing body of the participating school concerned shall consult the school teachers employed by them with respect to the proposed application."<P>

<P>
Consultation is therefore written into the Bill, which will totally meet the requirements of the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton. The consultation arrangements are specified in that subsection and it is not necessary to go through the very detailed consultation arrangements with the three bodies mentioned in the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Bath.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have nearly finished.
<P>
For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> That is amazingly disappointing. It is particularly disappointing that the Minister is not prepared to give way. There is a tradition that Ministers give way in Committee on important issues, so that hon. Members' views can be placed on the record. I suspect that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton is somewhat disappointed that she has not got much of an answer to her question.
<P>
The problem that now faces the Committee is that it is implicit in the arrangements for teachers' pay and conditions and, I assume, still accept accepted by the Government that teachers' professional associations should be invited to make their comments known to the pay review body and that the Secretary of State, subject to making a decision on the pay review body's recommendations, will also consult the professional associations representing teachers. I hope that the Minister will at least assure us that that procedure will continue. If he does not, it implies that the Government want each governing body to start[Mr. Foster]
negotiating on pay and conditions with the staff in its school and that they seek to break away from the existing pay and conditions arrangements. It would be worrying if there were no opportunity for that matter to be debated in Committee and for us to receive stronger reassurances than we have heard today.
<P>
It is an important issue and I had hoped to receive reasonable reassurances on it along the lines that the hon. Lady sought that there would be appropriate consultation with the governing body, the LEA and the teachers' associations. If I had, I would have withdrawn the amendment. However, given that the Minister was uncharacteristically unhelpful in his response, it must be right for me to press the amendment to a Division.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
Question proposed. That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I wish to inform the Committee that the Government will table amendments on Report to deal with one or two matters in respect of clause 13. At present, it will allow each governing body to disapply the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991 and no power will be placed on the Secretary of State to agree or disagree with the details of its application. They would be left to the governing body to determine and it would merely be applying for disapplication.
<P>
The Government want proposals that will reward teachers adequately and well for their work. But, under clause 13 as it is drafted, that may not be the case as, in effect, a governing body will be given a blank cheque by the Secretary of State agreeing to disapplication. We are not happy with those arrangements. We shall approve proposals to disapply only when we have details of the changes that the governing bodies want to introduce.
<P>
I can inform the hon. Member for Bath that, when the Secretary of State considers the proposals, he will want to examine the details of the consultation that has taken place. Obviously, we expect the representatives of teachers to have been consulted about such details. We shall have the opportunity to debate Government amendments on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister said that the Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment that the grant-maintained schools that opted out of the provision under the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991 could remain exempt from it. Where does that provision appear in the Bill? The hon. Gentleman may not know the answer to that immediately, but, when he does, he may like to report back to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Without notice, I cannot answer that question. I assure the right hon. Gentleman, however, that there is a provision somewhere in the Bill and I think that it concerns the way in which disapplication takes place. However, I shall write to members of the Committee about it. I think that it is contained in schedule 13, or is it clause 13 [Hon. Members: "It's coming."] Paragraph 2 of schedule 13 contains that provision. I knew that it would come to me eventually, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I hope that I have assisted hon. Members. We shall bring forward proposals to give the Secretary of State the final say on the details of what is to replace teachers' national pay and conditions. In the process, we shall want to see the consultation that has taken place.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> After all that we have heard about innovation and radical policies, the Minister ends up saying that the Government will not give them that freedom. Lo and behold, a new clause is to be introduced on Report, allowing the Secretary of State to take the powers to himself. I wonder whether the Government will ever trust schools, governing bodies, teachers or even the forums that they are setting up. On the one hand they say, "This pilot scheme is innovative; we shall see how it goes." Yet in the same breath they say about teachers' pay and conditions, "We are not really going to let them do that; the Secretary of State will decide for himself."
<P>
The Government must make up their mind whether they are radical, and whether they trust governing bodies, parents and teachers. This is yet another example of what we find throughout the Bill yet more power being given to the Secretary of State. There is nothing radical about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am sorry to detain the Committee. Schedule 13 deals with the control of school premises by governing bodies. It seems unlikely that it also deals with the employment of teachers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The right hon. Gentleman will be happy to know that a piece of paper has gone back making exactly that point. I should have said schedule 30.

<P>
<B>Ms. Morris:</B> It is clearly an eminently sensible amendment, and I am happy to accept it. It was our intention that head teachers should be informed in that way. However, some head teachers may choose not to be part of the governing body, so it is entirely proper that head teachers should be included.

This is an even more eminently sensible amendment. As we seem to have set up our own education action zone in the Committee, perhaps this extremely important amendment could be accepted. I hope that the Committee will take the amendment on board because without it, in essence, LEAs will have unfettered powers to intervene in schools. Although LEAs perhaps do not have power over painting their school corridors, as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton suggested, they will have strong powers to intervene in schools.
<P>
The amendment would do two things. First, it states that a governing body has a right of appeal whenever an LEA gives it a warning notice. That is right for reasons of natural justice. An LEA might well act subjectively or heaven forbid under this new Government in a politically motivated way. If an LEA were to do so, surely the governing body should have the right to appeal.
<P>
Secondly, the amendment states that, if the governing body appeals to the Secretary of State, he must give the reasons why he either allows or rejects it. I hope that the Committee and Ministers support the safeguard for governing bodies which the amendment proposes.

<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Superficially certainly in the way in which the amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough there is an attraction in allowing governing bodies to appeal against warning notices. However, such a right of appeal would put the Secretary of State in the difficult position of having to second-guess the reasons for an LEA's decision.
<P>
The Government believe that such matters should be dealt with under education development plans, which we have debated at some length. Moreover, we believe that the prime responsibility for raising standards must rest with schools. It is for the LEA to ensure that a school is raising its standards and to issue a warning notice where it thinks appropriate. It would not be helpful if the governing body were then to have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State.
<P>
Under clause 5 we have given LEAs a duty to promote high standards and they should be able to exercise that new duty without being delayed constantly by the hurdles that might be put in their way by individual governing bodies. The amendment would provide governing bodies with an opportunity to create such difficulties.
<P>
The priority of governing bodies should be to raise standards within their schools, not to appeal against warning notices from LEAs. The amendment is inappropriate because it would hamper a school's progress from weakness to strength. For those reasons,I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Once again, I agree with the Minister. It seems slightly odd that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough who has made common cause with the official Opposition in other debates, expressing concern about the extent of the Secretary of State's powers under clauses 6 and 7 should seek to introduce the Secretary of State as a forum of appeal. I said earlier that the functions of the local education authority should be more narrowly defined. One function that the LEA is better placed than anyone else to carry out is to identify the schools where standards are slipping, and to take the necessary action. I agree with the Minister that if that is the LEA's function, it must have the power to carry it out; the clauses give LEAs that power. It is not sensible to give a school, which is subject to a warning notice that it is in the first of the three stages of potential failure, the right to immediate access to the Secretary of State.
<P>
I agree with the Minister, and if the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough were to push his[Mr. Dorrell]
amendment to a Division, I should invite my hon. Friends to support the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am disappointed by the comments of the right hon. Member for Charnwood, as the Secretary of State should be the last point of appeal. It is important to be able to appeal to the Government through the highest person in the education system. That should apply to governing bodies, too. Under the previous Administration, schools and government bodies appealed to the Secretary of State on many occasions.
<P>
I am disappointed with the Minister's response. We do not envisage recourse to the appeals system being an everyday occurrence. We hope that LEAs will use their powers extremely rarely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): The hon. Gentleman's argument does not take into account the nature of practical educational politics. How will his proposal work in practice? The Spanish empire in the 17th century was very bureaucratic, and there was a saying, "If death came from Madrid, I would be immortal." Is there not a danger that if we pursue what the hon. Gentleman suggests, the Minister will be in a similar position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> Does that mean that it would take a long time? The fault in the Minister's response to our argument was that the Secretary of State would find it difficult to judge the appeal. Clearly, the LEA would immediately be able to put its case; it is not beyond the wit of man in this electronic age to require the LEA, as soon as it submits a notice that is appealed against, to take its decision to the Secretary of State. Surely, it will have had good grounds for taking that decision. All we are asking is that a governing body, if it is subject to the rule of Hackney education authority, for example, has the right to appeal. The Minister does not feel that that is the case.
<P>
We have given the matter an airing and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The amendment is similar to the previous one. The Committee will accept the comments made by the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who spoke about the importance of the LEA's role in identifying schools and having the power to take the necessary action. In our later debates on the code of practice, for example I hope that there will be greater clarity about the LEA's key functions. It has always been the case that when a power is given to take a decision, the right to appeal against that decision is also given, and the person who hears that appeal is someone other than the person who took the decision. The amendment would merely give a governing body, on which an LEA had imposed additional governors, the right to appeal. The most obvious person to whom it can appeal who has not been involved in the decision, is the Secretary of State. Some will argue that the poor old Secretary of State is being asked to do more and more. I hope that in another place some of the Secretary of State's powers will be removed to free up some time for him to consider matters such as the appeals mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough.
<P>
I am sure that the Committee must find it ludicrous that the entire strategic planning for the whole of the further education sector lies in the hands of just one person the Secretary of State. I am also sure that he would be delighted to divest himself of that responsibility in order to devote more time to other issues. How does the Minister believe a governing body that has had additional governors imposed upon it, for reasons with which they are not happy, will handle that apparent injustice?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The powers within the clause relate to schools that are failing, schools that have serious weaknesses or schools that have been subject to a formal warning notice hopefully a relatively small number of schools. Experience shows that one of the most helpful devices open to an LEA is to appoint additional governors for such schools. That was introduced by the previous Government; it was one of their successful innovations that we want to retain. The clause does precisely that.
<P>
However, it is inappropriate to allow an individual school to appeal against the appointment of those governors. Once again, that would be a barrier or hurdle that would obstruct the LEA from discharging its duty to promote high standards, as specified in clause 5. I understood the hon. Member for Bath's point when he asked what a school could do if it felt that the local education authority was acting unreasonably, perhaps in relation to the appointment of individuals who conflict with the school's aims.
<P>
Section 496 of the Education Act 1996 is an underlying provision that will allow a school to appeal to the Secretary of State if an LEA is discharging any of its responsibilities in an unreasonable manner. Schools have recourse to that provision. That is appropriate and it is unnecessary to add to it by building into the Bill a specific power to appeal against the appointment of governors by LEAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for drawing our attention to section 496 of the 1996 Act, which allows schools to appeal in circumstances described by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and me. It is odd, though, that in his response to my hon. Friend, the Minister said that it was inappropriate to have recourse to appeals to the Secretary of State. Leaving aside that slight inconsistency in the Minister's response, the right of appeal exists in other legislation, which the Bill will not repeal. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 81 in page 14, leave out line 42 and insert 
<P>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is an amendment to give to the voluntary-aided sector the same powers that we give to local education authorities to appoint additional governors to failing schools. If a voluntary-aided school is failing, it is appropriate to allow the relevant authorities to appoint additional foundation governors. Government amendment No. 81 would allow the authorities to do precisely that.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 16, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
 <H4><center>Clause 17</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 16, line 6, leave out from "Act" to end of line 7.
<P>
We are considering the right of appeal again. I hope that the Minister agrees that the Bill seems inconsistent. I am constantly hoping that the Minister will agree with something perhaps he will by the end of six weeks.
<P>
The amendment deals with the ability to appeal against the suspension of delegated budgets. Schedule 15 appears to provide for appeal against such suspension on grounds of financial mismanagement. However, there is no right of appeal if the suspension is based on performance. The amendment would remove that inconsistency and give schools and governors the right to appeal against suspension on both grounds.

<P>

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The arguments against the amendment are similar to those that my hon. Friend the Minister used when considering previous amendments. The responsibility for raising standards rests with schools, supported by local authorities. They should be seen to exercise their responsibility and make the decisions. A right of appeal to the Secretary of State is unnecessary.
<P>
Schools could appeal to the Secretary of State under section 496 of the Education Act 1996. It is not appropriate or necessary to include a right of appeal in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> In the light of those comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of Secretary of State to appoint additional governors</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 144, in page 16, line 14, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A)Before giving a direction under subsection (1), the Secretary of State shall consult 
<P>
(a)the Chief Inspector;
<P>
(b)the local education authority and the governing body of the school;
<P>
(c)in the case of a foundation or voluntary aided school which is a Church of England School, a Church of Wales school or a Roman Catholic Church school the appropriate diocesan authority;
<P>
(d)in the case of any other foundation or voluntary aided school, the person who appoints the foundation governors; and
<P>
(e)such other persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause covers the Secretary of State's powers to appoint additional governors. I do not oppose the principle of granting the Secretary of State additional powers to deal with a school that is subject to special measures. To use a metaphor that was heard earlier, the Secretary of State acts as a sort of long-stop to reinforce the obligations that the Bill rightly places on the LEA. If the Secretary of State believes that the LEA is not dealing effectively with a school that has received a report from the chief inspector to say that it requires special measures, should have a long-stop power.
<P>
The amendment would provide that the Secretary of State had a duty to consult before exercising the power. I commented earlier on the relative powers of the LEA and the Secretary of State to deal with schools where there are problems. The LEA should be the first line of defence in dealing with a school where there is a developing problem on which the chief inspector has reported. In earlier debates, I tried to confine the LEA, in a short list of obligations, to focusing on the problems that we are considering. If that is the LEA's role, there should be consultation between the Secretary of State and the LEA before the Secretary of State uses powers over the LEA's head.
<P>
It is unlikely that the set of circumstances required for the Secretary of State to use his powers under section 18 of the new Act will come out of the blue. It would be a sensible safeguard for the Secretary of State to have an obligation to consult the list of consultees set out in my amendment I am happy to accept propositions to add to or subtract from that list. The list of consultees is essentially the same as that in clause 19, when the Secretary of State can use his powers to close a school, with the addition of the chief inspector, which I think is appropriate in both cases.
<P>
It would be a valuable defence if the Secretary of State were required to consult interested parties. They are likely to be the group of consultees who know more about the position on the ground in a school than the Secretary of State or his officials in the DFEE. It is necessary, from the local perspective, to ensure that there is a proper understanding of the local position before the Secretary of State exercises his power. It is also in the interests of the Secretary of State to ensure[Mr. Dorrell]
that he does not go tramping into a local situation without understanding every aspect that may not have been fully understood by his officials in the Department.
<P>
The amendment is not moved in a spirit of objection to the principle of the clause quite the contrary. The principle of the clause is sensible, but it would be a sensible safeguard for the Secretary of State, before exercising his power, to undertake a range of consultation that reflects the contents of amendment No. 144.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall ask the Committee to resist the amendment. There is a clear distinction between the powers under clause 18, referring to the appointment of additional governors by the Secretary of State, and the power under clause 19, allowing the Secretary of State to direct the closure of a particular school. Clearly that power is a drastic step and it is only right that there should be full consultation with all the relevant players. Therefore, a distinction can be drawn between clauses 18 and 19.
<P>
There is nothing to stop the Secretary of State consulting on clause 18 on the way in which to exercise his powers to appoint additional governors. The argument is only about whether it should be included in the Bill. There will obviously be consultation certainly with the LEA and foundation or voluntary-aided school, because in all likelihood they will have appointed additional governors themselves under the powers given to them in the previous clause.
<P>
I must question the need to consult the chief inspector. There seems to be confusion about his role. He, rightly, will advise on the progress of a school. It would be a quite different role to expect him to advise on organisational changes or on how the powers are exercised. I am not sure that it would be appropriate to provide the chief inspector as a right, by statute, with the power to be consulted on a Secretary of State's decision to appoint additional governors. I cannot see how that fits in with the way we see the chief inspector's role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I wrote the chief inspector into the amendment, and pre-empted the debate on clause 19 by mentioning him, because when we consider the schools where the most serious problems exist and ask ourselves who knows best what is happening, surely on any short list, the chief inspector not necessarily him exclusively, but either him or the person who did the groundwork leading to his report must be among the most knowledgeable people locally in the circumstances and permutations of the situation. By not giving themselves access to that knowledge, the Government would be taking the decisions provided for in clauses 18 or 19 without consulting the person most likely to be among the best informed about the circumstances.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> There is a distinction between consultation and the provision of valuable information. The chief inspector will provide details of the progress of a given school through what is usually a termly monitoring report. The Secretary of State has the power, under the School Inspections Act 1996, to request a report on a failing school from Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools if he considers it desirable, although he will have up-to-date information from the termly reports provided by the same source. Therefore, whether through consultation or the provision of information, the expert advice of which the right hon. Gentleman spoke would be available through the usual procedures undertaken by the chief inspector.
<P>
I do not think that it is necessary to specify the chief inspector. There will be continuing dialogue with the local education authority and the foundation or voluntary aided schools. For those reasons, and given that there will be full consultation as well as the information that I have mentioned, I do not think that it is necessary to put this detail in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want to prolong the debate. I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that he expects consultation to take taken place about the use of the powers under clause 18. However, once again the Government's defence has been that all this will happen whether or not it is written in statute a defence that hon. Members who have been in the House for some years will have heard previously from a number of different mouths. However, I do not wish to press to a vote a proposition to disallow Ministers that defence. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 16, leave out lines 20 to 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 52, in page 16, line 21, leave out "remuneration and".
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> We have grave concern about the Secretary of State's powers to pay remuneration and allowances to a governor. It seems highly unlikely that those payments will be given only to members of the governing body. Under the powers taken by the Secretary of State, almost certainly the position of chairman of governors would carry remuneration and allowances.
<P>
Several points arise. First, the proposal cuts right across the ethos of governing bodies the spirit of voluntarism. It would be greatly resented by other governors and prove a disincentive to others wishing to serve. Secondly, it would mean that an appointee of the Secretary of State would be remunerated. This again would lend itself not under the present Secretary of State to political appointees in a post carrying an attractive remuneration package. If members of a governing body appointed by the Secretary of State in particular, the chairman were to be remunerated, there would be great resentment at the very time an appointee might need to carry the governing body of a school with him. Thirdly, the suggestion begs the question whether, if such remuneration is necessary, the Secretary of State would appoint someone from the local community, or a person from some distance away on the quid pro quo that travel expenses would be part of the remuneration package.
<P>
Clause 18(3) should be deleted from the Bill. It would set a bad precedent. It is not a good way of dealing with the immediate problem that will face the Secretary of State. It would certainly be a disincentive to people who might consider volunteering to serve on governing bodies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I should like to associate myself with many of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton. They also relate to amendment No. 52, and we are clearly thinking on the same lines.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members are aware of the enormous number of people who sit on governing bodies and do such a good job. We are opposed to the idea of paying some of the Secretary of State's lackeys to do that job. However, we should like to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt. Why do we need salaried governors? How will they be different to the chairs of governing bodies and the governors who are already serving? I have had the pleasure of working with a number of governing bodies over the years, and some of them would have been insulted if someone came in and was paid to do their job. It is one of the essential jobs in our schools, and its voluntary nature gives it a special flavour.
<P>
Will the Minister tell us where the funding for such appointments would come from? Will the Secretary of State pay for them from central resources? Will the funding have to come from the schools budget, or will it be an LEA cost or an education action zone cost?
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I also wish to support the comments made about amendment No. 143 by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton. For some time, there has been a debate about whether governors should be paid. I have heard many Labour councillors say that, as a general principle, governors should be paid. That goes totally against the spirit that has always existed of people from the local community voluntarily giving up their time to govern their schools. They give their time, their expertise and their knowledge of the local community and of the school.
<P>
It would be unfortunate if the provisions of the Bill allowed the Secretary of State to choose to pay a particular governor, in particular circumstances. Under the clause, the power is not that all governors brought in by the Secretary of State shall be paid, in recognition of the fact that they are additional members of the governing body. The power is that the Secretary of State may choose to pay any governor. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton suggested that the implication might be that a new chairman was to be paid. That is not the wording in the Bill, however. The payment of an additional governor is entirely at the whim of the Secretary of State.
<P>
The Secretary of State has been given a sweeping power in which there is no clarity whatever. Problems might occur when existing governors have not been paid and an incoming governor is paid. It might be necessary for the Secretary of State to use this power of intervention in two schools he might consider it appropriate to pay in one of them and not in the other.
<P>
The establishment of the precedent of payment could be unfortunate. Many people might say to the Secretary of State, "I understand that you pay for this. Will you pay for my appointment?" That would cut across the spirit that has always existed I am not sure that "voluntaryism" is the correct term and the concept that people are willing to give their time voluntarily for the good of their local schools. It would be unfortunate if the power were included in the Bill, and I therefore support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The Government are learning from experience our experience of giving support to the 18 schools that we identified last May as having been on special measures for an unacceptably long time. They had not made any real progress. We offered them consultancy support and some of them took it in terms of help for the head teacher or help with specific subjects, such as literacy and numeracy. Some schools thought that it would be helpful for a chair of a governing body to talk to them about the positive role that governors can play in helping to turn around a failing school.
<P>
People were paid by the Department on a consultancy basis to advise a governing body about the positive role that it could play in improving the standards in a school. They made a good contribution to helping those schools take themselves off special measures. That idea was not original. It was interesting to hear the criticism of the official Opposition, because when the Conservative Secretary of State appointed additional governors to Stratford school, she found a simple device by which she could pay the individuals concerned, even though there was no clear power to do so.
<P>
The then Secretary of State appointed Mrs. Daphne Gould as a governor to Stratford school, which she was perfectly entitled to do. She then realised that she had no power to pay her, so Mrs. Gould was appointed as a consultant and paid from the Department's consultancy fund. She received, through consultancy arrangements, money for taking on the role of a governor of Stratford school. We are being open about such matters and putting such arrangements into the Bill. We are not talking about a behind-the-scenes consultancy deal. If people have the skills that will help to turn a school around, we want to be up front and give ourselves the power to pay them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> It does not say in the Bill that the Secretary of State will make available such funds to employ an outside consultant to assist the governing body. It clearly states that the Secretary of State will intervene, yet again, in the affairs of that governing body and appoint a governor. That is different from an outside consultant being available to the governing body, albeit that, having availed itself of a consultant paid by the Secretary of State, the governing body may deem him to be useful and beneficial to the school and wish to co-opt him on to the governing body. That is a different scenario from the powers in the Bill that the Secretary of State is yet again taking to himself. It is entirely in his gift who that person is and the conditions and terms under which that person is statutorily entitled to sit on a governing body.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Lady managed to avoid the point about Daphne Gould. Her argument related to my description of how we would use the consultants for the[Mr. Byers]
18 failing schools in the light of the role that they played. The Government would much rather be open and honest than undertake matters in a behind-the-scenes way. The way in which a governor appointed by a Conservative Secretary of State was paid through a consultancy arrangement for carrying out that role is not one that we endorse.
<P>
We want to be honest and open about matters because there are individuals whose useful experience will help to turn a school around. If necessary, they will be paid, and it is appropriate to have the power to do so under the Bill. It is also worth noting that when we reach clause 35 and schedule 11, we shall consider having increased flexibility to pay the expenses of serving governors. Many governors spend a great deal of money in expenses necessary to discharge their reponsibilities.
<P>
When governors have experience of turning a school around, we must use that expertise to help individual schools. If that means that the Department provides money to enable that to happen, that is a good use of public funds. Governors have a vital role to play in turning a school around. Some individuals have an expertise that has been shown to work in practice. We want to harness that experience so that it benefits more schools than the one or two in which such people are directly involved. That is why the power is necessary and why we shall resist the amendments.

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister is opening a Pandora's box. His solution to a specific short-term problem has long-term consequences for governing bodies generally. It would be to the detriment of schools if governors or potential governors were to suffer prejudice because the Secretary of State had put in place and remunerated key people.
<P>
I hear what the Minister says about the validity of appointing consultants to assist the governing body, and about the Secretary of State making the resources available to fund that. I have no difficulty with that, but that is not what is in the Bill. As a result, I shall press the amendment to a Division.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"and the Secretary of State is satisfied that the closure of the school will not have an adverse effect on the supply of school places in the local education authority's area,".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a simple probing amendment. If a school is ordered to close, it may affect the balance of places within a local education authority. In particular, if a village school was ordered to close it would have a significant impact. The amendment would write that consideration into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough might reflect for a moment on the logic of the amendment. He suggests that if a school was failing so badly that the Secretary of State had concluded, in all the circumstances, that the only rational thing to do in the interests of the children was to close it, the Secretary of State should nevertheless stay his hand because of the balance of provision of places in the area.
<P>
Surely no member of the Committee believes that the state can deliver its obligation to educate the children of an area by keeping open a school that is palpably failing simply to keep the number of available places looking as though it is in balance. That absurd proposition seems to be the foundation of the amendment. I hope that the Under-Secretary's reaction will not be as moderate and restrained as mine she should make it clear that the Government will have no truck with it.

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The right hon. Member for Charnwood is right we hope that the Secretary of State will use this provision very rarely. The fact that it is an end-of-line provision shows how serious things might have become in such a school for those children and their parents. If it comes to that point, what must be uppermost in the Secretary of State's mind is the education well-being of those children.
<P>
I do not want to accept the amendment for that reason, but I assure the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that there is provision for the Secretary of State to consult many individuals and bodies, including local authorities. I hope that, in making their representations, local authorities will comment on the supply of places and what might happen to the children in their schools.
<P>
We must not remove the Secretary of State's ability to act decisively under the clause when a school is failing children and all the other measures that we have considered have failed to bring about an increase in standards. That must be at the forefront of his actions, which is why I will not accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I thank the Under-Secretary for the sensible way in which she responded to the amendment, which was in stark contrast to the speech of the shadow Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Charnwood. If he had thought a little, he would have realised that, for example, the closure of a small village school would have a knock-on effect those children would have to be placed in other schools, thereby affecting their education. In fact, many rural areas are tight on places. I thank the Under-Secretary for her comments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I intend to be brief, although this issue is of enormous importance. Part II deals with the new framework of maintained schools. The framework proposed in clause 20 and subsequent clauses introduces the concept of foundation school status. This group of amendments would remove foundation schools from the new framework. I hope that it will be possible to debate our reasons for opposing foundation school status at an apparently more logical time in debates on part II. I believe that the Committee should divide on this important issue.
<P>
My party was joined for a long time by the Labour party in stringently opposing grant-maintained status. We argued that having a special status for certain schools outside the LEA framework was inappropriate, divisive and would cause chaos and confusion. We also argued that it would lead, through parental ballots, to much disharmony between governors, between teachers and even between parents. That was the then Labour Opposition"s position before the general election.
<P>
In opposition, the Government opposed grant-maintained status. No doubt the Minister will vehemently deny this, but the Government are appeasing grant-maintained schools by giving them the opportunity to have foundation-school status. When have I made similar remarks in public meetings around the country, especially those attended by many Labour activists, our view that grant-maintained schools should be brought back within the strategic planning framework of the LEA has been widely supported by many Labour party activists, among others.
<P>
I will return to the consultation on the White Paper in much greater detail when we discuss clause 20, but the Minister will be well aware that during that consultation, about two thirds of Labour-controlled local education authorities objected strongly to the proposals for foundation schools. We know that there was also strong opposition in the broad range of responses to the consultation on the provisions of that clause. The clause does not have the support of the wider community, so we can assume only that it is proposed to appease the relatively few parents who voted for grant-maintained status.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I will give way to the hon. Gentleman if he assures me that he will not open up the big debate that I am sure the Committee is anxious to have when we reach clause 20.
<P>
<B>Mr. Marsden:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way; I do not intend to open up the discussion in the way that he describes. Given the comments made several times by him and by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the permanent revolution that occurred under the previous Government, is it not reasonable to draw a line under those matters and to move forward? It is not in the interests of the people and schools involved to pursue that point?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He has drawn stark attention to my concerns. If he is saying that the establishment of foundation status is a way of drawing a line under what the previous Government did by establishing grant-maintained schools, he is admitting what I have been implying that the creation of foundation schools is merely a vehicle to allow the continuation of grant-maintained schools. I am delighted that in this brief debate at least one Labour Member has admitted that.
[Mr. Foster]
<P>
I promised that I would be brief. I want to make it clear that the Liberal Democrats are fundamentally opposed to the Government's proposals for foundation school status. We will have the opportunity to explore that later, but I urge Labour members of the Committee, who at present think that foundation schools may be a good thing, to remember that in opposing the amendments they will be sustaining a policy that they fought vehemently for many years and during the general election campaign.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I will be brief and try to contain myself until Thursday, when I hope that we will have a full discussion on part II of the Bill. We have noted the Liberal Democrats' characteristic hostility to foundation schools, which we actually support. We will be opposing the amendments if they are pressed to a Division, and on Thursday we shall seek further to explore the prejudice of the Liberal Democrat party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We look forward to The Bath Chronicle being prayed in aid; we have heard that many times, but it will be a delight to hear it again.
<P>
The policy on which the Bill is based is one that was endorsed by the Labour party conference in 1995. There was some hostility to it. My noble Friend Lord Hattersley 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> That famous left-winger.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Yes, that famous left-winger, Lord Hattersley, defended the position, as he saw it, in the classically traditionalist way of a writer in The Guardian. I am pleased to say that he was overwhelmingly defeated by that Labour party conference. That conference decision formed the basis of a policy document and was part of the manifesto on which we stood for the election. We promised to have three categories of school and a new framework that is not grant maintained or LEA controlled, but is a new way forward based on fair admissions and fair funding. We put that framework before the electorate and we have been elected into office to deliver it. We shall perhaps discuss the matter again under clause 20, but I ask the Committee to resist this backward-looking amendment. The arguments supporting it also look back at what people said and at what happened years ago. If we want to build a world-class education system, we will not do so by looking back at all our yesterdays.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I am afraid that the Liberal Democrats have fallen into that trap. They are looking for a security blanket. We want change; some people resist that, but if we want to make progress, change must come about. The new school framework will deliver that and will play an important part in delivering our standards agenda. That is why I ask the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> What a load of old hooey we have heard from the Minister. I have never heard such incredibly pre-planned, for-the-media gobbledegook in all my life. [Interruption.] The Minister is suggesting that it is automatic. He does it in his sleep. He probably has one of those subliminal tapes that talks about new Labour getting rid of security blankets, old Labour looking backwards and all the rest of it. As I said, we shall have an opportunity to debate that in greater detail, when the Minister will be able to explain if the new approach that was sorted out and agreed by his colleagues in their conference resolutions has become policy what has happened to their commitment on special schools. They were going to become part of the framework of the schools system, but the Government have now changed their minds and will allow foundation special schools. I wish to place on record our fundamental opposition to the hooey that the Minister has just talked which, for the benefit of the Official Report, I have no idea how to spell and I hope that at the last minute, some members of the Committee will have the common sense to join us in voting for the amendments.

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 17, line 8, leave out "aided".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 83.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The amendments impose a requirement to consult a voluntary-controlled school or the diocesan authority of a voluntary-controlled school in the event of a proposal to close such a school. It extends the provision in the clause, which applies only to voluntary-aided and foundation schools, and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 83, in page 17, line 11, leave out "aided". [Mr. Byers.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 17, line 19, leave out "27" and insert "28".
<P>
The amendment rectifies a mistake in subsection (4), which refers to section 27 rather than section 28. It could have been a typographical error, but we need an amendment to correct it. My numeracy again!
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
