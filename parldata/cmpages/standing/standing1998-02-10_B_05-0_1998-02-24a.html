<P>
Question proposed, [this day] That the clause, as amended, start part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> On a point of order, Mr. Jones. Before we start our work this afternoon, I would like to inform the Committee of some very sad news. This morning Kevin Murnaghan, the deputy chairman of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, died after a period of illness. I am sure, Mr. Jones, that all members of the Committee will join me in sending our sympathy to Mr. Murnaghan's wife Nula and to his family.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Jones, we add our condolences to those of the Minister and his team to Mr. Murnaghan's widow. The news of his tragic death did not come as a surprise but he will be sadly missed.
<P>
Before I was rudely interrupted at lunch time, I was going over some ground in our debate on the clause and some of the amendments that I had tabled on the two substantive subsections, which relate to the transfer of control of civilian staff to the Chief Constable, and subsection (6) which deals with civilian staff in the Police Authority. In the original drafting of the Bill, the Police Authority was supposed to discuss and reach an agreement with the Chief Constable about them. We noticed and commented upon the timely move by the Minister and the Government to table a new amendment that went a considerable way to allaying some of the fears expressed by the Police Authority. I was also dealing with some comments and quotations that the Minister had made in an earlier debate which carried a lot of force at the time.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): Oh!
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> They did, because he gave the impression that they were direct quotes from the Police Authority. Those comments seemed fairly powerful and certainly undermined the thrust and logic of my argument, which was that the Police Authority was not happy with his proposals in clause 3. His quotes from the Police Authority appeared to contradict me and so what, he asked, was my argument?
<P>
It subsequently transpired that it was not quite as it seemed. I mention this now because if the conclusions reached by the minister and his advisors were on the basis of some misplaced or misdirected quotation from an individual or individuals in the Police Authority, but not from the Police Authority as a body, it throws a different light on his argument.
<P>
I should like to go over the chronology of events relating to the setting up of the fundamental review. This is fairly germane to the point at issue. The review was set up in June 1995 by the previous Secretary of State and it commenced under acting Deputy Chief Constable Flanagan, as he then was. The review team comprised a chief superintendent--[Interruption.] They are not listening. I am telling them the facts of the case.
<P>
<B>Shona McIsaac </B>(Cleethorpes): The hon. Gentleman was talking about the deputy Chief Constable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I know you concentrate. I have noticed that your listen to every word I say.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should remember that he is addressing the chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I apologise, Mr. Jones, for that momentary aberration. That was a rather timely and welcome intervention from the hon. Lady.
<P>
The review team was composed of a chief superintendent, other police officers below that rank, Mr. Peter May from the Northern Ireland Office and a principal officer from the Police Authority, Mr. Gary Archibald. I do not know exactly how many people in total were on the team, but it ws probably no more than seven, or 10 at most. Only one person from the Police Authority was on it.
<P>
In September 1995 the Police Authority chief executive wrote to his staff stating the PANI was participating with the RUC in a support services co-ordination group to progress support services and civilian staff issues, having regard to the Government's intention to introduce legislation. That was progressing until the Provisional IRA bomb exploded in London docklands in February 1996. Between that time and June the same year, although the fundamental review working group continued to sit and work, both the RUC and PANI had agreed that any prospect of reducing the number of people employed in the RUC had disappeared.
<P>
In September 1996, under some pressure from the Northern Ireland Office, a tripartite working group was reconvened to establish which, if any, of the recommendations of the fundamental review could be implemented, notwithstanding the resumption of IRA violence. In December, Police Authority members received an executive summary of the fundamental review document, to which the Minister referred earlier.
<P>
At that time an inspection by Her Majesty's inspectorate was due and it was understood that the inspector would refer to the summary in his report. At that stage the Chief Constable--Ronnie Flanagan had now been promoted to the office--decided to publish the summary and key findings, which were put before the Police Authority on 8 January. No further action took place regarding either the adoption of the fundamental review or the publication of the summary and key findings.
<P>
I return now to the comments that I was making before lunch. The original plan was that the fundamental review report would be endorsed, individually and collectively, by the tripartite structure--the Secretary of State, the Chief Constable and the Chairman of the authority. But that endorsement never took place.
<P>
The Minister referred to comments that were written by the working group participants; the most senior officer on the group was a chief superintendent. There was one member from PANI, but I was told that he was not representing the Police Authority in the working group's deliberations. He was not empowered by the authority to place the different elements into the equation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Who appointed him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Police Authority appointed him. We have already agreed on that. We know that it announced that its people were joining the working group to put forward ideas for the fundamental review. Yes, a person from the Police Authority was on the working group, but that is different from saying that he took the Police Authority's views into the working group on every occasion.
<P>
My key point is that the working group's views and the summary were never brought back before a full meeting of the Police Authority for endorsement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram indicated dissent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister shakes his head. His earlier quotes were plucked from the contribution of one principal officer of the Police Authority, yet playing the PANI card might give the impression that those were the stated, confirmed and agreed views of the Police Authority as a whole, whose members had taken a vote to endorse the summary and key findings. They did not do that. The Chief Constable produced a report, and they have never seen the fundamental review.
<P>
The Minister tried to give us the impression that this was a Police Authority for Northern Ireland view, but as events unfolded it came as no surprise to learn that PANI never looked at the summary and key findings, or read the fundamental review. The hon. Gentleman certainly did not confirm his earlier comments in Committee that his quotations represented PANI's views. It is therefore incumbent upon the Minister to recognise that and to say to PANI, publicly or privately, that he did not intend to misrepresent its members' views. I hope that he will do so.
<P>
Will the Minister also confirm that his quotes recorded in columns 63 and 64 came from the original unpublished working group's draft submissions to the fundamental review, not from the Chief Constable's summary and key findings document? Will he also confirm that those so-called quotes were never seen by PANI members, let alone endorsed by them. Will he confirm that PANI made it clear more than once that although it is not implacably opposed to the Chief Constable's assuming the control and management of civilian workers that currently rests with the Police Authority, it would support such a change only if the proper mechanisms for accountability were in place?
<P>
That was the subject of a letter written in December 1994 to the Minister then responsible for the RUC, Sir John Wheeler, by the then Chairman of the Police Authority, David Cook, which pre-dates many of the review's findings. David Cook wrote that the Police Authority would be inclined to move down that road--and that was when the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 was going through the House, or perhaps a short time after its passage had been completed. Mr. Cook emphasised that the Police Authority would agree on the management of all resources only when mechanisms for accountability were in place. That has been the authority's position all along. Its members were therefore surprised indeed to see ascribed to them in Hansard comments that they did not make.
<P>
The Police Authority also thinks that representations made by it have been ignored by the Government, which is why it opposes the main thrust of clause 3. I am sure that its members will be happy with the crumb that has been offered to them today, because at least some progress is being made. But they still consider that transferring 3,000-plus civilian personnel is a huge undertaking.
<P>
The sheer scale of policing in Northern Ireland is such that that transfer would be difficult at the best of times. The authority's members would like to work towards a sensible agreement--without the Bill--that would ensure that the rights of the civil servants, as well as the sheer logistics of the transfer, were looked at again.
<P>
Members of the Police Authority have, as I said, visited 12 police authorities in England and Wales, and have spoken about the proposals and how well or otherwise they have been implemented in those two territories. They reiterated their conclusions that many police authorities were having serious second thoughts about the wisdom of giving the chief constables powers of management over the authorities' human resources. Many told the Police Authority for Northern Ireland that if they had their time again, they would view the matter differently.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister did not claim that a specific number of police authorities in England and Wales were happy with the 1994 and 1996 legislation.
<P>
There may be problems that are not being tackled, and should be examined in the future. Yet the Bill transposes that legislation to Northern Ireland without reference to its success or failure in England and Wales.

<P>

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> Which police authorities in England and Wales lost control of their civilian staff to chief constables?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The Minister confuses clauses 3 and 4. Clause 4 provides for the transfer of civil servants to the Police Authority. They will be under the control of the Chief Constable. I referred to clause 3, which grants the Chief Constable managerial control over civilian employees. Consultation about such a transfer of power took place in England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The question stands: to which authorities does the hon. Gentleman refer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I do not have a list of the 12 authorities, but I am happy to obtain it for the Minister. It is not a secret.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> No one knows.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Well--
<P>
<B>Helen Jackson </B>(Sheffield, Hillsborough): Would it help if the hon. Gentleman had it?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. No sedentary interventions, please.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am more than happy to ask the Police Authority to divulge the list of 12. If it has said 12, but the list comprises only two, I, for one, will be miffed. I, like the Minister, have to trust the Police Authority. If it says 12 it probably means 12. The main thrust of the argument is that concerns were expressed during consultation.
<P>
The Police Authority simply asks whether it needs to go down the path outline in the Bill now, and whether the power should be transferred from the Police Authority to the Chief Constable, especially in the light of the numbers involved. We are not considering a small police authority such as those in the rest of Britain, apart from the Metropolitan police and Strathclyde police.
<P>
The Police Authority is not happy with the proposals. The Minister claimed that it had endorsed the proposals when it had not. It is up to the Minister to respond to that. We may return to the subject on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson (Belfast, East):</B> I wish to respond briefly. I take the hon. Gentleman's remarks very seriously. The Minister should consider whether he has misled the Committee on fundamental issues to such an extent that he wishes to adjourn our proceedings and re-examine his approach to those matters.
<P>
It is abundantly clear to anyone who reads the initial references to the role of the Police Authority in Hansard that the Minister prayed in aid the view of the Police Authority. He did that explicitly in our proceedings on the morning of 12 February. It was clear that, as was suggested by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) the Minister had recognised that for such a proposal to work, it was essential to have the support and agreement of the three parties concerned. There should be a tripartite agreement between the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State and the Police Authority. It is now evident that the agreement of the Police Authority has not been obtained, and that has serious reservations about aspects of the Bill.
<P>
I depart only slightly from the argument of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire in that I should have thought that a competent Police Authority--of course, the existing one is very unrepresentative--having appointed someone to a working group to be present at discussions and be party to any understandings reached, would have required that person to report to it, following which it would consider the report and present a view based on its findings. I should have thought that it was a responsibility of the Police Authority to provide the Minister with an authoritative view, rather than relying on a representative who, I understand, might not even be a member of the Police Authority, but rather an official employed by it.
<P>
The Police Authority was remiss in not requiring the relevant officer to report on it, and in not giving evidence to the Minister about its view. Therefore I can to an extent understand how the Minister might, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, form the opinion that he did. However, that was clearly wrong. The Minister offered what he thought were the Police Authority's views in support of his position. To that extent he has inadvertently misled the Committee. He made it clear that he wanted what he was telling the Committee to be taken into account. He clearly considered it likely to be persuasive. As he has inadvertently misled the Committee in this context he may want to reflect on whether he should proceed on the basis on which he has relied so far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have not inadvertently--and certaintly not deliberately--misled the Committee. The hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) has spoken in support of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who set out the history of the handling of the matter. All that history predates my time as a Minister. I think that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office at the relevant period.
<P>
The fundamental review was carried out under the leadership of the then deputy Chief Constable, who is now the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Ronnie Flanagan. It was agreed from the start that the review would be conducted on a tripartite basis. Government and Police Authority officials were intimately involved in preparing large parts of the final report. Government officials kept Ministers fully informed, as I understand it--although I cannot confirm that, as I was not the Minister at the time. Certainly, they keep me informed in my work. I can only assume that Police Authority officials kept Police Authority members fully informed at the relevant period. If that was not the case, it must be asked what the Police Authority was doing, given that it knew it had an official representing its views in the tripartite structure. Did it inquire what was being said in its name? Views were being expressed by a senior official, who was responsible for reporting back. Members of the Police Authority have a responsibility to question at any time what has or has not been said in their name. The authority appointed a representative to the tripartite body and that person was responsible for carrying such matters forward.
<P>
The chief executive of the Police Authority and the Chief Constable took part in a video designed to inform RUC officers and the authority's staff about the findings of the review. The video was circulated throughout the police force and the authority. We thus had the views of an official who was acting in the name of the Police Authority, under its full scrutiny. Furthermore, an informative video about the findings and the conclusions of the review was produced for the RUC and the authority.
<P>
On 10 December 1996, the Chief Constable met the chief executive of the authority and a senior civil servant. They formally agreed to the publication of the fundamental review summary in January 1997. On 8 January 1997, in advance of that publication, the Chief Constable met the full authority and briefed members on the findings of the review for two and a half hours. Members of the authority cannot therefore say that they were unaware of the import and direction of the fundamental review. They may not have attended the meeting, but they certainly had the opportunity to do so. A full explanation was given.
<P>
The authority's representative played a full part in the fundamental reivew, presumably with the knowledge of the authority. If that official representative was not acting in the name of the Police Authority when he was participating in the reivew, what did the members of the authority think was going on? What did they think was being said in their name? Did they have no interest in the matter? They certainly did not seem unhappy with the conclusions of the review.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I cannot answer the Minister's question. It is up to him to find out what the Police Authority was doing. We are discussing the fact that the Police Authority is still unhappy with some of the proposals in clause 3.
<P>
I do not dispute that the Chief Constable briefed the Police Authority--I gave the Minister the date of the meeting in my earlier remarks. What was the purpose of that briefing? Was it for the Chief Constable to tell members of the authority about the progress of the review and for them to consider the report as it stood at that time? Or was it to show them the report that would be submitted, up the line, for endorsement under the tripartite structure?
<P>
Surely the purpose of the meeting was not only to show members of the authority a report but to tell them that there would now be some progress on the findings. There is no point in having a briefing unless it leads somewhere. If the summary of the reivew's findings was to be taken forward, were members of the authority asked for their opinion? Were they asked to debate the matter internally? Were they asked to give their views to the Chief Constable or to the Secretary of State? Can the Minister answer that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> This is getting confusing. The Police Authority was not separate from the review process; it was part of the tripartite structure that produced the conclusions. It was not the Chief Constable's responsibility merely to present the findings of the review to authority. The authority has an input.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> One officer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That one officer was acting in the name of the Police Authority, had been appointed by the Police Authority and was acting in its name. Therefore, it is fair to assume, he was under the Scrutiny of the Police Authority. The mechanism for reporting back comes from the official and from those who appoint him. They have a responsibility to ask what is being said in their name, what has been decided and where they go from there. That is the process for informing the RUC and members of the Police Authority to which the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State agreed. There was no adverse reaction from the Police Authority, which does not sit in a vacuum; it is part of the tripartite structure. It had the opportunity to object to or endorse the procedure. In one sense, those are discrete bodies, but they come together to form a corporate view of what happens.
<P>
The Police Authority is a corporate body; it has its own functions and its own way forward. If, as was implied, the Secretary of State or officials acting in her name had told the body, ``We now want you to do this'', there would have been howls of outrage that that was an imposition by the Secretary of State. The Police Authority is independent,. It can come to its own conclusions and express its point of view.
<P>
I was advised by more than one officer of the Police Authority, and I mentioned the role of the chief executive who took part in an informative video about the findings of the study. I have set out the history and details of the matter. I have not inadvertently, and certainly not deliberately, misled the Committee. I have taken the views from a detailed document submitted to those taking part in the study. I do not have responsibility for publishing the contents; that rests with the Police Authority. It is their document, not mine. It is already in the Police Authority's possession, but the authority has not reacted to it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> The Minister said that he had not inadvertently misled the Committee, but his remarks show that he has. [Hon. Members: ``No.''] I ask hon. Members to listen for a moment. The Minister said exactly what I say--that if the Police Authority put forward an officer to represent it on the body and the working group proceeded, he would expect that officer to report back to the authority. If I had appointed a local government officer to a board to act on behalf of the Council, I would expect him to report back at each meeting, and the council to take a view in the light of his reports. I entirely agree with the Minister.
<P>
However, the Police Authority says that it has never arrived at a view on this matter. It may have been remiss, or even incompetent, in that respect--I suggest that it was--but at the end of the day, if the hon. Gentleman is right, members of the Police Authority are now saying that in spite of having sent someone to the working party who sat through all the meetings, they have said nothing as a result. They have not actually sat down and considered the matter and given the Police Authority's authoritative view. If that is the position, although a Minister might well feel himself to be--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that his interventions should be brief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> I think the Minister has the drift of what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I had the drift after the first sentence.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East agrees with some of my conclusions, but he does not take the next logical step and accept that the fundamental review was concluded on the basis of input from the Police Authority in the shape of the officer acting in its name.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> Supposedly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me defend the civil servants. The officer had the authority of the Police Authority because, as the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire recognised, the Police Authority appointed that person, and other officials, to act in its name. He and the other officials had the full authority of the Police Authority to act in its name. As I told the Committee, the chief executive of the Police Authority participated in an informative video to explain the findings at the conclusion of the study. Who examined the input? It is not for the Secretary of State's office or his officials to scrutinise what the Police Authority is doing. It is for the officers and members of the Police Authority to see what is being done in their names and then to sign up to it. They certainly signed up to it, but I am less sure that we should be over-concerned about what preceded it. There was full knowledge of the conclusions coming out of it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis (Fermanagh and South Tyrone):</B> The Minister could help me by saying who was the chairman of the Police Authority when the tripartite study took place and when Mr. Archibald was appointed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not know the answer off the top of my head, but during my explanation of clause 3 no doubt I shall be given the answer for the hon. Gentleman. I can carry only so much history in my mind. The Committee is again at a stage at which there are two competing points of view that, sadly, can never be reconciled.
<P>
To return to the question asked by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I understand that Mr. David Cook was the chair of the Police Authority when the procedure commenced and that Mr. Pat Armstrong was the previous deputy. That information was requested and I have provided it, but I do not understand its relevance.
<P>
I turn to the overall intention of clause 3. I have explained in historical terms the fundamental review and how the Bill reflects the investigation and examination of the tripartite approach and, specifically, its staffing aspect.
<P>
Clause 3 sets out the administrative arrangements covering the civilian staff of the Police Authority. The main thrust of the clause centres on the delegation of management functions in respect of civilian staff to the Chief Constable. The code reflects the provisions of section 10, which covers England and Wales, and section 14, which covers Scotland, of the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 which provides for police authorities to be the legal employer of staff working in support of police responsibility for the direction and control conferred by the legislation on chief constables. The 1994 Act gives chief constables statutory responsibility for the utilisation of all human resources, both police officers and support staff, and thus greater flexibility and freedom to manage personnel. When the new Police Authority for England and Wales became effective in April 1995, the chief constables became responsible for all personnel management, including recruitment and dismissal.
<P>
Contrary to what the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said, the information on which I am working is that the provisions are operating beneficially throughout England, Wales and Scotland, so we are keen to see the same principles applied in Northern Ireland.
<P>
I remind the Committee of how we are trying to deal with the matter. We have put forward an implementation strategy with which I am involved at steering group level and senior officials are involved at co-ordination level. At working group level and implementation level we hope to engage the Police Authority, representatives of the RUC and officials in the police division. That will enable us to examine the various areas of possible difficulty which may arise and to try to find ways of dealing with them. I explained earlier that we understand that there will be difficulties. The transfer from one section of employment to another must be handled carefully and sensitively. Other difficulties arise from the management structure and we want to make sure that those are handled fairly and to the best effect for those who will manage resources and for those who are to be managed.
<P>
We have tried to take account of some criticisms over practical application of the new arrangements in England and Wales. The changes have been to the overall benefit of police service delivery in England and Wales and in Scotland. We are trying to replicate that in the Bill.
<P>
I intend to table amendments on Report to this and other clauses. I made a commitment along those lines during our third sitting to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), who, unfortunately, is not here. We intend to replace the term ``civilian staff'' with another general term--``police service staff''. That change will be debated when it arises, but I give notice of it now so that hon. Members can give thought to any difficulties that may arise over the phrase that I have chosen. I do not doubt that difficulties will arise; that is the nature of the Committee system. If someone can come up with a better, all-singing, all-dancing phrase to deal with the point, I will consider it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I apologise for a brief musical interlude earlier which I shall try to ensure does not happen again.
<P>
Some disturbing information has been revealed by the Ministers. To understand fully the concerns of the Police Authority and others, we have to return to the time when a very good chairman of the authority, Tom Rainey, decided to retire. Sir Hugh Annesley was then Chief Constable of the RUC. It does not overstate the case, and parliamentary questions tabled by me bear this out, that Sir Hugh Annesley was not an easy man to deal with. He gave the Police Authority a great deal of difficulty and refused to co-operate in the expected way in terms of being accountable to the authority.
<P>
He failed to honour undertakings that he gave when he was appointed. He said that he and his family would live in Northern Ireland. On brief occasions, he and his family came to Northern Ireland, but they certainly did not live there. From the answer to one parliamentary question, I discovered that during one calendar year he had--if memory serves me correctly; the figures are on the record--spent 17 weeks or more out of the Province while he was Chief Constable.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
It was also noted that the Chief Constable was drawing housing allowance. That would have been available to an ordinary policeman, but not to one who did not live in Northern Ireland and who had a fine flat provided by the Police Authority. I do not want to say much more on this issue--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is coming to his point on the clause. At the moment, he is a little wide of the mark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I appreciate your tolerance, Mr. Jones. The Police Authority must be considered against the background of the difficulty that occurred when Tom Rainey decided that he had served his just and lawful time as its chairman. The Government of the day, acting on the advice of the police division of the Northern Ireland Office, tried to find a replacement. They looked in vain, partly because at least the first half dozen people who were asked to be the chairman refused because they knew about the difficult Chief Constable.
<P>
I pleaded with a member of the police division of the Northern Ireland Office not to appoint David Cook, a professional quango follower. As far as the Northern Ireland Office was concerned, he was a man of malleable character--ambitious, self-important and dependent on the Northern Ireland Office for favours. Unfortunately, David Cook was appointed chairman of the Police Authority. He decided to make it his own--well, almost his own, because he shared it, from time to time, with a professional journalist who also served on it. He managed to divide the authority as it had never been divided before. People who had been appointed to do jobs on behalf of the Police Authority, found themselves doing jobs on behalf of its chairman. The reporting arrangements were inadequate, yet the authority had its hands tied.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Again, may I assist the hon. Gentleman? I know that he is coming with a greater relevance to clause 3.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thought that I had almost arrived there Mr. Jones.
<P>
Those issues relate to the points that were debated by the Minister and the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. The Police Authority has gone through a difficult time. The Minister must not feel self-conscious. There was difficulty under other Governments, brought about by inept appointments to the authority and because of sensitivities about its difficult task. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire said, there is deep disquiet in the Police Authority about the fact that it did not have access during the consultation process to all the information that it needed to make a constructive and complete contribution that had the necessary depth of consideration. I am not asking the Minister to go down the route that I have pursued.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I will not let you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> But it is beholden on the Minister to fully consider the difficulties about the passage of information, which were created when Mr. Cook was chairman of the authority. He should also consider the difficulties that were inherited by Mr. Pat Armstrong, who worked manfully and honourably to make amends for the problems. The Minister must assess the comments of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire against that background of poor communication and lack of attention to detail by the police division of the Northern Ireland office.
<P>
I am deeply concerned that we have taken decisions, which appear to be logical, for all the wrong reasons--I assure you, Mr. Jones, that I will not reiterate them--and that when the Minister was questioned he was not sure of his ground.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I am sure of my ground on this matter. I do not want to discuss the history of appointments because they predate my appointment as a Minister.
<P>
There have been doubts about whether members of the Police Authority fully support the clause's proposals. If it was not aware that people had denied it the information because of a breakdown in its arrangements I shall seek to ascertain its members' views and to establish what they know about the fundamental review. That will take us back to square one, and we might have to go through the whole educative process again.
<P>
Last July, I said that senior officials would take the Police Authotity through our proposals, but it did not take up our offer. We could go through that process again. Officials in the Police Authority and elsewhere assiduously ensure that its information is imparted to Ministers and that any decisions that are taken are imparted on to other parts of the tripartite structure. The views that are expressed within the Police Authority will be imparted to me as the Minister. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) criticised the Police Authority, but I put on record the sterling and important work that it has done. Without being accused of a heavy-handed and interfering Northern Ireland Office approach, we will take the Police Authority through the process again so it understands why we have concluded that staff should be transferred on the basis of the experience in England, Wales and Scotland.
<P>
This is an important change because it will bring about a more efficient and effective police service in Northern Ireland. The Chief Constable will have direct control of the management of human resources. That seems the best way of dealing with these matters, and that is the experience in England, Wales and Scotland. I urge the Committee to support clause 3, as amended.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I am pleased by the Minister's comments. The crux of the argument is that the Police Authority is unhappy with a provision in the Bill that is not just important but one of the most far reaching. I am not that interested in who said what to whom and in what historical context, except in so far as the Minister erroneously quoted the Police Authority as being supportive of clause 3 when it patently is not.
<P>
	I spoke to the chairman of the Police Authority last week and again this lunchtime. He was the vice-chairman when most of these proposals were going through. He categorically said--I have no reason to doubt that he is an honourable and truthful man who, I understand, is doing a superb job as chairman--that the Police Authority, although it had the brief, did not endorse the summary and key findings and certainly did not provide the input that the Minister quotes from an official.
<P>
	It is wrong to quote an official in submissions to a working party rather than quote from the summary and key findings. We still do not know what was covered, and we certainly do not know what was in the video. If the chief executive co-operated in the making of the video, that implies that the Police Authority knew exactly what was going on. If the video did not deal specifically with the Chief Constable taking control of civilian staff then that is an erroneous and irrelevant argument. Has the Minister seen the video? It seems that the Minister does not know what is in the video, I certainly do not know. The Minister has simply been told to use the video as part of the argument, just as he was told to use quotes from a representative of the Police Authority.
<P>
	The most important point is that the Government need to have the Police Authority on their side. It is a wise move for the Minister to start talking to the Police Authority: if I was the Minister I would take the chairman, his deputy and the chief executive out to dinner this week, or as quickly as possible. I would ask, man to man, what the problem was. I would ask why there was no proper communication between the Police Authority and the Minister. I would want to know why, when I have been told that there are no problems and that the Police Authority support the changes introduced in the 1994 and 1996 legislation, I am now being told the opposite.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Something is amiss. It could be be that the Police Authority has acted incompetently; I do not know. It could be that internal communications within the Police Authority are non-existent. It could be that Mr. Archibald never told the Police Authority as he should have--I do not know.
<P>
The Minister has a problem because Members of the Police Authority, according to its chairman, are unanimously unhappy with the provisions in clause 3. It is no good for the Minister to argue that the Police Authority is happy; it is not. He has made a welcome concession to it in subsection (6), but it is not happy with the most vital change in the clause--the transfer of civilian staff to the Chief Constable's control.
<P>
Statements may have been made in the past to the effect that the Police Authority would accept the equivalent of the 1994 and 1996 legislation. David Cook may have been all in favour of that change when he was chairman; I am sure that he was. He may have been instrumental in putting some of the substance that the Minister quoted into the working group. I do not know. The Police Authority as now constituted, with its current chairman and members, is not happy and does not accept, as the Minister suggested, the legislation that was passed for England and Wales.
<P>
I understand that the authority has taken the trouble to investigate implementation in England and Wales. I hope that I can acquire the list of the 12 authorities that it visited. I hope that that figure is correct; that is what I was told. It has also produced the book to which I referred before--I cannot remember its name and do not have it with me today. The authority has undertaken a thorough survey of the implementation of the 1994 Act. Although implementation is broadly successful, the survey refers to difficulties on the personnel and management side. It is not unreasonable for the Police Authority for Northern Ireland--
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> The Police Authority has a crucial role in the tripartite structure. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Minister should adjourn the Committee until he has sorted out his differences with the Police Authority, to ensure that he brings it along?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That is sound advice, but I do not think for a moment that the Minister will go along with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Any more than he will buy it dinner.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> That was a most unhelpful intervention; Now I have forgotten my thread.
<P>
Where was I? The Minister is right to talk to the Police Authority. I suggest an informal dinner, in a nice restaurant, with good wine and a good menu, at which the cards are on the table, in the absence of officials--with the possible exception of his travelling private secretary, who I know likes a good meal. That is how to sort out the matter. At the moment the authority is unhappy with how matters are proceeding.
<P>
The Minister may be able to allude to, or to give, concessions elsewhere in the Bill that will strengthen the Police Authority's hand and its authority as it sees it. In the authority's view, the clause represents a fundamental undermining of its current position, along with other factors that I have already mentioned. To make it work the Minister must have the Police Authority on side. To get it on side, he must listen to it and negotiate the way through. I cannot do that; only he can do it. It must proceed smoothly.
<P>
The Minister talks about working groups; the structure sounds commendable. I know from his background that he is well versed in such matters. I am sure that the group will be a model of its kind. A glossy booklet is now available for the general public to discuss ways to select the Police Authority. Although it is now being elevated as a third leg of the stool--an important position--some of the legislation tends to undermine that status in its members' eyes. The solution is in the Minister's hands. If he does not resolve it by Report stage, the issue will be revisited.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Twice today the Minister has endeavoured to be helpful. For the second time, I want to acknowledge that he has recognised some of, if not all, the validity of the arguments advanced by hon. Members on this side of the Committee.
<P>
I suggest to the Minister that it is not helpful to talk about briefing the Police Authority. The Police Authority must be considered as an autonomous body with freedom and independence to do the job for which it is intended. I have had briefings on the issue, to which I alluded previously when I asked for figures to justify some of these changes. It irks me to see officials turning eyes to high heaven, but I have repeatedly asked for information that has not been available. A briefing that does not get to the heart of the matter is of little benefit. It may satisfy a Member of Parliament, but it does not satisfy a body charged with an independent and important role in policing Northern Ireland.
<P>
Rather than the briefing that the Minister suggests he will give to the chairman and other members of the Police Authority--that body has had briefing after briefing, and comes out of every one with its hands held high in despair because it believes that decisions are already made and it has no part in the consultative process--the Minister must embark on a meaningful consultative process that is a two-way operation. It must not be one in which he and his officials tell the Police Authority or imply what is intended, what is decided and what will happen, irrespective of the authority' sensitivities, sense of duty to society and appointed role.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> We have had a useful debate. It has shown that the Minister made assumptions that I do not think it was unreasonable for him to make. He assumed that, as the Police Authority was represented on a working group, it was receiving reports, and that its representatives on that working group were speaking at all times with knowledge of the authority's views. As many of us in similar circumstances would have done, he concluded that any agreements to which it was a party took account of the opinions of the Police Authority. I do not think, therefore, that it was unreasonable for the Minister to assume that the Police Authority went along with the Government's proposals.
<P>
I agree with the Minister that, undoubtedly, there has been a breakdown in communications. But it is not the Minister's responsibility to ensure that the Police Authority's representatives report properly to the Police Authority--that is their responsibility. Although it may be the Police Authority`s fault that it did not receive reports from its representatives, and although it may be its own fault that it did not sit down, consider the detail, and give an opinion to the Minister directly on this matter, it is now clear to us all that the Police Authority is unhappy about certain measures in the Bill.
<P>
In any set of circumstances, the Minister might say, ``So what, I am proceeding anyway'', but in a Bill that proposes to set up a structure to which the Police Authority is so central, the Minister cannot simply wave his hands and dismiss the Police Authority's position. It has such a crucial role in the triumvirate that is being set up that it is essential that the Minister resolves his differences with the Police Authority. If the Minister does not move to resolve those differences, he will be showing a cavalier attitude to the measure that he is putting before the Committee. He would be showing a degree of authoritarianism that would be most unpleasant in Northern Ireland. I hope that he is not suggesting that he will use the heavy hand and say, whether the Police Authority likes it or not, that this is the way it will be.
<P>
The Minister will accept that I speak as someone who does not have a great deal of respect for the representative qualities of the Police Authority. I found it hard to stomach yesterday when I received another glossy brochure in the post from the Police Authority for Northern Ireland entitled, ``Reflecting all Shades of Opinion''. It does not reflect my shade of opinion. My shade of opinion in the Forum election returned the second largest party in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Police Authority does not reflect all shades of opinion. I hope that the Minister will announce some time before today's sitting is over that he will move to have the remaining three positions on the Police Authority filled so that it does reflect all shades of opinion. Hopefully, he will put people on the Police Authority who will call back those who have been sent out to working groups to give their views on what has taken place so that decisions can be taken. We will thus have a responsible Police Authority.
<P>
The Minister cannot go on with this process as if nothing has happened. Something very critical has happened and it is clear that he does not have the support of one of the key elements of the tripartite structure that he intends to set up. Until he can ensure that support, he should adjourn the Committee and try to resolve his difficulties with the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> We keep returning to the central point. The key issue is whether the staff of the Police Authority should be under the control of the Chief Constable. It is not necessarily about whether there is agreement between me as Minister and the Police Authority. Perhaps we could never agree on that point. I ask the Committee and those who represent opinion in Northern Ireland to consider what is the most effective and efficient way to deliver the police service to Northern Ireland. My contention is based upon the long-term examination which preceded the publication of the Bill. The Police Authority knew that the transfer would take place, and that it would take place in a manner consistent with that in England, Wales and Scotland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East says that we should adjourn because there is a disagreement that could effectively end our Committee proceedings if it is not settled. That may be his wish: that may be the way he goes about his business and he feels that Government should be constrained because someone disagrees with them. He obviously operates under the motivation of his political persuasion: if someone disagrees with the hon. Gentleman, nothing should happen because he is absolutely right in everything that he says. That is not the way Governments operate and one cannot govern a country or a province on that basis.
<P>
The process of consultation has been put in place. We have tried to consult at every level and in a detailed way. I object to and reject the views expressed by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, which somehow implied that there was no consultation and no point of engagement with the Police Authority. The opposite is the case. I have stated time and again the offers that were made to provide officials to speak to the Police Authority at an early stage to arrive at the conclusions which are reflected in clause 3. That process has been followed. No one should have been under any misapprehension or misunderstanding about the way in which it was likely to be developed. If hon. Members do not want the clause to stand part of the Bill they can vote against it, but would that deliver the best and most effective police service for Northern Ireland?
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The best way to achieve that would be to give management control to the Chief Constable over those directly under his responsibility. I endorse the sensible views of officials, to which I referred earlier. Interestingly, not one hon. Member who argues against us has disagreed with the sentiments that have been expressed, only with the way in which they were transmitted in consultation. They have therefore missed the fundamentals of the debate, but not for the first time because we have encountered that a great deal in Committee. They have failed to understand the best and most effective way of delivering a police service in Northern Ireland. I ask that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 3, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 4, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision and maintenance of buildings and equipment</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 34, in 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>page 3, leave out lines 23 to 34.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have thought about the Government's and the Minister's claims that the Bill is not designed to claw to the Secretary of State powers that should properly be exercised by the Police Authority or by the Chief Constable in the name of the Police Authority. However, it seems that that is precisely what is intended regarding the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``maintenance of buildings and equipment wholly or mainly for police purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That suggests that those buildings and equipment are intended for operational purposes. If they are, the Police Authority would rightly want to delegate to the Chief Constable the right to maintain them as he requires for those purposes. Subsection (3), however, makes it clear that the Secretary of State is the final arbiter in those issues. He or she will be placed in a dictatorial role over an operational matter.
<P>
For example, if a police station in my constituency was seriously damaged by terrorist activity and was out of full commission for a number of years, the Chief Constable might decide that better policing of the area will require the re-equipping and refurbishing of that station. The Secretary of State could tell the Chief Constable that she was unable to sanction the money that was required to reinstate, for example, Moy or Benburb police stations, and that the Chief Constable would have to base operational commitments on the decision not to allow the permanent reopening of those stations.
<P>
If that is the case, the Minister's argument about the respective responsibilities of the Police Authority, the Secretary of State and the Chief Constable begins to fall apart. As we understand it, the Government, in consultation with others, will determine the best overall policing policy. We support that. The Police Authority could then examine ways of accommodating the operational procedures of Chief Constable and his men to allow policies to be implemented in the best interests of society. However, the clause suggests that once the Police Authority delegates responsibility to the Chief Constable, it will have no further influence on the provision or maintenance of buildings and equipment,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``wholly or mainly for police purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister cannot believe that that is for the greater good of the RUC, or the Police Authority. Such a policy would further derogate from its responsibility. Surely the Minister does not believe that it is for the greater good of society if, for purely political reasons, the Chief Constable is prevented from providing the service that he, in consultation with the Police Authority, wants to provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> One of the Bill's main aims is to transfer responsibility for the day-to-day management of all police resources to the Chief Constable. He will be solely responsible for his actions. Such a system exists elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Amendment No. 34 would remove a vital element of the introduction of that system to Northern Ireland.
<P>
That said, I do not intend the Police Authority to be excluded from all matters that pertain to buildings and equipment. It should play an important role in all matters of specific interest to the community. That does not, however, mean that the vast majority of decisions about the provision and maintenance of buildings and equipment should rest with the Police Authority. Those are straightforward managerial decisions, due to be taken by the Chief Constable. It is not the authority's proper role to make decisions about boots, light bulbs or details of provision and maintenance of buildings and equipment. The authority should hold the Chief Constable to account for the quality of his decision making. That is a very important role and it is devolved to the Police Authority. The Bill strengthens and refocuses that role. It is intended to enable the authority to hold the Chief Constable to account for decisions and actions that affect the community.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> It would be helpful if the Minister could tell the Committee how what he has described might work. For instance, if it was thought that a new RUC station was required, presumably the Chief Constable would tell the Police Authority that he thought it was necessary. Would he have to do that? If so, what would be the Police Authority's role in deciding whether he should proceed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Engagement between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority, in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman, is required in matters of the strategic delivery of services. We are not discussing bodies that are constantly at each other's throats. They have not operated in that way in the past, and will not in future. The Police Authority and the Chief Constable both act in the interest of the community. They may have slight differences of opinion but they reach agreement because decisions must be taken. Their relations do not need always to be a matter of conflict--major division and never the twain shall meet. That has not been the history of people who work for the Police Authority or who act on behalf of the Chief Constable. Those people try their best to work for the greater good of the greater number in Northern Ireland.
<P>
We are trying to achieve a clear differentiation of functions, so that the day-to-day management of resources such as buildings and equipment is the responsibility of the Chief Constable, and big strategic issues remain, through consultation and decision-making processes, with the Police Authority, acting in concert with the Chief Constable. The Police Authority should have a role in dealing with land and its disposal--primarily the acquisition of land for police buildings. Also, it should have a role with respect to what are called novel and contentious items of purchase. If, as someone suggested, the Chief Constable wanted to buy a tank, for whatever purpose, that would be treated as a novel way of proceeding and the Police Authority would have a say in it, as not being a proper item of public expenditure. Several examples could be brought to mind of new equipment that has been used elsewhere in the world. Should the Chief Constable want to use such items in Northern Ireland, the Police Authority might deem it a novel approach and therefore want to express the community's view on it. Those big issues would remain the responsibility of the Police Authority.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
As we are now dealing with matters concerning the provision and maintenance of police buildings and equipment, I give the Committee notice that I shall later table items to enable public-private partnerships to be established to ensure that such provision and maintenance is as efficient as possible. Those provisions have not yet been finalised, but they are likely to be ready on Report. If we can deal with the proposals in Committee, I shall endeavour to do so. However, as we have moved on from the part of the Bill in which they would be included, it would be better to deal with them on Report. It is important, as we are considering the issue, to introduce proposals on the subject of public-private partnership.
<P>
The amendment as drafted does not enhance the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority in delivering the most efficient and effective police service. Certain detailed matters will transfer to the Chief Constable, but as far as the big, strategic issues are concerned, it will remain the responsibility of the Police Authority to establish and reflect the community view. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I have twice risen to say that the Minister has done well, but I cannot do so for a third time, as he failed to address the issue that arises in clause 5(3)(a) and (b)--that the matter is predicated on what the Secretary of State ``may direct''.
<P>
The Minister knows that I was not disputing the relationship that he described between a police authority and the Chief Constable. I gave the Minister the simple example of a couple of police stations in my constituency with which I hope that he is not completely unfamiliar. The problem is that he has neglected to define the Secretary of State's role--an improper role, I believe--in operational matters. The Minister must consider situations that were previously resolved by discussion between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. If there was an escalation of violence, it was possible to transfer money from the maintenance and building budget--I am sure that there is a better name, perhaps the resources budget--to the manpower budget, and vice versa. If at any time the pressure on manpower and the need for overtime decreased, it was possible to move money back to deal with matters which in the interim had been neglected.
<P>
I understand--the Minister will confirm it if I am right--that that will not happen any more. The budget will be clearly and definitively designated for resources or for manpower. There will be no movement of moneys back and forward; two separate purses will exist in future. If that is so, there will come a time when the Treasury will say to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, ``You must tighten your belt,'' and the Secretary of State will be torn between the duty of a Secretary of State to the Treasury and to the Government, and her responsibility to society in Northern Ireland. There will be no buffer if lines 23 to 34 of clause 5 are retained.
<P>
I could give further practical examples, but judging by his reaction, I think that the Minister understands my point. He will probably wish to respond positively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> If the Minister is keen to respond, I will raise some other issues that he can deal with. It is normally assumed that when Governments introduce legislation, they want to resolve some existing problem. When the Government set about changing the arrangements for the provision of various services, we assumed that there must be some existing difficulties. However, when the Minister replied to my earlier intervention he said that things were working quite well. If that is the case, why does he want to make changes, especially such confusing ones?
<P>
I have asked the Minister what would happen if the Chief Constable wanted a new police station. What would be the role of the Police Authority? Can it stop the Chief Constable building a new police station. It would appear that although the power would be in the name of the Police Authority, the Chief Constable would have responsibility for exercising that power. How far can he go in doing so?
<P>
The arrangement is confusing. Subsection (1) appears to grant the Police Authority certain responsibilities, but subsection (2) states that they are to be exercised by someone else. How will that work?
<P>
We do not have to read much more of the clause to realise that neither the Police Authority nor the Chief Constable will have the final decision-making power. Looming behind them is the presence of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State has to give final approval and will dominate any decisions. The Bill attempts to put forward the view that the Police Authority and the Chief Constable have some form of shared responsibility--although it is exercised by the Chief Constable. However, the Government want to retain executive power over such matters. They are putting up stooges, but behind the scenes they will exercise all the control.
<P>
In the past the Labour party has consistently accused the Ulster Unionist party of treating the RUC as its personal property. Now the Government are doing exactly that, although they are attempting to hide behind the skirts of the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
Will the Minister explain how things will work in practice? Where does the role of the Chief Constable end? Where does the role of the Police Authority begin and end? Does the role of the Secretary of State ever end?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Previous Opposition contributors to the debate have made powerful and telling arguments. The clause would give the Secretary of State additional powers--not for the first time. It is a recurrent theme. British civil servants are often accused of adding to European legislation. That also seems to be true in this case. Why do we need a belt and braces for the Secretary of State?
<P>
Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``For the purposes of this section the decision of the Secretary of State as to whether any buildings or equipment is provided or maintained wholly or mainly for police purposes shall be final.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, subsection (7) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The power conferred by this section to provide buildings shall not be exercised except with the consent of the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot see much difference between the two subsections, yet they repeat the power of the Secretary of State to overrule these so-called legs of the tripartite structure and take on board almost all the executive decision making.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> Is not the distinction the fact that subsection (7) gives the Secretary of State a veto, whereas subsection (4) gives the Secretary of State power to act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> One subsection states that the Secretary of State's decision shall be final, and the hon. Gentleman talks about a veto. I am not sure that they are so different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robinson:</B> A veto can stop something happening, and subsection (7) provides for that. It makes it clear that the Secretary of State can stop something happening if she refuses her consent, but it does not mean that the Secretary of State would get her way. She could stop others from getting their way, but not necessarily get her own. However, subsection (4) makes it fairly clear that she does get her way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I go along with that analysis. I believe that the hon. Gentleman is correct.
<P>
I am interested in knowing where in earlier legislation clause 5 comes from. I have looked through the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994 and the Police Act 1996. We have accepted that a large part of those two Acts for England and Wales have been put into Northern Ireland legislation. However, I cannot find in either Act any reference to the Police Authority maintaining buildings and equipment. It may be in earlier legislation such as the Police Act 1964. Perhaps the Minister's advisers can send him a note in time for him to tell me where that reference occurs. Section 47(1) of the 1996 Act relating to grants for capital expenditure, gives the Secretary of State power to make grants. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may make grants in respect of capital expenditure''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>

So the Secretary of State may make grants for capital expenditure--that is buildings and equipment in my book--not just through having a submission for such expenditure examined and agreed, but by grants for expenditure already incurred. There is a massive difference in the powers of the Secretary of State. For Northern Ireland it is proposed that nothing shall be done or agreed and no plans for buildings and equipment will be implemented, unless there is consent from the Secretary of State. In England and Wales the Secretary of State may pay for investment that has already been made.

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> when we were interrupted, I was asking about the origins of the first part of clause 5 because I cannot locate it in the 1994 and 1996 Acts relating to England and Wales. Section 47 of the 1996 Act gives the Secretary of State powers to make grants for capital expenditure. Interestingly, it also allows him to give money for expenditure already incurred. The arrangements proposed for Northern Ireland are very different. Expenditure has, presumably, to be discussed by the Police Authority and the Chief Constable before going up the line to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is no provision in Northern Ireland legislation for the Police Authority to receive any aid or grant for expenditure already incurred. We need to tease out from the Minister, or to examine him on why there is a need for that. Where does comparable legislation for England and Wales allude to the powers of police authorities to provide and maintain buildings and equipment? I should like to compare the length of clause 5 and its numerous subsections with the relevant passage. Section 47 of the Police Act 1996 contains only three subsections. It is short and to the point, while clause 5 seems to go on and on.
<P>
Hon. Members have said that the Secretary of State is being given enormous power to decide what is needed. In Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State must oversee, have an input and make the final decision on all sorts of policing issues. There is no comparison with England and Wales and one wonders why we need to centralise so much power in the hands of the Secretary of State. It is almost as if the other two legs of the tripartite structure cannot be trusted, particularly the Police Authority, which feels that point keenly.
<P>
The Minister must answer the questions that have been posed. How on earth can he believe that the Police Authority, which the clause tasks with providing and maintaining buildings and equipment, can be accountable in that role when the Chief Constable will operate capital expenditure on the authority's behalf and the Secretary of State can veto it in any event?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps I had better explain this matter to deal with the fundamental question put by the hon. Member for Belfast, East about the building of a new police station. The Chief Constable would decide that he wants a new police station and would lay that down in his strategic plan in consultation with the Police Authority. He would determine the area in which the station would be, would give his reasons for that, and talk to the authority about it. The authority could disagree and would have an effective power of veto at that stage in that it could fail to include the estimate in its own bid to the Secretary of State.
<P>
If the Chief Constable decided, for operational imperatives, that the station was absolutely vital, he would not let the matter rest. He would argue that he had made a decision for good operational reasons and say that he did not agree with the authority's decision. He would argue the matter with the authority. If a resolution could not be found, some other solution would have to be found. The Bill gives the Secretary of State a mechanism to break the logjam.
<P>
That example probably would not happen. It has not happened in the past when the system has worked well. However, we have to provide for the possibility of a breakdown in agreement between two important legs of the tripartite structure. It is not the case that because a system works well, we should not provide mechanisms to deal with other eventualities. In good legislation the converse is the case: one must have mechanisms that allow for the possibility of disagreement and one must find ways to resolve it.
<P>
Opposition Members were wrong to suggest that the Secretary of State will determine on all occasions what will or will not happen. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone discussed what the Treasury and central Government might decide vis-a-vis the Secretary of State. If a Government decided that there should be cuts in expenditure in all Government Departments, it would be wrong for the Northern Ireland Office to be excluded, other than for good strategic reasons of national security. Exceptional expenditure is allocated to Northern Ireland to deal with its problems. No Department can exist outwith the ambit of the Treasury's needs and demands, which are determined, ultimately, by the Government's view of what their expenditure profile should be. Power would reside with the Secretary of State, but there is nothing new or different about that. That power has always existed, and it is a standard requirement.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked about clause 5. I do not remember whether he mentioned clause 6 as well, but it is worth mentioning it, because the two clauses will apply in the same way. He asked whey there was no straight read-across from existing legislation. The simple reason is that there is no direct equivalent in Great Britain's police legislation. In Great Britain local authorities have powers over land issues, whereas in Northern Ireland the Police Authority has that responsibility. The Chief Constable's responsibilities are contained in the clauses, and the Secretary of State has the overriding responsibilities that I mentioned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I did not quite follow the Minister's argument about buildings and equipment held by police authorities in England and Wales. With regard to the Cambridgeshire constabulary, for example, is he saying that all police stations in Cambridgeshire are owned by the local authority--in this case, the county council--or that they are owned by the police authority? I should have thought that the powers were transferred to the police authority when the 1994 legislation was enacted. The Minister's response was a little confusing, and I hope that he will clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Perhaps the best way to proceed is to send a detailed explanation to the hon. Gentleman and to other Committee members. I shall outline the differences between the legislation that applies to Northern Ireland and that which applies to local authorities in the rest of the United Kingdom, where residual and specific powers remain. I hope that that will clarify the situation.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) accepted my explanation about the location of a new police station, which will be considered by the various parts of the tripartite structure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> If the Chief Constable did not get his way with the Police Authority, could he raise the matter during his Monday morning session with the Secretary of State, and get her to intervene on his behalf? The relevant provisions, which I believe are contained in subsection (3), will not apply if the Secretary of State so directs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I would not envisage that. I have attended many of those meetings, and we discuss weightier issues than maintenance and equipment, but if the Chief Constable has a strong wish to discuss such matters and the Police Authority had a strong wish to the contrary, the Secretary of State would require the two to resolve their differences. If there are two strong competing arguments there must be a resolution, and the Secretary of State must be the arbiter in such circumstances. It is not a question of all the power being transferred to the Secretary of State to make all the decisions all the time.
<P>
I said earlier that the process worked well at present, and the original question was why the provision was necessary. It is necessary because we must envisage the possibility of the process not working well. The hon. Member for Belfast, East argued as though it would be an everyday occurrence for the Chief Constable to have one view and the Police Authority another, so that the Secretary of State would always be involved. That is not how it will work and there will not always be conflict. The opposite will be the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke):</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of why subsection (2) would not apply, and I accept his argument entirely. But why did the Government choose not to express that line of reasoning, either in a schedule or in the main part of the Bill? That would have removed a great deal of misunderstanding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have always assumed that hon. Gentlemen have the same capacity to understand the subtleties of legislation that I have. They are bringing to the argument prejudices that I do not share, and perhaps that is where the difference arises. I assume that people work in the better interests of the greater number for the greater good of society at all times. It is clear that some people do not hold that view, and see conflict in every situation--but I am not attributing such a view to the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter), who accepted my explanation.
<P>
I have explained the purpose underlying the clause and why it is not necessary to include a belt-and-braces explanation in a schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> I hope that the provision works as the Minister envisages it will.
<P>
I want to suggest another scenario. Clause 5(3)(a) appears to give the Secretary of State the power to require, for example, a police station to be built in the middle of Crossmaglem. She may have a political reason for that, even if it were not part of the Chief Constable's plan or endorsed by the Police Authority. Under subsection (3)(a) she would be able to have her way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Obviously, ``Who governs?'' is always a question. The hon. Member for Belfast, East fails to recognise the fact that power must reside somewhere away from himself. In this case, it will be with the Secretary of State. The question of who should be accountable to Parliament is important.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are trying to take into account the various strands of representative views--those of the Secretary of State, those of the Police Authority and those of the other part of the tripartite structure, the Chief Constable, who has professional knowledge. We have tried to show that those bodies and authorities can work together to try to deliver the best solution, and in drafting the legislation we have tried to take account of occasions when disagreements may occur, so that there is a way of breaking the logjam. It is not a case of the Secretary of State deciding, ``I shall not listen to the Chief Constable or the Police Authority. I will decide.'' That is not how it operates. It may be the way in which the hon. Member for Belfast, East wants society to be run, but it is not the way in which the Government want it to be run. We want agreement and co-operation between all strands of opinion in Northern Ireland. That is what the Bill aims to achieve. For that reason, I hope that hon. Gentleman will withdrawn the amendment.

<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I think that the Minister wants to be frank and forthright with the Committee. He is trying hard but he is being mislead. I always notice that he is especially pleasant when he is on sure ground but that he becomes a little aggressive when he is unsure of his ground. He has been told that this is the answer, that it is all innocent, and that it will cater for a situation that has never arisen before between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. It is said that there has never been such a struggle to the death and the Secretary of State has never had to intervene in a situation such as she speculates may happen sometime in the future. Good heavens! If the Bill speculates on the most unlikely events occurring, we shall be here this time next year.
<P>
The reality is--the hon. Member for Belfast, East came close to saying this--that the Secretary of State wants to be in the position to decide. If the Chief Constable and the Police Authority agree on a certain form of policing in an area that is predominantly loyalist or predominantly republican, there is a possibility that certain interests in that area will whisper in the Secretary of State's ear, ``We could do it much better with a two-tier policing system, in which we shall tolerate a passive form of policing by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Do not worry about anything else because we are capable of carrying out our version of the law.'' The Secretary of State could then decide that the form of policing that had been determined by the Chief Constable and the Police Authority was not a good idea.
<P>
We know that it happens. It is happening in both loyalist and republican areas, where those who claw unto themselves responsibility for how society functions in those areas are prepared to break and shoot knees and beat people up with clubs, cudgels and iron bars. We know how it operates. If we could turn a blind eye to it we could all live in a fool's paradise and pretend that it did not really happen or that, if it does, it is what people want. People want to be shot through the knees if they misbehave or do not agree with the diktat of the hard men in their areas. They want to be beaten up with iron bars. What a load of rubbish!
<P>
The draftsmen and draftswomen have written the clause to ensure--whether we like it or not and whether the Secretary of State recognises it or not--that it will be possible to choose between bowing to the diktat of the terrorist, the pseudo-terrorist or the person directed by the terrorist and the rule of law. In so doing, we would embark on two-tier policing, which would be the means whereby the operational freedom and responsibility of the Chief Constable could be overridden, and the Police Authority would be able to do nothing about it. That is dangerous and we must therefore press the amendment to a vote.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> In the debate on the amendments, the Minister failed to answer the question that I asked him in relation to section 47 of the Police Act 1986. Under that Act, the Secretary of State can make grants for capital expenditure once expenditure has been incurred. That suggests that police authorities in England and Wales have some licence to embark on capital expenditure, which they intend to be covered at a later stage. Clause 5 prohibits any move by the Police Authority or the Chief Constable unless it is agreed to by the Secretary of State. While we are on the vexed question of the Secretary of State's powers, subsections (3), (4) and (7) are almost draconian in saying that the Secretary of State's word will be final. Under subsection (7) the Secretary of State has a veto; and that is over the top. In clause 9, which deals with grants made by the Secretary of State to the Police Authority, subsection (1)(a) specifies:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a grant for police purposes'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph (b) specifies:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a grant for general administrative purposes of the Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In granting such money, the Secretary of State will therefore specify that it must be spent on particular items and not on, for example, a new police station. The power to restrict finances and capital expenditure is clear. I am unclear about whether those draconian powers are given to the Secretary of State under clause 5. I know that the Minister listens carefully to debate on such issues and the matter is worthy of reconsideration. It would be acceptable if he thought it necessary to come up with another form of words. Why not leave the power to make such decisions to the Police Authority and the Chief Constable, and control expenditure, as is the case under clause 47 of the 1996 Act, by grants given by the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Robinson:</B> This is disappointing. One would have expected the Government to be prepared to take account of arguments. The clause is dangerous; it is a mesh that will cause considerable confusion. I foresee many difficulties in the relationships between the Chief Constable, the Police Authority and the Secretary of State, brought about by unnecessary changes to a process that the Minister admits has gone smoothly. The clause is unnecessary; it introduces division where it does not currently exist.
<P>
It is not good enough for the Minister--and this perhaps demonstrates how poor is his argument--to argue that it may be how I as the Member for Belfast, East would operate. I assure him that I do not envisage ever being Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, or being a member of the Police Authority, given the way that the Government discriminate against my party, or being the Chief Constable of the RUC. Therefore, whoever else the Minister's remarks might apply to, they certainly do not apply to the hon. Member for Belfast, East. However, that does not prevent the hon. Member for Belfast, East from reading how the Government will behave. I can judge how a Government will behave in the future only by how they have behaved in the past. If the Secretary of State behaves in the future as she has in the past, I expect here to intrude into decisions. That will not be good for policing in Northern Ireland.

<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 4, line 1, leave out subsection (1) and add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) For the purposes of its functions, the Police Authority may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, acquire, hold and dispose of land.'.<P>

<P>
Amendment No. 53 is simply a technical amendment, which does not change the sense of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Why are we having it, if it does not change the sense of the Bill? The Minister does not want to speak to it. What is the point of it? I have read the amendment several times and cannot understand what difference it will make.
<P>
<H5>7 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> I was trying to be helpful. The clause as drafted replicates section 4 of the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. We are introducing a technical amendment to give the Police Authority the right to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``acquire, hold and dispose of land.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause is taken from the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970. The Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954, which gave rise to a body of legislation, applies to the 1970 Act, but it does not apply to the Bill. The appropriate wording, therefore, is in the amendment. I was trying to save the Committee that explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister has not explained anything. There is no significant difference between clause 6(1) and the amendment. The question remains unanswered: why do we need the amendment? It has no purpose unless there is a substantial difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> The wording of clause 6(1) would have been appropriate had the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 applied to the Bill, because it would have conveyed the correct sense. The amendment phrases subsection (1) in a way that is appropriate to this form of legislation.
