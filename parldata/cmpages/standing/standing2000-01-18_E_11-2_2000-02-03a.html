<P>
On resuming—
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I had congratulated the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh for the clarity of his amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A scheme must not have an adverse effect on the pension entitlement of past or present employees of any of the undertakings involved in the scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I had then moved on to a quotation from the response to the public consultation. The first line of paragraph 62 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Almost all the employee responses expressed strong concern about their pensions . . . In addition, they expressed concern that potential investors might remove the surplus from their pension funds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly the topic that has been raised by Labour Members with reference to bus company pensioners and by Conservative Members with reference to Maxwell pensioners. The response continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Employees also felt that the shares they would receive would not compensate them for the potential decrease in their pension.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is covered by the amendment.
<P>
The nub of the matter is that uncertainty about future pensions has an impact on the morale of those employed in air traffic control. There is no doubt about that. We have discussed continuity and the need to ensure that the change is made smoothly. It is worth quoting from a letter, which we have all received and which is the most recent indication of the mood among employees. Mr. Paul Noon, general secretary of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists wrote to me outlining its concerns about the Government's proposals, because pensions will have a major impact on morale. Under the heading ``Disruption and morale''—``The impact of pension changes'' would be an equally relevant heading—the briefing states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The reality is that the safe provision of air traffic control in the UK is finely balanced. NATS and its staff need stability to cope with 1.8 million aircraft movements a year in ever more complex airspace and to bring new systems on line. In many areas they are struggling with outdated equipment, controller shortages, and severe training and development pressures. To this picture can be added the upheaval and disruption that would flow from privatisation.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The key clause is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The oft-quoted mantra that demotivated staff cannot operate to the best of their abilities has real application to air traffic control.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
An interesting example then follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``For instance, following a disagreement over contracts earlier this year, the simulator performances of an entire batch of student controllers went down markedly. This would be a disturbing prospect if it was translated to operational ATCOs following privatisation. To quote the Royal Aeronautical Society's evidence to the Commons transport sub-committee last year: `Safety must always be paramount but low morale amongst controllers, for whatever reasons, is in itself a flight safety hazard.' ''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On those grounds alone, apart from our obligations to those who, as the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh said, worked so hard to build up what is the best air traffic control system in Europe—the right hon. Gentleman said that it was one of the best, but I believe that it is the best, bar none—this simple amendment should have the support of both sides of the Committee. My right hon. Friend Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) has moved on to greater things, sadly for the Committee. His contributions were most interesting, as he has such deep experience of all the Bills that have gone through the House in the past 10 or so years. He said that every now and then it was worth the Government's while giving a little on an amendment. I should have thought that the amendment contained something that would please all sides. I want to know what the Government's reasons are for not supporting it, in view of the spirit in which it has been discussed and the concern expressed by both sides of the Committee—buses on one side and Maxwell on the other—that morale would take a major dive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was listening carefully to the comments that my hon. Friend read from the brief given to us by the IPMS. Will he confirm that the institution is concerned that the pension rights of existing employees and pensioners are at risk from the current process, despite the assurance that Ministers have given? Will he agree that this is a superb opportunity for the Ministers to put their assurances into the Bill to reassure those concerned?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> That is a valid point. There is no specific reference to pensions in the brief, but I have cited the institution's concerns about disruption and the impact on morale, and I tried to explain before the break that public service employees cherish their privileged pension rights as against those in the private sector. That surely is one of the advantages for people working in the public sector. My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has a good point when he says that pensions are integral to this matter.
<P>
I should be fascinated to know why the Government cannot support the amendment now, that it has broad support on both sides of the Committee. It is in the interests of those who will be entitled to pensions in their own right, but there is also a major element in that it would help to make the changeover smoother. There will be great uncertainties for those who will be affected, because they will have genuine worries about the new management coming in, the new arrangements and how the whole public-private function will work. They can perhaps look to their compatriots who work for a privatised British Airways or a privatised British Gas. They know what it is like to work in a private company, but no one knows what it will be like to work in this strange, amorphous new creation under new Labour.
<P>
I should have thought that the amendment would give the air traffic controllers confidence and will mean that there is one less reason for their morale to take a dip. As far as I can see, there is unanimous concern in the Committee about the dangers of pension funds being misused. To go back to the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea, it would be good for the Committee to show that we are not being steamrollered by the Government's majority and are not going through a farcical process of discussing each amendment at length and then throwing it out. It would be a worthwhile exercise for the Minister to listen to the Committee and accept the amendment. I look forward to his arguments with great pleasure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I congratulate the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh and thank him for tabling the amendment. He will see from the amendments that are grouped with his that the pension issue worries us too, although I am the first to admit that his amendment more succinctly addresses our crucial concern. It does not simply say that any liability to a relevant pension fund should be honoured, which in any case would be a legal obligation for the Government or any of its subsidiaries. It goes further and requires the Government to honour any obligation to maintain the outputs of the pension funds in question. That is clearly an important consideration when we are debating these matters.
<P>
We have had a good debate, which has drawn the Committee together, despite our diverse history. Maybe this is what new politics is all about—that we should all share the same concerns.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Give us a hug.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I very much regret that I missed what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> I hate the idea of this being put on the record, but what I said in response to the hon. Gentleman's projection of a new caring, sharing image was, ``Give us a hug''. [Hon. Members: ``Answer!'']
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Lady can give me a hug whenever she wants.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> I am certainly not offering to do that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's comments and his recent performance at the palace of varieties have shown a side of him that I have never seen before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It just shows that Tories are much friendlier than they look.
<P>
There is genuine concern throughout the Committee on the issue of pensions. While we are in repenting mood, I want to put on the record that, whatever the shortcomings of decisions that led to the retention of the bus company pension fund surplus, it was legal, above board and regarded as unacceptable only because of changing attitudes throughout the pensions industry towards surpluses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> While the hon. Gentleman is in a repentant mood, will he consider what happened to British Telecom employees after its privatisation in 1991–92? Current employees were allowed by the Government to have their pensions index linked, but those employed after the transfer were not. New employees thus lost many thousands of pounds in future pension rights. Will the hon. Gentleman repent on that subject as well?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is a question that the hon. Gentleman needs to ask members of his own Front Bench. The matter is their responsibility as much as ours. The arrangements that he is likely to vote for in this Committee would have exactly the same effect in that regard. I confess that I do not know whether the Civil Aviation Authority fund is currently index linked—perhaps the Minister can enlighten us. Once NATS is in the private sector, I very much doubt whether new employees will get an index-linked pension. Contractual arrangements on employment—
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Paragraph 66 of the response to the public consultation is quite clear. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``These arrangements will not necessarily apply to employees taken on by the PPP after it is established. Their pension arrangements will be determined on the basis of the usual negotiations between management and the Trade Unions.''<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is right. That would be entirely normal. The civil service has the same capability to decide that future employees should be taken on under different arrangements. Pensions are deferred pay. They form part of contractual employment arrangements and the remuneration package, and must attract suitable candidates. If NATS decides that its pension arrangements are more than generous, and that it need not offer such terms to future employees to attract the calibre of air traffic staff that it needs, it will not be obliged to offer such terms.
<P>
In answer to the intervention of the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke), if he thinks such changes were bad for British Telecom, he should tell the Committee that he thinks the Bill is bad, because it will have the same effect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) said, we will listen carefully to the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It has to be said that not even Amendment No. 358, which was tabled by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), addresses that point. A different amendment would be required. Amendment No. 358 does not address the question of new employees who join subsequent to privatisation, and I agree that it would be wrong for it to do so. We support the amendment. We shall listen carefully to what the Minister says, and if we are not happy we may wish to divide the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The interventions by the hon. Member for Northampton, South are red herrings. The amendment is absolutely clear. It refers to ``past or present employees'', not future employees.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The hon. Member for Northampton, South made a strong and aggressive attack on me, as Opposition spokesman. When I pointed out to him that he was, by implication, attacking members of his own Front Bench, he decided that he would listen carefully to the Minister. As he is a new Back Bencher in training on the Government Benches, we would expect no less from him.
<P>
Pensions are deferred pay, and form part of the contractual arrangements. The important point about a pension fund, especially a defined benefits scheme—which is what we are dealing with—is that it represents a promise from the employer to the employee. The pension fund is merely a means for the employer to fulfil that promise. In the final analysis, pension funds belong to the employer, not the members of the pension fund. That is because if the employer has put in too much money—or has put in money and the fund has grown so that there is a surplus and the promise can be more than delivered—the employer has no obligation to deliver more than his promise.
<P>
That was the case with the bus company pension scheme. When the actuaries looked at the figures, they saw that there was a surplus in the pension fund. Once the pension fund had been split up among the various privatised bus companies, the previous employer—the Government—had no obligation to release those surplus funds to the bus companies because they had every confidence, supported by actuaries, that their promise would be fulfilled. That is why the surplus was retained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Labour Members jump up to say ``Robert Maxwell'' every time we mention the bus company pension scheme, as though they were equivalent situations. Let us be clear what Robert Maxwell did. He raided the pension fund to bail out his business and maintain his lavish lifestyle. There is no comparison between what Robert Maxwell did and what happened with the bus company pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving the Committee an explanation of how pension funds work. The other side of the coin is that while the employer is entitled to retain that part of the surplus which is not required to meet the promise, in the event that the fund is inadequate to meet the obligation to pay out the pensioners, the obligation falls on the employer to find the funds from elsewhere in order to make good the deficiency in the pension fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> My hon. Friend is exactly right. It was from that perspective that we tabled our amendments. In the transfer, the Government should include provision for any liability to any relevant pension fund, because any shortfall in the ability to deliver the promise is naturally a liability on the employer which he has to fulfil.
<P>
The trustees of the pension fund are advised by actuaries, who look at forward liabilities, investment performance and likely investment performance. They then decide whether the funds in the pension fund, the income to the fund and the on-going liabilities of the fund are sufficient for it to cover all the liabilities as they fall due. A liability arises in a pension fund when the actuaries conclude that the fund has insufficient capital, and insufficient income, to deliver all the liabilities as they fall due, which may be in 60 or 70 years. Our amendment would deal with that problem. I have acknowledged that the amendment of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh would deliver a better guarantee. The Government should signal that they will deliver the same pension outcomes for past and present employees of NATS.
<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): The hon. Gentleman made an important point when he said that pensions were deferred pay. That view forms the basis of the Barber judgment in the European Court, on which much of pension fund law now rests. Is it the Conservative party's policy to comply with that judgment? How does the hon. Gentleman square his statement that pensions are deferred pay with his later statement, which I think he made in the same sentence, that at the end of the working life of a scheme member, the property of the pension fund—its ownership—belongs to the employer, not to employees?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Barber judgment was delivered in, I believe, 1986—and a very significant judgment it was, too. The decision that pensions were deferred pay was made in an earlier judgment; the Barber judgment was about our old friend, sex equality. We certainly agree that we should comply with the Barber judgment. I stand to be corrected by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woolas:</B> In a former life, I was an employee of the trade union that took the case to the European Court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I certainly defer to the hon. Gentleman's superior knowledge. I spent four years on the Select Committee on Social Security, I dealt with the aftermath of the Maxwell pension fund case and with the Goode committee report, and I sat on the Committee that considered the Pensions Bill. However, my memory may be at fault, and I defer to the hon. Gentleman. I shall check the record before going head-to-head with him in this regard.
<P>
It is certainly my party's policy to comply with the Barber judgment. The principle of a pension as deferred pay is in no way diluted by insisting that the surplus belongs, in the final analysis—that was the phrase that I used earlier—to the employer. In that context, we need not establish whether the employer has the right to remove or to erode that surplus. As I said, a trust is set up as a means to deliver a promise, and the employer guarantees to deliver that promise and defaults if he fails to do so. A pension fund is a means by which an employer can deliver that promise, and it is an insurance against the company going bust. That is why it has to be fully funded. We strengthened solvency requirements as a result of the Goode inquiry. There is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition about whether pensions are deferred pay.
<P>
It is easy for trade unions to make political capital out of that idea and to play on the fears of their members by saying, ``The surplus has been taken away. You have been robbed,'' when that is not the case. If the surplus was physically removed from a pension fund—it is harder to do that under current legislation than it was at the time of the bus company pension fund—the outcomes that are enjoyed by members of that fund would not be affected.
<P>
The essence of our discussion about the NATS pension fund involves establishing whether the surplus in a pension fund should be transferred to a new business and whether it should be available to the new employer or whether it should be used solely for the benefit of the pension funds. At no point has legislation stated that a pension fund surplus exists solely for the benefit of employees—that has never been proposed or argued for. However, I am afraid to say that that is already happening—the ability of employers to recover surpluses is being eroded. The effect of that is to discourage employers from having defined benefit schemes; instead, they move to defined contribution schemes. That results in a net reduction in the benefits that employees receive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Henderson:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that some of those companies could have improved the conditions of their pension funds for their employees, but instead took the money for themselves, perhaps when their companies had financial problems? We have also discussed pension holidays today. Many pension holidays serve to reduce surpluses, because a company puts no money into the surplus, which gradually diminishes because pension benefits are still being paid out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am wary of becoming too involved in an argument that is preoccupied with the technicalities of pensions.
<P>
The relevant point for the hon. Gentleman is that he is about to consent, by sitting in Committee and supporting his right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench, to a company being able to do precisely that. The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh seeks to secure the present benefits that existing and past employees receive from a pension fund.
<P>
Neither I nor the Minister would go as far as the hon. Gentleman would like us to go in restricting what companies might do with surpluses in pension funds in future. That is governed by pensions law, and is not for us to determine here. I would go further and say that his party will not stop the processes that he complained about in relation to ferries privatisation and to British Railways, nor will it stop people dropping out of the present scheme and being offered only an inferior scheme in future. The Government's proposals will not prevent that. If the hon. Gentleman has a complaint about that, he must direct it not to me but to his right hon. and hon. Friends. The right hon. Gentleman's amendment would guarantee in statute the pensions of existing retired people in the scheme, and the status of the pensions in absolute terms of those contributing to the National Air Traffic Services scheme.
<P>
It was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, who is now attending to matters elsewhere in the House, that—whether one agreed or disagreed with what was done with the pension fund of the National Bus Company—we had to split up that fund among many operators. The question as to how a surplus would have been distributed was therefore much more complicated. That is why it was said that the cheque was in the post.
<P>
I should accept the correction given to me by the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central, who pointed out that, following the ruling by the pensions ombudsman and the overcoming of various legal difficulties, the Department has handed the cheque to the trustees of the National Bus Company pension fund. However, they are experiencing the problem that prompted the previous Government not to distribute that surplus in the first place. That is the problem of how the surplus should be distributed to the various members of the pension fund. It is a difficult question to decide, because it is an unprecedented situation.
<P>
However, whatever was contained in the Transport Act 1985, whether Labour Members agreed with it or not, that was in the Act. I note that the Minister of State has his Railways Act 1993 open and is ready to strike me down with precedents from it. I refer him to a provision in that Act which does not seem to be in the Bill. It is in section 93, which covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Assignment of employees to particular parts of undertakings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Section 93(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where a scheme modifies the terms and conditions of employment of any person, the person's terms and conditions of employment after the modification takes effect must overall, and taking account of the amount or value of any compensation payable to him by virtue of subsection 1(c) above in respect of any such detriment as is there mentioned, be no less favourable to him than his terms and conditions of employment before the modification takes effect.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was made perfectly clear that the terms and conditions of employment include pension rights. The protection for working members of the pension fund was included in the Bill. An assurance was given, and maintained, that people who were already retired from the British Railways Board were guaranteed their existing pension rights under its pension scheme. The British Railways Board pension fund is still extant, and paying out to its pensioners. The railways privatisation implicitly gave the undertaking that we are seeking to include in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to make one last point about future NATS pensioners, who might not enjoy the same pension arrangements as existing employees. Such people will be employed under a completely different regime, not only because of who owns the business, but because they will have the opportunity to own shares. My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire referred to the representation from IPMS about compensation. The compensation will be significant, and will provide a considerable share-owning opportunity to future employees rather than present employees. Present employees who are nearing their retirement may have the opportunity of holding some shares—from the 5 per cent. management allocation—for a short time. I suspect, however, that the scheme for employee share ownership will require relinquishment of the shares on retirement. That will not be without compensation, of course. In order to maintain a real share ownership scheme—it will not be possible to keep issuing shares, as there is a limit of 5 per cent.—the scheme will have to pull in shares from retiring employees, to make them available to new employees. The Committee may wish to discuss that later, but I hope that that is how the scheme will work.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I want to raise a final point in the public consultation response. Paragraph 62 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Some employees sought reassurance that the Trust Deed would remain in force with a new employer.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the significance of that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Every pension fund is set up under a trust, and the trust is governed by the trust deed, which is the equivalent of the articles of association of a company. My hon. Friend has alighted on an important point, to which the Minister might respond. Will the trust deed of the present pension fund remain unaltered, as a result of the public-private partnership, with regard to past and present employees? The trust deed defines contributions, payments, the treatment of surpluses, the release of surpluses back to the employer and the reduction of surpluses through the granting of a pension holiday to the employer. I should add that pension holidays do not apply only to employers; often, they apply to employees. When I was in the private sector, I worked in two companies where employees enjoyed a pension holiday. It would be nice to think that, in future pension arrangements, the trust deed would reflect that. My personal view on pensions is that it is in the interests of the employer that they are equitable, and seen to be equitable. It would have been in the interests of the previous Government if the arrangements that were made for the bus companies had not merely been equitable, but seen to be equitable. What we had to endure after the privatisation occurred did not make us any friends. That is why the amendment of the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh has such an attraction for the Government. They want to be seen to be doing the right thing. This is, after all, a Government who care deeply about appearances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The issue of the trust deed seems significant. What would be the status of the trust deed under the Bill were the amendment to be accepted?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the Minister is paying close attention to our exchanges because if he is to give an assurance that the trust deed is not to change, it must be invulnerable to the new company set up. Will the Minister appoint trustees to ensure that the trust deed cannot be altered? Will the relevant pension fund remain in the public sector, in the CAA, so that any new arrangements are made in the private sector on a completely separate basis—so that there will be no transfer of the pension scheme? All those arrangements need to be clarified and I look forward to that clarification so that we may be reassured. However, I serve notice on the Minister that we are concerned about the issue and that unless we get answers that satisfy us in every respect, we hope to persuade the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh to press his amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> We are debating the amendment of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh and it is his decision, not that of the Opposition, whether it should proceed to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. Is what the Minister just said correct?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The only person who can seek to withdraw an amendment is the hon. Member who moved it; it is then up to the Committee to grant or deny permission to withdraw it. It is not in the gift of the hon. Member himself to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Gale. The Minister was referring to the ability not to withdraw the amendment, but to move and vote on it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The amendment was moved by the right hon. Gentleman. That amendment is now the property of the Committee and the only person who can seek to withdraw it is the right hon. Gentleman who moved it. It is then up to the Committee to decide to give or to deny leave for that amendment to be withdrawn. If leave is denied, the amendment is still the property of the Committee and it may be put to the vote. I trust that that clarifies the position for all concerned.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. The debate has had a somewhat surreal quality. It was initiated by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh, expressing real concerns that I hope I was able fully to allay. Those concerns were followed by a series of speeches from Opposition Members that contained interesting verbal pyrotechnics—necessitated to justify their attacking the Government while defending the activities of the previous Government. I shall not revisit that territory other than to say that the most glorious moment was perhaps when the hon. Member for North Shropshire quoted an IPMS paper—which, incidentally, did not mention pensions, a fact that he might have thought significant but did not comment on—that attacked privatisation, which is the explicit policy of his party.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I was talking about morale and the point that I was making was that the uncertainty of future pensions has an impact on morale. I was quoting the IPMS on what it had to say on that subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Yes, but as I pointed out, the paper did not mention pensions—which might indicate that IPMS is satisfied by the assurances that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Transport and the Regions and my right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport have frequently made and will continue to make. I will humbly try to repeat those assurances in the Committee and hope that I have the same effect.
<P>
Hon. Members have repeatedly voiced concern at the lack of specific provisions in the Bill. There is no provision in the Bill because there is simply no need for it. The position is different from that in other cases such as the privatisation of British Rail. Past and present employees belonging to the Civil Aviation Authority pension scheme—CAAPS—will continue to be members of it after the PPP. CAAPS will remain in the public sector, albeit with a private sector partner participating. That is quite different from the position when the whole of British Rail and the railways were transferred to the private sector. That is why separate provision was necessary in the Railways Act 1993, and why there is no need for it in the Bill.
<P>
Staff in the CAA and NATS are currently members of CAAPS. When the PPP is established, NATS staff will continue to be able to participate in the scheme and enjoy its full benefits, but the PPP will have non-associated employer status. At present, the CAA is the principal employer with NATS having associated employer status, because of its existing link with the CAA. When the link ceases to exist on the establishment of the PPP, NATS will need to move to a non-associated employer status and the part of the fund attributable to NATS must be separated from the rest of it. That segregation is a requirement of the pension schemes office of the Inland Revenue and is intended to avoid cross-subsidy between the public and private sectors. Although there will be separate funds for the CAA and NATS, both will be within CAAPS with the same entitlements, trustees and trust deeds.
<P>
CAAPS trustees will govern the funds of NATS and the CAA, and NATS will participate as a non-associated employer. Past and present employees will therefore remain in the scheme. The strategic partner could offer membership to future employees, but it may want to offer a different scheme. As the hon. Member for North Shropshire rightly identified, it would be impossible to tie up that eventuality. He said that pensions have a considerable bearing on morale. We expect and hope that the strategic partner, if it does not intend to continue the existing scheme for new employees, will want to ensure that the new scheme offered matches if not enhances the benefits available under CAAPS. We should always bear in mind the fact that all existing and past employees remain part of the existing scheme.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex asked whether the pension fund is index linked. It is. He asked about employee share schemes and how those would work. The details are still to be finalised, so I cannot give a definitive answer, but it will be administered via a trust arrangement that will create a market in the shares, which could allow shares to be bought from staff who leave the company through retirement or resignation. Those matters will be considered further. In line with the approach that we have adopted to date of being open with members of the Committee and showing documentation as and when it is ready, I undertake that further information on that matter will be made available to the Committee if we are in a position to give it before Report.
<P>
I hope that I have now satisfied my right hon. Friend and the Committee that there is no need for specific mention to be made in the Bill to achieve the objectives of amendment No. 358. We share his concern, but the arrangements that I have outlined will achieve a solution, and I hope that he will accept that the amendment is not required.
<P>
Amendment No. 306, tabled by the hon. Member for North Essex, is not necessary. The clause refers already to any liability, which will include any pension fund liability, so the amendment is otiose. Amendment No. 315 would include the pension rights of NATS employees within the liabilities that can be guaranteed under the provisions of clause 51. For the reasons that I have already explained, the amendment is not necessary. I hope therefore that my right hon. Friend will withdraw his amendment No. 358.

<B>Dr. Strang rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hope that the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh will forgive me for butting in, but the Minister did not give me the assurance that I was expecting. I am grateful to him for his clear explanation, but can he enlarge on it? He gave an assurance about his intention and what he expects to happen, but he did not say that the Government and the CAA are under an obligation to deliver what the amendment seeks. It would place an obligation on the Government when a transfer is made. If the Government are under such an obligation, we shall drop the matter. Will he make the position clear?

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman of the wording of my right hon. Friend's amendment. It states that a transfer scheme
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``must not have an adverse effect on the pension entitlement of past or present employees of any of the undertakings involved in the scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have made it absolutely clear that that is the case. There will be no adverse effect because the employees will continue to be members of the existing scheme under the same trust deeds, under the same trustees and under the same arrangements as apply at present. I am not sure what point the hon. Gentleman is making. I repeat my request to my right hon. Friend to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I hear the vehement way in which the Minister is now labouring the point that he intends the employees to remain in the same scheme. However, he is not under a legal obligation to ensure that they do. The point of the amendment is to make it an obligation that such an outcome is delivered. Where is the legal obligation? The matter can be cleared up if the Minister simply points to the provision that will place the Government under an obligation to ensure that any transfer does not harm the pension entitlement of past or existing employees. It should be in the Bill. In any case, where is the harm in sticking such a provision in the Bill if that is the Minister's intention? Why does he not simply accept the amendment? Why will a complication arise if he does that? I fail to see an obstacle to prevent him from following the example of his right hon. Friend and gracefully accepting that it should be added to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The Opposition berate us for the Bill being over-long and over-complicated. The hon. Gentleman is now asking us to include in it a clause that is not necessary for the reasons that I have given. I shall repeat them because he finds them difficult to understand. We are talking about schemes. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a scheme does not have an adverse affect on the pension entitlement of past or present employees. I have explained how the scheme cannot have an adverse effect on past or present employees' entitlements. It does not affect their entitlements, because they will remain entitled to all benefits of the scheme, which will continue in the public sector. That is the possible guarantee, which is why the amendment is unnecessary.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is promising that the transfer schemes will have such an effect, but there is no obligation in the Bill or other legislation for him to deliver it. If there is an obligation, would he point to it? That is all I ask, yet he has been unable to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being extraordinarily obtuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Deliberately.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is possible that he is being deliberately obtuse. If we were to put into law provisions to prevent the continuation of arrangements that had an adverse effect on people, legislation would stretch from here to John o' Groats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Why not put the provision in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There is no need for it. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to understand that there will be a continuation of arrangements—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for North Essex seeks to intervene from a sedentary position. I have given way repeatedly, but if he wants to intervene again, I will happily allow him to do so. He might first do me the courtesy of listening to my explanation, which he seems to find difficult to understand.
<P>
The arrangements guarantee the continuation of the public-sector pension scheme to which all past and current NATS employees are entitled to belong. If there were an attempt to worsen the conditions in that pension scheme, the hon. Gentleman's concerns would be justified, but there is no intention to do so. The suggestion that the Secretary of State might try to breach contractual entitlements to which all those pensioners are entitled is absurd, because it implies that he would act unlawfully. That is not our intention. I regard the hon. Gentleman's interventions as misguided. Frankly, he is unnecessarily delaying the proceedings of the Committee, which have already been sufficiently protracted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I have not sought to enter an acid tone into the proceedings; it comes entirely from the Minister. However, he has now clarified the matter. He says that my anxieties and those expressed by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh are covered by existing contractual obligations. The Minister has only just mentioned the term ``contractual obligations''. He has now succeeded in clarifying what could have been clarified much earlier. If he is saying that there is already provision for the enforcement of that parity—
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Of course there is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> He now says of course there is, but why did he not explain that earlier? I shall not get ratty about it—[Laughter.] I am determined to remain good natured and understanding. I appreciate that the Minister has a lot to do. He was on his feet in the Chamber yesterday, and in Committee on Tuesday and again today. I do not wish to add to that pressure. I just point out that he could have explained that much sooner, and we would have been satisfied.
<P>
It has to be said, however, that the matter will exercise the employees of NATS. If the Minister does not include such a provision in the Bill, the employees will face the prospect of litigation with their future employer or the CAA—unless, of course, we take the Minister's word for it. I still fail to understand why it is impossible to incorporate the words of the amendment into the Bill. The Minister has given no indication that doing so would wreck the Bill. He has tried to suggest that it would elongate the Bill and that reams of pages would be necessary, but that is not so. The wording selected by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh would be an adequate signal to employees, and it would make it absolutely clear that, in the event of such litigation, it would be an open and shut case in their direction.
<P>
Although I still do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted, the Minister has explained that contractual obligations will be enforceable in law in order to protect pensioners. That is the sort of assurance that we were looking for; I shall resume my seat.
<P>
<B>Dr. Strang:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend the Minister's clear and helpful response to the amendment. When employees transfer to the new set-up, they will remain in the CAA—the public-sector—scheme. That is hugely important. Some misunderstanding has arisen because two funds will be involved. My hon. Friend has made it clear that, although the funds are separate, the employees will be entitled to the same benefits and the funds will have the same deeds and trustees. He has said categorically that past and present employees will continue to enjoy the same rights as they would otherwise have done, because they will be in the same scheme. The separate funds will not alter the benefits to which employees are entitled. That is helpful; and he went on to make further helpful comments.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Essex—I am not sure that I would have gone this far—said that it would not be reasonable to tie the new company, the private strategic partner, to paying the same benefits on precisely the same terms for new employees. He said that, in the usual course of events, people could expect new employees to be given the option of different arrangements. The hon. Member for Poole suggested that that might cause problems, which we would obviously prefer to avoid. My hon. Friend the Minister's remarks were helpful. As he pointed out, the amendment does not refer to future employees. Accepting the amendment would not, therefore, impinge on arrangements. However, he has given us a categorical undertaking that they will be entitled to the same benefits—not merely be part of the same scheme—as existing employees. We shall no doubt discuss further the status of future employees during the dialogue that will take place both inside and outside the House, but it is a helpful start for my hon. Friend the Minister to say that he will encourage the new company to allow, if it could, even new employees to join the existing scheme.
<P>
The contribution of the hon. Member for North Essex has been helpful, and together we have secured a good arrangement from the debate. Given that the dialogue will continue, it is sensible to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 27, line 20, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(10) This section shall not come into force until the Secretary of State has laid before Parliament the articles of association of the designated company referred to in section 49(3) and the said articles have been approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is designed to flush out the articles of association of the final transferee company. It would oblige the Government to lay before Parliament the articles of association of the final designated company referred to in clause 49(3)—the company that issues the securities, as I was kindly reminded earlier—and would ensure that the articles were approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.
<P>
The amendment may seem extreme; indeed, it is unprecedented. In no previous privatisation has it been suggested that the company's articles of association should be approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. However, the Bill relies on the articles of association to an extreme extent for the assurances that the Government have given about being able to protect matters such as national security and to regulate safety. We are dealing with an exceptional business, which some might argue is really a safety operation of unquantifiable strategic importance, vital to our defence capability and handling sensitive intelligence information. All the matters that we discussed in relation to clause 38 apply just as strongly to our present debate.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Articles of association are important because they are the constitution of the company: they are the rules by which the company conducts its affairs, albeit under United Kingdom companies law. They set out rules on disclosure of shareholdings and share transfers, maximum shareholdings and the advantages of ownership of special shares. If they are defective, the rights intended and implied in the Bill are inoperable. We would be pulling a piece of string with nothing attached at the end. So the articles are of supreme importance.
<P>
The Minister has generously made the draft articles, not necessarily the final draft, but an illustrative document available. Clause 3 of the articles details the share capital, with large black dots indicating where figures denoting the company's share capital are to go.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I do not have a copy of the draft articles. Where may I obtain one?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not strictly a point of order. However, the articles are on the table behind us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> As I was saying, the figures are significant.
<P>
We have an opportunity to discuss the exact nature of the PPP vehicle when it is launched. For example, clause 3 of the articles deals with authorised share capital. What is the gearing in the vehicle? How much share capital will it have? Is the amount of capital, share capital, paid-up share capital and debt an issue? Is that a matter for the company partnership to decide? After all, that will be on its balance sheet and classed as a subsidiary because it is in its control. Is that a technical matter for the partnership? Will the financial security of the deal be ensured by an adequately capitalised PPP vehicle running as a self-sufficient commercial entity, albeit a subsidiary? Or will that vehicle be a trading entity reliant on guarantees and financial support from its parent company? Will the Minister clarify that, as we may not have another opportunity to discuss it?
<P>
Article 4 deals with rights attached to shares. The draft articles show that there is to be no preference share capital. Is there any reason why the strategic partner should not be able to finance the PPP company with preference share capital rather than debt or loans of other descriptions? It would be advantageous to the public interest if the company had preference share capital rather than debt because preference shares are fixed into the balance sheet and, in the event of any financial difficulty, capital attached to preference shares cannot be withdrawn. However, debt can be recalled. I fail to understand why there is no provision for preference shares.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and studied the Amendment Paper: it is plain that his amendment provides simply that the articles of association should be laid before Parliament and debated by both Houses. This is therefore not a debate on the articles and I must rule the hon. Gentleman out of order if he continues down that road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I fully understand and accept that ruling, but I hope that you will accept that the amendment is relevant to the question of whether Parliament should have a right to scrutinise the contents of the articles of association. If the Minister wants us to drop the amendment and to trust him to agree the contents of the articles of association, it is only fair that we should ask the Government to state their intention in regard to the articles of association.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may feel that, and it may be so, but that is not the substance of his amendment. I must now draw him to that clear substance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The substance of the amendment is that Parliament should have the right to determine what goes into the articles of association or, more accurately, that the Government should not be able to determine the articles of association without the consent of Parliament. If, for example, the capital structure of the company was not advantageous to the public interest, Parliament should have a say in the matter. That is particularly relevant to the rights of the special share.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is coming perilously close to challenging my ruling. The amendment that he has tabled clearly does not relate to the substance of the articles, but specifically to whether the articles should be laid before Parliament and to whether both Houses should approve them. If the amendment is agreed, the substance will be a matter for both houses, but it is not a matter for the Committee at this moment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I will obviously have to foreshorten my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Is there not a risk, if the amendment is rejected, of serious deficiencies in the draft articles, which Parliament will not have the opportunity to scrutinise? You have rightly ruled, Mr. Gale, that there is limited scope for debate on that issue. I therefore wonder whether my hon. Friend could suggest how Parliament could scrutinise the articles in the event that his amendment is rejected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Well—
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Perhaps I could suggest, in the spirit in which we have previously approached such questions, a way in which the objective of the hon. Gentleman and of his hon. Friend might be met: it might be appropriate to deal with the matter when we come to subsequent clauses that deal with share capital and the issue of securities and, in clause 49, the Crown shareholding, which is obviously fundamentally relevant to the articles. I will—subject to your approval, Mr. Gale—be happy at that stage to give an outline of the articles and their intention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has heard what the Minister had to say. His suggestion strikes me as extremely helpful, and we may be able to proceed from there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. I am most grateful to the lifeline that the Minister has thrown me. I look forward to hearing his account. It is with some regret—chagrin, to use a European word—that I lay aside the regulations and focus on the amendment.
<P>
It is important that the draft articles of association receive Parliament's attention. Without wanting to labour the point, the fundamental danger is that by oversight, or under pressure from the strategic partner, the articles of association may be compromised during the negotiations. I do not suggest that Labour Members are anything other than honourable, but pressure will be applied to make it easier to reduce the risk and to increase the commercial attractiveness of the deal for the strategic partner.
<P>
We have talked much about the proceeds of the sale, and pressure will be applied by Her Majesty's Treasury to maximise those proceeds. I am sure that the Minister will agree that it would be wrong to compromise the rights of the Crown shareholding under the articles of association, because those rights are vital in the exercise of the special share; the rights of the Crown directors are important also for the benefit of the public interest.
<P>
All those rights need to be secured. It is impossible to include them in the Bill. It would be possible to attach them to a schedule, but the amendment is easily the most practical way of providing a safeguard that will allow Parliament to debate the articles of association before they finally come into effect. That would provide a backstop guarantee that that extremely important business will not be compromised by commercial considerations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I listened with great care to my hon. Friend. I, too, am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of how we might deal with some of our worries about the articles of association.
<P>
This is a serious matter. The organisation is not concerned only with the safety of airline passengers; a substantial national security interest is involved. The work of National Air Traffic Services has a military aspect. If the Minister takes up my suggestion to visit the London air traffic control centre, he will see adjacent to the main civil operation a military unit operated by the Royal Air Force. The two work closely together, which demonstrates the importance of the military and national security interests of the proposed public-private partnership arrangements. That is why the articles of association need to be carefully considered.
<P>
I am mindful of your ruling, Mr. Gale, that the amendment simply proposes that the articles of association should not be approved without the authority of Parliament. The Minister helpfully suggested that the provisions of other clauses might be relevant. I am grateful to him for that. Some of those clauses will enable us to address matters of concern to all members of the Committee. Government investment in securities, grants, loans and guarantees are referred to in clauses 47 to 52.
<P>
Clause 53 is about trustee investments and clause 54 relates to shadow directors. There are other aspects covered by the articles of association that we cannot debate and consider in Committee because the Bill gives us no scope to do so. We are therefore presented with a hit-and-miss opportunity. We can discuss some issues later, but others will go wholly without such consideration. I was interested to read, for example, that there is to be no age limit on share qualification, that no director shall be required to retire or vacate his office and no person shall—
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Nice try, but no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> It was a very interesting point.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It was fascinating, but I am afraid that it was out of order. Can we please return to the amendment under discussion?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am afraid that you missed the best bit, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 49, in which he will discover opportunities to discuss other matters relating to the articles, as the Minister virtually pointed out to him. However, that opportunity has not been created by the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> Clause 49 is entitled ``Crown shareholding''. I shall not tempt your patience by reading an extremely interesting quotation, Mr. Gale, but shall save it up.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I assure my hon. Friend that everything is all right. We shall come to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am a great admirer of my hon. Friend, and if he assures me that we shall come to it, we shall come to it.
<P>
<B>Ms Claire Ward </B>(Watford): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I would be charmed to give way to the hon. Lady.
<P>
<B>Ms Ward:</B> It is a shame that the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo) has been replaced by the hon. Gentleman, as they clearly do not have the same control and ability.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I confess that the hon. Lady is right. Although the sojourn of my right hon. Friend in Committee was destined to be a short one, I must disappoint her: my chances of being promoted from the Committee are zilch, so she is stuck with me. I shall try to make my comments as interesting as I can within the confines that you will allow me, Mr. Gale. Although you recently prevented me from referring to an interesting item, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex assures me that I shall be able to raise the question of age qualifications on clause 49.
<P>
There is a case for ensuring that Parliament has the opportunity to review the final draft, for I take it that the articles of association are still at an early stage of drafting. Before Report, officials will undoubtedly re-draft them and the opportunity will have been missed for the parliamentary scrutiny which I am sure the Minister and Labour members of the Committee, as good parliamentarians, feel should be given to such an important matter.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Essex has proposed a modest and sensible amendment, given the importance of NATS. We all fly around the world and therefore sometimes find ourselves under its safe guidance. The subject does not extend only to a few people in this country, so we all have a vested interest in it. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that we should exercise a substantial duty of care to ensure that we launch this new bird safely and leave nothing to chance. Our modest proposal would not impose an onerous burden on the Government.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> My hon. Friend mentioned a new bird. It is worth stating that the concept is wholly new; it has never been tried before. As he said, our proposal is a worthwhile safety valve.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> As ever, I agree with my hon. Friend. The public and air traffic controllers are concerned about the implications of transferring the organisation from the public sector, but I do not entirely share those concerns. I believe—I have maintained some consistency on this—that it can be operated outside the narrow confines of the public sector, but we have a responsibility to show those who work in NATS and the wider public that we have taken security and safety issues very seriously. By accepting the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex, the Committee and the Government will show the public that we recognise those concerns. Therefore, the draft articles of association should be submitted to Parliament for approval.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> When my hon. Friend referred to the anxieties of air traffic controllers, I heard the Minister say, sotto voce, that they talk of nothing else.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I shall give way to the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> When the hon. Member for Aldershot said that his constituents were deeply concerned about the issue, I commented, sotto voce, that they talk of nothing else, but I was not implying that it was not a matter of concern to air traffic controllers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The Minister is right, but he may not know that the Aldershot constituency encompasses Farnborough, which is not only the birthplace of British aviation but includes the headquarters of British Aerospace and the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency and one of the most famous aerodromes in the world. I assure the Minister that I am in constant contact with the control tower when I fly in the vicinity of Farnborough. Many air traffic controllers, many others who are involved in the aerospace and defence industries and many business men who travel often live in my constituency—a prosperous part of the United Kingdom. I know that the Minister was exaggerating when he said that they speak of nothing else, but they do say a lot about such issues and they certainly write to me about them. Does the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) want to intervene?
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> As usual, I find that invitation irresistible. I did my basic training at Farnborough when I joined the Royal Engineers, and we spoke of many other things than the matter to which he refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> You would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale, if I speculated on that, but I am sure that the Committee can imagine what the hon. Gentleman, who is a man of many parts, was talking about. I am pleased that he knows something of my constituency.
<P>
I have made the point that I wanted to make. I hope that the Minister will think the amendment reasonable and that he will seize the opportunity to reassure those who work in air traffic control and the wider public by accepting it. I rest my case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for North Essex would require the approval of both Houses of Parliament to NATS' articles of association before any transfer schemes were made and, consequently, before the implementation of the PPP through the partial sale of NATS. As the hon. Gentleman conceded at the outset, that would be unprecedented.
<P>
Members of the Committee know that we have made available to them copies of the draft articles of association and the draft strategic partnership agreement, as well as other documentation such as the draft licence agreement, to which the Committee has already given some attention. The purpose of so doing was to give hon. Members an opportunity to consider them at an early stage in their development and to see how they fit within the overall PPP framework. I believe that we have acted openly and generously in making that documentation available so that hon. Members could fully understand the implications. At the same time, however, we have made it clear that they are legal documents that are at an early stage in their development; inevitably, certain elements will need to change as a result of consultation and subsequent developments.
<P>
Following the Committee's consideration of the draft articles, they will be developed by means of an iterative process involving, among other things, negotiations and discussions with potential strategic partners. The negotiations are likely to continue right up until the moment when the PPP documentation is signed by the Government and the strategic partner. A requirement for further parliamentary approval would be extremely difficult to accommodate within that framework and would bring no appreciable benefit when the principles underlying the draft articles had already been the subject of parliamentary scrutiny and discussion. Moreover, as I said, a requirement for parliamentary approval for articles of association is unprecedented in legislation relating to sales of Government assets, including legislation introduced by previous Conservative Governments.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that we have gone a long way towards enabling exactly the discussions about the principles behind these documents that he wants, that it would not be practical or feasible to accept the amendment and that he will agree to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his response. I fully accept that the amendment is not entirely practical. It was designed to give us the opportunity to explore issues arising from the articles of association, but we will have to return to that at a later date.
<P>
I place on the record my thanks to the Minister for his patience throughout our discussion of this clause. You will be surprised, Mr. Gale, that I am not going to ask you to indulge the Committee in a debate on stand part. The Minister has taken quite a lot today, but we have benefited from his explanations about the nature of the transfers and I am much clearer about them. I hope that we will be able to make faster progress through subsequent clauses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
THE CHAIRMAN, being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendment proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Order No. 68, That the clause stand part of the Bill:—
<P>
Clause 40 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer schemes made by CAA</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> There is a complication, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is no complication. The hon. Gentleman either moves his amendment or he does not.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 300, in page 27, line 22, after `may', insert 'make an order to'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 302, in clause 42, page 27, line 31, leave out `approves it in writing' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`makes an order to approve the scheme'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 305, in clause 43, page 28, line 10, after `make', insert `an order to make'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I was just going to explain why I jumped up like a scalded cat. For much of the afternoon I have been without certain colleagues and, indeed, without my esteemed Whip, so it has fallen to me to attempt, ineffectively, to arrange business through the usual channels. I am now able to turn my entire attention to the business at hand.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> This is fascinating, but it is nothing to do with the Chairman and it is certainly nothing to do with amendment No. 300.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The amendment proposes another safeguard. Clause 41 deals with the schemes that are to be made by the CAA, which we have already discussed at length—[Interruption.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> It must be extremely disconcerting for the hon. Gentleman—we all feel for him—because every time he gets to his feet, all his colleagues flee the Room. Is there a secret that he can let the rest of us into?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Yes: it is belonging to an Opposition party consisting of 164 Members, with all the logistical and practical difficulties that that involves. I am, however, not here to plead my personal vicissitudes, but to do a job and—I say this to the Government Whip with a glint in my eye—to make progress.
<P>
The clause concerns schemes made by the CAA to transfer business and assets as specified in the previous clause and provides that the CAA may make schemes only where directed to do so by the Secretary of State. Given the exceptional nature of this privatisation—the Minister denied, with all the e´lan that he could muster, that it was a privatisation, but it is, albeit an exceptional one—we think that when the Secretary of State makes directions, it is fair that he should inform Parliament of what he is up to. Amendment Nos. 300, 302, and 305 apply to clauses 41, 42 and 43 respectively and would require the Secretary of State in each case to make an order rather than just to act or to approve a scheme in writing.
<P>
I hope that the Minister's response might cause the Committee to be confident that the amendments are unnecessary because Parliament would be well informed about what was going on; otherwise, we might require a safeguard of this nature to ensure that the Secretary of State was doing his job as intended—as I am sure the Minister will assure us he would.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendments would result in a time-consuming and cumbersome mechanism. Proposed schemes will be subject to consultation with those concerned. They will be technical in nature and designed to achieve either the complete separation of regulation from service provision or the separation of the regulated part of NATS' business from the unregulated part. Giving parliamentary approval to each scheme could jeopardise the PPP timetable, as I explained on the last group of amendments. The approach proposed by the hon. Gentleman is unprecedented. None of the many such schemes in the past has been subject to parliamentary approval. I therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I heard what the Minister said and I accept the unprecedented nature of the amendments. I hope that he would agree that it is important that Parliament is kept informed of the progress of this PPP. I understand that that is the intention and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 240, in page 27, line 22, leave out `direct' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`give a direction requiring'.—[Mr. Raynsford.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 301, in page 27, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) Stamp duty shall not be payable on such a transfer.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was about to get all indignant, Mr. Gale, as I thought that you had forgotten to call this amendment—but there was no need. I can remain my usual calm and rational self.
<P>
The amendment would add a new subsection to the clause and I shall be grateful if the Minister will explain the purpose of the clause when he replies. The proposed new subsection would ensure that transfers would not attract stamp duty because it would become an extremely expensive operation. Perhaps that is what inflates fees and costs. I hope that stamp duty would not be payable on these transactions and the amendment aims to avoid that if at all possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance he wants. If he looks ahead to paragraph 16 of schedule 7—I accept that we have not got there and I do not blame him for not having reached that—he will find that it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A relevant transfer is not to give rise to liability to stamp duty.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I can give him the absolute assurance that his amendment is unnecessary because the provision is already in the Bill and I therefore invite him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. Before I sit down, will the Minister say something about the operation of the clause now rather than on stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> If it would help the Committee for me to do so, I shall.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister is in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The clause gives the power to the CAA to make transfer schemes. It can, however, do so only if directed by the Secretary of State, although the latter is under a duty to consult the authority first. Amendment No. 240, which we just agreed, makes it clear how that direction should be given by the Secretary of State. The CAA has been selected to be the maker of transfer schemes because as it is the current owner of NATS it is best placed to fulfil this role. Subsection (3) provides a degree of protection for the CAA when acting under a direction from the Secretary of State. It enables the Authority to comply with the direction notwithstanding any duty that might be placed on it by any other enactment. For example, it is conceivable that the CAA could still be under the duty in section 72 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 to provide air navigation services at the same time as it is directed to make a scheme for the transfer of its shares in NATS to the Secretary of State. This subsection prevents the CAA from being taken to be in breach of its duty to provide the services as a result of having complied with the Secretary of State's direction.
<P>
I appreciate that that might sound slightly complicated and tortuous, but it shows what a legal minefield we are in and the importance of making it quite clear that compliance with the directions will not have any adverse consequences for the CAA. I hope that that has given the hon. Gentleman the explanation he was looking for and that he will now withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am more than satisfied. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Effect of scheme made by CAA</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> The clause is relatively self-explanatory. It contains various details on the Secretary of State's responsibilities in relation to the transfer scheme. It allows him to modify it before approving it, although he is required to consult first. It also requires the transferor or transferee to provide the Secretary of State with information and assistance. I note that it is an offence to fail to provide the Secretary of State with that information without reasonable excuse. A person who is guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction can be subjected to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. When the Minister replies to the debate, will he gently remind those of us who are not entirely familiar with the standard scales what such a person might be liable to. Would he be dispossessed or would it be just a rap on the knuckles?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Whereas clause 41 gave the CAA the power to make transfer schemes, this clause provides that any such scheme cannot come into force unless the Secretary of State has given his approval to it. The Secretary of State may make such changes to the scheme as he considers appropriate, but before doing so he must consult the transferor and transferee. The Secretary of State can require any transferor or transferee to provide such information and assistance as he may reasonably require to enable him to exercise his powers. As the hon. Member for Aldershot rightly pointed out, failure to do so would be a criminal offence carrying with it a fine up to level 5. That could involve a fine of up to £5,000. There is a happy symmetry: level 5 and £5,000 seem to be in line with each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> What is the time scale? When is a person in breach? How many days would be given to provide the information?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The provision is not particularly specific. It is there to make it clear that the Secretary of State must have the ability to obtain the information if necessary. Clearly, if he sought to enforce this through seeking action against the party who had failed to provide the information, it would be for the courts to decide whether the person concerned had had sufficient time to comply. The normal principles of our legal system would cover that. We are not going into detailed provisions. We are aware that the Bill is already pretty complicated and that to spell out in precise and minute detail exactly what period should elapse before the penalty came in might be over-gilding the lily. I hope that that satisfies his concern.
<P>
These provisions enable the Secretary of State to control the transfer scheme process. All members of the Committee will appreciate the importance of the Secretary of State having the power to do that if the process is to proceed in an orderly and timely way.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Transfer schemes made by Secretary of State</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 28, line 5, leave out subsection (1).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 304, in page 28, line 10, leave out `In such a case'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It all gets a bit confusing when we come to the Secretary of State's schemes. We have been following the parallel of other Acts and on close inspection of the Railways Act I can find no reference—
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> Section 85.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for that help. Section 85 refers to the powers of the board to make transfer schemes. Section 86 refers to the powers of the franchising director to make transfer schemes and section 87 deals with transfer to the Secretary of State or the franchising director of the board's function of making transfer schemes. Ah! All is revealed. There is no precedent for the Secretary of State to make transfer schemes. Why does the Bill require the Secretary of State to make transfer schemes, as clause 41 gives him the power to direct the CAA to make transfer schemes on his behalf? The need for such a clause is mystifying, although I am not as familiar as the Minister with the Railways Act.
<P>
Amendment No. 403 would delete subsection (l). Amendment No. 404 would delete the first four words from subsection (2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``In such a case the Secretary of State may make a transfer scheme after consulting each person who is a transferor or transferee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We wish to make the Bill a bit simpler. However, if the Minister explains the drafting of the clause, I am sure that we will be happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has examined the lengthy provisions of the Railways Act, so he will appreciate that section 87 of that Act provides the Secretary of State with a reserve power and makes a parallel with clause 43.
<P>
Essentially, the transfer scheme provisions are the responsibility of the CAA, which is most familiar with the property, rights and liabilities to be transferred, so is in the best position to fulfil that role. The requirement for the Secretary of State's approval ensures that he remains in overall control of the process. However, it is not designed to supplant the normal process of the CAA drawing up schemes which, I repeat, the latter is best placed to do.
<P>
Therefore, we do not accept the amendment, as the clause makes provision for the Secretary of State to take default powers if the CAA fails to submit a transfer scheme within the necessary period. That is a necessary safeguard which, however, we do not envisage will apply. The hon. Gentleman's amendment would complicate the process unduly by putting the primary duty on the Secretary of State to do something that the CAA is best placed to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 43 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 44</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information for Purposes of section 43</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This clause is extraordinarily long and reiterates the rondo form of this part of the Bill. It contains a refrain, stating that interested bodies are ``the CAA'',
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a company which is wholly owned by the Crown''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a company which is wholly owned by the CAA''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
To my fuddled brain, the clause is completely redundant. It aims to provide information for the purposes of clause 43, but replicates what is already in place. It should be simplified and reduced.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The clause enables the Secretary of State to obtain the information that he needs to make a scheme. The Secretary of State may issue a direction to interested bodies requiring them to provide information that he considers necessary.
<P>
If such a direction is not complied with, the Secretary of State has the power to serve a written notice requiring the recipient to provide the specified documents and information. Anyone who fails to do anything required in the notice without a reasonable excuse will be guilty of a criminal offence. It is an offence for the recipient of a notice to alter, suppress or destroy a document, production of which has been required by the notice. Such provisions are important, as malpractice would have disastrous consequences in a service of this significance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister said that that relates to a business's on-going management. However, the clause simply deals with providing information for the purposes of transfer. Under what circumstances would someone wilfully destroy information to frustrate a transfer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's surprise.
<P>
Obviously, we do not expect such a position to arise. However, the process has not been without controversy and has made some people unhappy. If a party tried to thwart it by withholding, changing or, worse still, destroying information, that would be a serious matter. The whole communications, transport and air-transport system—in this country and far more widely—depends on the service, so we need a requirement for the Secretary of State to obtain information and penalties in the event of those obligations not being satisfied.
<P>
If the recipient of a notice fails to comply with it, the Secretary of State may apply to the court for an order requiring compliance. The order can provide for costs and expenses incidental to the application to be paid by the defaulting body or its officers, as appropriate.
<P>
The Secretary of State is further removed than the CAA from the parties to a transfer scheme, so needs specific powers to obtain information enabling him to carry out his role in making transfer schemes. Clause 44 gives him those powers.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was concerned about the refrain in subsection (2), which lists interested bodies. I am afraid to disappoint him, but that refrain occurs again. Indeed, a recapitulation occurs in clause 47, which we shall debate shortly. When we do so, we may reconsider such interesting matters. However, I trust that I have satisfied the hon. Gentleman on the basic principle of the need for information and that the clause may stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 44 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 45</center></H4>
<H4><center>Accounting provisions</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 323, in page 29, line 25, leave out `by virtue of' and insert `under'.'
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 324 to 329.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> These amendments seek to remove the inconsistency between references to a transfer by virtue of a transfer scheme and a transfer under a transfer scheme. In a few instances, the clause mentions transfer ``by virtue'' of a transfer scheme. That wording will be replaced by the more frequently used phrase, ``transfer under a transfer scheme''. The amendments ensure that the phrasing is technically consistent throughout.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Under-Secretary explain the clause's accounting provisions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I certainly will. I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman's implied inquiry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I assume that the hon. Gentleman wishes to avoid a stand part debate. On that basis, I am prepared to allow the Under-Secretary to reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful, Mr. Gale.
<P>
The clause deals with determining the book value of a company. It is not concerned with evaluation which would be made for a sale nor creative accounting—the latter matter is germane to the hon. Gentleman's inquiry.
<P>
Clause 45 deals with accounting provisions and provides for values or amounts to be ascribed for accounting purposes to property, rights or assets transferred under a transfer scheme. It is especially concerned with, for example, the opening accounts for the newly transferred NATS to the Secretary of State and any wholly owned subsidiaries of NATS. Those transactions will not be normal commercial transactions and it is necessary to provide certainty about how transferred assets should be accounted for. The object of the transfer scheme is to parcel out assets and liabilities between different entities as though they had always been held that way.
<P>
Clause 45(5) allows the maker of a transfer scheme—the CAA with the Secretary of State's approval—to substitute a different book value when the maker sees fit. That is not intended to allow creative accounting but, for example, when an asset is split between companies, splitting the old book value might produce a manifestly wrong result in the new entity's accounts. That might arise in the case of an irrecoverable debt or if a new value had to be substituted where the old book value was in doubt because of deficient accounting records.
<P>
It goes without saying that the provisions of clause 45 have a precedent in previous sales of Government assets—I need hardly refer to the Railways Act 1993. They are also incorporated in electricity legislation. I hope that my explanation satisfies the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Part of the clause catches my eye. I am sure that there is a good precedent, and I do not suggest that the Government are doing anything untoward, but we require an explanation.
<P>
The Under-Secretary drew attention to subsection (5). That provision has a Maxwellian feel to it. To manipulate values on the balance sheet of a company in the normal course of events is deeply suspect, if not illegal. I appreciate that the values ascribed to various assets and liabilities may need to be adjusted; we shall be dealing with an on-going concern in the private sector instead of the rather more relaxed attitude to asset values and accounting that exists in the public sector.
<P>
Will the Under-Secretary specify what sort of values he is likely to manipulate under those circumstances? What sort of assets will need to be revalued or written off? They will not be simple paper transactions that have no effect on the public accounts. As we move to an era of resource accounting, all public institutions and Government Departments will themselves have balance sheets, so changes made under clause 45 will have a material effect on the nation's accounts.
<P>
One would hope that the Under-Secretary can assure the Committee that the provision is about adjusting values to their real market value rather than manipulating values in order to cook the books. I would not accuse the Under-Secretary of that, but I wonder whether he could illuminate the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am conscious of the hon. Gentleman's interest in the matter. Indeed, he adverted to it earlier. I remember that he suggested that the Secretary of State would have huge scope to determine the value of assets. That, of course, is not true.
<P>
Clause 45(5) allows the Secretary of State to substitute a different book value when appropriate. For example, the old book value of an asset that was split between companies might be manifestly wrong—perhaps if there was an irrecoverable debt or if accounting records were deficient. However, the important factor—this should reassure the hon. Gentleman—is that if an inappropriate value is substituted, the company's auditors would not be able to sign off the accounts as true and fair. That is where the guarantee lies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that explanation. How are such changes in value to be reported? Is there a method of writing down and reporting the changes? If the Public Accounts Committee wanted to do an audit trail of the changes suggested by the Under-Secretary, how would it ensure that the accounts were open and above board? How would they be scrutinised and audited—and, if necessary, corrected?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman tempts me into deep waters. I have to confess that, like the hon. Member for North Shropshire—this is probably the first time that I have some empathy with him—I am not an accountant. If I were, I might be a lot better off, but I doubt that I could stand the pace.
<P>
Let me make it entirely clear. All the records, all the numbers, all those values will appear in the published accounts of the CAA. I have absolute confidence in the validity of that reporting. I anticipated a certain amount of probing, but I remind the hon. Gentleman that he said earlier that the CAA was an excellent company, with good accounting practices. I am sure that the Committee agrees with him. Indeed, it is the assurance that we all seek. Auditors will pore over the records, and the accounting provisions will be explained in the accounts of the new entity. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is sufficiently reassured.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> That is strong reassurance. I have no doubt that precedents exist for the procedure. I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's informing the Committee.

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I certainly would. The clause contains definitions of a number of terms used in clause 45, which deals with the accounting treatment of transfer scheme provisions.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(being securities of a class authorised under the articles of association of the transferee)'.<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, consistent with the provisions of the articles of association of the transferee,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This is the moment of truth. This is the clause that launches the great ship ``PPP'' into the blue yonder. This is the clause entitled ``Issue of securities''. It is this clause that empowers the Secretary of State to authorise the issue of securities in the PPP company to the strategic partner. It is important, when the Secretary of State gives his consent, that we should be happy with the arrangement.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has kindly furnished us with copies of the strategic partnership agreement. We have not yet debated it, but in giving an account of the clause I wonder whether he could, at the same time, give us an account of the agreement. I look to you, Mr. Gale, for guidance on that point. The strategic partnership agreement should be debated now, because return to the subject will be difficult. This is the point of no return.
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The transferee must issue to the appropriate person such securities of the transfer as the Secretary of State may from time to time direct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The ``transferee'' is the PPP company, the ``appropriate person'' is the strategic partner and ``such securities'' are shares in the transferee, but I am bound to question why such action might be required ``from time to time''. I thought that such action was a one-off and that the Government had consulted on a specific scheme. We have not tabled an amendment specifying that 46 per cent. of the shares would go here, while 5 per cent. of the shares would go there, because we expect the Government to behave in a relatively grown-up manner in relation to such matters.
<P>
I should have thought that two fairly straightforward transactions could be made on a given date, at which point the PPP would commence. Instead, subsection (2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may from time to time direct.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I was even more alarmed to see that nothing in the Bill requires the Secretary of State to retain his 49 per cent. shareholding. Labour Members may like to reflect on that, given that we have been assured that the Government will hold on to the shareholding of 49 per cent. The Bill states that the Secretary of State may issue 46 per cent. of shares and 5 per cent. of shares, but goes on to say that he may ``from time to time'' direct the disposal of further securities.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. I have been listening carefully to what he has to say, but he must bear in mind that we are debating amendments Nos. 308 and 309. Amendment No. 241, to which he is now referring, has been debated and, as such, I must rule his remarks out of order. In return for that admonition, if the Under-Secretary wishes to refer in his reply to the strategic partnership agreement for the convenience and information of the Committee and to enhance its understanding, I shall allow him to do so. For the moment, however, the hon. Gentleman must refer directly to amendments Nos. 308 and 309.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I stand admonished, Mr. Gale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> In response to your observations, Mr. Gale, it would be for the convenience of the Committee and of the hon. Gentleman if we held the broader debate about the strategic partnership when we discuss clause 49. That might help him to save his energies. Clause 47 does not launch the PPP. It does a different job and, if the hon. Gentleman is agreeable, I shall now concentrate on the amendments and we can deal with the broader issue under clause 49.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The person who must be agreeable, or even in agreement, is me, and I may be prepared to be so. For the moment, will the Committee confine the debate to amendments Nos. 308 and 309?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Gale. It was designed to enable us to make faster progress.
<P>
If I confine my comments to the amendments now, I hope that we can still have a debate on clause stand part. The amendments are narrow. They both refer to matters of company law. After the words in subsection (2),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The transferee must issue to the appropriate person such securities''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the amendment would add:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(being securities of a class authorised under the articles of association of the transferee)''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have little doubt that that is the intention of the clause, as it would be contrary to company law for the company to issue shares that were not authorised, but the amendment would clarify the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 309 refers to what must be implicit in the articles of association. Subsection (4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Securities issued in pursuance of this section must be issued or allotted at such time or times and'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
after which the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``consistent with the provisions of the articles of association of the transferee''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would be added under amendment No. 309. Again, it is a company law matter that no measure must override articles of association unless the shareholders amend them to comply with the legislation. The Government have already accepted that principle in clause 49, in which they specify that the special share must be consonant with the articles of association, or vice versa, but that is not specified in clause 47. Amendment No. 309 would improve the drafting of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We are satisfied with the drafting of the Bill. Before I deal with the amendments, I shall explain that the clause is about balancing the books as part of the process of preparing NATS for partial sale. In essence, it tells the subsidiaries that they have all the assets, so they must issue shares up to their value. Shares are not necessarily securities; they can be debts and loans. The transferor referred to would normally be the CAA, but it could be NATS in the case of a subsidiary.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 308 and 309 would ensure that securities issued under the clause were of a type authorised by the issuing company's articles of authorisation and that they were issued in accordance with those articles of association.
<P>
To assist the Committee, I shall give an example of the circumstances in which the issues of securities may be directed under clause 47. As I have explained, transfer schemes will be required to transfer that part of NATS' existing business which the CAA will regulate and that part which will not be so regulated, to two new subsidiaries of NATS. Under the relevant transfer schemes, those subsidiaries will receive a number of valuable assets for which they will not be required to pay. Under clause 47, those companies will be required to issue securities to NATS. The purpose of so doing would be to provide NATS with securities to replace those assets transferred under the transfer schemes and to ensure the accounting integrity of each subsidiary's balance sheet. Clause 47 is intended to assist the accountants; it does not have wide-ranging implications for NATS or the PPP.
<P>
To reinforce that point, it may help if I advise the Committee that the Government intend to table an amendment to the clause that will require the relevant company to issue any such securities when it is wholly owned by the CAA or the Crown. The Secretary of State will not therefore be able to make any direction under the clause post PPP.
<P>
Although it is not uncommon for a company's articles of association to include provision for each class of security that it issues, that is not always the case and it is certainly not a requirement of company law. Accordingly, there is no reason why the restriction in amendments Nos. 308 and 309 would be useful or necessary, especially given the relatively anodyne purpose of the clause. The only possible effect of the amendments would be to complicate an otherwise simple provision, which is well precedented in other legislation on the sale of Government assets without the restriction proposed by Opposition Members. Therefore, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I listened with interest to the Minister's explanation, which was partially helpful, although I confess that I lost him slightly halfway through it. I am sure that other members of the Committee understood him perfectly, but I wonder whether he could give a hypothetical illustration of the non-regulated aspect of the company. How would it value itself and what securities would it create to give to NATS? Such an example would be helpful.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I thought that we had had that discussion under clause 46 when, in detail, we went into the process by which values were identified, assigned and audited—and therefore approved.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I apologise—I had to be in two places at once and I was somewhere else when the Under-Secretary gave that explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> If my hon. Friend were able to see the monitor from where he is sitting, he would see that another member of the Committee is speaking in the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> It is difficult when one has to take part in two things at once. If the Under-Secretary has already given that explanation to the Committee, I shall not take up more time with it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I understand my hon. Friend's confusion. As the Under-Secretary has explained that this is not the moment of truth in the Bill, could he explain exactly who the transferee is?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The transferee would—I believe—be the NATS subsidiaries, to which we have referred on many occasions. On reflection, may I withdraw the words ``I believe'', which may have incorrectly implied an element of doubt? The transferee will be the NATS subsidiaries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is curious that ``I believe'' are the first words of the creed, yet in any other circumstances it is an expression of frailty and doubt. It is entirely characteristic of the Under-Secretary that he should acknowledge that so gracefully and I do not blame him in the least for his momentary confusion—which is why I asked the question. Now that I understand that the clause is about setting up NATS and its subsidiaries and transferring assets to and from the subsidiaries of the PPP company, its purpose is clearer. I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's explanation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>Mr. Gerald Howarth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 311, in page 31, line 41, after `without', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the approval of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament and'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would provide a further safeguard by providing for parliamentary scrutiny of the arrangements. I hope that hon. Members will indulge me, since today is the first day that I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee. The clauses are littered with such phrases as ``transferee'' and ``transferor'', which becomes a little confusing. I am not sure which Minister will respond to the amendment. I suspect that it will be the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), and it will be a great privilege to hear what he has to tell us.
<P>
As I understand it, the clause will apply when any property, rights or liabilities are transferred to a company in the state sector or which is a subsidiary of the CAA. Under subsection (3),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State must not dispose of any securities or rights acquired under this section without the Treasury's consent.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If amendment No. 311 were accepted, he would not be able to do so without the additional
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``approval of a resolution of both Houses of Parliament''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary is able to clarify a specific point. It is not clear whether the subsection applies solely to the initial disposal of the transferee under the PPP or for any subsequent privatisation of the Government's shareholding in the PPP vehicle. If our amendment were accepted, Parliament would have the final word. Otherwise, the clause might authorise the PPP establishment and we might then discover that we had given the green light to full privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> My hon. Friend is on the right track. The clause would give carte blanche to do that. We would obviously welcome full privatisation. We suspected all along that there was an agenda to offload much more in future, and the clause is precisely the provision under which the Government could do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for confirming that my interpretation is correct. We have raised a matter of considerable concern, no doubt more so to Labour than Conservative Members, save that we want to know precisely what we are dealing with. Is it a PPP or a hidden agenda for full-scale privatisation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We received a note from the Government entitled ``Protection of the Public Interest'', but my hon. Friend will not have done. I request that Ministers provide him with all the documentation that we have received.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I should have told the Committee that that has already been arranged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am most grateful. That is no less than I expect, given the courtesy of Ministers throughout the Committee's proceedings. It is fascinating that the note states that the strategic partnership agreement
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``therefore provides for the possibility of a flotation of NATS after the New Scottish Centre is completed, currently expected in 2006.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On the Government's own admission, this halfway house of a privatisation paves the way for a full-scale flotation of air traffic control, as it is to be provided in the strategic partnership agreement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. As he said, I am flying without a seat belt—perhaps I should say without the full navigational equipment required. I simply have an old-fashioned map rather than the full ground positioning system. I am also grateful to you, Mr. Gale, for arranging for me to have the full information that other members of the Committee have received.
<P>
My hon. Friend is right. It ought to be clear to the Committee, the House and the public precisely what the Bill authorises. If it authorises not only the creation of a PPP vehicle, but an arrangement whereby that vehicle could be floated as a full privatisation without further parliamentary scrutiny, that would be a serious concealment. Considerations of democratic accountability outweigh party ideology, and we would not be doing a service to either side of the House if we did not subject the clause to full scrutiny and secure a clear undertaking that there is no intention of providing a means by which a far greater degree of privatisation than Ministers suggest could be achieved.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I appreciate that it has been a particularly difficult day for Members on both sides of the House. I thank all hon. Members for continuing their business with the courtesy and good humour to which the Committee has become accustomed. There are times when a certain amount of levity is a good thing; I think that we have proved that today. I wish all hon. Members an enjoyable, productive, and, after last weekend's events, a safe weekend.
