may remove their jackets during Committee sittings if they wish.
Members should ensure that mobile phones, pagers and other such devices
are turned off or switched to silent mode during Committee sittings.
Also, as a general rule, I and my fellow Chair do not intend to call
starred amendments that have not been tabled with adequate notice. The
required notice period in Public Bill Committees is three working days.
Therefore, amendments should be tabled by the rise of the House on
Monday for consideration on Thursday, and by the rise of the House on
Thursday for consideration on
Tuesday.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000007">&#160;</a>

members of the Committee less familiar with the process of taking oral
evidence in Public Bill Committees, it may help if I explain how we
will proceed. The Committee will be asked first to consider the
programme motion on the amendment paper, on which debate is limited to
half an hour. We will proceed to a motion to report written evidence,
and then to a motion, which I hope we can take formally, to permit the
Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence
sessions. Assuming that the last of those motions has been agreed to,
the Committee will go into private session. Once the Committee has
deliberated, the witnesses and the members of the public will be
invited back into the room and our oral evidence session will begin. If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral
evidence this morning. I call the Minister to move the programme motion
standing in its
name.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000008">&#160;</a>

to a conclusion at 4.00 pm on Thursday 19
May.</p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
start by welcoming you, Ms Clark, to the Chair, and all other members
of the Committee. I suspect that there must be a unique piece of
parliamentary history being made this morning, because the right hon.
Member for Dulwich and West Norwood, the right hon. Member for Bath and
I were all involved in considering the original Act six years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000011">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This
Bill is reasonably short and simply builds on a number of the
undertakings made in the 2005 and 2006 legislation. It is small and
technical in nature, and it ensures that the principles enshrined in
the original Act can be implemented. As such, I hope that we can
confine our debates over the next couple of days to the small and tight
matters under discussion, and not range further than those.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000012">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I should add
that London Councils and the Local Government Association were invited
to give evidence to the Committee today. Both declined to do so because
they believed, apparently, that the Bill was not of sufficient concern
to merit their attendance. The organising committee also declined to
give oral evidence. We shall go through the Bill clause by clause on
Thursday and there are no schedules. With the Committee’s
agreement, I hope that the clauses will be considered in the order that
they appear in the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000013">&#160;</a>

                           </span> Welcome to the
Chair, Ms Clark. Labour Members are very happy to support the programme
motion. The Minister has made clear the technical nature of the Bill.
It gives effect to a number of the commitments that we made in 2005
when we won the right to host the Olympic games and updates the 2006
legislation. Perhaps unusually for such sittings, it carries almost
complete cross-party support. Indeed, that has been one of the great
strengths of the progress that we have made in our hosting of the
Olympic games. It has won the confidence of the International Olympic
Committee, our country’s athletes, the organising committee, the
sponsors and the people of this country, who see these games as their
Olympics, held in trust by the Government of the time. I am happy to
support the programme motion.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000014">&#160;</a>

the ORN is inside London, feeding the competition venues and the
training venues, to move athletes from their place of accommodation to
their place of competition or training. Outside London, there are
elements of the ORN that will move the rowers from the accommodation at
Egham, for example, to Eton Dorney for the rowing and flat-water
canoeing, and also the roads down to Weymouth and Portland to support
the sailing competition there. Within the football host cities, there
is no need for ORNs as such, because the volume of vehicles and the
duration of competition mean they don’t need them—they
are well used to supporting football matches
anyway.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the dynamic outside London itself—it generally feeds up to
Broxbourne for white-water canoeing, Hadleigh Farm, Eton Dorney, and
Weymouth and Portland. However, measures will be very different because
the durations will be different. For example, at Broxbourne 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 4<a class="bkMark" name="Column4">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the competition will be finished by day 6 and we will immediately drop
the measures out at that point. Furthermore, the background traffic
will be less, so the intervention needed to smooth the traffic will be
less.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third thing is that there are elements and places within the UK where
the enforcement will need to be done by the police. For example, south
Bucks has yet to put in civil enforcement for measures, and there,
Thames Valley police will help us out. So, there are differences
between London and outside
London.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
prime way to prove the networks will be simulation using computers,
rather than live testing. Nevertheless, the individual elements will be
tested in advance of the games and we will build it all together for
the games operation. Not all measures will come into force on the same
day because, for London, the media will start at the back end of June,
the athletes in the middle of July and the games competition from the
27th onwards. There is therefore a phased build-up of activity from
June onwards into July, dropping off at the end of the Paralympics.
That is why the measures here are
time-limited.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000031">&#160;</a>

                           </em> From a roads perspective, there are three
elements in the Bill that are essentially of a technical nature, which
will facilitate the games and the communities in which they operate.
First, it provides coherence between moving and static traffic
offences, allowing local authorities to take due measures, where
necessary, to make it come together. Secondly, it allows for temporary
orders and notices immediately during games time. If we find that there
are problems, we can rectify them immediately to keep the games going
effectively, which will help the athletes, spectators and background
road
users.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000034">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
third measure is around special event notices—ensuring that you
don’t need to create multiple event notices and that they
embrace all relevant measures. You don’t have to write a
women’s marathon route and a men’s marathon route; you
write one marathon route that has everything in it, and you can then
use it for two different events. These are essentially nurturing
amendments that allow the filling out of the legislation in the spirit
of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act
2006.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000035">&#160;</a>

is obviously a little bit broader. My colleagues have given very
specific transport and advertising responses. We are happy that the
Bill allows clarity around things such as what will happen on the ORN
if there is a problem, and what will happen at short notice. Our only
real concern with the implementation is that business be given
appropriate warning—not just when things are communicated, but
how they will be communicated in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>

so that they are not accidently caught short by implementation of the
alternative ORN, should there be a problem on the ORN. I think that

                           </em> If I may, I will take your question in two
parts—measures first, then what we have learned from the
process. I think that the measures are broadly comparable to those that
were put in place for Sydney following the experiences of Atlanta. They
are also broadly comparable to those used in Athens in 2004. Beijing in
2008, as you might imagine, took a slightly more forceful approach to
running their road system at games time, which involved a series of
measures for an entire 60 days, lanes throughout the road network, half
the vehicles banned on alternative number plates, and deliveries only
between 12 and 6 at night. London, as you can probably gather, has
adopted a slightly more proportional approach to hours of operation,
days of operation and the measures needed, trying to achieve the right
balance between making certain that athletes get there on time while
keeping London and the other places in the UK operating effectively
during games
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000038">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
big learning point for us—it echoes what Hannah said
earlier—is the need to work with communities and businesses. We
have been embarked, with our colleagues in Transport for London, on an
advice-to-business programme since November last year. We are providing
free consultancy support to the bigger employers, and working through
organisations such as London First and the FSB to get to the 200,000
businesses in London and get them to start thinking about what it means
in planning terms. Do they pre-order their materials? Do they do things
differently on the arrival and departure patterns of their staff and
the rest of it? The big learning point is trying to work with the city,
local authorities, employers and business to make it a positive
experience to host the games, and one that works for the spectators and
the
athletes.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000039">&#160;</a>

two. The big challenges for the games are to do with the intensity and
duration of the activity itself. This is an entire summer of activity,
starting with the Queen’s diamond jubilee, then the 16 days of
the Olympic games and 12 days of the Paralympic games. There are
different types of challenge in relation to competitors, spectators and
such like. That intensity and the need to maintain businesses—so
that the pubs do not run dry, so that you can still buy your
sandwiches—is a big challenge to any
nation.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000045">&#160;</a>

questions on the ORN. Mr Sumner, where would you anticipate the maximum
pressure will be? I would like to explain this question a bit. My
experience of the other games that I have attended is that maintaining
the support of the public for the necessity of the ORN is a very
important part of ensuring the overall smooth running of the games. I
remember both in Beijing and Athens, roads had one lane dedicated to
the ORN, traffic-free, with large cars gliding along, while the
residents of Athens and the normal spectators sat bumper to bumper in
the other two lanes. That image would not be good for London. I think
we all know that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000050">&#160;</a>

Wicks’s question: at which parts of the network do you
anticipate maximum pressure? Will we see two lanes bumper to bumper,

importantly—and for the IOC? What do you expect regarding

pressure on the road network, athletes, competitors and technical
officials will be moved from the east to venues in the centre of town.
There will be a lot of flow coming from athletes who have competed
going in one way and athletes who are going to compete going in the
other—in areas such as along the Embankment and on Lower Thames
street and Upper Thames street. The large flows will generally be
east-west in direction. To give a sense of scale, that means a minibus,

venues for 9 o’clock, when, for example, volleyball at Earls
Court starts. From then on, throughout the whole day, it will be very
busy because many of the sports events have one, two or three
competitions a day at that particular venue. There will be a very large
flow of athletes, competitors, and technical officials and such people
working there. The road networks will be busy all day. For that reason,
TfL and ourselves are working with businesses to manage background
traffic during the games. That involves rerouting traffic, persuading
people to leave their vehicles behind if possible, and businesses
adjusting their freight patterns for deliveries—for example,
pre-ordering their stationery before the games so that such deliveries
are not needed during them. That is the
key.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000054">&#160;</a>

in London during the Olympic and Paralympic games. Under the host city

football authorities are putting back football matches. Having said
that, there are going to be a whole range of other events taking place,
with live sites, IOC houses, and big sponsors taking places like
Alexandra Palace. All such events are being collated by the Greater
London authority into a London events calendar, which is now being
assessed by the police and the transport people, such as ourselves and
TfL, to ensure that London can cope with that footprint of the wider
events that will take place in the summer of 2012. There is also an
analogous measure

transport co-ordination centre, which is already in existence and
exercising. It will co-ordinate all modes of transport across the UK
during games time, welding together heavy rail, rail and roads in
London, and Games Family transport, in order to get coherence of
delivery and ensure that we are coherent in communicating effectively
to users of public transport and the road system. A key thing coming
out of the transport co-ordination centre will be information back to
the operators themselves—so, to road users using variable
message signing, radio adverts, radio bursts; all those means are
designed to ensure that we can give the best possible information so
that, if there is a problem on a particular line, we can re-route
spectators rapidly and effectively. As their mainline train is coming

guidance about the most effective way of walking to the venues—a

Olympics—I think all Londoners are, because we can prove how
well London can perform at such an amazing event, as well as others who
are involved across Britain—I want to press the point of the
impact on business. There are some businesses that will not benefit
from the games per se, so I want to make sure that they can still trade
as normal. For example, Fuller’s on the A4 coming into London,
says that it has struggled to find information about the changes that
will be imposed on it. Mr Sumner, you mentioned adjusting freight
patterns. That is an incredibly difficult job for some businesses
because of having to change shift patterns, contracts and so forth. A
lot of work goes into that and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow
East said, you may need to be quite flexible at short notice. What have
you been doing to make sure that businesses such as Fuller’s can
still operate as planned and trade as normal? Ms Holdroyd, how
confident are your members that they have been involved and included
and that they feel they can still trade as

been working on the issue of the movement of beer out of breweries and
into pubs, which is an important part of their activity. That group has
already been working through the issue. The actual maps for the ORN,

is well taken, and our commitment, with our colleagues in TfL and the

that the Olympic Delivery Authority has made an awful lot of effort to
engage with business in getting information across. Where we would be
slightly critical from the small business perspective is that an awful
lot of that engagement has been with the larger businesses

			Column number: 10<a class="bkMark" name="Column10">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and the larger business community. For example, the site-specific advice
for travel planning is aimed very much at larger businesses. They did
lower the threshold of how many employees they had to have, but I would
argue that if you have 500 employees you probably have a business
continuity manager, and if they don’t have travel planning
experience you can probably send them on a course. It is the much
smaller businesses that do not have the in-house knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
things that we were quite disappointed about was that, way back, we
heard that there would be a telephone helpline, so that if you had a
query when looking at the various maps that have been published you
could call, which would be a great resource for small businesses. That
was not implemented, and now there is an e-mail address, which is quite
impersonal. Even if the person answering the e-mail has the best
knowledge in the world, you do not necessarily feel that you’re
being listened to if your only method of communication is e-mail. I
would say that, while the maps have been published in good time, and
the ORN consultation is ongoing, there is a question about who the
small business with a query talks to. Yes, there has been engagement
with the business intermediary groups, but who do I talk to? That is
part of the difficulty that we have
had.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000068">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
the freight side, this is obviously a big problem for businesses of all
sizes, and I know that TfL made some suggestions in its written
evidence about how this might be managed. The ODA freight team is
surprisingly small, in terms of how big an issue freight will be during
games times. I have worked quite closely with the project manager for
freight. I think that he has done a very good job, but he is only one
person. Sometimes we feel that his mandate is very much to deal with
the bigger businesses. Just because smaller businesses are small does
not mean that they have one man and a bicycle. We have been trying to
get the message across that a small business can still have several
very large lorries that travel exclusively in, for example, the
Stratford area, and would therefore be significantly impacted by any
changes or last minute amendments to the ORN. It is as if we are 75%
there, but there is the last 25% of how the smaller business gets its
questions
answered.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000069">&#160;</a>

what Hannah said. The dialogue has moved on significantly over the past
few months. For example, my freight team is now co-locating and working
with the TfL freight team, so there is now one team driving
London’s freight, working with the industry to power it through.
It is a challenge working with small businesses; there are 200,000 of
them in London. The key mechanisms for us have been mail drops, working
through business intermediaries, trying to hold surgeries and the rest
of it. We are determined to do whatever we can to try to get to small
businesses, but it is a challenge, and I am not going to deny it. It is
not easy to get to all of the local tobacconists, newsagents and the
rest, but we are determined to do so, in particular through our
colleagues at TfL along the lines of the ORN, because that is where the
most impact will be for the people concerned during those few days of

only on particular sections of road where there are very high volumes
of traffic, and where there is enough road space to, in effect, create
a form of bus lane during the games. Those lanes will generally be in
the centre of the road—the offside, rather than the nearside,
lane—so that they do not interfere with buses and cyclists or
other such traffic. With regard to compliance, the lanes are designed
to be primarily self-compliant. The experience from previous games has
shown that it is generally an issue of national pride for people to
stay out of the lane. They enforce themselves through
visual—<em>[Laughter</em>

This is why there will be good-value ticketing of all main line trains,
direct coach networks providing good-value travel, and strategic

existing penalty regime in London: it is memorable, but not rapacious.
The whole thing is designed to send a message, not to penalise per se.

establish what level of tariff might be appropriate, but that is the

moving-traffic violations. For the enforcement of static violations we

key issue during the games is keeping the flow of traffic moving, and
therefore the biggest single measure is not within the Bill: it is in
ensuring that there are no road and streetworks. There will be a
moratorium on road and streetworks in London for about a three-month
period leading up to the games. To ensure that that works effectively,
we have good support from the utility companies, which have adjusted
their capital works programmes for 2012. That will be the biggest
single boon, and we will put the measures in the Bill over
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000077">&#160;</a>

there will be strategic park-and-ride areas. What consideration has
been given to creating those areas around parts of London? Every time
there is a major event at Wembley, half of my constituency becomes a
car park and people use the last two or three stops on the tube line to
get to Wembley Stadium. Clearly, that is inconvenient for local
residents on Saturdays, Sundays and during the week. This could
potentially be quite an extended period of time, so I wonder what
temporary park-and-ride schemes will be available. I know that these
are meant to be public transport games, but the experience of Wembley
shows that you can make it completely public transport-friendly, but
people will still use their cars from outside London and park as close
to the area as they
can.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000080">&#160;</a>

putting in good-value mainline fares for the trains, which will come on
sale next month, and putting in a direct coach network across the
nation to support the movement of spectators to the Olympic park and
suchlike, there will be people who will, because of their particular
circumstances or needs, look towards using their car. For that reason,
we have secured a number of big strategic park-and-ride sites around
the periphery of London where people will be able to park their vehicle
and then use shuttle buses to take them to the Olympic park, ExCel and
Greenwich on day 3, to ensure that they do not arrive in
London and then look towards rail

The first is that we understand the needs of residents and small
businesses immediately around all the competition venues. We understand
that something has to be put in place to manage the flow of vehicles
during games time, so that you do not get people rat running or trying
to park up—fly parking—which is what you often get around
sports venues. There will therefore be local area traffic management
plans around all the competition venues to ensure that only people who
have due business within it can access that area. This will ensure that
spectators do not try to drive close to a venue and then park up. Those
measures will be fully consulted on—mail drops, surgeries and
all the rest—working with those businesses in the local areas
such as Leyton to ensure that they can go about their day-to-day
business during games time. Part of the reason why the measures in the
Bill are important is because it means that Waltham Forest, Newham and
Hackney will be able to put in the right measures to support the games
and support their local residents and
businesses.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000084">&#160;</a>

specifically located on the ORN, or within a stone’s throw of an
Olympic venue—I know Leyton very well—consultation could
possibly have started a little earlier to make them aware that it does
impact on them. One thing we hear from our members is, “Well, I
am not in Greenwich, so it is not my problem”. We take our
responsibility as an organisation which represents them to say to them,
you need to think about this now, but we very much want to work with
the ODA, to use the tools they can provide us to do that. If
organisations like mine were made aware of things like the mail drops
and the surgeries—it is a logistic aspect, but if we were told
that they were happening in east London, say, or west London—we
could make businesses aware. I have never been told of a surgery taking
place that I could tell my members about.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000086">&#160;</a>

provides means to protect things such as the bus network, which is very
important in much of London. The ability to prioritise bus and direct

                           </strong> Yes, I have one more question. The amendments
essentially allow enormous, virtually unfettered discretion to TfL to
amend the ORN as is needed for the proper running of the games. First,
Hugh, could you say a little bit about the way in which you will
protect that freedom so that it is proportionate? Secondly, what do you
estimate is the time between you deciding that there must be a
variation to the route network and that taking effect? What notice, if
any, will drivers and travellers get? Finally, a point of fact: is
there any point in the ORN where bus lanes will be closed in order to
facilitate the extra lane for Olympic traffic? You may want to come
back to us on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000100">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In terms of ensuring that there is no
aberrant behaviour by TfL or others that might unduly impact or be
disproportionate to the sort of problems that they face, the key issue
is that they are using existing powers and existing controls around
them. For example, the temporary traffic notices and traffic orders are
very clear about the circumstances and duration for which they can
apply, so that does not allow them untrammelled powers to run in
perpetuity. You have seven days for a notice, and then it has to be an
order. You have to prepare the relevant paperwork and so on. There is a
due process associated with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
second thing I would say, in terms of how swift an action might be
necessary, within the space of an hour, let us say, it might be
necessary to change a left turn or right turn. If the security
footprint changes on a particular day, for whatever reason, the change
will have to be immediate. There will have to be appropriate signage
and the rest of it, and then we will have to update existing road
users. A lot of this is around finding that things are not as predicted
on the day, and the whole situation changes. For example, the sports
event overruns, there is an extra day of rowing, or the security
footprint changes; all of that drives
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000102">&#160;</a>

terms of the removal of bus lanes, that is generally very limited
indeed. There are a couple of minor areas by Hyde Park that will need
some tweaking, given that the triathlon is there, but in general they

roadworks are suspended, and often the minor roadworks cause just as

is supportive and will allow an immediate and urgent response if things

programme that is working through transport, security, communications

well under way. The transport co-ordination centre is now on its fifth
or sixth exercise in desk-topping. Actual events that we will be
learning from include the opening of the Westfield centre, which is a
huge shopping development that opens in Stratford this September. We
also have the sports test events, so there is a programme of readiness,
ranging from big events through to desk-topping, that London has to go
through to get itself in a fit state for the games next year. It is

fine, reduced to £100 if people paid within a certain time. You
said that most of the organisations that responded to the consultation

Secondly, although in the round, the sums are relatively small, so will
you explain to me the impact assessment and the financial information
we were given, as I still have a little difficulty? We are told that
the additional cost of transferring responsibility for dealing with
seized items from the police to the ODA, which in turn will no doubt
pass it on to trading standards officers, is £22,000. Later in
the documentation, however, we are told that by doing that there will
be a net saving to the public purse of £55,000. I assume,
therefore, that the cost of the police doing this is £77,000
more than if trading standards officers did it. Would you explain
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000112">&#160;</a>

arrangement was that the police would hold all the seized items within
their various storage arrangements and we would be charged for that,
both for officer time and storage. Under these arrangements, we are
looking to provide our own arrangements for oversized or excess items.
That is the estimate of £22,000. The majority of seized items
and the cost of storage is now transferred to local authorities and we
will pass on some on-costs to officer time to cover that. The saving is
that we do not now need a police officer attached to every enforcement
team just to deal with seized items and, additionally, will not be
charged for storage of those items. The rules are all time-limited to
the venues and events, so they do not kick in for the Olympic park, for

with the IOC as part of the whole deal or is there a reasonable amount
of freedom about that? What is the definition? Can you give us more

Nugent:</strong>
                           </em> My understanding is that the definition of an
infringing article was part of the debate on the Act originally passed.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport policy officers would have
agreed that at the time. I think it is broad enough to allow
enforcement officers to do their jobs—not only to seize goods
that may be being sold, but items displayed or a stall being used to
display those items—in order for us to prevent the commission of
the offence. Obviously, those items remain the property of the person
they have been taken from, so they will be returned in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Can you say how this will operate? The venues in
London will be quite diverse and spaced around London, but it is not
just limited to London and there are venues outside. As I understand
it, there will be strict enforcement within the immediate facility of
the venues. However, Londoners all over London will, for example, be
entering tube stations, and potentially people selling articles. The
former individuals will then turn up at Olympic venues to be told,
“Sorry, that is illegal and I am going to take it off
you.” Possibly that will include even the shirt off their back.
How will that be operated?<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000127">&#160;</a>

some of the transport areas where things may be given away or sold. We
may anyway not necessarily have a right to seize people’s
carried items and their belongings—for example, their T-shirt.
There is an exemption for people wearing their own clothing. The issue
is if they are part of an ambush campaign—people will be aware
that they are part of such a campaign if they have been paid to wear
particular shirts or T-shirts. Only then does it become an offence, and
that is the only time that we can take action. We do not have 
the right to seize items off individuals. The issue is the selling of
those items, which has to take place within  the zone for the
Olympics.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000128">&#160;</a>

met with some small businesses, particularly in Newham. Westminster
council has also approached us to start getting the message out
regarding what the regulations cover and what could be affected.
Generally, the response has been reasonably positive because quite a
lot is exempt from what we are trying to do. Businesses are responding
positively to the fact that we will be tackling illegal traders who
come into their

5% sit outside our remit, so we are not in a position to regulate them,

concern is marketing and advertising. We support all the
recommendations, and trading standards are well-equipped to deal with
those powers and the provisions under the regulations. We have been in
consultation with the ODA and discussed what would be required of our
profession during the Olympics, and we feel that we can provide and
carry out those particular functions. With respect to the suggested
changes regarding the delivery of seized goods to the police, we are
fully supportive of that recommendation as
well.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000151">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In terms of the key amendments put forward by
the ODA, we are very supportive of that. It makes sense that the
seizure and storage is under the control of the enforcing authority
within a venue. If it turns out to be the trading standards officers
who are the enforcement agents of the ODA, again that makes more sense,
so we are very supportive of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000152">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
terms of the wider issues and of some of the questions posed earlier,
there are a number of issues and concerns from trading standards about
more general enforcement outside the 200-metre zone. I have got a
slight, technical point about the procedures for retention within the
zone. The requirements of the Bill are for seized articles to be
returned under various circumstances. It is unclear, if the articles
seized in the area are counterfeit, whether they can be returned to the
people they are seized from—they would be illegal articles but
potentially seized under another
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
cover that, it would make sense if trading standards officers were the
enforcement authority, because they would carry dual enforcement roles
with them in the zone—the zone would be within their powers
anyway, if that is clear. Rather than just having the powers under this
bit of legislation, trading standards officers would carry powers under
the Trade Marks Act 1994 and the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988, so they could seize goods under other legislation, as well as the
new trading
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000154">&#160;</a>

comfortable with the definition, or lack of definition, of such
articles. Do you think the term is self-explanatory, and that the Bill
can easily implement
it?<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000155">&#160;</a>

                           </em> In relation to the Bill and the 2006 Act,
which are purely talking about the zones within which the Olympic
events are taking place, that makes sense. “Infringing
articles” is wide but it protects the sponsors of the games and
protects against ambush advertising. The point I am making is that you
can get ambush advertising by using counterfeit goods, just as you
could with genuine goods, so there are two
things.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000156">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Outside
the zone, the definition of “infringing articles” does
not apply. However, there will be all sorts of infringing articles
outside the zone, but it is the local authority’s responsibility
to ensure a safe trading environment for the games and for local
businesses to be able to profit from the games and to trade fairly
around them. Part of that responsibility is to prevent illegal
trading—a key concern for local authorities—and the
funding is a key concern that is not covered at all by this legislation
before you.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000157">&#160;</a>

In so far as the definition of “infringing articles” is
concerned in the event zone itself, I think that covers it. People
envisaged all the situations that could possibly arise, and therefore
the definition is sufficient for us, if we were given the powers and
asked to enforce the legislation, to seize and detain quite a few of
the offending
articles.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000158">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The intellectual property of the Olympics is
subject to tight protection because it is so valuable. In making the
argument for the games, the protection of intellectual property and the
ORN are both points where the insistence and the obligation that come
with hosting the games may rub up against public support. We have been,
on a cross-party basis, tough in saying, “You want to host an
Olympics? This is what you have to do.” That said, we are all
concerned to ensure that, where these breaches of the Olympic marque
occur and require you or your officers to move in and seize goods, that
is done in a fair and proportionate way. That is similar to the
discussion that we were having earlier about the application of the
ORN. We, as I am sure you do, have a clear idea of where the good will
towards the Olympics erupts into a bit of negative public
feeling.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000159">&#160;</a>

us through a couple of scenarios where you would apply these powers?
What, for you, would be the gold standard of good practice to achieve
the objective of protecting the Olympic marque or Olympic sponsors
while, at the same time, not treating the vast majority who were
responsible for that kind of breach as if they were carbon-copy

light-touch approach to enforcement. We do not want to be seen as being
heavy-handed in the approach that we take, because that could lead to
bad publicity and the public would be against that type of enforcement.
We are well versed in taking a light-touch approach to all sorts of
different things in our day-to-day job. Where a heavy-handed approach,
if that is the right terminology, may be taken is where somebody has
deliberately set out in an organised manner to breach the provisions of
these regulations. In that case, it falls on us as designated officers
to take whatever appropriate action is necessary. That is the approach
that a trading standards professional has always taken and will
continue to take in whatever regulations we
enforce.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000161">&#160;</a>

Pratt:</strong>
                           </em> I would add that the approach is always based
on informational intelligence. Before you can take any action, you have
to get some intelligence around it. That would be on-the-day
intelligence, when the officers are operating at the venue. That
intelligence will vary, whether within the zone or without the zone. I
will speak about that in a minute.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000162">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once you have
that intelligence, you decide what the appropriate tactical approach is
to deal with the issue. That should result in proportionate
enforcement. Trading standards are well versed in dealing with large
events, be they football matches at Wembley or, as in Hertfordshire,
big pop festival events at Knebworth house, which we deal with. It is
an intelligence approach, where you tactically decide how you will deal
with that intelligence, with least disruption to the public and maximum
fairness to the traders. There are different approaches within 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 23<a class="bkMark" name="Column23">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and without the zone. Within the zone, we are not specifically talking
about the Olympic marque and the Olympic brand; it is more about the
ambush advertising. That would more involve covert
officers within the venue. We do not know how many officers are needed
or how many there will be, or what the moneys will be. We have not yet
had those detailed discussions with the ODA, but more covert officers
will be looking for issues that are about to occur or people acting
suspiciously, and then working out how to best deal with them. That
will be dealt with at the time by the use of security officials or
police within the venue and just a quiet chat gently saying,
“This isn’t going to happen. The best thing is for it not
to happen. Keep that in your bag or we will take it out. Go and enjoy
the
games.”<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000163">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Outside
the venue, the Olympic marque itself will come much more into being
because it is much more likely that there will be people looking to
make profit on the back of it, to the detriment of genuine traders.
Hertfordshire is quite a busy shopping area. People will be selling
genuine, sponsored Olympic articles and they would want as much
protection—and quite rightly they should receive it—from
people setting up stalls or just hiding in bushes trying to sell other
goods. Again, that is about intelligence. It is about having officers
on the ground trying to find out what will be happening and dealing
with it in the most appropriate
way.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Enforcement
will be difficult logistically and numbers are an issue, as is funding.
Funding that enforcement within 200 metres of the venues will be the
responsibility of the ODA, although we do not know the detail of that
yet. Outside of that, no funding outside London is currently made
available to local authorities, so if funding were not forthcoming from
LOCOG, local authorities will have to decide with the resources that
are put to them—which again will be for local politicians to
decide—and balance the needs of the traders and the need for a
safe and enjoyable event for members of the public, which is what local
authorities want, against the cost of resources to do
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000165">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that I have answered the questions. First, it is intelligence on
the ground working out the best tactical approach and then the most
proportionate actions. I want to give the Committee a prime example of
the concerts that take place at Knebworth, where there are probably
200,000 or 300,000 people over a three-day event. A number of teams of
officers work throughout the weekend. Most of the seizures take place
in, say, pub car parks or cars around the venue out of sight of the
crowds. We identify where the issues are; we have appropriate resource,
whether police officers or security people, and we then prevent the
items from occurring. The last thing we want is confrontation and
potential seizures among the public. Generally, trading standards are
very well experienced in that and have a very proportionate approach to
such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000166">&#160;</a>

no detailed discussions between the ODA and local authorities—if
the Bill is enacted and seizure and storage become the responsibility
of the ODA, then if it passes the power on to local authorities, that
would be paid for by means of an on-cost on to a standard officer rate.
Currently, there have been no detailed discussions, so I cannot comment
whether that would be sufficient or whether all of the £22,000
will be transferred. But I do understand what it will not be: for
instance, if in Hertfordshire we seized an articulated lorry and had to
store that with its goods, we would not charge that back to the ODA.
The cost is met by the on-cost of x number of officers for whom we are
being paid y amount per hour. We are expected to meet such costs within
that amount. In terms of £22,000, it is difficult to say whether
that would meet the cost, because it entirely depends on the issues

                           </em> No. In our discussions with the ODA, we have
not discussed the financial aspects of the work that trading standards
would be doing during the Olympics. Those discussions have yet to take
place, so I could not really help the Committee with how the figure has
been arrived at. It is something that trading standards has not been
involved in. However, it is envisaged that in the very near future,
discussions will begin to take place about the funding aspect of
trading standards’ involvement with these regulations. In the
funding, we would want to include the costs not only of officer time
but, definitely, the storage of seized articles and, obviously, any
litigation that might take place subsequently—in effect,
underwriting the work we would be doing. Coming back to your question
about funding, no, those discussions have not taken place, so I cannot
explain.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In
the first part of your question, you were talking about outside the
venues and whether we had done any work to establish what level of
activity might take place. In my own area of Brent, where we have
Wembley stadium, we always find that whenever the FA cup, the champions
league final or whatever takes place, there is a good build-up of
activity, with itinerant traders selling all sorts of articles, whether
counterfeit or unsafe goods—unsafe products as well—and
it requires a lot of resources for trading standards to get involved
and to stop such activities from taking place.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000174">&#160;</a>

envisage the same thing will happen with the Olympics. There will be a
huge build-up of activity, not necessarily within the venues but, I
expect, outside—at railway stations and on the periphery of the
venues, where itinerant traders will try to sell their goods and make
money. That is where, in the main, trading standards activities will be
taking place, although also in the venues and the zone. The lesson that
we learned from Manchester—we had extensive discussions with our
colleagues there following the Commonwealth games—is that these
were the sort of issues that arose. Within the zone or where the events
were taking place, there were not too many issues, but outside that
were huge problems which they had to
resolve.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000175">&#160;</a>

is not impossible, having said that—it does not take very long
physically to build a structure. However, under the same contract
whereby our members put forward all their advertising assets to the
disposal of London 2012 and for selection by sponsors, anything new
that gets built in the interim has to go through that same process. It
has to be made available to sponsors, which does not entirely answer
your question about the sheer volume, but certainly there is
control.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000177">&#160;</a>

you like, less of an incentive for people to build structures because

protected from price gouging. Prices have to be based on last
summer’s rates paid with a certain indexing that is provided by
the Advertising Association. So you could not simply build the site and
then, because it was a great site, charge £1 million to
somebody. It would still have to be the fixed market rates that
everybody else would be paying for equivalent
sites.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000178">&#160;</a>

have at their disposal would be divided into vicinity sites, which are
within the immediate surroundings of the venues themselves, and then
other sites that are within the London TV area or Greater London, let
us say. There is a slight difference in terms of how those can be used
because the proximity sites, the vicinity sites, have to be made
available to sponsors and if sponsors do not take them, we very much
hope that the look and feel messaging from London 2012 will fill any
shortfall, because otherwise there is a risk that our members lose
money on the process. So in terms of build that would not make a

in terms of protection of Olympic marques, rings
and mascots, the content of any advertising that is displayed in
posters there also has a strict regime of approvals and checking. So
the sponsors themselves have to submit their creative work for
inspection, but it would also be extremely risky for any non-sponsor to
take liberties with those assets because, realistically, by the time
they get posted, they can get covered over within a day, so it would be
a rather stupid exercise. Our industry is still mostly paper and
paste—there is obviously digital signage as well—and it
has to go to the printers. So there is ample time to review all the
advertising copy, and for the media owners—our members—to
look carefully at anything that seems a little bit suspect in terms of
the use of those
properties.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000182">&#160;</a>

businesses we deal with—the itinerant traders—and
therefore, we require the assistance of the police to avoid a possible
breach of the peace. We also conduct some serious investigations when

if there was likely to be large-scale ambush advertising at any venue
against the regulations, the police would invariably be involved. If
100 or so people are about to put on T-shirts, or whatever, there are
potential public order issues if an ODA enforcement officer or a
trading standards officer tries to prevent this, not in uniform, not in
anything else. If the intelligence said that a number of people were
going to be doing this, the tactical approach would be to have
uniformed police officers and/or security people—I do not know
how that is going to work at the venues—and deal with that in
one go, calmly and effectively, so that the event can take place. The
practicalities are that the police will not deal with the seized items
once they have been seized, but at the point of seizure, big ambush
advertising practicalities will not
alter.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000185">&#160;</a>

heads of trading standards who effectively manage the services and
resources across the country. One thing these organisations are doing
at the moment is trying to co-ordinate intelligence on a strategic
level, linking in with police intelligence on a strategic level,
because, invariably, the people who will cause issues around venues are
known people who would cause the same problems around Wembley or
Knebworth. The approach is to work with the police and with
intelligence across the country within our networks to identify where
the issues are and prevent them at source. That is at the strategic
level—work is under way to do that because trading standards
works on intelligence at the moment. Tactically, it will be about
putting that intelligence into practice. That is where it will come
down to individual local authorities to have the resources to do that.
Strategically, we hope to be at the place where we can identify
potential issues and where they might be. That might be warehouses
producing some of the counterfeit goods or goods with fake Olympic
marques. It would be down to the tactical response of the local
authority in that area to address that. Those resources would be at the
whim of the local
authority.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000188">&#160;</a>

stadium many of the routes into the stadium on foot are in private

enforcement to take place on those particular areas. Across London, at
a lot of the Olympic venues, there are public highways. I understand
that there are different restrictions that would apply to the public
highway as opposed to private land. Are you content that the proposals

of enforcement officers is to get to the heart of the problem and take
action against those who organise these things—the controlling
minds of the operation—and not those who perhaps fall into the
trap. If somebody perpetrates a scheme, and they stand outside the
venue and hand out particular T-shirts, which would constitute ambush
marketing if a group of people were to wear them, clearly it would be
wrong for us to try to prosecute the individuals wearing the T-shirts.
The intention would be for enforcement officers to establish who was
behind the particular scheme and prosecute those individuals. So yes, I
agree that there is a possibility that innocent members of the public
could be induced into perpetrating this type of offence or breaching
the regulations, but we would not necessarily prosecute those people,
no.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000195">&#160;</a>

those T-shirts. If that is cured, and there ends up being one or two

standards officers is, in some ways, knowing the legislation to ignore.
You could probably go into any premises and find breaches of
regulations. That does not happen at all. If we look at the
prosecutions nationally for trading standards, the people prosecuted
are those who are deliberately breaking the law, who often get
custodial sentences. The days of prosecuting for small regulatory
offences are over, and it is very much about proportional enforcement.

be allowed to enter the Olympic site and the event regardless of what
they are wearing.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000218">&#160;</a>

detail has not been worked up—I would expect the ODA to provide
detail around ambush advertising, and that would be about numbers. I do
not know if 30 T-shirts, or two, or three, would be broad
enough to be ambush advertising. Some of that detail needs to be worked
out. I can reassure you that schoolchildren coming into any of the
venues are there to watch and enjoy the games, and that is absolutely
what they will be doing. Coming back to my colleague, we are looking
for perpetrators of deliberate actions designed to undermine the
legislation of the country. That is what trading standards officers do
on a daily basis. A group of schoolchildren are not perpetrators
designed to undermine the will of Parliament and laws of the country.
That is the approach that we would
take.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000219">&#160;</a>

we might be guilty of ambush advertising. Mr Pratt mentioned the
potential to bring in additional staff. I have no concerns about
professional trading standards officers, but this event will be vast. I
have attended many sports venues in my time, and all you need is one
person, whom we would normally describe as a jobsworth, to cause a
problem, which can blow into something it was never intended to be. Can
you convince and reassure us that if additional staff are brought in,
they too will get the appropriate training and be aware of the
potential for a flashpoint to be created over something very
small?<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000221">&#160;</a>

look to train staff in that and in the memorandum of understanding.
From the point of view of the Trading Standards Institute and the
Association of Chief Trading Standards Officers, we would look to be
involved in that. We would look to employ or move staff who were well
versed in dealing with those sorts of situation. In Hertfordshire, in
relation to our response to the Knebworth festivals, this year we had
no public order offences and very few seizures. We had no seizures in
the venue itself; all the seizures were outside. Various
authorities—including my own authority and my colleague’s
in Brent—have experience of officers working in such
environments and providing proportional enforcement. It is not about
taking a trading standards officer off the street, who is used to
carrying out only inspections of businesses and putting them into a
different situation without any training. I can reassure you that that
would not be the case.<a class="bkMark" name="1105182000222">&#160;</a>
