<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000380"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I remind the Committee that with this we are
taking clause 43 stand
part.</div><a name="081111106000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000381"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I welcome you back, Mr. Hood. It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. Before we adjourned earlier
today, my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough raised an issue
that I endorse. He said that it would be helpful, when discussing the
issue of partial transfers, if the Government would give the Committee
the benefit of their experience of the partial transfers that have
already occurred under the existing regime of the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act 2008&#151;that is, in respect of Bradford &amp;
Bingley, Kaupthing and Heritable.</div>
<a name="081111106000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue addressed in the Treasury consultation paper on safeguards for
partial property transfers published last week relates to security
interests, which are the interests the lender has in the property
collateral of the party to whom they have lent on a secured basis. This
has been an area of concern, in that the provisions could result in
disruption and make it difficult for the security holder to enforce
security, which would set London banks at a competitive
disadvantage.</div><a name="081111106000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
special resolution regime consultation proposed the transfer of all
liabilities to the new company with the related collateral or not at
all. Concerns have been raised that the proposal may limit flexibility
from the Government&#146;s perspective because of floating charges.
The Government have clearly considered how floating charges should be
addressed and, as I understand the position, they have decided not to
go for maximum flexibility but to provide some certainty and security.
We welcome that, but I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm
the approach set out in the consultation paper and elaborate for the
Committee&#146;s better understanding the Government&#146;s
thinking in that area.</div>
<a name="081111106000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that the safeguard will restate the legal requirement to respect the
integrity of security interests covered by the financial collateral
directive. Will the Minister give the Committee some guidance as to
whether it should be the financial collateral directive or the
regulations made under it for the purposes of UK law&#151;the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column422" />Column number: 422</div>Regulations 2003? I believe that they are wider than the directive. It
would be helpful to know whether any consideration was given to using
the regulations rather than the directive as the basis for these
provisions. Were any considerations given to the use of secondary
legislation referring to regulations rather than the directive? The
draft statutory instrument refers to the directive rather than the
regulations.</div><a name="081111106000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue has come up with regard to structured finance. Again, the
Government are keen to ensure that there is no disruption to structured
finance arrangements and we welcome that. There is nothing on that
point in the draft order, which seems to be at an early stage, so it is
difficult for the Committee to discuss the provisions at great length
or in detail, although we welcome the principles guiding the
Government&#146;s action.</div>
<a name="081111106000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I stated
this morning, it is vital that the safeguards in place as a consequence
of clauses 42 and 43 are effective, to protect the competitive position
of London banks. However, I should like to highlight one area where we
are not in a position to assess the status of the proposed legislation
and proposed secondary legislation&#151;enforcement. What happens if
things go wrong? If a transfer falls within a class prohibited by the
order&#151;currently the draft restriction of partial transfers
order&#151;what will happen? We have to look at regulation 6(5) of
the draft order, which at the moment merely states in square
brackets:</div><a name="081111106000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
steps are to remedy the breach identified in the
notice.&#148;</div><a name="081111106000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the Minister can provide some clarification about exactly what steps
will be taken to remedy any breach, because that is important and it is
necessary to ensure that partial transfer takes effect to produce a
result that is not incompatible with the relevant safe harbours, which
we spent some time discussing this morning. If something is in a safe
harbour, it is important that it is properly protected and that the
harbour is
safe.</div><a name="081111106000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is another example of our being somewhat short of details. The document
published last Thursday is helpful; there is some indication of
movement in the right direction in the view of industry bodies that
have been concerned about the proposals, particularly the idea of
moving away&#151;in the context of netting the set off&#151;from
master netting agreements to incorporate bespoke agreements, which
seems to have a lot to be said for it. However, there are still a large
number of areas where the drafting is at an early stage or
non-existent, which makes it difficult for the Committee to debate the
provisions as effectively as we should do.</div>
<a name="081111106000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The matter
is at the heart of the concerns raised by outside bodies about the
competitiveness of the UK banks, yet we are having to consider it
without knowing where we shall end up, because the key parts are not
clauses 42 and 43&#151;no amendments of any substance have been
tabled or proposed for those clauses&#151;but relate to secondary
legislation that is at draft stage. Although things have moved
considerably since the first meeting of the expert liaison group on 31
October, the document, from which I have quoted at some length today,
was published only last Thursday so industry groups may not have had an
opportunity to digest all its finer detail and to convey their thoughts
to Committee
members.</div><a name="081111106000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
return to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport at the
beginning of the stand part debate: whether the Government should
consider the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column423" />Column number: 423</div>proposal made by the London Investment Banking Association, among
others, that the provisions relating to partial transfers be
implemented at a later date to ensure that we get them right and that
we do not fall into some of the difficulties that the Government
themselves recognise. I raise the matter not in an attempt to push the
Government into a corner&#151;far from it&#151;but to urge the
Minister at least not to rule out that possibility, because although we
are debating something important today, it is not clear what we shall
end up
with.</div><a name="081111106000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want overly to anticipate our debate on clause 65. However,
outside bodies are looking for assurances about greater certainty in
this area, and clause 65, which enables the Government to change the
statute by statutory instrument, undermines that certainty. That has to
be taken into account when we consider the package as a
whole.</div>
<a name="081111106000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are moving in the right direction, although concerns remain
about the provisions we have, and even greater concerns about those we
do not have. I therefore urge the Minister to do all that he can to
address them, or at least to be prepared to take this aspect of the
Bill in a steadier way, without jeopardising the implementation of the
Bill as a whole, so that we get this area of legislation
right.</div><a name="081111106000051"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081111106000382"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): We have reached what is
perhaps the most controversial part of the Bill. Against the backdrop
of the current economic crisis, we may have a tendency to rush through
the clauses on partial transfer. We are moving against all the rules of
the market; the essence of the Bill is not to let the rules of the
market apply but to intervene to stabilise the financial
situation.</div>
<a name="081111106000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many people
can understand taking a whole bank and nationalising it. They can
understand a whole bank being part of a fire sale to the private
sector. We have seen that happen in the past and we understand the
implications. A fire sale would mean that the shareholders would lose a
lot of money, but the creditors would still be ranking in the business.
Nationalisation would result in a huge loss to the shareholders but the
liabilities would go across with the bank. Creditors who are not
depositors will lose out significantly with partial
transfer.</div><a name="081111106000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am still struggling to understand how the Bradford &amp; Bingley
situation was managed. It would help if we had&#151;even if only for
my benefit&#151;an idiot&#146;s guide to the process that the
Government went through. They did it in exceptional circumstances and
seem to have pulled off something that is generally welcomed, but I am
not sure what the outcome will be. In effect, we have two banks: the
good bank and the bad bank. The good bank went off to Abbey Santander
and the bad bank is left, but I do not know what it is worth.</div>
<a name="081111106000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
clauses that we have already debated the Government are allowed to send
bad bits back to the rump bank. I do not know whether it is intended
that in most cases the rump bank or the bad bank will then go into
administration. I am not clear about whether the money from a partial
sale to the private sector goes to the original shareholders or whether
it is used to pay off creditors in a ranking order. I am not sure about
any of these things. Because the detail is left to regulations, we are
struggling.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column424" />Column number: 424</div><a name="081111106000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
probably the most important part of the whole Bill. We could proceed
with the Bill and leave these clauses until a later stage when we have
much more detail. The Conservatives want to get the Bill right. It is a
measure that we hope no one ever has to use. We are dealing with
concepts that are so strange and unusual that more time on these
provisions would be most useful. We have already had to deal with
default clauses, yet all the things that would normally happen under
them are not in the Bill. It would help if the Minister could tell the
Committee where we are with the only concrete partial sale that has
occurred&#151;albeit some time ago, in relative terms&#151;Bradford
&amp;
Bingley.</div><a name="081111106000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="081111106000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not arguing for the commercial details but for the general
principles&#151;the way in which the sale happened, how it occurred,
who will get what from where and the likely outcome. A concrete example
for dealing with partial sales would help the Committee enormously. I
take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire: it would be hugely damaging if we got things wrong and
there was a feeling in the global marketplace that it was best not to
do business in Britain because if something went wrong the business
would lose much more than if it were based elsewhere. We hope that the
provisions are never enforced&#151;of course, if we have a new
Government they never will be enforced because everything will be milk
and honey from then on&#151;but I accept that we must look seriously
at the possibility of that happening somewhere down the line, in 20 or
30 years. We do not want to lose 20 or 30 years of business because we
got one part of the Bill
wrong.</div><a name="081111106000057"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081111106000383"></a><b class="B">Sir
Peter Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): I recognise the need for
the Bank and other bodies working with the Treasury to have exceptional
powers to deal with exceptional difficulties. We have a set of
circumstances that require the Government to take unusual measures, but
it worries me that the rules that we are considering will wipe out all
the rules of private enterprise and virtually give the Government an
opportunity to start with a clean white sheet of paper on which to
write their own plot. Which of the provisions do the Government intend
to be temporary and which permanent? Perhaps the Minister will find
that question difficult, because he will know, as I do, that the world
we go back to in 2012 or 2015, when the current difficulties are over,
will not be the world of 2004 and 2006. We will not immediately go back
to freedom of credit. If the Minister could essay an answer, I should
be grateful for his
comments.</div><a name="081111106000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000384"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> We
intend the Bill to put in place a permanent special resolution regime.
We have been clear that there are things that are right and appropriate
to put into primary legislation and that other matters rightly should
be the province of secondary legislation, which is still permanent but
where there is greater ability to make changes urgently. Other things
are in the code and will be reviewed from time to time. The debate
throughout the Committee stage has been about what is most
appropriately put in which box&#151;primary legislation, secondary
legislation or a code. I hope that helps the hon.
Gentleman.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column425" />Column number: 425</div><a name="081111106000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000385"></a>Sir
Peter Viggers:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. We have had
an exchange a bit like this before, when&#151;perhaps as a tribute to
my incredibly advanced years&#151;I was harking back to the days when
the Bank of England was able to carry out its negotiations and
discussions behind closed doors. The Minister pointed out that we have
to move on, that we have to recognise that we are in the 21st century
and that such outdated practices are no longer possible. I regret that
the old idea of the Bank working quietly and privately is no longer
possible, because the proposed structure is undoubtedly mechanistic and
gives the Government powers that they have never had
before.</div><a name="081111106000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
express caution on behalf of the banking profession&#151;including
the British Bankers Association and others&#151;which is concerned
that we should not put permanent legislation in place until a great
deal of thought has been given to the overall structure. We are where
we are, and we have some way to go yet in the Bill, but I put these
comments down as a marker to Government and support my hon. Friend the
Member for South-West Hertfordshire in expressing concern about the
comprehensive nature of the powers that can be given to
Government.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000386"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I fully appreciate stakeholders&#146; concerns
about the Bill&#146;s partial transfer provisions. We have talked to
stakeholders about them on many occasions and, as the Committee will be
aware, we have held three rounds of formal public consultation, an
extensive series of stakeholder workshops and meetings between February
and September 2008, and have published draft clauses from the most
complex part of the Bill&#151;the special resolution regime. The most
recent round of consultation was about the safeguards on partial
property transfers. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised
many issues that appear in the consultation document. Those who take an
interest in our proceedings will have noted what he said, and we will
consider fully all the representations that he has made as we seek to
refine the special resolution regime
safeguards.</div><a name="081111106000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will be aware by now that clauses 42, 43 and 55 and the
secondary legislation contain a number of legislative safeguards to
protect bank creditors and counterparties in a partial transfer. The
Government recognise particularly the importance that market
participants attach to netting arrangements and security interests. For
example, legal certainty with respect to a netting agreement is vital
for risk management. Therefore, in responding to stakeholder concerns,
we are consulting on the details of three key
safeguards.</div><a name="081111106000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
clause 43 contains a safeguard to protect the set-off and netting
arrangements on which so many bank counterparties rely. Secondly, it
provides for a safeguard to protect security interests so that
creditors with a fixed or floating charge retain recourse to their
collateral. Thirdly, clause 55 contains a safeguard that will provide
compensation for creditors left in the residual bank, to ensure that
they are made no worse off than if the whole bank had been wound up: in
other words, had the authorities not intervened.</div>
<a name="081111106000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safeguards are important and should give market reassurance so that the
potential problems alluded to by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire and others will not arise in practice. In addition, the
code of practice will set out the types of circumstance in which 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column426" />Column number: 426</div>the authorities would wish to consider a partial transfer. Building on
the work done so far, the Government will continue to work with
stakeholders to develop the safeguards and the other secondary
legislation.</div><a name="081111106000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
welcome the comments made by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire recognising that the Government have been listening and
continue to engage in dialogue. As he is aware, we have established a
new expert liaison group, which will help prepare the secondary
legislation on the special resolution regime. On other occasions, I
have referred to the process as one of co-production. We want to get it
right. The expert liaison group has already provided valuable input on
the detailed nature of the safeguards, and the consultation document
reflects some of its initial views, but there are a lot more
opportunities for the expert liaison group and stakeholders more widely
to contribute.</div>
<a name="081111106000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000387"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. It is encouraging
that there are a lot more opportunities for the expert liaison group to
make contributions. His comments have highlighted the fact that we are
at quite an early stage of the process of developing the various
safeguards. I know that he said that the Treasury will hear the
representations made during the debate, but these proceedings should
not be just part of a consultation process. We are the law-makers, yet
it seems to me that the law is being made after Parliament has had the
opportunity to scrutinise and debate these matters. The consultation
seems to be lagging behind Parliament, because we should now be
debating something pretty near its final
form.</div><a name="081111106000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000388"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I shall say more on the timing in a few moments.
However, it is not necessarily abnormal for the Government to seek to
pass primary legislation and then to implement secondary legislation
later. We are going through the normal procedures of both Houses. On
Second Reading, several Opposition Members expressed concern about the
time it had taken the legislation to reach that stage. We have very
good co-operation with stakeholders, and we want to continue to work
with them to ensure that we get the legislation
right.</div><a name="081111106000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
42 provides the Treasury with a power to place restrictions on partial
transfers. Although the Government are not proposing to place broad
legislative restrictions on partial transfers, it is still beneficial
to include the clause, as I shall explain. The clause provides the
authorities with the means to place restrictions on the nature of the
partial transfers that they may effect through use of the property
transfer powers provided by this part of the Bill. The making of
restrictions has the potential to provide bank stakeholders with
greater certainty about how the property transfer powers will be used
to effect partial transfers. That could be through a particular strict
condition, or through a more general restriction on when and how
partial transfers would be executed. Given the nature of the powers,
stakeholder interest and the technical complexity of the issue, the
Government consider it appropriate to take a power in the Bill to
provide for restrictions to be made as the authorities deem
appropriate. For example, if further consultation with stakeholders
reveals a particular facet of partial transfers that the authorities
may wish to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column427" />Column number: 427</div>restrict in order to provide greater certainty to the market, the clause
provides the mechanism through which that can be
achieved.</div><a name="081111106000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have already noted, the range of ways in which the authorities may
restrict partial transfers is purposely broad. The flexibility reflects
the complex range of issues likely to be generated in different bank
resolutions. The Government consider it appropriate and desirable for
safeguards of this nature to be provided in secondary legislation,
rather than in the Bill. Any order made under such a power would need
to make provision at a level of detail inappropriate to primary
legislation. That reflects the complexity of bank resolutions and of
the property, rights and liabilities of banks. It will be important to
retain flexibility, including the flexibility to amend or add to the
nature of the restrictions placed on partial transfers.</div>
<a name="081111106000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that the SRR is a new legislative regime. Experience may show
that partial transfers should be more or less restricted than initially
thought, to respond to continuing market reaction to the powers, or to
the authorities developing practical expertise in resolving banks in
difficulty. At the very least, the nature of the restrictions will need
to be updated in line with innovation in the financial markets.
However, in view of the significance of the issues addressed by the
power, and in view of the standing nature of the provision to be made,
the power is subject to the draft affirmative procedure. In addition,
the Government are committed to consulting fully on the key elements of
the secondary legislation for the
safeguard.</div><a name="081111106000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
that end, the Government are consulting on what secondary legislation
should be made under clause 42. At this stage, we propose that the
power should be used to place restrictions on reverse property
transfers. The restrictions are designed to provide certainty to
creditors transferred to a bridge bank that they will not be moved back
to the residual bank. However, this is not a closed book. Further
consultation with stakeholders may determine that further restrictions
are appropriate. What is important, however, is that the authorities
have the means to put the restrictions in place in an appropriate way,
preserving market confidence in the use of the property transfer
powers. The clause provides those
means.</div>
<a name="081111106000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="081111106000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
43 provides a key partial transfer safeguard. It provides the Treasury
with the power to protect security interests and set-off and netting
arrangements. The purpose is to provide protection for private law
interests. Secondary legislation made under this power will describe in
detail the nature of the interests to be protected and the way in which
they are to be protected. The recently published consultation document
provides detail on the Government&#146;s
proposals.</div><a name="081111106000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may help if I describe the nature of the interests that the safeguard
is designed to protect. In broad terms, a security interest is a
specific protection, taken by obtaining a property interest in the
debtor&#146;s property, against which recourse can be had in defined
circumstances&#151;for example, in cases of non-payment. At its most
basic, netting is the process whereby multiple contracts are set off
against one another. However, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column428" />Column number: 428</div>netting also involves more complicated arrangements, utilising the basic
concept of set-off to manage transactional risk.</div>
<a name="081111106000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
close-out netting may allow all the contractual obligations of a party
to be terminated on a trigger event and reduced to a single sum, either
owed or owing to the counterparty in question. Such cover is often
provided under industry standard master agreements, prepared by bodies
such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. However,
counterparties also use a range of bespoke arrangements. Those
arrangements are crucial to the functioning of the financial markets,
and are an integral part of the way in which counterparties do business
with banks. It is therefore important that we get the safeguards right,
and that we strike the right balance between the protection that the
market needs and the flexibility that it is desirable to retain in
order to effect appropriate partial
transfers.</div><a name="081111106000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
power in clause 43 provides a broad definition of the interests to be
protected, which reflects the extremely broad range of interests that
exist in that field. The interests that the power needs to address
include, for example, security interests granted under foreign legal
systems and complicated types of set-off and netting arrangements used
in particular types of specialist markets. Protection may be given to
such interests in the ways set out in subsections (2) and (3). Again,
flexibility is needed to reflect the complexity of the underlying
arrangements, and the ways in which protection might be provided. The
draft order proposed to be made under the clause is, as I have
indicated, the subject of
consultation.</div><a name="081111106000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
protection to be afforded will, in broad terms, ensure that the
integrity of the interest is respected, to the extent provided for in
the order. For example, when a series of contracts are subject to a
netting arrangement protected by the order, the requirement could be to
transfer all such contracts or to leave all such contracts behind, as
to transfer some but not all would interfere with the operation of the
netting
arrangement.</div><a name="081111106000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
line with clause 42, the Government propose that the detail of the
safeguard should be set out in secondary legislation. That is for two
main reasons. First, implementation of the policy will require detailed
consideration of complex and varied interests in a variety of market
contexts, the detail of which is appropriately addressed in secondary
legislation.</div>
<a name="081111106000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
is desirable to retain flexibility in order to adjust and refine the
safeguard in the light of experience. That is particularly important in
this context, because security interests and set-off and netting
arrangements have proved to be highly innovative. The latter, in
particular, have developed and evolved significantly over a
comparatively short period of time. Changes to the safeguard may be
necessary to ensure that it continues to protect what it is intended to
protect, but also to ensure that innovations do not undermine the
policy aims that the special resolution regime is intended to
serve.</div><a name="081111106000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Draft
orders were published in the 6 November consultation document,
following discussions with the expert liaison group. The precise nature
of the safeguards is subject to consultation. However, at this stage
the Government propose a set of broad protections. The Government
propose to protect all contracts covered under set-off or netting
agreements from potential 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column429" />Column number: 429</div>disruption caused by a partial transfer&#151;apart from a set of
clearly defined exceptions. The protection extends to bespoke
agreements, in addition to those made under industry-recognised master
netting agreements. The Government consider that the safeguard provides
the market with a strong and clearly defined protection, while leaving
the authorities with sufficient flexibility to carry out appropriate
partial transfers.</div>
<a name="081111106000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081111106000389"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab): The balance between
the discretion required to exercise the power and the certainty
required by someone trading with a bank when trying to reach a
long-term commitment is a delicate one.</div>
<a name="081111106000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have been
slightly puzzled by the application in this legislation of the word
&#147;may&#148; to the protections to which the Minister has
referred. It implies a discretion that allows the Government not to
exercise the powers granted to it to protect the various interests to
which he refers. Will he clarify the use of that term, because it
puzzles me that there does not seem to be an obligation involved to
protect the interests he has
stated?</div><a name="081111106000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000390"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I am not sure to which &#147;may&#148; my
hon. Friend is referring. The policy intention is to provide a strong
safeguard that provides protection to bespoke agreements, to agreements
made under industry-recognised master netting agreements and to
provide, as part of that context, clearly defined protection. This is
something that the industry has welcomed and has been asking questions
about and we will be responding to the consultation
exercise.</div><a name="081111106000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000391"></a>Mr.

&#147;may&#148;? Clause 43(3)

arrangements...of a specified kind, or...made or applying in
specified
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="081111106000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is rather general, on the lines that those are our broad intents but we
can do it another way. The difficulty with uncertainties may be dealt
with by clearer guidance which is being discussed now. My concern is
that what is on the statute book enshrines a degree of discretion that
those lending to a bank or seeking to construct an instrument with a
bank might have some anxiety
over.</div><a name="081111106000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000392"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the point that my hon. Friend is
making. I want to be clear that we are intending to make progress and
issue secondary legislation to provide the safeguards that are
reflected in clauses 42, 43 and 55, as I have already outlined to the
Committee. We think that with regard to partial transfer powers we
should outline the principles in the code. My hon. Friend will see the
draft legislation that is in the &#147;Special resolution regime:
safeguards for partial property transfers&#148; consultation
document. I confirm the Government&#146;s intention, following
consultation, to proceed with
it.</div><a name="081111106000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000393"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Following what the hon. Member for South Derbyshire
has said, it is rather important to give certainty in this area as it
is the most controversial. The Minister has assured us that it shall
happen but I am afraid the Bill says that it may happen. Would it not
be worth thinking about whether those &#147;mays&#148; should be
turned into definites?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column430" />Column number: 430</div><a name="081111106000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000394"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will certainly think about it and talk to
officials about the different &#147;mays&#148; and
&#147;shalls&#148;. We may consider that changes need to be made to
the Bill but, on the other hand, we may not; we may think that our
original thinking was correct in this matter.</div>
<a name="081111106000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude on security interests, the Government are proposing that all
forms of security arrangement where a creditor takes an interest in the
property of the debtor should be protected, including both fixed and
floating charges, which was a point raised by the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire.</div>
<a name="081111106000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of hon. Members requested further information on lessons learned
from Bradford &amp; Bingley, as an example of a partial transfer. As I
said before we adjourned for lunch, it is inappropriate to discuss the
details of current resolutions, not least because of litigation issues.
However, in order to help the Committee, let me provide some general
reflections on this case and how recent resolutions have informed our
thinking on partial transfers.</div>
<a name="081111106000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Using
the powers in the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, put in place
in February, Bradford &amp; Bingley plc was taken into temporary public
ownership by way of a transfer of its securities. Then, as part of the
same order, its deposit business and its branches were transferred by
way of a property transfer to Abbey Santander, backed by a contribution
from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and the Treasury. The
parts of the bank that were not transferred to Abbey&#151;in broad
terms, mortgages and other assets&#151;remain in public ownership.
That was a relatively simple example of a partial transfer. Under the
transfer order, the FSCS paid out approximately &#163;14 billion to
enable retail deposits held in Bradford &amp; Bingley and covered by
the FSCS to be transferred to Abbey, with the Treasury making a payment
to Abbey for retail deposit amounts not covered by the FSCS, amounting
to approximately &#163;4
billion.</div><a name="081111106000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
may also help the hon. Member for Wellingborough to set out how a
partial transfer might work, but I want to stress that this is just one
example. The Bank of England could use the bridge bank stabilisation
options to transfer a deposit book of a failing bank to a bridge bank.
The residual company&#151;that is the banking business not
transferred&#151;would enter the bank administration procedure, as
provided for by part 3. The residual company would be wound up by a
bank administrator, while providing necessary services to the bridge
bank. The Bank of England would work to stabilise the bridge bank and
sell on to a private sector purchaser as quickly as possible. That is
an example of one way that the powers could be exercised in the
future.</div>
<a name="081111106000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire also asked a number of questions
about clause 42(3) and our treatment of it in the consultation document
on partial transfer safeguards. First, to answer his question on the
why subsection (3) refers to classes of deposits: the provision gives
an example of the class of property to which restrictions could relate.
Subsection (3) does not state that restrictions must necessarily relate
to deposits. It is designed to give a flavour of the type of provision
the underlying secondary legislation could
make.</div><a name="081111106000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also asked why the Government are consulting on making
provisions for general restrictions in the code of practice rather than
in legislation. As he noted, the Government agree that key safeguards
to partial transfers should be put in secondary legislation. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column431" />Column number: 431</div>That is why we are consulting on putting in secondary legislation the
safeguards to protect set-off and netting, to protect security
interests and to aim to ensure that no creditor be worse off through a
partial transfer. Feedback from stakeholders, as the hon. Gentleman
noted earlier, is that those three safeguards, and in particular the
protection of set-off and netting, are the most important, and we
intend them to be covered through secondary legislation. However, as he
is aware, we are consulting on providing additional guidance in the
code of practice on what property, rights and liabilities could be
transferred in a partial transfer and in what circumstances such
partial transfers would
occur.</div><a name="081111106000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I have said, recent events in the financial markets have clearly
demonstrated that preserving the flexibility of the authorities is
crucial. Therefore, we do not believe that at this stage there should
be, in addition to the safeguards that I have just mentioned, a general
legislative restriction on the scope of partial transfers. However, the
guidelines in the code of practice will give the market more clarity
about the nature of the partial transfers that the authorities may
effect. However, we are consulting on it and I look forward to
receiving stakeholder views on
it.</div><a name="081111106000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
issue raised by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was about
paragraph 2.16 of the consultation document. Paragraph 2.16 sets out
the Government&#146;s broad policy intention towards set-off and
netting arrangements, which is to protect contracts relevant for
regulatory capital purposes from the threat of disruption. However, it
would not be appropriate for the draft order to adopt a specific
definition to that effect, in part due to the circularity point raised
by the hon. Gentleman. Instead, the draft order specifies that set-off
and netting arrangements will be protected subject to delineated
exceptions, which is important so that counterparties can attain the
necessary legal certainty. The Government will be working with
stakeholders, including through the expert liaison group, to ascertain
whether the provisions of the draft order address the policy objective
of protective set-off and netting arrangements with rate contracts that
are relevant for regulatory capital
calculations.</div><a name="081111106000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="081111106000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make it clear at this stage that the safeguard is likely to
cover many more set-off and netting arrangements than simply those that
relate to contracts relevant for regulatory capital. The broad
safeguard proposed would cover most set-off and netting arrangements,
subject to some exceptions, and that approach has been welcomed
already.</div><a name="081111106000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked what protection is provided for security. I can
confirm that the Government are consulting on the position that the
security interest safeguard should be comprehensive and include all
floating charges. He also asked why we should refer to the financial
collateral directive, rather than to regulations, which are wider. It
is correct that the draft order only refers to protecting interests
under the financial collateral directive, rather than regulations, but
we are specifically consulting on that point. I refer the hon.
Gentleman to question 10 on page 18 of the consultation document. We
are open to representations on that
point.</div><a name="081111106000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to return to the question of whether we are rushing this too much.
I of course agree that partial transfers are critical and that it is
therefore essential to  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column432" />Column number: 432</div>get them right. That is why we have published the consultation document
and why we have set up the expert liaison group to consider the
safeguards. The consultation document, as I have made clear, included
draft orders on the safeguards that stakeholders have informed us are
the most important. Annex A of the consultation document provides draft
secondary legislation for the set-off and netting arrangements and
security interest safeguards in addition to draft regulations for the
&#147;No Creditor Worse Off&#148; safeguard. I would also like to
point out that the adopted approach for the netting and safeguards
follows a direct recommendation from the expert liaison
group.</div>
<a name="081111106000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
making good progress on the detail of those important safeguards, and
we want to get them right. We currently believe that, with the good
co-operation we have had so far with stakeholders, we will be able to
get them right in a timely manner so that we can pass the secondary
legislation at a similar time to the passing of the primary legislation
we are discussion
today.</div><a name="081111106000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000395"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 98, in
clause 44, page 21, line 6, leave
out &#145;establishing a scheme
for&#146;.</div><a name="081111106000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000396"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
Government amendments Nos. 99 to 101 and
112.</div><a name="081111106000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000397"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Amendments Nos. 98 to 101 make several
modifications to provision for compensation scheme orders under
subsection (2). The purpose of the amendments is to enable the
Treasury, where appropriate, to make provision in a compensation scheme
order for a sum of compensation to be paid, rather than to make
provision for establishing a scheme for determining whether transferors
should be paid compensation.</div>
<a name="081111106000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
explain why I think that that modification is essential. As I have
already stated in debates on earlier clauses, in most circumstances the
preferable stabilisation option for the authorities will be to effect a
sale to a private sector purchaser. In such circumstances, a price will
be agreed between the purchaser and the Bank of England. That price may
have been determined in one of a number of ways, including an auction
process.</div>
<a name="081111106000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In such
circumstances, the price agreed reflects a market rate, and the
Government therefore believe that there is no need to appoint an
independent valuer to determine the compensation due to the transferors
as the basic principle under article 1, protocol 1 of the European
convention on human rights is that compensation must normally bear a
reasonable relation to the property expropriated. In such
circumstances, the Government believe that the process of selling the
institution would have determined the fair market value, and that there
is therefore no need to appoint an independent valuer. The compensation
scheme order should simply state the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column433" />Column number: 433</div>level of compensation&#151;the price agreed&#151;rather than
providing for a mechanism to determine the compensation
payable.</div><a name="081111106000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me also be clear that there is still a means for transferors and other
interested parties to appeal against the provision for compensation
made in the order. That would be by way of the appeals process set out
in the order, or by way of judicial review. I would also like to point
out that compensation scheme orders are subject to the draft
affirmative procedure. Therefore, Parliament can scrutinise the order
and assess whether the provision for compensation is
appropriate.</div><a name="081111106000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government are committed to ensuring that the fair value of
compensation is paid to parties who have suffered a compensatable
interference in their property rights as a result of an exercise of the
stabilisation powers. While in many cases that will be done through an
appointment of an independent valuer, in some circumstances the
appropriate level of compensation can be determined through the process
of resolution itself, and it is in those circumstances that I believe
the Treasury should be able to specify the sum of compensation due in
the compensation order. Amendments Nos. 98 to 101 make incidental
appropriate technical provision that allows that. Finally, amendment
No. 112 makes it clear that a compensation order is a statutory
instrument.</div><a name="081111106000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that hon. Members will agree to the amendments to clauses 44 and

<div class="hs_brev">&#145;the bridge bank or bank in public ownership, or any

ownership&#146;.</div><a name="081111106000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment refers to the wording in subsection (3) about a
resolution fund order. As the Minister has set out, there are
essentially two stages in a typical transaction&#151;if there is such
a thing in these circumstances. The first stage is the transfer of the
assets into a bridge bank or temporary public ownership, and the second
stage is the transfer of the assets out to a private sector purchaser.
It is not clear whether the resolution fund order applies to just the
first stage, just the second stage or both. The purpose of the
amendment is to probe what the Government seek to
achieve.</div><a name="081111106000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
subsection states that a resolution fund order
is</div><a name="081111106000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an

transferred&#148;.</div><a name="081111106000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek clarity as to what &#147;disposal of things transferred&#148;
means. The amendment breaks that down into the two stages, which would
provide greater clarity if the Government&#146;s intention was to
cover both stages. If the Government&#146;s interpretation of
&#147;disposal of things 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column434" />Column number: 434</div>transferred&#148; is broad, the amendment incorporates that; if it is
narrow then it does not. I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
reply.</div><a name="081111106000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000399"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 44, which the hon. Gentleman seeks to
amend, sets out three types of compensation provision that can be made
to compensatable persons. The first provision is the
&#147;compensation scheme order&#148;, which requires a scheme,
involving the appointment of an independent valuer to assess
compensation due, to be put in place for the purposes of compensating a
bank or its shareholders. Members will recall that a similar
compensation order was put in place in respect of powers under the 2008
Act to bring Northern Rock into temporary public ownership. The
Government amendments to clause 44 also need to be borne in
mind.</div><a name="081111106000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
44 also provides for a &#147;resolution fund order&#148;, which
creates a scheme whereby transferors&#151;the bank or its
shareholders, depending on whether property or share transfer powers
have been used&#151;become entitled to the net proceeds of the
resolution, subject to the deduction of the costs of the resolution.
The scheme will include the method of calculation and distribution.
Finally, the clause includes a &#147;third party compensation
order&#148;, which provides for compensation to be provided to
persons other than the transferors who have their termination rights
interfered with by a partial transfer.</div>
<a name="081111106000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
requires all compensation orders to be subject to the affirmative
procedure, as set out under clause 56, which is in line with the
recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
in respect of the 2008 Act. The compensation provisions in the Bill
will provide suitable mechanisms for determining compensation. I hope
that that background explanation was
helpful.</div><a name="081111106000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
appreciate that the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire is a probing one. The clause does not refer specifically
to the disposal of a whole bank in public ownership, but to the
proceeds of disposal of things transferred, so a broad definition is
provided for. The clause encompasses the meaning that he desires, as it
does not refer to any particular method of disposal. His amendment,
therefore, is not necessary. With that clarification, I hope that he
will seek leave to withdraw

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000406"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The amendments are largely a drafting matter. There
is no a particular dispute about the policy element. Amendment No. 146
relates to clause 48 and attempts to elaborate further what should be
contained within a third-party compensation order. It aims to be
helpful and provide some clarity to the existing wording. Amendment No.
147 is a rather short amendment to clause 52(5), which
reads:</div><a name="081111106000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is nothing to prevent the application of the valuation principles in an
order from resulting in no compensation being payable to a
transferor.&#148;</div><a name="081111106000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably
the same point applies to third parties, which is why the amendment
would add the phrase &#147;or to third parties&#148;. Both
amendments add something to the Bill, particularly amendment No. 147,
which provides helpful
clarification.</div><a name="081111106000138"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000407"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I believe that the purpose of amendment No. 146
is to ensure that rights arising from provision made for compensation
by way of a third-party compensation order are in addition to those
rights conferred on a third party under a bank resolution scheme order.
The amendment is inappropriate as the Treasury does not have the power
to make provision for bank resolution funds for onward
transfers.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column436" />Column number: 436</div><a name="081111106000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
in relation to any rights arising by way of a bank resolution fund that
has been put in place in respect of the initial transfer of property to
the bridge bank or bank in temporary public ownership, any provision
for compensation for interferences in third-party rights arising under
an onward transfer compensation scheme order will relate to separate
and unrelated interferences in property
rights.</div><a name="081111106000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 147 proposes that clause 52(5) should also make reference to third
parties. However, as  subsection (5) is applied to third
parties by clause 54(3), the courts would construe that clause to refer
to third parties. The amendment is simply not needed, so I ask the hon.
Gentleman to consider withdrawing
it.</div><a name="081111106000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000408"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I will take the Minister at his word on amendment
No. 146 but I am not sure that I quite understand his argument on
amendment No. 147. If he is saying that the courts will interpret
subsection (5) as applying to third parties, notwithstanding the fact
that the clause specifically mentions the transferor but does not say
&#147;or to third parties&#148;, the amendment seems helpful. I do
not see why he does not accept it. It seems that subsection (5) will
apply to third parties, and if it does I see no reason why it should
not say so, given that it specifies transferors.</div>
<a name="081111106000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am loth to
divide the Committee on this point, because it does not seem to be
anything other than a technical one, and I am surprised that the
Minister has not accepted it. However, I am in a generous mood. Perhaps
I will allow him to ponder whether he might reconsider later and accept
my
amendment.</div><a name="081111106000143"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000415"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As the Committee will be aware, the determination
of compensation under a compensation scheme order or a third party
compensation scheme order will constitute a determination of a civil
right for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column437" />Column number: 437</div>the purposes of the European convention on human rights, and the
requirements of article 6 of the convention will therefore apply. In
particular, the compensation must be assessed by an independent and
impartial
person.</div><a name="081111106000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Accordingly,
clause 49 provides for the amount of any compensation to be determined
by an independent valuer. We touched on that point in a previous
debate. The clause also sets out the process for appointing and
removing the independent valuer. The Bill ensures that the valuer will
be seen to be independent and impartial, as required by article 6 of
the
ECHR.</div><a name="081111106000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause sets out an appointments process whereby an order must require
an independent valuer to be appointed by a person who is, and is seen
to be, fully independent, as stated in subsection (2). The independent
appointing person may appoint an independent valuer either from a list
of suitable candidates supplied by the Treasury or by way of an
appointment made with regard to criteria specified in the order. The
clause specifies a number of other safeguards on the independent
valuer&#146;s security of tenure. For example, the independent valuer
may be removed from office only on grounds of incapacity or serious
misconduct, and only by an independent
person.</div><a name="081111106000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of Government amendment No. 106 is the same as that of the
Government amendments to clause 44: to remove the requirement that a
compensation scheme order must always make provision for the assessment
of compensation by an independent valuer. To summarise the arguments
briefly, in some situations&#151;for example, a sale through auction
to a private sector purchaser&#151;the rate agreed would reflect a
market rate. In those circumstances, as I outlined about half an hour
ago, the Government believe that there is no need to appoint an
independent valuer to determine the compensation due. The compensation
scheme order should simply state the level of compensation&#151;that
is, the price agreed&#151;rather than providing for a mechanism to
determine the compensation
payable.</div><a name="081111106000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 107 makes technical changes to clause 49 so that where an
independent valuer is to determine compensation under a compensation
scheme order, the provisions in clause 49 regarding  his
appointment, resignation and dismissal, and the appointment of any
replacement independent valuer also apply. Again, I remind hon. Members
that there is still a means for transferors and other parties to appeal
against the compensation amount decided in accordance with the
order.</div><a name="081111106000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope with that explanation and the read-across to the previous
debate&#151;</div>
<a name="081111106000157"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="081111106000416"></a><b class="B">Dr.
John Pugh</b> (Southport) (LD): I am not sure that the
Minister referred to Government amendment  No. 106;
I only heard him refer to Government amendment No. 107. However, to
return to the point made by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire about
the use of the word &#147;may&#148;, if &#147;must&#148; is
substituted, as the Government wish to do, within the terms of the
legislation a compensation scheme could presumably provide, in theory,
for the amount of any compensation payable to be determined by somebody
other than the independent 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column438" />Column number: 438</div>valuer, or in some other way than by a method of independent valuation.
Is that a correct reading of Government amendment No. 106? There is a
significant change of gear from &#147;must&#148; to
&#147;may&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000417"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I was trying to explain, the purpose of the
amendment is to reflect the circumstances if there was a sale through
an auction process, because a market rate would have been determined.
Once a price has been established, it seems a highly artificial
exercise to have to go through the process of appointing someone. It
seems odd, after the price has been decided, that an independent valuer
should come to a different judgment about the price and determine the
compensation due to transfers as part of the process of selling the
institution.</div>
<a name="081111106000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman is encouraging me to think about whether &#147;may&#148;
might be used in other cases that have no auction process and where
there is no clearly identified price.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000419"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> In response, the only indication why we would not
want to go down the independent valuer route at the heart of the clause
would be if an auction process or a similar mechanism had clearly and
demonstrably provided an agreed market rate. However, there are
safeguards. If people felt that there were particular problems with the
route that we had adopted, they would obviously have legal remedies and
a right of appeal against the compensation
order.</div>
<a name="081111106000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000420"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> I accept some of the Minister&#146;s remarks. I
know what he intends. However, the legislation as framed could permit
other activities than the benign acceptance of the consequences of an
auction. Assurances given under the clause or elsewhere in the Bill
would probably not be sufficient to eradicate that possibility. It may
be a slim possibility, but it still exists in
legislation.</div>
<a name="081111106000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000421"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> To conclude, I hope that I have given assurances
about the Government&#146;s intentions on how the clause, if amended,
would be used. However, I shall reflect on the matter and if more needs
to be done to clarify things I shall endeavour to come back at a later
stage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000422"></a>Mr.

comments may be more appropriate to clause stand part, but if I raise
the issue now we may not need a clause stand part debate.</div>
<a name="081111106000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
the independent valuer will be important. On occasion, it is possible
that some political pressure may put on the valuer. I can imagine
circumstances in which our constituents wrote to us to raise concerns
about the valuer, so independence is clearly important, as is the
perception of independence.</div>
<a name="081111106000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have given some indication of how independence is to be
maintained, based on the limited grounds on which an independent valuer
can operate. Will the Minister give us a little guidance on
the type and status of the person the Government will be
looking for to fill that position? Will he give us more information
about the role of the appointing person? Subsection (3)(a)
refers to the Treasury making arrangements</div>

that they will be people with sufficient experience to make the
judgments required of them in the circumstances. As for the appointment
of an independent &#147;appointing person&#148;, I shall check with
officials but I would be surprised if it was made under anything other

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000424"></a>Dr.
Pugh:</b> On the face of it, the clause seems innocuous. It
simply says, &#147;supplemental&#148;. However, when I studied it I
had some concerns, which I need the Minister to clear up before I can
be completely happy with the clause. Although the clause is
supplementary, it is wide-ranging. I draw attention to the fact that
the independent valuer can publish and disclose
information&#151;which we would expect&#151;but can also withhold
information. Yet, subsection (8)
states:</div><a name="081111106000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Records
of an independent valuer are public records for the purpose of the
Public Records Act
1958.&#148;</div><a name="081111106000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sufficiently learned in the law to know whether that makes an
exemption from a freedom of information request. I could imagine that
if in certain circumstances a valuer was deemed to withhold crucial and
important information, more than one interested party would wish to get
hold of that information. They might have a right to do so,
particularly if the information concerned the disbursement of an ailing
bank and resources being allocated in one direction or another. The
clause appears to create that sort of exemption and make it immune from
any legal challenge, so that if people want information that an
independent valuer has, primary legislation says that he has the right
to withhold it. That exemption seems to be created. It may not, as a
result of being created, be challengeable in law, but it may not be
consistent with the principles of natural
justice.</div><a name="081111106000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
other concern is more a matter of amplification. Subsection (3) states
that jurisdiction may be conferred on a court or tribunal, and
subsection (6)(b) states that there can be an appeal to a court. A
number of courts are referred to, and I would simply like to know which
courts we are thinking of&#151;courts that exist and can be
identified, or courts to be created for the specific purpose.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div><a name="081111106000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
similar question on subsection (3)(d), which states that at some future
date a criminal offence might be created by a statutory instrument.
That is not a most desirable way to create a criminal offence. I
imagine that the offence would be along the lines of withholding
information from an independent valuer. I wish that the Minister could
give us an inkling as to what types of offences the Treasury has in
mind.</div><a name="081111106000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dotted
through the clause are areas where clarification is required. Let me
rehearse them again. First, will the clause create an exemption to
freedom of information requests for information from independent
valuers? Secondly, where courts or tribunals are referred to, precisely
which are they? Are the appeal court and the court upon which
jurisdiction is conferred one and the same? Thirdly, are we creating a
new kind of misdemeanour, or the possibility of one, and if so what
will it look
like?</div><a name="081111106000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a complex and detailed set of questions. If the Minister wants to
reply in writing, that is great by me, but if he can give amplification
straight away, that will be equally
acceptable.</div>
<a name="081111106000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000425"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> Briefly, clause 50(2)(b) will allow the Treasury to
instruct an independent valuer to withhold information. The independent
valuer is there to arrive at a compensation figure. I cannot imagine
any legitimate grounds on which the Treasury should instruct an
independent valuer not to publish information used in obtaining
compensation levels for a third party. Does the Minister have any

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000426"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I can respond to some of hon. Members&#146;
points, but I might have to respond in writing to give further detail.
The hon. Member for Southport asked why the independent valuer will be
able to withhold information. The reason is the normal reason for which
an independent valuer might wish to do so: the information is subject
to commercial sensitivities. In that respect, article 6 of the European
convention on human rights requires only the reasons for a valuation
decision to be made public, not every single piece of
information.</div><a name="081111106000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
certainly recognise that there will be a degree of interest in the
independent valuer&#146;s determination, but it is the
Government&#146;s assessment that it would be inappropriate to
designate the independent valuer a public body for the purposes of the
Freedom of Information Act. In particular, the independent valuer does
not meet both the conditions for section 4 of that Act to apply, as he
or she will be an independent person with the sole function of
assessing compensation in accordance with the order and any contractual
arrangements and is likely to seek commercial return for the
work.</div><a name="081111106000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
of the unique nature of the valuer&#146;s function and
status&#151;they will discharge a quasi-judicial function&#151;the
Government do not consider it appropriate to designate the valuer a
public body. Furthermore, the application of the Freedom of Information
Act may inhibit the valuer&#146;s ability to obtain full information
from other institutions and individuals on their relations with the
failed bank. That is why we do not think it appropriate for the
independent valuer to be subject to the Freedom of Information
Act.</div><a name="081111106000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
criminal offences, I am advised that the issue must relate to the
provision made under subsection (2): in other words, it must involve a
refusal to disclose information. I hope that is helpful to the hon.
Member for Southport.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column441" />Column number: 441</div><a name="081111106000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
publication of information, the independent valuer will be able to
select documents suitable for permanent preservation as a matter of
public record. Selection takes place in two stages: when records are
passed out of active use and later when they are subject to review. At
that later stage, the independent valuer may select records worthy of
permanent preservation in the National Archives; it is for the valuer
to select which.</div>
<a name="081111106000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
provides for the Treasury to make provision in an audit for the
remuneration and allowances of independent valuers, the staff of
independent valuers and appointing persons. As hon. Members will be
aware, there are a number of detailed provisions in the clause. I think
that most of them are uncontroversial, although there is naturally
Committee interest in the public disclosure matters to which I have

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000429"></a>Ian

provision in an order for the remuneration and allowances of
independent valuers, the staff of independent valuers and appointing
persons.</div><a name="081111106000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
the Treasury will pay the remuneration and expenses of the independent
valuer, the Treasury must put in place a monitor to oversee the
remuneration and any allowances for the independent valuer, including
pension arrangements. As part of his or her role, the monitor may be
required to approve certain actions including the appointment of staff.
The Government amendments to this clause are intended to ensure that
the Treasury can remunerate and reimburse the expenses of the monitor
for the functions that he or she is undertaking, which I am sure the
Committee will agree is a sensible
provision.</div><a name="081111106000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the provisions of the clause, it also provides that independent
valuers and their staff should not be liable for damages for actions
taken in good faith. The exemption is, however, limited so the
exemption will not apply if the act or omission is ultra vires, or in
bad faith, or would prevent an award of damages under section 6(1) of
the Human Rights Act 1998 in respect of acts or omissions that are
unlawful. This is a relatively common
provision.</div><a name="081111106000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I wish the Committee to note that the provisions to put in place and
provide the independent valuers with powers and remuneration are to be
made by an order subject to the negative resolution procedure. Of
course, the compensation orders themselves, which will set out such
matters as valuation principles, will be subject to the draft
affirmative procedure.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000430"></a>Mr.

actions? Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on what those actions will
be.</div><a name="081111106000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000431"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I was not following the Minister&#146;s statement
as intently as I should have done. I thought he said
&#147;negative&#148; resolution for one of the provisions. As far
as I am aware, all the statutory instruments related to this Bill so
far have been affirmative. This, of course, means that Members have the
chance to debate them in one and half hours but they are not amendable.
A negative one&#151;unless it is prayed against&#151;will just go
through. I missed which one they were trying to sneak through without
any proper

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000432"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We are not trying to sneak anything through. As I
explained to the Committee, the compensation orders will be subject to
the draft affirmative procedure. It is the compensation orders that are
likely to attract the most interest. The provisions to put in place and
provide the independent valuer with powers and remuneration will be
subject to the negative resolution procedure. That is the right balance
to adopt.</div>
<a name="081111106000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have not
made express provision as to who the monitor would be but it is our
intention that he or she should be an independent person with relevant

basis. We would want to look at who was most appropriate depending on
the circumstances. To clarify, the monitor cannot veto action but can
and will be expected to provide an independent audit and report to the
Treasury on expenses. I hope that the Government amendments will be

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000435"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Indeed it is convenient to consider these three
amendments together. They all stem from representations that we have
received from the BBA, which can be simply described as representing
the desire for a fairness test in the provisions relating to valuation.
Amendment No. 115 is to clause 52, relating to valuation principles.
Subsection (2) states the valuation principles that will apply and that
the independent valuer must take into account. The principle suggested
by the amendment is that the independent valuer acts fairly. Clause 53
relates to the resolution fund. The proposal in that regard is that a
resolution fund order and any action taken as a consequence of a
resolution fund order or a discretionary power conferred by such an
order must also be consistent with fairness. Amendment No. 118 relates
to the making of regulations that provide for compensation to be paid.
Again, in the list of various factors to be determined, the
compensation levels should be determined
fairly.</div><a name="081111106000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
intention behind the amendments is to elicit some comments from the
Minister about fairness. He may well say that the amendments are not
necessary and are otiose&#151;that is a splendid word and I
congratulate him on being the first member of the Committee, as far as
I know, to use it in these proceedings. None the less, concerns have
been raised by outside bodies, including the BBA, about the valuation
principles and the way in which compensation will be paid. There is a
question of fairness. One difficulty that I can acknowledge is that
what is fair to one person is not necessarily fair to another. It does
not provide a great deal of certainty. None the less, it is an
important principle and I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
comments on whether he would be willing to incorporate a fairness test
in some of the
provisions.</div><a name="081111106000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000436"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I regard fairness as extremely important. In
fact, it runs through the Labour Government&#146;s policy. I am a
little surprised that the outside bodies that have been advising the
hon. Gentleman think it necessary to probe in this area and seemingly
doubt both the Government&#146;s good intentions and the fact that
the European convention on human rights will apply to the circumstances
that we are
discussing.</div><a name="081111106000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
52 sets out the valuation principles that may be required to be
specified in any compensation scheme order. In summary, the clause
allows the Government to include in a compensation scheme order a
number of valuation principles. Those may cover a range of issues,
including the method of valuation, whether certain matters should or
should not be taken into account by the valuer and whether the valuer
may make particular assumptions in carrying out his functions, such as
the assumption that the bank is unable to continue as a going concern.
The aim of the provisions is to allow the Government to set out the
principles that they believe should be adhered to in assessing any
compensation. Parliament can of course debate those, as the draft
affirmative resolution procedure applies to compensation scheme orders,
as I previously
outlined.</div><a name="081111106000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
specific valuation principle that is required to be taken into account
by the clause is that in determining an amount of compensation an
independent valuer must disregard actual or potential financial
assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury. That is to
ensure that taxpayer support does not artificially 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>inflate the value of the failing bank. I know that the hon. Members for
Southport and for South-East Cornwall have put forward an amendment on
that principle, which we will debate in a few
moments.</div><a name="081111106000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
purpose of the first amendment from the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire is to allow the Treasury in the compensation order
explicitly to require the independent valuer to act fairly. I would
like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the independent valuer is
already required to act in just such a manner. The independent valuer
will be making an assessment of compensation, which will involve the
determination of a civil right. As a result, the independent valuer
will have to act fairly, in accordance with article 6 of the human
rights convention, which requires a standard to be put in place to
ensure a fair process for making the determination of compensation. I
should also note that the valuer will also be performing a public
function and will have to act fairly in accordance with the principles
of public
law.</div><a name="081111106000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s second amendment is intended to require the
resolution fund to be consistent with the principle of fairness. Again,
standards of fairness as defined under human rights law will need to be
met in any event, in the making of resolution fund orders by the
Treasury and the taking of action under such orders by any of the
public persons specified in clause 53(3). A resolution fund order is
intended to provide compensation to the transferor for the
expropriation of property and that compensation must be at least
sufficient to meet the requirements of article 1 of the first protocol
of the European convention on human rights on the protection of
property rights. Fairness is an important principle in ensuring that
interferences with property rights are compatible with article 1. As I
have explained, the assessment of compensation is also a civil right
for the purposes of article
6.</div><a name="081111106000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s final amendment is to 
clause 55, which provides for the &#147;No Creditor Worse
Off&#148; safeguard on which the Government are consulting, as I have
mentioned. My understanding is that the purpose of the amendment is to
require the determination of third party compensation to be made in a
fair manner. Public law will still require the determinations to be
made in a way that takes account of all relevant factors and is not
considered irrational or arbitrary. Therefore, again, the concept of
fairness is implicit in the Bill and in the orders that may be made
under powers conferred by the provisions of the Bill. Therefore, in
each of these clauses there is already a strong requirement for
fairness, in both the outcome of the compensation determinations and in
the procedure that must be put in place to determine any outcome, by
way of the European Court of Human Rights requirements or through
public law requirements, or both. I hope that the explanations have
reassured the hon. Gentleman and those who follow these matters that
the clauses already deliver the intention of his
amendments.</div><a name="081111106000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is, I suppose, possible to argue that the concept of fairness should be
explicit rather than implicit, but I do not agree with that. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments, which introduce a requirement for fair
treatment, suggest that a different standard of fairness than is
usually regarded under the convention rights or public law should
apply. I do not believe that that should be suggested. Parliament and
the courts have already 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div>determined the appropriate standard of fairness, which these clauses
comply with, so it would be unhelpful to suggest that the provisions of
the Bill should seek to meet a different standard. I hope that I have
demonstrated why the amendments are unnecessary and that the hon.
Gentleman will withdraw
them.</div><a name="081111106000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000437"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I shall resist the temptation to query the
Minister&#146;s statement that fairness runs through the heart of the
Labour Government; we will leave that for another day. To address his
comments, there appears to be a slight tension or inconsistency in his
explanation. He argues on the one hand that the provisions are
unnecessary because fairness will be part of the process, and on the
other that the provisions would confuse matters by applying a fairness
test different from that which exists elsewhere in the legislation. It
is difficult to argue both. None the less, I am grateful for his
comments that fairness is there implicitly, if not explicitly. I can
see difficulties with including an explicit fairness test in the
legislation, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="081111106000215"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I beg to move

and insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;take into account such financial
assistance provided by the Bank of England or the Treasury as would
have been likely to have been provided to the bank if the SRR powers
had not been
invoked.&#146;.</div><a name="081111106000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the third of a suite of amendments highlighting the vulnerability of
the legislation in dealing with banks and financial institutions before
their insolvency. We have considered the matter in debate on amendments
concerning the objectives and the exercise of powers; the valuation
principles are the third area.</div>
<a name="081111106000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for Southport, is in effect a direct negative of the
clause&#146;s current wording. I suppose that, to a certain extent,
the issue goes back to the fairness that we just discussed. It is
interesting to ask to whom we are being fair. One hopes for fairness
across the board, but the thrust of the legislation is to protect
depositors, which implies that the fairness, if there is any, is more
fair to depositors than to others. If that is the case, in order to
protect the interests and property rights of shareholders, creditors
and others, and to ensure that they are not prejudiced or treated
unfairly by the clause, we need to protect the residual value of the
business and the
entity.</div><a name="081111106000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is particularly relevant to the extent that the Bill retains
the prospect of banks entering into the SRR regime before they have
reached a state of insolvency as it is generally understood in law. It
is that period that we have highlighted on several occasions. Once
someone has gone into insolvency, there are clear rules about how
things will happen, but in the period before that, a number of
subjective judgments must be made about timing, objectives, principles
and so on, all of which can be incompatible with each other to a
certain extent.</div>
<a name="081111106000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
believe that the aim should be to make those valuation judgments
consistent with an orderly run-off or wind-down of the business.
Sometimes it is right for the authorities to support and create that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>rather than the &#147;crash bang wallop&#148; approach of going
straight into insolvency. If that is the case, when valuation
principles and compensation are being considered, it is right at least
to consider what might be available from the Treasury and the Bank of
England.</div>
<a name="081111106000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
clause currently excludes all that. I can understand why the Government
would want to exclude it, but I am not certain that that sits easily
with the objective of treating everyone fairly. Bearing in mind that
the process could immediately precede an ultimate insolvency, it is
rather contradictory to what would normally happen in the event of a
full-scale insolvency. This is a probing amendment. It is for the
Minister to explain and justify the clause to which we have tabled the
amendment.</div>
<a name="081111106000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15
pm</div><a name="081111106000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000439"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I note that the hon. Gentleman described this as a
probing amendment. We would not be inclined to support it; it is right
that financial assistance should be disregarded by the independent
valuer; otherwise, a public subsidy will essentially end up in the
hands of shareholders and creditors. We believe that that would be
wrong. However, there are two points in subsection (3) where
greater clarification would be
helpful.</div><a name="081111106000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first is the fact that the independent valuer has to disregard
potential financial assistance. I am not sure what potential financial
assistance is, and how the independent valuer is supposed to disregard
it given that it will not have happened. Secondly, the carve-out
disregards ordinary market assistance offered by the Bank of England on
its usual terms. It would help if the Minister were to elaborate a
little on what ordinary market assistance is, so that we are clear as
to what is ordinary and what financial support should be
disregarded.</div>
<a name="081111106000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000440"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendment seeks to remove the principle that
the independent valuer must disregard any financial assistance provided
to the failing bank by the Bank of England and the Treasury. Although I
appreciate the probing way in which the amendment was moved, it would
have fundamental consequences. We cannot agree to it, as it would
remove a core principle of the compensation provisions, which is that
compensation should not be paid for the value of a bank as artificially
inflated with the investment of public funds. If public funds have been
invested, it is right that they should be discounted in subsequent
evaluations. If taxpayers&#146; money has been invested in a bank in
order to support it, the failing bank or its shareholders should not
benefit through the compensation. To allow that to happen would be
against the Treasury&#146;s duty&#151;and, indeed, the SRR
objective of protecting public funds, as outlined in clause
4.</div><a name="081111106000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about potential
financial assistance. Financial assistance provided on an ongoing or
continuing basis would be potential financial assistance. That probably
clarifies the hon. Gentleman&#146;s query.</div>
<a name="081111106000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
broader point, however, there is a matter of principle. I cannot agree
with an amendment that suggests, when it comes to subsequent
evaluation, that we should disregard any amount of money that the
Government or the Bank of England have put into a bank that
subsequently gets into difficulties. That would be wrong, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div>and it would not be accepted by the wide generality of taxpayers. I hope
that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000441"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> As I said, it was a probing amendment. We moved it
because we needed clarity. To an extent, the matter of compensation is

53 makes provision in respect of bank resolution fund orders. A bank
resolution fund is mandatory following a transfer of a failing
bank&#146;s property to a bridge bank and optional when a bank is
taken into temporary public ownership. Such a compensation procedure
ensures that the failing bank or, in the case of temporary public
ownership, its shareholders have a contingent economic interest in the
proceeds of the
resolution.</div><a name="081111106000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bank resolution fund demonstrates that the Government do not have an
economic interest in the bridge bank and that they do not intend to
profit from any uplift in value arising from the stabilisation. Rather
the authorities&#146; only aim in acting is to meet the SRR
objectives. As I indicated, I do not believe it necessary to have a
bank resolution fund following a transfer to a private sector
purchaser, because in such circumstances the proceeds of resolution
flow directly back to the failing bank or its shareholders. The
Treasury should have the discretion not to put in place a bank
resolution fund when a bank is taken into temporary public ownership,
because in some circumstances&#151;for example, if a significant
amount of public funds has been invested&#151;it is appropriate for
the public to benefit from the upside of any
resolution.</div><a name="081111106000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
reflection, even though the bank resolution fund method does not
require the undertaking of a valuation exercise to assess the
compensation due, the Government recognise that in certain
circumstances the appointment of an independent valuer will be
appropriate. For example, it might be appropriate to appoint an
independent valuer to consider whether the actual sale price provided a
reasonable relation to the market value. The amendment thus allows the
Treasury to appoint an independent valuer and to put in place,
alongside that, certain valuation principles to be used in conjunction
with the bank resolution
fund.</div><a name="081111106000234"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000443"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> As the day has drawn on, I have been pondering that
point in relation to earlier clauses, when the Minister referred to an
auction, rather than a sale, to establish the market value and
therefore to make an independent valuer unnecessary. However, I am not
sure that the sale price will always be the market value, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div>because of the way in which the deal is done. I hope that the Minister
is saying that in those cases we would have an independent
valuer.</div><a name="081111106000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000444"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
but it seems a little theoretical. If a clear market price is set
following an auction process that results in the disposal of part of a
failing bank, I cannot see why that price should not be accepted and
transacted. Government amendment No. 110 deals with a different case.
If passed, it would allow the Treasury to appoint an independent
valuer. By allowing us to do that, if we felt it necessary, we would
increase the transparency of the calculations within a bank resolution
fund and help to ensure the adequacy of the fund for human rights
convention purposes. On balance, the amendment should be added to the
Bill, so I invite hon. Members to support
it.</div><a name="081111106000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000447"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Clause 53(3)
states:</div><a name="081111106000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
resolution fund order may confer a discretionary function on...a
Minister of the Crown...the Treasury...the Bank of England,
or...any other specified person.&#148;</div>
<a name="081111106000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why should we permit a
discretionary function to be conferred on any other specified person?
What does that provision have in mind? Should not only a Minister of
the Crown, or the Treasury or the Bank of England have such a function
under a resolution fund order? Amendments Nos. 148 and 149 would remove
the reference to &#147;any other specified person&#148;. I should
be grateful for the Minister&#146;s explanation why it is necessary
to be able to confer discretionary functions on somebody
when&#151;from the point of view of the Committee&#151;it is not
clear who that person would be, even though he or she would be in a
relatively significant
position.</div><a name="081111106000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000448"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I provided an explanation of the purposes and
reasoning behind clause 53 when we were discussing Government amendment
No. 110. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments seek to remove the
power under the clause for the Treasury to confer a discretionary
function on &#147;any other specified person&#148;. I do not think
that is appropriate. The bank resolution fund order may include a role
for a number of persons. For example, as the hon. Gentleman indicated,
the Bank of England, as set out in subsection (3)(c), will have a
management duty placed upon it. The Treasury, under subsection (3)(b),
could be required to pay additional compensation if there were a
successful challenge that the bank resolution fund had not met ECHR
requirements for adequate compensation.</div>
<a name="081111106000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition,
other persons such as an independent valuer, an independent auditor of
resolution costs or a monitor of fees can also play a role in a bank
resolution fund, so instead of listing all the persons who may have a
discretionary function conferred upon them, subsection (3)(d) of clause
53 allows the Treasury to confer a discretionary function on
&#147;any other specified person&#148;. It is an important part of
making the clause effective, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will seek
leave to withdraw his amendment.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div><a name="081111106000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
provide a little more detail. Specific functions are conferred on
appropriate persons under compensation orders and third party
compensation orders. For example, the independent valuer must conduct a
valuation exercise to determine what, if any, compensation is payable.
An appointing person must appoint an independent valuer and the
monitoring person must monitor the remuneration and other arrangements
of the independent valuer. The compensation scheme order may also
confer functions on appellate bodies to hear an appeal as regards any
determination of the independent valuer. As such, it is not necessary
to confer any other function on any other specified person. However, in
the case of bank resolution funds it is impossible to specify precisely
the functions a specified person may have to undertake under the bank
resolution fund. A detailed provision  in the Bill would be
inappropriate. We therefore considered it prudent to take the power to
enable the Treasury to confer a function on &#147;any other specified
person&#148;. I hope that is helpful in explaining the intention
behind the
provision.</div><a name="081111106000244"></a>

Gauke:</b> Although I am sure the Committee is united in its
belief that otiose is a splendid word, subserviate is not. At least,
that is the view on this side of the Committee. I certainly could not
find it in the dictionary. My amendment identifies only one use of it
but it creeps in not only in subsection (5) but also in subsection (6).
If the Minister is inclined to accept amendment No. 150 and change the
wording from &#147;subserviate&#148; to &#147;subordinate&#148;
the requirement and so on, we will call it a score draw. He can have

between &#147;subserviate&#148; and &#147;subordinate&#148;. I
urge the hon. Gentleman not to press his amendments, but I will
certainly take away the question of whether &#147;subordinate&#148;
is a clearer use of the English language and should appear in the Bill,
or whether we need &#147;subserviate&#148; or something else that

(1) of the clause refers to persons &#147;other than a

me&#151;is that such persons will be pre-transfer creditors and
shareholders. I tabled the amendment partly as an attempt to seek
clarification as to whether that is correct, or whether there is
another form of third party that might be paid compensation. If my

be slightly more specific in the legislation, and I should therefore be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s
views.</div><a name="081111106000259"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000458"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause allows the Treasury to make third
party compensation orders for all transfers under the SRR powers. Third
parties can be creditors or other contractors with the bank. The third
party compensation order can either be part of a compensation scheme
order or bank resolution fund, or be a separate order. The order may
also include provision for an independent valuer and valuation
principles, as discussed under the other compensation
clauses.</div><a name="081111106000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
aim of the clause is to ensure that all relevant third parties in both
initial and onwards transfers can be compensated for compensatable
interferences in their property rights, arising from an exercise of the
stabilisation power. The hon. Gentleman has proposed a probing
amendment to specify that third party compensation orders should apply
only to pre-transfer shareholders and creditors.</div>
<a name="081111106000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is not appropriate, as its effect would be to make the clause
too restrictive on the question of who should be counted as a third
party for the purposes of compensation. In particular, it would exclude
third 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>parties that have contracted with a bank once it is a bridge bank or in
temporary public ownership, and have their rights disrupted as part of
an onward transfer. To comply with the ECHR provisions, compensation
provisions need to be made for all persons who suffer a compensatory
interference in their property rights arising from the transfer. I have
explained the background to the clause and its purpose, and I think I
have answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question about its scope and
the need not to exclude third parties that have contracted with a bank
once it is a bridge bank or in temporary public ownership, so I hope he
will withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000462"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have some general comments to make about the
clause, so I shall be as quick as possible on the amendments, which
relate to subsection (2). Amendment No. 152 attempts to tighten up the
wording. Currently the clause refers to the Treasury having
regard</div>
<a name="081111106000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to the
desirability of ensuring that if a residual bank is wound up after
transfer, pre-transfer creditors do not receive less favourable
treatment than they would have
received&#148;.</div><a name="081111106000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggest that the Treasury shall ensure that happens. Amendment No. 153
simply clarifies that the reference to &#147;it&#148; in the last
line of the subsection is the residual bank that has been wound up. I
think it is a stylistic point, unless I have misunderstood the
clause.</div>
<a name="081111106000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000463"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause provides a safeguard to give creditors
a degree of certainty about how they will be treated should they be
left in the residual of a failing bank following the exercise of the
property transfer powers to transfer some of the failing bank&#146;s
property, rights and liabilities. We have already discussed how that is
an important safeguard. In effect, the clause provides that the
creditors remaining in the residual bank will receive on the winding up
of the residual bank, at a minimum, what they would have received had
the whole of the bank gone into insolvency. Of course, through the
mechanism of the bank resolution fund creditors may receive more than
they would have otherwise received, but the clause provides that they
shall receive no
less.</div><a name="081111106000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
second purpose of the safeguard is to ensure that a partial property
transfer does not create de facto depositor preference in insolvency.
The Government remain committed to the existing insolvency priority
rankings 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column452" />Column number: 452</div>and do not propose to introduce a regime of depositor
preference. The clause ensures that a partial transfer of depositors
from a failing bank will not have the effect of preferring those
creditors transferred out.</div>
<a name="081111106000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">To provide
context to the amendments proposed by the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire I shall briefly set out how the safeguard will work,
while pointing out that we are currently consulting on the draft
regulations and that matters may change as a result of the
consultation. Following a partial transfer, creditors remaining in the
residual bank will have a claim on the assets that have not been
transferred. Realisations from those assets will be distributed by the
bank administrator to the creditors in line with the standard
insolvency priority order. In certain circumstances the payment
received by those creditors may be less than they would have received
if the bank had gone into an insolvency procedure. In such situations,
the clause will provide a mechanism whereby affected creditors may
receive compensation for the amount by which they have been made worse
off as a result of the exercise of the stabilisation tools. That amount
will be calculated by an independent valuer  and will involve
an estimation of what realisations would have been made had the whole
bank been  wound
up.</div><a name="081111106000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the purpose of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s first amendment
is to require the Treasury to ensure that pre-transfer creditors do not
receive less favourable treatment than they would have received had the
bank been wound up immediately before transfer. The clause as drafted
requires the Treasury to</div>
<a name="081111106000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;have regard to
the desirability of
ensuring&#148;</div><a name="081111106000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
that is the case. It has been drafted that way on purpose. The
regulations made under the clause will put in place a procedure to
ensure that no creditor will be worse off. That procedure will include
calculating hypothetical insolvency of the failing bank. Given the
necessarily counterfactual nature of the calculation, it would not be
appropriate for the Government to commit in statute to ensuring that
creditors are no worse off under that procedure than if the bank had
been wound up, because it is not possible to know definitively what
that would mean. Therefore, the language&#151;appropriately, I
believe&#151;has been drafted in less concrete
terms.</div><a name="081111106000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are
committed to providing adequate compensation to creditors to ensure
that the safeguard is effective and provides confidence to creditors
who invest in banks. I believe that the Government&#146;s provision
under the clause and the draft regulations, on which we are consulting,
provides that confidence.</div>

Financial Services Compensation Scheme elsewhere in the Bill. There is
a question about the interaction between the third party compensation
regime and the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. I am probing
whether it is appropriate that regulations affecting the Financial
Services Compensation Scheme should be made in  clause 55, or
whether that fits slightly oddly in the
circumstances.</div><a name="081111106000357"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000470"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Clause 55(6)(c) and (d) provide that the payment
of compensation to creditors is to be made by either the Treasury or
the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The hon. Gentleman has
suggested that the FSCS should not be required to contribute to the
cost of providing that safeguard. Let me explain why I do not agree
with him.</div>
<a name="081111106000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe as a point of principle that the financial services
sector, through the FSCS, should contribute to the costs of the SRR for
two main reasons. First, where intervention is necessary to prevent the
cost to the wider economy of a failure of a bank, there is a strong
argument for banks to contribute to that cost. Banks in the financial
services sector more widely benefit directly from the achievements of
the SRR objectives, particularly the objective of enhanced financial
stability and confidence in the banking system. It is entirely
appropriate, therefore, that the sector should contribute to measures
that achieve those objectives.</div>
<a name="081111106000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
but for the use of a resolution tool, the financial services sector
would have to fund the cost of compensation to depositors arising as a
result of the failure of a deposit taker through the FSCS. Therefore,
it is also entirely appropriate that the Treasury may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div>provide that the banks should contribute to the cost of compensating
third parties arising from an exercise of SRR tools designed to address
a failing bank. As we will discuss when we reach clause 157, safeguards
have been put in place to ensure that the FSCS can contribute to the
SRR only up to the amount that it would have had to pay out to
depositors had the bank entered
insolvency.</div>
<a name="081111106000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point about regulations on FSCS funding being made
at this point in the Bill rather than later is a technical one, but I
will certainly consider it. On a broader point, the Government have
responded to strong stakeholder pressure from the banking industry and
others for safeguards to be provided for partial transfers and for them
to include compensation to creditors made worse off following a partial
transfer. That compensation is a legitimate resolution cost because it
is a necessary cost arising from the exercise of a resolution
tool.</div>
<a name="081111106000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
in responding to consultations on that provision the banking industry
has consistently opposed our plans. It argues that the cost of the
resolution should be met by an acquiring company or the insolvent
bank&#146;s estate, but we strongly believe that the industry, before
taxpayers, should be called upon first to contribute to any shortfall.
There is a fundamental issue of principle in that regard. I appreciate
the probing nature of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendments, but it
will be up to him to decide the official view of the Opposition in the
matter.</div><a name="081111106000291"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000474"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As I am sure the Committee is aware, major
financial firms do not tend to operate as single legal persons.
Instead, they are organised as groups, generally with a single ultimate
parent company and any number of subsidiaries, which may be organised
into distinct sub-groups. Corporate entities within those groups are
connected through shareholdings but are likely to be connected in other
ways as well. Bank holding companies may have hundreds of subsidiaries.
Members of the Committee should note that Northern Rock was an
unusually simple bank in terms of corporate structure, in that the
holding company was the deposit taker and the bank had very few
subsidiaries. There is no &#147;general rule&#148; about how banks
organise themselves or, in particular, where they locate their systems.
Some banks&#146; systems are split between subsidiaries; others are
all located in the holding company or a particular subsidiary. For
example, the holding company may employ all the group&#146;s
employees or a specialist subsidiary may provide IT services to the
whole
group.</div><a name="081111106000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we have discussed before, the scope of the special resolution regime is
restricted to deposit takers and does not include other financial
institutions such as investment banks. I have said that the Government
are considering what powers are needed in relation to other firms, but
they do not generally consider it appropriate to extend the scope of
the resolution regime beyond the deposit-taking class and that includes
other non-deposit-taking firms in the financial group in which the
deposit taker sits. However, we recognise that there are arguments for
extending the scope that need to be considered in due
course.</div><a name="081111106000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is possible that the deposit taker may not be operational on a
stand-alone basis. It may require the provision of essential services
from other companies within the group, such as IT systems. If that is
the case, removing it from the group will not lead to an effective
resolution, as the deposit taker will no longer be able to function
without the provision of those intragroup services. The aim of the
pre-insolvency tools is to preserve continuity of banking services.
That aim cannot be met without a functioning bank. Therefore, specific
provisions are needed to deal with such a situation. The Government
consider that the most appropriate solution for successfully resolving
deposit takers that form part of a group of companies is to take powers
to place general and special continuity obligations upon group
companies of the failing bank. Those obligations will be restricted to
ensuring that services and facilities continue to be provided to
businesses
transferred.</div><a name="081111106000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
group of amendments comprises a collection of generally technical
amendments to the continuity obligations. In broad terms, the
amendments do two things. First, they provide the authorities with the
flexibility to remove a general continuity obligation that has
arisen&#151;in some circumstances it may be appropriate for that to
occur. The provisions of the special continuity clauses already provide
for the termination of the special continuity obligation, therefore new
clause 18 brings the positions of the two types of obligation in line
with each other. Secondly, they make changes to the consideration that
must be paid to service providers. If a former group company provides a
service, for example IT support, to a deposit taker, an appropriate
amount should be paid for it. There is a difficulty, however, in
characterising an appropriate amount in terms of a market
rate.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div><a name="081111106000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
normal circumstances, the forces of supply and demand would work to
determine the market rate and it is likely that in normal circumstances
such a rate would be an appropriate amount to pay. For example, the
deposit taker could solicit bids, through a tender process, for the
provision of a particular service, and following an open competition,
could select the service provider that offered the best combination of
product and price. Such a process is clearly not suited to the
circumstances surrounding the resolution of a failing bank; we have
already discussed the fact that action needs to be taken urgently. Once
the business is transferred, it is essential that services continue to
be provided to ensure that the deposit taker remains operational from
day one. That is necessary to ensure that depositors retain access to
their accounts, for example. There is likely to be insufficient time
for a transferee to arrange for new servicing arrangements. There will
be one choice: to continue with the same services as
pre-transfer.</div><a name="081111106000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, bank systems are often highly bespoke to the particular
business that they support, so it is highly unlikely that a deposit
taker would be able to find and organise an alternative supplier for
essential services at short notice. Given that the deposit taker would
not be able to take advantage of substitute service providers, a former
group company that supplies services is likely to be in a position of
relative power. That position could be used to charge a ransom rate,
because the deposit taker would have no choice but to accept that rate,
given the lack of
alternatives.</div><a name="081111106000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
that reason, the Government have tabled amendments to remove references
to &#147;market rate&#148; and &#147;market terms&#148;. We
propose instead that service providers should be paid a
&#147;reasonable consideration&#148;. Government amendments Nos.
122 to 127 provide for that. In addition, new clause 17 provides that
the Treasury may, by order, specify matters that are to be or are not
to be considered in determining what amounts to reasonable
consideration.</div><a name="081111106000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take the opportunity to advise the Committee that the Government will
table further technical amendments to clauses 57 to 60 on Report. Those
will amend the provisions to ensure that they work in situations in
which different parts of a bank&#146;s business are transferred to
different transferees, and in which some or all of a bank is
transferred to an onward transferee. It is crucial that we get the
detail right and that continuity obligations can work in the widest
range of potential resolution scenarios. We tried to prepare the
amendments in time for the Committee&#146;s scrutiny, but that has
not been possible. I apologise to the Committee for that, but I wanted
to draw hon. Members&#146; attention to those additional technical
amendments so that they do not come as a surprise. I should also inform
hon. Members at this stage that the Government are considering whether
further reserve powers are needed to deal with banking groups where the
holding company is not an authorised deposit
taker.</div><a name="081111106000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
continuity obligations that I have just described provide measures to
allow the authorities to deal effectively with circumstances in which
transferring the deposit taker out of a group may not allow for an
effective resolution of the deposit taker. There may also be situations
in which transferring just the deposit taker in a financial group,
while successfully resolving that firm, could create a further threat
to financial stability. Such circumstances may arise if there are other
parts of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>group in financial difficulty whose failure would pose a risk to
financial stability. They could also arise if the transfer of the
deposit taker led to the failure of the group within which it sits,
which is most likely if the bank provides essential services to other
parts of the group. That could create a separate risk to financial
stability, particularly where the other group companies are financial
firms.</div><a name="081111106000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
such circumstances, the most appropriate solution may be for the
authorities to seek to resolve the group as a whole, rather than
focusing on the deposit taker alone. The Government have been
considering whether such a power is necessary and have come to
recognise that it may well be. We will continue to keep that under
review in the immediate short term and will introduce further
amendments if necessary. As I have said in a number of
contexts&#151;for example, when we discussed investment banks last
week and in the debate on foreign branches&#151;the Government
continue to keep under review options for action in respect of
financial institutions other than deposit takers. The work on group
holding companies is part of that process. Returning to the amendments
at hand, I hope that they will be incorporated into clause 57 and other
areas of the Bill as
appropriate.</div><a name="081111106000310"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="081111106000475"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> We appreciate some of the difficulties with the
Bill&#146;s original wording. Indeed, the London Investment Banking
Association highlighted in its written evidence on the Bill some of the
difficulties with regard to clause 57(4) and (6) working together. I
can see that, to some extent, the Government are seeking to address
that concern. I also note that this is work in progress, in that
further technical amendments are to
follow.</div><a name="081111106000358"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="081111106000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I have an instinctive suspicion of the term &#147;reasonable
consideration&#148;. I can see the difficulties created by the use of
&#147;market rate&#148;, but with regard to reasonable
consideration, the consideration tends to be what two parties reach
agreement on. The idea that a third party can determine what is
reasonable in an abstract way could cause difficulty in a range of
contexts. Will the Minister elaborate on how &#147;reasonable
consideration&#148; will be reached? I have a slight concern about
the amendments, but we do not intend to oppose them, and subject
perhaps to that further clarification, I raise no particular
objections.</div><a name="081111106000312"></a>

approach can be found in a number of places in the Bill, but it is not
