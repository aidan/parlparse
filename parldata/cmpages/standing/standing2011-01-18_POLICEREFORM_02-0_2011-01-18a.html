Good afternoon, everyone. May I start by asking the question that I
asked this morning? Obviously, we have an important Bill before us. All
of us are united in the desire to improve the ability of the police to
tackle offending and also to reduce reoffending. As a start, could each
of you say how you think the proposals in the Bill improve the prospect
of reducing crime and reoffending, or say whether there are aspects of
it that in your view may be a hindrance to that objective, which we all
have?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000086">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">
                           <em>
                              <strong>Ian
Loader:</strong>
                           </em> There are three reasons why, broadly
speaking, I am in favour of the principles that animate this Bill.
First, the idea that you think about policing reform under the rubric
of a notion of democratic accountability is, broadly speaking, one that
I favour. It seems to me that, if you look back over the history of
these matters over the last half century, we have gone through a period
where we thought that professional police officers knew best and it
could just be left to them to get on with things as they saw fit. We
have gone through a decade or so of trying to run the police from 10
Downing street, and a broad move to try to reorganise the police under
the rubric of local democratic accountability seems to me to be
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly, I
think that, as a matter of democratic principle, local policing
priorities should be determined by a body or bodies that are
democratically accountable to local citizens rather than by unelected
public officials. This Bill goes some way, although not all the way, in
that direction for reasons that I could go on to discuss. Again, the
idea that that democratic responsiveness and decision making should be
local rather than national is one that I broadly support.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
third reason why I think that the idea animating this Bill is a good
one, which has to do with the state of our political culture. I do not
need to tell the people in this room that Britain’s political
culture and its institutions are at a low public ebb in terms of trust
and confidence. In that context, you can either go on as you have been
going on before or you can seek to experiment with new ways of trying
to reconnect politics—broadly conceived—and public
services with the public. In that context, it strikes me that this
proposal, the commissioners proposal, is best understood as an
experiment in local democracy. You can think what you like about
experiments in local democracy; I happen to think that experiments in
local democracy are, broadly speaking, a good thing.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000089">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having said
that, I will say one more thing and then I will stop. If I was starting
with a blank slate and I was trying to give practical effect to those
principles, I would not have gone with the commissioner model. One
reason is just the scale; it seems to me that it is hard to say that a
commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, or for Thames Valley, can be
described as “local” in any meaningful sense. There are
other ways in which you could have done this. It might have been better
to try to replicate the Mayor of London model, but of course 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 48<a class="bkMark" name="Column48">&#160;</a>
                           </div>the problem with doing that is that the police boundaries and local
authority boundaries are not coterminous outside of London.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000090">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My personal
preference would have been for locally elected police authorities, but
the Government have chosen not to go down that road, and we are where
we are. Broadly speaking, the principles that animate the Bill are the
right ones, but I am not convinced that this is the best way of giving
practical effect to them. Although, given that that is where we are,
there are things that the Committee may want to attend to in terms of
how one mitigates the potential risks and maximises the potential
advantages.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000091">&#160;</a>

                           </em> My answer is not dissimilar. The proposals have
the potential to better connect policing with the people that it serves
locally. The risks that Ian mentioned are in ensuring that local is
properly represented locally, that the full mission of policing, which
involves many things that are not visible or clearly obvious to local
people, is properly taken into account and that there are proper checks
and balances in how the accountability system
operates.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000092">&#160;</a>

Muir:</strong>
                           </em> I agree with both those contributions. We need
to strengthen local accountability in policing, so I certainly do not
support the status quo. I have argued that local accountability needs
strengthening largely because police authorities are not visible enough
and not connected enough with the priorities of local people to perform
that role
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
we need to distinguish between the different questions here. One is a
question of formal accountability, which is proposed to be dealt with
at force level. The other question is the issue of the responsiveness
of the police, which is a wider issue. Actually, that is the issue that
the public are most concerned about. They are concerned about whether
the police are responsive to their concerns. If they ring up, do the
police respond quickly? Do the police deal with their problems
adequately? The commissioner model does not tackle the whole set of
issues around responsiveness, which is key to improving public
confidence in the police. Those issues are dealt with at the
neighbourhood, town, borough or city
level.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000094">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
it is important to sort out formal accountability, because you
essentially need someone to hold the chief constable to account. If we
have chief constables, and if we have forces along the lines that we
have them at the moment, you need somebody to set the priorities and so
on. So I am in favour of strengthening accountability. Rather like Ian,
I do not favour the commissioner model, because introducing an elected
element to the force level is quite remote from local people’s
concerns, because some forces are very large. There are also risks
involved when you hand power, particularly in policing, to just one
individual.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000095">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
first preference was to do something involving strengthening the
accountability of the local police to local government. I know that
there are issues of coterminosity—we are all familiar with
that—but I think that there was a way to do it. I would have
preferred to go down that track.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000096">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My second
preference would have been for an elected police authority, and only
then would I have gone for the police commissioner model. So it is not
my ideal model, but it is right to strengthen local
accountability.

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to move
the debate on. It seems that there is a tension, because you have a
police and crime commissioner responsible for policing and yet part of
what we are talking about is reoffending, which is criminal justice. I
am not sure what the role of the police and crime commissioner would be
with respect to that. It is dangerous to go down the route of the
commissioner’s being in any way responsible for any sort of
influence on the criminal justice system. I know, however, in terms of
confidence and what happens locally, that how the criminal justice
system responds after the police have done their job has as big an
impact. Do you have any comments on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000099">&#160;</a>

more responsive. A lot of the issues with that system are around
ensuring that, for example, offender management is more locally managed
and more integrated into local services. That is very important. I do
not think that that should be done at the level of the police
commissioners. I think that would work much more effectively if it was
done with local authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000100">&#160;</a>

with the formal end of the criminal justice system, and the other is
with the local authority end of community safety. To be successful, the
commissioner will need to build bridges with both. As Rick has said,
the softer end of the formal criminal justice piece is probably the
most important. I do not think this would necessarily be about
connectivity with courts or Crown Prosecution Service decision making.
The parts of the criminal justice system that are more about deterrence
and local punishment seem really important, and the commissioner would
need to make those connections. Again, that will be made very difficult
by the scale the commissioner will be operating
at.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000102">&#160;</a>

better one, first, because policing is not the Mayor’s only
responsibility, so there is a connection between the Mayor and other
strategic priorities. The broad principle—there are some
suggestions that this is amended in relation to the Bill—that
some elected figure is responsible for setting strategic priorities and
policy direction for a public service seems to be at least one of the
ingredients you want to have in place to generate more citizen-focused

accept the points that have been made about scale, and what follows
from that is that that arrangement is not the only thing that needs to

principle. It also seems to be one of the mechanisms through which you

are interested, I think mayors are really important. One of the
challenges for many of us would be how the commissioner works not with
a single mayor, but with multiple mayors. Again, to consider the
public’s point of view, the public are looking for local
figureheads, and there is room for confusion. With a force like West
Midlands, mayors have been proposed for Birmingham and Coventry, and
they will clearly be very significant figures. There may be a public
identification issue about where the police and crime commissioner
fits, when that commissioner does not have a clear territorial mandate
in the way that mayors have in Wolverhampton, Walsall and so on. The
issue about mayors is perhaps slightly at a
tangent.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000109">&#160;</a>

Democratic accountability is obviously a serious issue. While the
notion of having it at a lower level might be attractive—to take
the example Chris Sims gave of the west midlands—would the chief
of the west midlands be happy if your operational commanders underneath
you were answering to a democratically elected mayor or some other
individual, and how would that cut across your own command in the
force? In the end, given that we have 43 forces on the existing
boundaries, does not somebody have to appoint the chief, set the budget
and the priorities, and should not that person answer
democratically?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000117">&#160;</a>

the question that you asked. The point is about what is necessary and
what is sufficient. A mechanism of democratic accountability at some
level—given that we have Thames Valley, and Devon and Cornwall
police forces, and chief constables for those areas—is a
necessary ingredient for making the police more responsible. But a
single figure? Partly, it is about trying to take a view across the
force and think about resource allocation decisions between very
different parts. Take the Thames valley, where I live. The policing
needs of Woodstock are not quite the same as the policing needs of
Witney or Slough. It is about taking some kind of strategic view of how
resource allocation decisions are made. At the same time, it is not
going to be the be-all and end-all. You don’t necessarily expect
a police commissioner for Thames valley to have their finger on the
pulse of the particular policing needs of the boroughs of Slough or
Reading. You need to ensure that there are mechanisms that get at that
element of local responsiveness. It might well be that that is where
members of local police and crime panels play a very important role in
making this work on the ground.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000118">&#160;</a>

                           </div>there are potential advantages in doing that: in generating interest in
elections, in generating informed local public debate about policing
priorities and in having a commissioner who can develop a certain
amount of knowledge, expertise and experience in relation to that
public service. Those advantages come with potential disadvantages,
such as the severing of some very important linkages between local
police representatives, between crime and disorder reduction
partnerships and between offender management services.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000119">&#160;</a>

the Government have taken the view that you cannot write in detail how
those mechanisms are supposed to play out from the Home Office, other
than saying that there will be a statutory responsibility to develop
those connections and that it is for the commissioner to decide how to
do that. That comes with a risk. There may be commissioners who mess
that up and who get it wrong. Hopefully, there is a mechanism in place
on the ground to make sure that they do not. Let us not, however, get
away from the fact that making sure those connections and relationships
are developed and work on the ground—they might look different
in different places and that might just be fine—will be crucial
as to whether this proposed reform delivers the improvement in local
policing that the Government think it
will.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000120">&#160;</a>

local democracy and that its genuine intention is to try to address a
perceived deficit in democracy, accountability and policing, how
successful do you think it will be? If you end up with umpteen elected
mayors dealing with one chief constable, one commissioner with,
presumably, a whole host of councillors underneath, who may well have
their own, much more localised, views about what should happen, what
are the risks of democratic confusion? How, given the Bill that we

                           </em> I think there is a risk of that, particularly
with the new mayors that are being proposed in the major cities. The
key thing is that these are all figures with a direct personal mandate.
We know that the Mayor of London is a significant figure. We saw that
with the issue around Ian Blair’s position. A person with a
personal mandate has a huge amount of power and legitimacy. If you have
mayors in the cities representing smaller areas, and they have to work
with this police commissioner, who also has a personal mandate, there
is the potential for conflict. That is why I would have rather done
this at a smaller level—at the borough, town or city level,
rather than at the force level—and worked through local
government to try to do that. Then, some of these new mayors would have
had a much greater role in policing. As Ian was alluding to, all the
evidence shows us that the connection at the local authority between
the police, the local authority and all the other services, through
CDRPs and so on, is very important in reducing crime. That is why I
think accountability works better at that level than at force
level.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000122">&#160;</a>

                           </div>people who sit on the police authorities that we currently have are of a
strong calibre. In the Netherlands, they have a system with a series of
local mayors, who all set their local policing priorities, and there is
a regional structure where all the mayors from the local area sit
together and hold the regional force to account. That would have been a
much more attractive system, which would have integrated things much
better at the local level than the proposal in the

strong. It is a significant role and mandate—for example, under
the Mayor of London. I wanted your view on whether having one person
makes that person more accountable. They are elected, so the public can

themselves into this position. One reason might simply be that in a
world of celebrities and culture, people will be more interested in an
election for an individual than an election for a committee. If you
want to generate public interest and debate on the elections,
you’re better off doing it like this than generating an elected
police authority. I can see that there is logic to that.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">You can also
see the logic in creating a job where people have sufficient
authority—and, let’s face it, a certain amount of
power—as it will attract people of a certain calibre, who want
to do it and develop expertise and knowledge in the policing field.
That might be all to the good. However, with it come certain risks. One
is dislocation from the locality. That is why we have the local police
and crime panels. That relationship is going to be important. You might
also say that there is an oddity in creating a figure to make the
police accountable, then creating another body to make that figure
accountable to them. It can create that sort of problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000126">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It also means
that the relationship between the local elected police commissioner and
the chief constable is going to be very important to how it works, for
the following reasons. There are all kinds of advantages in holding
elections around policing, as I have indicated. There are also certain
attendant risks—basically, you may create 41 mini arms races,
with candidates falling over one another and promising that they will
be the toughest on the local crime problems, and that if they are
commissioner they are going to knock the chief constable into shape.
They will promise to do things that, once elected, they cannot in
practice possibly deliver.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000127">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There is also
a risk, it seems to me, that if you hold elections purely around
policing, some of the dangers of what de Tocqueville once called the
tyranny of the majority could manifest themselves big-style. Therefore,
one needs to think carefully about how to create checks and balances in
the system, in the relationship between the elected police commissioner
and the chief constable. I do not think that the Government have got it
right, and it is something that could be improved.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000128">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 54<a class="bkMark" name="Column54">&#160;</a>

chief constable. That seems to me to be a recipe for instability, as
the appropriate checks and balances are in the wrong place.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If I were to
do anything about it, I would remove the power to veto the local
policing plan from the chief constable. If you are serious about making
policing democratically accountable and placing the strategic
priority-setting goals in the hands of an elected figure, the chief
constable should not have a veto. You might want the chief constable to
be closely involved, and you might want to include a statutory
obligation to consult, but I do not think you need to go so far as a
veto, especially if the veto comes with the attendant risk of being
sacked for exercising the veto. I would remove that veto, but I would
stiffen things.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000130">&#160;</a>

another worry, it is that there will be a bit too much coming and going
of chief constables. That is not the best way to get those checks and
balances right. What you want, it seems to me, is an elected public
official who sets the strategic priorities, and a chief constable who
can say on the basis of their professional authority and expertise,
“I don’t think this will run,” or, “You
can’t do this,” or, “You can do this, but it
won’t reduce crime,” and so on, without fear of being
removed. I think that you need to find a way of putting in place a few
more substantive safeguards in relation to the power that the
commissioner has to remove the chief constable, because I do not think
that that balance is in quite the right
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000131">&#160;</a>

The most important safeguard that I would look at is not about local
matters and performance, but about ensuring that there is a balance in
delivering the full requirements of the police force. The strategic
policing requirement, which sits as part of the proposed legislation,
is potentially the most important part. As ever when you talk about
policing, we focus, inevitably, on the local and the uniform, and most
of the plan tends to be about that. However, a great deal of my
resource is, quite properly, directed at the high-level, sensitive
areas of the policing mandate. They are not visible to the public and
are, quite properly, not part of everyday discussion, but it would be
absolutely disastrous if they were squeezed out by an over-emphasis on
locality. The real and biggest question for me is making sure that
there is a proper balance in the national part of policing delivered by
the 43 forces and the local part of their mandate. If we lose that
balance, I think it would be a really dangerous place to
be.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000133">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There are 3.5
million people unregistered to vote in the UK. The Electoral Commission
has done research into what type of person is unregistered. They are
black and ethnic minority people, young people, people who live in
social housing and council housing, people who live in houses of
multiple occupation and people in deprived areas—in other words,
the very victims of crime who we are talking about and whose lives will
be influenced by the legislation we are passing.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Those people
are not even on the register to vote, so in considering the task of
exciting them to vote, the Electoral Commission will have to go back
one step further. At a time of central Government
cutbacks—electoral registration funding is not hypothecated; it
is up to local government to decide how much money it puts in
there—there is a need to look at the issue of registration,
otherwise you may get the tyranny of the majority or the tyranny of the
registered versus the unregistered.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000148">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I also think
that there is a desperate need for the Electoral Commission to give
ward-by-ward figures to local town councils, county councils, Assembly
Members and Members of Parliament on what the registration rates and
levels of turnout are in their ward. At least if they are armed with
those figures, they can say that they need to strengthen this voice in
this ward because they are unregistered or they do not turn out to
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000149">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We need to
excite those people. The Electoral Commission has failed to do that
over the past five or six years, despite the fact that there are new
powers under the Electoral Administration Act 2006. In addition,
despite the fact that there has been tens of millions of pounds of
extra funding, registration rates have not greatly improved. So give us
your views please on registration, the Electoral Commission and
ensuring that they are not
neglected.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000150">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I agree with the tenor of what you are saying.
It is important for the reason you gave surrounding the question of who
the victims of crime are. Within police force areas, there are likely
to be more victims of crime in deprived areas and most offences are
likely to take place in those areas. They also tend to be areas that
have lower turnouts at elections and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000152">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As part of
that, we do not want to end up in a situation where, for example, an
elected police commissioner has an incentive to focus on those parts of
the force area that are more likely to vote and turn out at elections
than others, because they are likely to be the more wealthy areas. So I
do not quite know how you deal with that.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000153">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clearly,
boosting registration is one way of doing it. Of course, chief
constables and sensible police commissioners will want to make sure
that everybody in their area gets a decent policing service and that
there is not an electoral tendency to police the leafier areas because
they are more likely to vote. I do not know whether it is likely to go
that far, but there is some risk of that.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000154">&#160;</a>

Loader:</strong>
                           </em> I think you raise an important issue. It is
clearly something that the Electoral Commission must take seriously. I
think the question of turnout for the elections will be very important
to the credibility and legitimacy of the people elected to be
commissioners. If we get to the point where it is going to happen,
clearly a great effort needs to take place among the political class in
general to encourage as many people to turn out as
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000155">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Having
said that, some of the issues that you have raised may not be ones that
can easily be dealt with between now and May 2012. It raises an issue
that Rick alludes to. There is a danger that if you democratise local
policing, it will start to drag resources away from those areas of
towns and cities where the need for policing is greatest because levels
of crime victimisation are greatest. In this context, you can deal with
that by trying to make the elections as representative as possible. You
can also deal with it by trying to think more imaginatively about what
kind of office the elected police commissioner’s office should
properly be.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000156">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
possibility is to treat them—I was going to say “just
like an elected politician”, but this is the wrong room in which
to say that. You treat them as someone who will stand on a manifesto,
get elected, think that it is their task to implement the manifesto for
the next four years and get themselves re-elected in four years’
time. You could supplement that by treating the office—I think
that there is a real case for this—as being not just about doing
that but about being a kind of fulcrum and a catalyst for organising
citizen engagement and public deliberation around policing issues, so
that reaching out to those very constituents who are not registered
becomes part of the job of being an elected police
commissioner.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000157">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">If you
want to make sure that that happens, rather than just relying on those
who are elected to do it, I think the way to do it is to put in place
much more stringent and robust consultation stipulations when you think
about what the commissioner has to do before they come up with a local
policing plan. That would be, I think, a better way of getting at the
problem you have identified than hoping that the millions of people who
are not registered to vote suddenly get themselves registered so they
can take part in a police commissioner’s election.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000158">&#160;</a>

an interesting comment about how you would adjust your operational

of a commissioner is that they make some electoral commitments about

interface between my operational control of the force and the political
input of the commissioner is through the agreement of the policing
plan. That is why it is so important that it is an agreement rather

                           </em> There are two tensions running through this
discussion. They seem inescapable. They cannot be wished away; it is
not as though they are being invented by the Bill. One is a tension
between some kind of democratic accountability and input on the one
hand, and a chief constable or any other police officer’s
professional judgment on the other. The other tension is between what
you call a policy decision or a strategic priority and what you call an
operational decision. It is just a myth to think that you can somehow
write all that down at this moment and wish all such problems
away.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">They
will be problems, and the wager the Bill is making is that we put in
place mechanisms for making sure that such things can be managed and
worked through on the ground. You can probably do no better than that,
other than to make sure that the Bill puts in place an architecture
that has the appropriate checks and balances to enable the commissioner
to say, “I’ve been elected on this mandate. You need to
do this” and the chief constable to say, “That’s
nonsense”, or “That goes against 30 years of my policing
experience”, or “I don’t think it’s good
for you to take away a policing resource from this problem to that
problem because this is a problem here”, without being sacked.
That seems to be the nub of it. You cannot come up with some document
that says what is policy in operations, what is input and what is
professional judgment. You have to put in place the right kinds of
political arrangements that make it more likely that these things are
going to be worked out for the good of citizens on the
ground.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000179">&#160;</a>

am not so convinced that a pilot is what is needed here. When I said
that I thought this was a democratic experiment, what follows is that
you treat the whole damn thing as an experiment. You need to be
prepared to see what is working and what is not working as it unfolds
and to rectify mistakes as and when they arise. It may be that, for all
kinds of reasons, democratically

Bill that is completely silent on that. The argument was first whether
you should try to define “operational independence”, and
what was said was, “No, that’s a bad thing.” The
operational independence of the chief constable, Mr Sims, is
fundamental to the democracy of our country, yet we have a Bill before
us that is a leap of faith. It does not define operational independence
at all because it is too difficult, or we are not sure that we can do
that. The Select Committee on Home Affairs then looks at the issue and
says, “Instead of operational independence, what we need is a
memorandum of understanding, because it will give the protection that
is paramount if the chief constable is to operate as he sees fit, and
not do things because the police and crime commissioner says he
should.”<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000185">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
the Committee does not have a definition at some point soon, we need a
draft that gives us an indication of what a memorandum of understanding
would look like. Otherwise, the Committee and Parliament are being
asked to make one of the most fundamental changes to how the police
service in this country is governed without any idea of what a
memorandum should be or what a definition should be. I therefore ask
both witnesses whether they think the Bill should say something more
particular about operational independence. Should we have something
more in primary legislation about what a memorandum of understanding
should include, so that we are much clearer about what the police and
crime commissioner and the chief constable can or cannot do, and about
that division? Otherwise, the sort of situation described by Mr Mills
and Dr Huppert will happen all the time. What do the witnesses think
the Bill should do to resolve that fundamental point, which goes to the
very heart of what we are discussing?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000186">&#160;</a>

widely held by the Association of Chief Police Officers—that an

two of the constituent parts that would be important. I have already
mentioned the strategic policing requirement, and that should be rooted
in the code of practice, so that the national and inter-operability
issues are absolutely squarely part of the deal, and not simply a
reference point. The other player, I think, in this is the chief
inspector, Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary. Let us
not forget that HMIC, the third member of the tripartite accountability
structure, is the Home Secretary’s adviser on policing. Where
there is a log jam between chief constable and commissioner—and
we must be careful that we are not creating an expectation of that; I
still go into this with an optimism that this can be worked through,
but let us go with the scenario that we have created—HMIC has a
really important part to play as the one that can validate the
professional judgment and take a view above, potentially, the two
parties, to help create the agreement that is required. I think that
should be a code of
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000188">&#160;</a>

whether you need some kind of code of practice, or memorandum of
understanding. I may not be clever enough to work this through, but I
am not quite sure what would go in it. What is animating that is the
idea that you can legislate for all this, so that on the ground,
everything will run totally smoothly. As it happens, I think that on
the ground, mostly the relationships will work out reasonably well. All
kinds of facts will shape that. Even if you are an elected police
commissioner, if you are sensible, you do not go around publicly waving
your mandate in the face of the chief constable, provoking them to
disagree with you. Chief constables in this country are still
sufficiently symbolically powerful figures to ensure that publicly
falling out with them is not a smart bit of business if you want to be
re-elected in four years’ time. None of that is an argument for
not getting the right checks and balances in place, but I think that is
the best that you can do, rather than try to prescribe in detail what
is possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000197">&#160;</a>

going round the policy/operations track for about 25 years. I am just
about old enough to remember when the Greater Manchester police
authority wanted to abolish the police band, and Jim Anderton said that
whether chief officers blow a trombone or not is an operational
decision and nothing to do with the police authority. There are so many
difficulties. It seems that everybody is clear—and the
legislation does not allow it—that nobody wants an elected
police commissioner to go round telling chief constables,
“Arrest x, y and z,” or “Police demonstrations in
this kind of way.” The job is principally limited to the setting
of strategic priorities in a plan. That does not mean that there will
not be conflict between the chief officer and the commissioner on what
should properly go into that plan, and what it means in terms of the
allocation of resources. That is what democratic politics is
about—finding mechanisms for trying to enable that conflict to

a similar mandate: put more police on the streets. Day one, they are in
their job, they sit down with Chris or the other 42 chief constables,

on which I have been elected, to get more police out on the beat. I

mandate is to demand of me, as chief, a style of policing that
maximises street presence. There is absolutely no problem with that at
all. Developing and sharing a plan with the commissioner to explain how
I am going to enable that to happen raises no problem. If the
conversation then gets into, “I want two people in that car
instead of one” or vice versa—absolutely not. I must have
the ability to deploy my people, because professionally that is what I
have been trained to do. In that example there is a clear

on a mandate—it was in his manifesto—to put uniformed

First, was he formally able to do that, or was such a decision an
operational matter for the commissioner of the Met? Secondly, did he
not sit down with the commissioner of the Met and decide that that was
a good idea, which meant, therefore, that the mandate did mean
something, even if it formally crossed that barrier on operational
independence? <em>[Interruption.] </em>No, the new

                           </em> I think that I disagree with what the chief
constable said. It is a policy issue. One of the motivations behind
doing this is that in decades gone by, people would find out that
things were happening, such as their local police stations were closing
down, and they had no say over them. There was this move away from more
visible policing towards patrolling by car. Neighbourhood policing was
a political plan that was

			Column number: 64<a class="bkMark" name="Column64">&#160;</a>
                           </div>agreed nationally, but it is exactly the sort of thing that can be done
at a local level. We know that the neighbourhood policing plan set out
what the policing teams would look like; that was a political priority.
They would have chief constables and police community support officers
and all the rest of it. If you write that into a three to five-year
policing plan, that is fine as a policy
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000214">&#160;</a>

Yes, there was a national discussion on neighbourhood policing and some
agreed national models that ACPO drew up, but its operation was driven
by 43 chief constables. Each force has its own policy. It is a good
example, because the spirit of it is appropriately driven as a national
structure, but operating it as a policy has to be part of the
deployment of resource and sits with the chief
constable.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000215">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But there is an historical essence in there, which
Rick alluded to, which was that 10 to 20 years ago, there
was a policy-type decision to put police in cars, because it was
thought that the chance of them walking down the street and catching a
burglar in practice was about the same as winning the lottery. It was
seen as a waste of police resources, so they decided on rapid response.
The police retreated from the streets. Then the public said,
“Actually, we think that there is a deterrent effect in them
walking down the street that might prevent that burglary, so we want
them back on the street.” That is where my point comes from. We
have a lot of people standing on this mandate of, “We want to
get the police back on the streets.” I am interested in
Ian’s views on that.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000216">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The other
example I would use is the Tony Blair knife crime summit. A senior
politician called all the chief constables to No. 10 and said,
“Politically, I want something done about knife crime.”
Is that not a legitimate use of political pressure to interfere with
operational independence? You might argue that we need to do something
about knife crime, but as a politician, you want something
done.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000217">&#160;</a>

It is the difference between setting a strategy and controlling the

street crime initiative, and I led nationally on its co-ordination. At

with you that none of this is new. I think that that must be right,
but, listening to Commissioner Burley, there is a risk that his
expectations are very different if he believes, and Rick Muir seems to
agree with him, that he can say, “I have a mandate to say that
you won’t patrol in pairs, because this would be a better use of
resource.” You think that may be the case. What if he also
thinks that you do not all need stab vests, or you do not all need a
particular piece of equipment? Is it not just as reasonable for him to
think that that is an efficient use of resource? Is that not slightly
different from your usual problem, because we have created a whole new
institution that expects to have far greater power to demand of the
chief constable what even a Prime Minister could not demand in the
past? Is that not where it is slightly different? There is a huge
expectation of this Bill and of police commissioners and what they will
be able to do. If the Government create them and chief constables
nobble them at every turn, presumably the Government will think that
the Bill has been a
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000222">&#160;</a>

already have local policing plans. So, presumably, such issues must
come up on the ground every time that a police authority and a chief
constable negotiate the local policing plan. To the best of my
knowledge, chief constables and police authorities up and down the land
are not quibbling about whether the use of Tasers on a demonstration,
or having officers work in pairs or wearing stab vests should go in the
local policing plan. There is already a bit of collective wisdom and
experience of doing this
stuff.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000223">&#160;</a>

is changing—we should not underestimate this, because it is an
important change—is the author of the policing plans and the
mechanisms through which those people get into the position they are
in. In other words, we are electing them directly. That gives them a
connection to citizens. Presumably, therefore, they will have the
disposition to say, “I can do this, because I have been elected
to do it”. That does not currently

the risk of repeating myself, I think it is more valuable not to think,
“Oh no, how do we get the policy-operation distinction to
work?”, but to put in place the right kinds of checks and
balances for the relationship between the commissioner and the chief
constable to enable a conversation, because it will have to be a
conversation, to take place on the ground between commissioners and

of that is related to the things that Chris has said—all that
stuff about a lot of effective policing being invisible and, therefore,
not being a vote winner. We have to find a way to inject that into the
discussion of local policing plans, but there is a crunch. If people
cannot agree, who makes the decision? For my money, it should be the
elected police commissioner, and I think that is what democracy is
about. Along the way, you want to ensure that the elected police
commissioner is involved in a close and sustained conversation with
chief constables. The Bill has not gone that far. Perplexingly, the
Bill gives the chief constable a

                           </div>counts as strategic. We have already done that. I was in the police 20
years ago. I was driving a police patrol car, and we went through the
exact scenario that we have just talked about. I was told I was going
to be patrolling singly, and if I was out on the street I would be
patrolling singly. It was all about raising awareness and making people
think that there were more police out there than there really were. The
difficulty was the operational problems that that brought up.
Patrolling singly meant that there were many things that you could not
do. You ended up in situations in which you needed back-up, so you drew
in another car. With two cars tied up, suddenly you had real
operational problems. There is, therefore, an operational element to
such situations, which needs to be discussed. You cannot prescribe
exactly how you will deal with that, so I completely agree with
you.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000227">&#160;</a>

                           </em> I guess I differ from Ian on the code of
practice. Having a code of practice would be important, because we have
muddled along in a very British way, without defining operational
independence for the past 50 years. There have been various judicial
decisions, which have framed how people see the roles of the chief
constable and of the police authority. It is all about balance between
professional judgment and independence, and democratic accountability.
We are shifting the balance towards democratic accountability by having
that personal mandate.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000228">&#160;</a>

could do and what the commissioner’s role was. As we are doing
that, it is worth erring on the side of caution. It would be best to
set out and flesh out a bit more what sits under the different roles.
Erring on the side of caution, I support the ACPO proposal for a code

                           </strong> Yes. Thank you. That links to a point that the

                        <p class="tabbed">People are
right to say that the police and crime commissioner will, essentially,
focus on local priorities in order to be elected. To be fair, the
Government have recognised that. Somewhere along the line, chief
officers in the police service have told Ministers that that is a real
issue, hence we have clause 79, which introduces a strategic policing
requirement. Does the panel agree that the requirement does not go far
enough?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
understanding of the clause is that the chief constable must have
regard to the strategic police requirement that is published by the
Home Secretary. Would it not be more effective if it were not only the
chief officer who had to have such regard, but also the police and
crime commissioner? I know that the police and crime commissioner can
advise on what should be in the strategic requirement, but that is not
the same as being required to have regard to it once they have done so.
The Home Secretary is saying that these are important strategic issues.
What are your views on whether requiring the police and crime
commissioner as well as the chief constable to have regard to that
would help to overcome some of the difficulties? People are promising a

crowds roaring, but then they are saying, “What are you doing
about domestic violence, sexual violence, human trafficking,
counter-terrorism, fraud, economic crime, and so on?” If I have
read the clause correctly, would that be the sort of amendment that
would find favour with you?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000233">&#160;</a>

                           </em> That would be helpful. I almost take the
position that that particular part of the Bill cannot be too strong. It
is not just about dealing with the serious end of the policing mission;
it is also about working cross-boundary, and collaborating tactically
and strategically. All that needs to be part of a framework in which
the commissioner must set decisions. Is it right that, as soon as you
have elected someone, you have codes of practice that bind their
behaviour? That is your issue, not mine.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000234">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is right
that it would be catastrophic if the commissioner took office and
believed that there were absolute local scope with the resources that
sit within the force, and that nothing mattered other than putting
officers out on street corners and so on. Somehow we have got to think
of a mechanism that ensures recognition by both chief constable and
commissioner of the need to balance between the service and protection
ends of how we
operate.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000235">&#160;</a>

disagreement for a start—it would set out the expectation that
policing isn’t just about vehicle crime, burglary and all this,
but about all the other things that we know it’s about. We know
that one of the great gaps that we still have is the regional level and
the cross-border stuff, so that would be fine. It would mean that

around the houses with a bit is how you get in the local links and
accountability when you have one person with a larger region. It looks
like the police and crime panels are the fix for that in the Bill. It
looks to me to be positive that you are bringing an individual from
every district council into this, which is a bit of progress from the
police authorities, which can be made up any old how, as far as I can
tell. Do you think that has gone far enough and got the balance right,

think their balance is probably about right, although I have not given
the question as much thought as it clearly deserves. They will clearly
be important in making sure that one gets that relationship between the
commissioner and local force areas. But let’s be clear also that
that’s not the only relationship that will matter

it is the only opportunity potentially for people in Coventry,

unclear to me whether the police and crime panels have been designed to
scrutinise the work of the commissioner or hold the commissioner to
account, or what the role of the police and crime panel is. I do not
understand where the idea of two independent members rather than what
the police and crime panel thinks is appropriate has come from. I do
not understand what powers the police and crime panel has, other than
the very limited powers in the Bill. It has a power on
appointment—not to say anything about the sacking, the
commissioner can just sack the chief constable without reference to
anybody—and a power to veto the precept, and all of that on a
three-quarters majority. It would seem, from the size of the majority
and the limited powers that the police and crime panel has, that it is
not regarded as something that is there to do very much.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000245">&#160;</a>

                           </em> Scrutiny or accountability? I think both,
really; that would be my view. It is very important. We have the chief
constable, who has operational responsibility, and the commissioner,
who sets the priorities. I think you would want the panel to scrutinise
both, because there will be operational decisions that the chief
constable makes that politicians should not decide but will want to
scrutinise afterwards, such as how an operation has been run. In many
ways that happens now; there is post-hoc scrutiny of decisions and
reviews, and that would be useful
from—<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000255">&#160;</a>

there might be some confusion, because the local authority has a
scrutiny role, particularly around community safety, which the seven
local authorities I work with exercise. I do not think that they would
want to give that up in favour of the panel.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000256">&#160;</a>

of this has to be worked through. The panel feels like a really honest
attempt to root the commissioner in the locality and create stronger
links between local authorities, where they are multi-local

there is a series of specific functions, but probably not enough about
the general role.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000257">&#160;</a>

at the moment, whether the local panels will have some kind of limited
scrutiny role in relation to the commissioner—in which case,
apart from anything else, you might struggle to find people who want to
go and sit on them, rather than do other things—and whether you
can find ways of actually trying to sew them into mechanisms for
delivering accountable local policing. The trick is clearly to do the
latter and not only the former. I am unclear, at the moment, whether
the Bill’s provisions do enough to ensure that what happens on
the ground is the latter and not the
former.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000258">&#160;</a>

members. Because I am a democrat, I think that these functions should
be performed by elected people. I know there are arguments; people
always say, “These are some of the best people on the police
authority, and it is very important for diversity,” and all the
rest of it. Those are considerations, but it is a democratic body. If
we want more diversity, it is up to political parties and others to
ensure that they are putting forward a diverse range of candidates and
so on. I do not really buy the argument for independent

members have added an awful lot to police authorities, in terms of
skills and representation. It almost goes back to the previous question
about understanding the role of the group before understanding its
composition. The democratic challenge, which, again, I do not fully
understand, is the ability of the commissioner seemingly to appoint
people to undertake significant roles. Of all the pieces in this, the
least democratic seems to be the ability, once elected, simply to
choose people that you are going to get to do stuff. That is what I am
not sure about.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000261">&#160;</a>

I perhaps move on to the provisions around clause 140, and ask for some
advice about those? Police officers have the right to use reasonable
force—effectively state-sanctioned violence—and
presumably have an extensive period of training in order to do so.
Could you comment on how hard it is to judge reasonable force, how much
training is required and how appropriate it is for non-police officers
to do such
things?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000282">&#160;</a>

reasonableness is that it takes into account the training, and the
context in which the decision is made. What would be reasonable for a
trained officer is different from what would be reasonable for an
untrained member of the public. Ultimately, it is the court that makes

Chris, have you ever found it tricky to walk the line between doing

some other thing that is topical. Have you ever struggled to stay on
the right side of that line? Have you ever felt that you might have
made a mistake and crossed

boundaries sit. Not everyone might agree with my definition, but I have
always been really clear about that. I have dealt with some politically
contentious areas—not least when Mr Coaker was in
office—around DNA, which is a reasonable example. I have always
been clear that it is not for the police to determine retention
periods, but it is for us to advise Ministers on consequences and the
manner in which legislative change is made. I think that that is a
reasonable example of where the issue is very politicised, but a police
officer has to understand what the proper boundaries

to do that, because that is what gives the commissioner some teeth, but

about treading this political line, which I suppose builds on what you
have just said? If we were to see a number of chief constables either
sacked or choosing to go early as a result of well-publicised
difficulties with their commissioners, would that suggest that the
political line had been shifted by this legislation? Would that be a
reasonable
conclusion?<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000306">&#160;</a>

balance is shifting towards what you could call politicisation. One
person’s politicisation is another person’s
accountability; they sort of amount to the same thing. It is all about
balance, and about the safeguards and how that works out. So, yes, we
are shifting a line. Do I think that it is more likely in this context
that there will be more fluidity and more changes of chief constables?
I think probably yes, but I do not think it is going to be dramatic. We
are not going to see it increase vastly, but over the course of years
we probably will see a bit more mobility, because we have created this
new dynamic in the systems.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000307">&#160;</a>

                           </em> There is a particular issue that I raised with
the Select Committee last week, which is one of timing. The most
difficult year we face is 2012-13, in terms of the financial challenge,
and that year creates an overlap of governance that will present a real
challenge about how the police authority, and then the commissioner,
takes a long-term, concerted view about some of the decisions. That
apart, it is really important that both the commissioner and the chief
constable adapt really quickly to a world of much more limited
discretionary choice in the way in which policing is delivered. Any
commissioner who stands on an agenda of novelty and growth will find
quite a difficult opening few months when financial circumstances
determine that a lot of that is not going to happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000310">&#160;</a>

the potential advantages of this being a police-limited public office
is that it precludes making a populist move and saying, “I am

the current environment, one needs to be cognisant of the costs of all
of this. People need to be careful that they are not throwing money at
this reform when it could be more usefully spent elsewhere. At the same
time, if you are going to make this work on the ground, you have to
make sure that when commissioners are in place, they have the kind of
staff that makes it possible for them to do their job effectively. I
sometimes think that, basically, people throw the “why are you
spending money on this in a time of austerity?” argument around
because they think that something is a bad idea, and that is a stick to
beat it with. If they think that something is a bad idea, they should
argue the case on its merits, and not use that

world where policing is run from Whitehall and targets are set in
Whitehall. We all know the problems with that. The previous Government
moved away from it and went towards the single confidence target. It is
right that all parties are now moving away from that kind of central
interference in local policing, which creates all kinds of
inflexibilities. It does not work. If you are going to move away from
it, you have to have some kind of locally accountable figure or figures
about whom the public can then say, “If crime goes up in
Manchester, it is their fault. Let us not go to the Prime
Minister.”<a class="bkMark" name="1101196000322">&#160;</a>

accountable people whom the public can hold to account at that level.
