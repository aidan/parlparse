the RDAs on to the face of the Bill, an impact assessment will be
produced to cover RDA abolition, assuming that the Government
amendments are accepted. It will set out the economic rationale for the
abolition of the eight RDAs as a whole, excluding London, and will
cover the costs and benefits of abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000017">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Quangos were set up on a regional level covering
administrative areas that seemed very removed from the community level
or constituency level that we represent. We are trying to encourage
voluntary partnerships to form at a much more local level. It is right
to try and focus the discussion on how to encourage economic growth and
development at a much more local level than at the regional level. That
is the whole reason underlying the new model—the power shift
that I am talking about, away from central Government and quangos and
towards local communities and local business, because we think that
they really understand the barriers to growth in their areas. We are
also working to try and ease the transition from over-reliance on the
public sector through the regional growth fund. The regional growth
fund is a £1.4 billion challenge
fund—<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000020">&#160;</a>

Minister said that he anticipated some degree of opposition to this
particular proposal from Opposition Members. Did he also anticipate
opposition from the former Deputy Prime Minister, the noble Lord
Heseltine? He said that scrapping RDAs was a mistake, that they acted
as a bridge between localities and Whitehall and that Departments, such
as the Department for Communities and Local Government, were building
vast empires in the regions. What assessment has the Minister made of
those
remarks?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000021">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have the greatest possible respect for Lord
Heseltine, and he is entirely entitled to his view. I have no idea when
that was expressed, because I do not know the quote. I know that he is
actively involved in the delivery of the regional growth fund, and I am
delighted about that. It is a £1.4 billion challenge fund, which
aims to stimulate enterprise by providing support for projects and
programmes with significant potential for creating long-term private
sector led economic growth and employment.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I would like
to make one thing clear. LEPs are part of the post-RDA landscape, but
they are not the whole picture. LEPs may, if they wish, choose to
undertake similar activity to those previously carried out by RDAs.
Other continuing RDA activities are moving to be co-ordinated at
national level, but they will often be delivered at a local level,
bringing in local partners and city regions. A good example is foreign
direct investment, which is still delivered locally on the ground but
co-ordinated nationally by UK Trade &amp; Investment, which will build
links with LEPs, local authorities, business organisations and city
regions as they promote and attract inward investment. Those continuing
activities were set out in the local growth White Paper, which was
published in October 2010.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000023">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> LEPs are not a straight replacement for RDAs. As I
have said, they are free to assume some of their functions, but the
hon. Lady has missed the fundamental point. RDAs cost a fortune. The
previous Labour Government reduced their funding, not least because a
strong body of opinion suggested that they simply did not add enough
value for the £2 billion that was being spent on them. We
propose a model of economic development that is much more local to
communities, allowing partners to come together and tackle the barriers
that they see locally. Speaking through the prism of my experience in
my constituency, the RDA felt a long way away, and the value it added
to our community seemed extremely limited. This is a different model,
which certainly does not replicate RDAs.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000025">&#160;</a>

An independent evaluation by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed that for
every £1 spent, £4.50 was generated in economic output.

previous Labour Government, although she was not part of it at the
time, significantly reduced the budget to RDAs by about £300
million in the last financial year. Clearly, some people at the
Treasury were not entirely persuaded that the investment in RDAs was
producing as big a dividend as possible.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000027">&#160;</a>

statutory bodies. It is up to each individual LEP to decide what its
priorities are for economic growth in its area. Under existing plans,
LEPs will not deliver statutory functions on behalf of the Government,

take over RDA
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000028">&#160;</a>

perhaps, complaint—of the business community in Leicestershire
is that LEPs do not have any resources. The city council may be
expected to put resources in, but their budget is being drastically
cut. Does the Minister not accept that LEPs, if they are to succeed,
need

at a time when a great of public money was swishing around the system.
In that process, there was a great deal of laziness with public money
and a lot of it was wasted. That era is definitely over, and I am
grateful for his comments on LEPs. They are local voluntary
partnerships. On resources, I re-emphasise that the
£1.4 billion regional growth fund is a significant
resource to stimulate programmes and projects that have the capacity to
stimulate economic development, so it is not a question of no resources

about that already in Committee. Will he give us more detail about how
that might work? There has to be equity in relation to how those

have developed detailed plans for the disposal of their assets and
liabilities. Parliament has been informed about the proposals that have
already been agreed. Local authorities and LEPs can buy RDA land and
property deemed suitable for sale on the open market, which involves
those assets that have been fully developed. Some local authorities
have already acquired former RDA assets in this way. The Minister of
State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend
the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk), announced in July
that RDA land and property assets that are in need of further
development would be transferred to the Home and Communities Agency
under a stewardship arrangement. That will allow local partners,
including local authorities and LEPs, to influence the development of
these assets.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000041">&#160;</a>

my remarks to a close in order to let the debate open up. We think that
RDAs were expensive to run and often duplicated activities that could
be better undertaken at a national level. Various reports have shown
that some of the work that they did in business support was successful
and delivered a good return, as the hon. Member for Wigan has
suggested, but the regeneration activities were considered to have
delivered poor value for money. The fund that I have mentioned will
ensure a better return for every pound invested. The budgets were
unsustainable in the current fiscal environment and the new model of
economic growth will be more nimble and cost-effective, targeting
inevitably more limited resources where they are most needed. In light
of those remarks, I hope that Opposition Members will feel able not to
press proposed new clause
3.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000042">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It is a pleasure to see you back in the
Chair this afternoon, Mr Robertson. It should be obvious to Committee
members that the new clause seeks to tease out, in opposition to the
Government amendments, some of the problems with the process of
abolishing RDAs. We want to put some common sense into how—in an
ideal world—we would go about abolishing bodies of this nature,
if we wanted to do so, in a sensible way rather than in the way we have
experienced it to date.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Some of us
were really quite shocked to obtain from the Department for Communities
and Local Government, some months after the Government announced the
abolition of RDAs, a schedule transferring the functions of RDAs over a
period of time without any legislative 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 114<a class="bkMark" name="Column114">&#160;</a>
                  </div>mandate in place. In passing, I also query whether the governing parties
have a mandate to abolish all RDAs. Although it was clearly an aspect
of Conservative policy in advance of the 2010 election, it was not at
all clear that the Liberal Democrats would take that action. I have
some concerns about that as well, but on the matter before us today, I
want to make some points about how the whole process should be managed
and about some of the grave problems emerging in some areas due to how
the Government have gone about abolishing
RDAs.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
problem depends on where you are coming from. For example, my
constituency is in the north-east. It is widely acknowledged across the
business and other sectors that One North East was an excellent RDA
that levered in many thousands of jobs as well as additional funding.
There are now real problems for the region with lack of growth that
partly relate to the running down of the RDA. It was done so quickly
and in such a cack-handed way that lots of problems are
emerging.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000045">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does the hon. Lady acknowledge that the previous
Government gave RDAs the task of narrowing the gap in growth rates
between the relatively prosperous south-east and the rest of England?
It provided them with significant resources to do so and that was the
target they failed to meet.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000046">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> What is interesting about that
intervention is that it ignores the real work done in some regions to
help catch up with other areas of the country. Figures from 2007-08
show that the north-east had the highest number of business start-ups
of any region. Then we were all hit by the global recession, which
meant that when the Government looked at the concrete figures in 2010,
the figures had not narrowed by as much as we would have wished. It is
important to acknowledge the very good work that RDAs did in a number
of areas. If the Government had had proper consultation processes
before deciding to abolish RDAs, I think they would have ended up
wanting to keep RDAs in some areas but not in
others.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000047">&#160;</a>

we take London and the south-east out of the picture, there has been a
remarkable convergence between the different regions. Also, does she

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes a number of excellent
points in support of the RDAs and the regional economic strategy that
was put in place by the Labour Government. It is also interesting to
note that during the debate in the other place, a number of Lords from
different parties said that the abolition of the RDAs was both
“chaotic” and “misguided”. That is one of
the points that we are making this afternoon. My hon. Friend the Member
for Wigan referred to the very low rate of growth and the slowdown in
economic growth in some of the most disadvantaged regions. 
<div class="columnNumber">

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New clause 3
seeks to delay the process of abolition. Labour members of the
Committee recognise that a number of the RDAs are already barely
functioning because their funding has been withdrawn and they are being
wound down in advance of this Bill. There is another point about RDAs
that was touched on this morning. I know from my own experience in the
north-east that, as soon as it was announced that the RDA was going to
be abolished, some of the best people in the RDA, who had brought
industry into the region, left for other jobs, most notably in London.
Perhaps we should put the question back to the Minister—if he
thinks that the RDAs were not very good at narrowing the gap between
regions, what is in place in the current arrangements to ensure that
there is a narrowing of the
gap?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">New
clause 3 proposes that before the RDAs are abolished the Government
should undertake a thorough evaluation of their work; that the
Government should adequately check the preparedness of local enterprise
partnerships to undertake the functions of the RDAs that are being
allocated to them; and that the check should be made in advance of
abolition.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
clearly outrageous that regions should not have growth plans in place
and that the RDAs are being abolished at the very time that we need
growth plans for the regions, particularly the most disadvantaged
regions. It seems particularly odd timing to abolish the RDAs now and I
am not sure that we have heard from the parties opposite why there is a
rush to abolish
them.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
I have said already, since their inception the RDAs have created
thousands of jobs. Interestingly, in that respect they were well ahead
of the targets that were set for them by the governing Department. We
know from the PricewaterhouseCoopers study that for every £1
they spent RDAs levered in £4.50 on average, but that was an
average figure. Interestingly, it was better for the most disadvantaged
regions, and in my own region, for every £1 the RDA spent,
£9 was brought into the region. By anybody’s estimate,
that is a really positive performance and I would be interested to see
whether LEPs, as they roll out, are able to achieve anything like the
degree of leverage that at least some of the RDAs were able to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Crucially,
the RDAs did more than just bringing jobs to particular areas or
levering in money from businesses, because they were able to produce a
coherent economic vision for their region and to assess the local
infrastructure needs on a regional basis. That is particularly
pertinent, because if we are to have economic growth, it will require
proper transport links. I will again use my region as an example. The
RDA was able to assess that there was a problem with the Tyne tunnel,
which was slowing up business development because of the big tailbacks
that business had to put up with. Money was therefore found from a
range of public and private sector partners to expand the Tyne tunnel.
Similarly, plans were in place for widening the A1. It is just not
clear to me how a big infrastructure project like that, which may
extend over a couple of local authority areas, can be addressed under
the current
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
RDA was also a strong voice for business, and it brought together
people from the public and private sectors. It also—there is no
mention of this in what is

looking at the skills needs of the region and ways of addressing that.
It brought a whole range of education providers
together—schools, colleges and universities—to upskill
the local population, particularly in areas that had had a skills
deficit for some time, such as the north-east and
north-west.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000055">&#160;</a>

vital role in regenerating some former brownfield sites. I suspect that
there are similar examples from the Durham coalfield that my hon.

the transfer of coalfield assets to the Homes and Communities Agency,
some of that regeneration will inevitably fall back as a result of the

                  </strong> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point,
and I hope that we can spend a little Committee time on looking at the
transfer of assets, because it looks a bit peculiar. I will say
something about this in a minute or two, but the Minister told us this
afternoon that local authorities would be able to purchase the assets
of RDAs on the open market. The local authority in the area that I
represent would certainly not be able to do that, because it is
receiving a huge cut—£67 million—from the
Government this year, so it would simply not have the finance to be
able to purchase any of the assets. The assets are indeed being
transferred to the HCA, and it is not clear whether they will then be
used for business development or some other
function.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000058">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">It
is fair to ask whether the new arrangements are able to cope adequately
with the variety of functions that were undertaken by RDAs. We need to
hear a rationale from the Government of why those functions are being
split between several organisations. On Thursday, my hon. Friend the
Member for Hemsworth was discussing how the Government have a new zeal
for nationalisation. Here, we see a zeal for centralising that is truly
outstanding. It takes my breath
away.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000059">&#160;</a>

Whitehall and to UK Trade and Investment, so how will we ensure some
democratic accountability in where investment ends up? We also know
that the record of UKTI is good, but it is not a good record for all
regions. It concentrates its activities in London and the
south-east.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000060">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
know that the growth fund is inadequate and is only about a third of
the funding that was available to RDAs. There are several problems with
the operation of the growth fund, about which I will say more in a
moment or two. We also know that LEPs vary enormously from area to area
and that the process of setting them up was completely shambolic. The
deadline for the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 117<a class="bkMark" name="Column117">&#160;</a>
                  </div>initial round of LEP applications came six weeks before the publication
of the White Paper that outlines their form and function.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am not at
all clear on what basis the first round of LEPs were actually agreed.
That has led to the problem that regions such as mine have ended up
with two LEPs and not one, which might have been desirable. That almost
entirely relates to the process of establishing LEPs in the first
place. It is very unlikely that those two LEPs will always work
together in the interests of the region. I am sure that they will work
together where they can, but the system that has been put in place for
bidding for regional growth fund money means that those two LEPs will
often be in competition and not working together to get resources. That
does not seem to be a very sensible way of processing economic
development. I have used the example of the north-east, but I am sure
that my hon. Friends and Government Members will have similar stories
from their
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
criticism of the process does not simply come from the Opposition.
There has also been a hugely negative appraisal from business, which
has highlighted the confusion over the role of LEPs. Businesses have
said that LEPs are hampering business growth and undermining the
Government’s rhetoric about a private sector-led economic
recovery. Local business groups have very vocally and publicly
expressed their concerns. They also say—this is quite
interesting—that there is still a stand-off between the
Government saying, “Get on with it” and LEPs saying,
“Get on with what?” That alludes to the fact that massive
budget cuts have resulted in huge job losses and redundancies in some
of our most affected areas. Therefore, the money is not available to
LEPs. I acknowledge to the Minister that there is a very small start-up
grant of some £5 million to cover all of the LEPs in the
country. However, that is a small amount of money and is just the
start-up
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000063">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
point that the LEPs in the business sector are making is that there is
not the money or substantial enough resources behind the LEPs to enable
them to take on board some of the key functions of the RDAs in terms of
attracting and supporting business at a very early stage of its
development or supporting business through periods of economic
difficulty. We know that that very important function was undertaken by
RDAs. I shall give two examples from my area. During the economic
downturn, Nissan needed some support from the RDA to bring forward its
new generation of cars. That was given by the RDAs through a proper
process, and Nissan now continues to expand in the north-east. Given
that Nissan is a big regional employer, it is not clear to me how the
LEPs would have the ability to support a local business in that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
terms of business start-ups, I have the Printable Electronics
Technology Centre, which deals with plastic electronics, at the North
East technology park just outside my constituency. That involves new
technology and is a bit risky, but it needs sustained investment to be
able to compete with similar processes in Japan. Again, that involved
money that was forthcoming from the RDA. It may be that the Minister
will say that that is what the regional growth fund will do, but we
know that the regional growth fund is seriously underfunded. In any
case, there is no regional strategic input into regional growth funds,
but PETEC could be important to the future of manufacturing in this
country. However, the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 118<a class="bkMark" name="Column118">&#160;</a>
                  </div>regional growth fund does not take that into account in making its
assessment. That is the issue at the heart of new clause 3. We are
saying in the new clause that it was not sensible of the Government to
remove some functions from the RDAs before LEPs had the capacity to do
such work.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000065">&#160;</a>

South East England Development Agency was that it would build things

the Pfizer site has been successful. The same LEP also promoted the
Harlow enterprise zone. There is a sense of movement to create more

jobs and money rather than just talk about
it?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000066">&#160;</a>

points about RDAs seem to come mostly from people in the SEEDA area. I
think that that is because the economy in the south-east had a vibrancy
that other areas did not. In areas such as the west midlands, the
north-west and the north-east, RDAs had an important role that perhaps
they did not have elsewhere.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000067">&#160;</a>

join several LEPs. That might be the route that we go down, but it is

economic sub-region extends across the north Wales border, and there
was no interaction between the Northwest Development Agency and the
Welsh Assembly. It was almost as though a wall ran down the middle of
the economic sub-region. At least LEPs are locally driven and decided,
and local people on the ground can make a decision to interact with
neighbouring LEPs and do something for the sub-region. It is better
than working on a regional basis when some areas of a region are very
different from other areas.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000071">&#160;</a>

favour of how the RDAs might have worked. New clause 3 also
encapsulates our great concern that some of the functions of the RDAs
are not being adequately considered by other bodies. We still have
concerns about European funding, and we need some assurances from the
Minister that European funding will not be put at risk. We also have
some concerns about asset transfer. I note that Government new clause 1
states in subsection
(9):<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000074">&#160;</a>

we have heard what that is likely to mean. The point about transferring
a number of the assets to the HCA is that that does not seem to be
backed by any demand that the land be used for economic development. In
my constituency, One North East held a number of sites that are
strategically important for the region, adjacent to the riverbanks.
Those sites are in the process of being transferred to the HCA but no
one, including the LEP, knows what that land will be used for. It might
be used, straightforwardly, for accommodation, and although that might
help us with some of our accommodation needs, it will not necessarily
be in the best interests of economic development in either the city or
the region. We would like to hear something from the Minister about how
the transfer of assets will be looked at carefully, and whether those
assets will be used for economic development.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000075">&#160;</a>

resources to undertake activities in their area to promote economic
development, and we know that the growth fund is no substitute. In
addition, the LEP strategy seems to lack coherence, and the LEPs seem
to lack the ability to work together regionally to set priorities. We
have concerns about that as well. I am also concerned that they do not
seem to be looking at what skills are needed within a particular area,
and, as I said earlier, that will go beyond the geographical area of
some of the current LEPs. They need to do more to bring people together
and to involve small and medium-sized enterprises. One criticism I
regularly hear is that although SMEs did not always like RDAs, the new
structures are not working any better, which is clearly an issue that

benefit Advantage West Midlands brought to the area was the
Manufacturing Advisory Service. Between 2002 and 2009, it helped 5,000
manufacturing companies in the area and improved manufacturing
efficiency. Chamberlin &amp; Hill is one of the firms that has been
helped by the Manufacturing Advisory Service, and I have nominated it
to the associate parliamentary manufacturing group, Made By Britain.
The company makes this fantastic structure that is used for
turbocharged engines. It has brought back the manufacture of these
little structures from India and China and it is making them in
Britain. Amazingly, the company will now have a turnover of £5
million. These structures will enable us to meet the European directive
on reducing our emissions by 60%. They will go into each engine.
Members may not know this, but Porsches have turbochargers. Every car
will have them and they will reduce emissions. The Volkswagen Golf has
them at present. The Manufacturing

                  </div>Advisory Service helped the company to take away the manufacturing line
and build a learning centre, so that workers got lots of
qualifications. That is what Advantage West Midlands did for the
company. It was efficient, too. Contrary to what the Minister has said,
for every pound that was invested, £8.14 was generated in the
local economy. That is a huge amount. It was efficient in other ways,
because administrative costs, which I know Members are exercised about,
only amounted to 7% of the total budget. That was amazing.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000083">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
organisation is closing on Monday, and many good people are leaving. It
is not recognised that some people carry on in their posts, even though
they know the organisation is to be abolished. That is public service,
Mr Robertson—to me, that is someone who carries on with their
job, despite the chaos all around them. That is what those public
servants have done. As I have already mentioned, the Prime Minister
said it was one of the top-performing RDAs. That worries me, because it
reminds me of when former Prime Minister John Major would say that he
had every confidence in a Minister—and then the next day the
Minister would resign. The Prime Minister says that this is a wonderful
organisation, as he has done with the NHS and is doing with the
RDAs—and then the next day it has gone. I am concerned about
what might happen if he starts praising us.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000084">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Some
£975 million was given to Advantage West Midlands, but only five
projects have so far received money. That is worrying. A constituent
told me that, under the current chaotic arrangement, money promised to
him and agreed by the RDA had been stopped. He was told by the body
administering the funds the he has to show growth. How could the
company grow unless he was given the money to make it grow? That is the
sort of difficulty going on
now.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000085">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Does my hon. Friend accept that Advantage West
Midlands was not only engaged in promoting manufacturing but had a
wider role in the region? That is what was important about regional
development agencies: they had a strategic overview. In an area such as
Telford, the agency was not only supporting manufacturing but investing
heavily in tourism. It provided significant funds to the Ironbridge
Gorge Museum Trust for redeveloping one of its major sites, which
brings hundreds of thousands of tourists to the west midlands every
year. It also supported estate-based regeneration projects, building
centres to promote skills and development in learning in parts of my
constituency and, I am sure, right across the region. RDAs had a wider
strategic overview; it was not just manufacturing, even though that is
incredibly important in the west midlands. The RDAs had an overview
that was strategic and important in a number of
sectors.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000086">&#160;</a>

how European funds are to be accessed. Clearly, the RDA had a link and
role in that; how is that going to happen on a regional basis? It is
important to show that. It is nice to see that there is movement and
growth in the west midlands. However, I feel that that is all going
now, given the uncertainty. I would like to pay tribute to the

                  </strong> I am troubled by being on the same side of the
argument as Michael Heseltine. As far as I am aware, that has never
happened to me before. I suppose in the spirit of coalition politics, I
ought to accept it. However, I absolutely agree with the remark he made
in <em>The Times, </em>referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member
for Leicester South: that the abolition of the RDAs and the
announcement of just over a year ago was a real mistake and will have
serious consequences for the people I and my hon. Friends represent.
The uncertainty that surrounded the announcement caused absolute chaos.
I was contacted by my own north-west development agency, which was
completely confused by the statements coming out of Government. There
were statements about the future of RDAs from the Secretaries of State
for Communities and Local Government and for Business, Innovation and
Skills that appeared entirely at odds with one another.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000088">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I made the
point earlier to Ministers but I make it again: when there is
considerable uncertainty, the problem is that people start to leave and
projects start to fail. That has been happening for some time in the
agency with which I work most closely. The loss of such expertise is
serious because regenerating areas such as Wigan, a former coalfield
community, is incredibly difficult. It takes many years and a lot of
patience and skill. There were people in the Northwest Development
Agency who had that, but they have now been lost. Whatever decision
Ministers make—and I seriously hope they will think
again—that experience has now been lost and cannot be recovered.
The decision to announce the end of the RDAs had immediate financial
and economic consequences. Much of the progress that had been made over
several years was lost, and the competitive edge that areas such as
mine had started to gain was
undermined.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Conservative mayor of north Tyneside recently highlighted the fact that
900 jobs that Amazon was going to locate in his constituency have been
lost to Edinburgh because of precisely the sort of help that the RDAs
used to provide: such help is now being provided by the Scottish
Parliament. Unfortunately, north Tyneside, an area that badly needs a
boost, is simply unable to compete because of the loss of the work of
the
RDA.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000090">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
importantly, the Northwest Development Agency was working—there
was no reason to get rid of it—because it had a clear and
essential purpose, which was set out when it was established: to
promote economic development and regeneration; to promote business
efficiency, investment and competitiveness; to promote employment; to
enhance skills relevant to employment; and to contribute to sustainable
development. Surely no member of the Committee believes that those are
not the right objectives for the future, particularly for areas such as
mine that so badly need
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000091">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
NWDA delivered on jobs, investment and help for business. Looking
across all the RDAs, 500,000 jobs were created, £1.7 billion of
additional investment was levered in from the private sector and nearly
57,000 new businesses were created in just four years. In the
north-west alone, in 10 years 85,000 jobs were either created or
safeguarded and more than 900 investment projects were
realised.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000092">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">For former
coalfield communities such as mine, such investment could not be more
important. As was pointed out earlier, the regional aspect is
important, and the LEPs simply will not replace it. When the mining
industry collapsed, areas such as Wigan saw the end not only of jobs,
but of a way of life. The loss of confidence that that creates, and the
devastating ripple effect across all cultural, social and economic
life, is enormous. If I had one criticism of the previous Government,
it is that they did not understand quickly enough how long it would
take to rebuild areas such as mine that had suffered such
devastation.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000093">&#160;</a>

powerful, and she is making an interesting point on developing
confidence. The effectiveness of the way in which RDAs operated has
gone somewhat unnoticed. However, we in the north-east had a conference
in 2008 on whether the north-east is becoming more confident. Hundreds
of people attended, and they all accepted that the RDA was critical in
improving confidence not only in business, but in people, their culture
and their ability to get on and build up new businesses. That has been
lost.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000095">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. The picture
she paints could equally portray my constituency. One of the problems
with the proposal is that it relies on the assumption, to which the
Minister alluded earlier, that if public sector intervention and
support is removed, the private sector will somehow spring up to fill
in the gaps. In my constituency, there has not been a large private
sector because of the dominance of the mining industry. As the
Government have pursued this strategy of withdrawing support, as well
as making huge and fast cuts to public services, unemployment has
risen, so those people are having to claim benefits and are not
spending in local businesses. Local private companies are not able to
get the contracts that they used to get from public services. Everyone
is suffering. It is a vicious cycle, in which businesses are going
under, people are losing jobs and people are losing their homes. There
is no growth and they cannot see a way out. That is important, because
with the regional development agency, that investment was not only
provided by the state, but levered in through the private
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000096">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
were so many success stories with the Northwest Regional Development
Agency and I have a book here that sets out a number of them. If
Members on the Government Benches want to read it at some point, I
would be happy to lend it to them. The best known success story of the
Northwest Regional Development Agency is MediaCity, the move by the BBC
of several of its functions and their staff up to Salford. That has
been a terrific boost to the whole area. It has not just been a boost
to my constituents as far away as Wigan, but has had ripple effects all
the way around the region. The Northwest Regional Development Agency
covers an enormous area; it goes all the way up to
Cumbria.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000097">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Many
Government Members, including the Minister, have dwelt on the issue of
efficiency. A 2009 report, “Putting the Frontline First: smarter
government” found RDAs to be among the 25% most efficient of all
Government Departments. I have not looked at where the Cabinet Office
came in that, but the Minister might want to check and perhaps consider
that it is rather odd to get rid of, on the basis that it was
inefficient, one of the agencies ranked as most efficient. A National
Audit Office report in 2006 bore that out.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000107">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I have
already said that for every £1 spent, on average £4.50
was generated in economic output. But in my area in the north-west, the
figure was £5.20. Unfortunately, that is not as much as in the
area of my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall South, but it is still a
stunning return on taxpayers’ money. The Minister said he
thought that the LEPs could do better. If they are going to press ahead
with this—I suspect they will because it is already
happening—will he commit to conducting the same evaluation after
the LEPs have been established so that we can see whether they do
better?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000108">&#160;</a>

I would like to say something about how this happened and why I believe
it to be a mistake. It was announced a month before the NAO published
its evaluation into the RDAs, so Ministers had no time to consider the
evidence. The Newcastle<em> Journal</em> put in a Freedom of Information
Act request and discovered that this decision was taken after just one
meeting between the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.
There were a number of representations from my area to Ministers to ask
them to think again, including from all of the north-west local
authorities, the CBI, the Institute of Directors,  the chambers
of commerce, United Utilities, Bentley Motors, Westinghouse, Manchester
university, Manchester Metropolitan university, the university of
Central Lancashire, Salford university and Lancaster university, to

                  </span> I, too, welcome you to the
Chair, Mr Robertson. If we listen carefully to the Minister and look at
the amendment he has proposed, it is clear that the Government have
made a decision to proceed irrespective of any evidence that emerges or
any consultation or the views of any business group or other sector, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan has persuasively argued. Our
amendment seeks to explore the reasons why those decisions were taken.
The Bill 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 126<a class="bkMark" name="Column126">&#160;</a>
                  </div>itself would have required the Minister to produce a report that
indicated his reasons and demonstrated effectiveness, efficiency and so
on, and to be accountable by means of an order in both Houses. What we
face today is a Government amendment that does away with all that. It
simply places the abolition into the Bill with no
explanation.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000112">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
listen carefully and, as I said the other day, the Minister is a
reasonable man, but he occasionally does unreasonable things. He made
no rational argument in his introduction for the decision he has taken.
It is not a pragmatic decision; it is an ideological decision. The
ideology behind it is that it would be better for the market to
determine where economic activity takes place and that it would be
better for the state or organs of the state to stand back and let the
market run free. He should argue that ideological position, because it
is clearly the position of the governing parties. It is not a position
we
share.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000113">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is not good enough to say that local economic partnerships will be able
to perform some of the functions of RDAs, because the difference
between the partnerships and RDAs is that RDAs recognised that from
time to time it was necessary to intervene in the market to secure
particular economic or social objectives. The local partnerships will
effectively be advocates on behalf of local interest groups and
possibly wider groups too. They will speak on behalf of businesses and
perhaps other institutions, such as universities. They will play an
important role, but the truth is that they will have no
resources.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000114">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
now understand why the Minister wants unincorporated associations in
the Bill as eligible persons. He clearly has my mates in the Brown Cow
in the local village in mind to run them. Perhaps business people will
form partnerships and become advocates for local industry. I do not
think that that is a bad thing. In fact, I think it is very good thing.
We, as politicians, should hear the voice of business and all the other
agencies engaged in economic activity. However, it is important to bear
in mind that there will be incidents of market failure from time to
time that intervene directly in the economic life of the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000115">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
and his Back Benchers have rested their case not on their true belief
in market-led economic activity, but on a critique of RDAs’
practices. I do not believe that is a completely honest argument,
because underlying it is an ideological position. In truth, nobody
would defend every action of every institution, whether state or
private, in society. One could develop a critique of some things that
RDAs did, as I would of Yorkshire Forward in my area. I am not sure
that it spent enough time on coalfield areas such as mine. Perhaps it
was easier to address the problems of Leeds, Sheffield and the larger
cities, which are highly dynamic, than those of the coalfield areas.
RDAs could have done things differently, but the truth is that if there
is a critique of an organisation, the way to proceed is by first
appraising it—making a rational judgment—and on that
basis deciding whether it is capable of reform. That is not the
Government’s approach.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government simply decided after a single meeting, as we heard, that
RDAs have to go. No attempt has been made to argue the case that they
ought to go, other than that the Government believe that some mistakes
were made. No case has been made to show that they 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 127<a class="bkMark" name="Column127">&#160;</a>
                  </div>were incapable of reform. They simply have to go. The Minister may say
that I am not entirely right because there is the regional growth fund.
The regional growth fund is an interesting development, but it is
entirely led by the private sector in that bids are made against the
fund for interventions. In a way, the Government are saying that from
time to time the state needs to help.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000117">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
difference, however, between the regional growth fund and the RDAs is
that the RDAs were obliged to operate strategically across a whole
region, not just in a single locality, and to make regional
interventions according to the priorities that the RDA had established
for the region. I will not say that the regional growth fund is
pitifully financed but it is not adequately financed, and it is not
strategic but reactive. It depends on the next phone call, letter or
e-mail from a business that wants to receive some investment. For all
those reasons, what the Government are putting in place underlines the
ideological assumptions that they are making.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will make
a final point about the nature of strategic intervention and whether it
is possible simply to leave a market to bring about economic activity.
The RDAs were based on the presupposition that from time to time there
will be market failure. Arguably, the economic structure of our country
reflects a degree of market failure, because the truth is that in parts
of the south-east of England there are concentrations—wonderful
concentrations—of economic activity that can become overheated
very quickly when the economy begins to upturn, to the point that the
Treasury has to turn off the supply, even though areas in the north,
the south-west and elsewhere in the country have hardly begun to get
started. Arguably, these regional imbalances are products of market
failure.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000119">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Labour Government understood that and understood that there were
underused resources—in some cases unused
resources—outside the major centres, particularly in the
south-east but also elsewhere. They understood that if we were to get
not only a balanced society but more importantly a dynamic economy
working across the whole country, it was necessary to make regional
strategic interventions. That was what the RDAs were. They reflected a
set of perspectives and an understanding of how our economy works that
are different to the view that is expressed in these measures that the
Government are
introducing.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000120">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The hon. Gentleman makes a forceful argument
about RDAs, setting out how they were designed to focus on their own
areas and improve economic growth. But is it not the case that that
experiment did not work, because the gap between the north and the
south did not narrow? Is that not the core problem that really needs to
be tackled?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000121">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Of course, it is very difficult to know
precisely what happened, but there was a point coming where it was
necessary to make a judgment on the work of the RDAs and to see whether
they were making a contribution to remedying the regional imbalances.
The argument about RDAs should have been, “Let’s have a
careful review of their achievements, see what they’ve done
right and what they’ve done wrong and see whether they are
capable of reform”. That is not the step that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 128<a class="bkMark" name="Column128">&#160;</a>
                  </div>this Government have taken; they have just decided simply to abolish the
RDAs for a reason that I believe has been unstated. The hon. Member for
Dover comes from Kent, so he will know that there are difficult
imbalances within regions, even within the south-east. I am fully aware
of the difficulties in parts of Kent and elsewhere, including in his
own constituency.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000122">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
second example of market failure, which is very pertinent to this
debate. We have seen a sustained collapse of banking investment,
particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises, for reasons that we
fully understand and that I will not debate here. That is the current
situation; it is happening now and it has been happening for some time.
In the absence of banking finance, there is a serious problem for real
business people in the real economy now, and the RDAs were a key source
of pump-priming and sometimes of finance throughout the country. It is
extraordinary, is it not, that at the point that growth appears to be
flatlining—it is certainly not accelerating away—and with
the banks still failing to deliver on the aspirations that all parties
in this Committee have, we should be pulling away one of the primary
mechanisms for providing finance to the SME sector and beyond the SME
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000123">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
Yorkshire, for example, Yorkshire Forward provided 112 loans to
businesses—loans, not grants—securing 1,400 jobs, where
the banks had failed to provide the money. I have an example from my
local authority area, in which the banks had agreed to fund a major
development, Trinity Walk in Wakefield, which would create 1,500 jobs.
The work began and the banks simply walked away, leaving a hole in the
ground, leaving construction workers unemployed and leaving part of the
city centre desolate, with no possible way of finding private finance.
Yorkshire Forward helped the developer to find the money to bring about
the completion of that scheme using regional money from Europe. That
highlights a serious problem, because when the RDAs have gone there
will be no clear agency to enable access to regional funds.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I was not
going to speak on this subject, but it is better to get this
ideological position out on the table to show that there is a
disagreement across the Committee. I suggest to the Minister that it
would have been better to have a pragmatic response and an
evaluation—we would have supported that, and we still
would—rather than simply abolishing RDAs with the risk that some
of the regions will decline in the long term because of market failures
that I have just described.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000125">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> It has been a genuinely good debate. It is becoming
increasingly interesting to witness the intellectual renaissance among
the Opposition and their sources of inspiration. The blank sheet of
paper is gradually being filled out. In previous sittings we have had
Winston Churchill quoted back to us, and Margaret
Thatcher—reluctantly—who appeared again today. Lord
Heseltine has played a distinguished part in inspiring the Opposition;
the Prime Minister has been quoted not once but twice; and even Liberal

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 129<a class="bkMark" name="Column129">&#160;</a>
                  </div>problem that we face. Any Administration would have faced the same
pragmatic problem around sustainability of funding, because there is
simply not enough money to carry on as we were. On top of that, as many
Members have added, there is not enough evidence that that money was
being spent in the most efficient way.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000127">&#160;</a>

say to the hon. Member for Wigan, who spoke very well, that this is not
a casual decision. How could it be a casual decision? We are talking
about a significant amount of taxpayers’ money and a significant
number of people who work in these organisations. We are talking about
a decision on how the Government support economic development at a time
when economic development is absolutely at the top of the
nation’s agenda, because we know how difficult it is at the
moment and how difficult it will stay for a while. We could go into an
argument about how we got into this place, but that would not be in
order. It is in order for the Committee to recognise the very pragmatic
point about sustainability of funding. The old model was simply not
sustainable, so the decision is, in large part, pragmatic. Is there
some ideology here? Yes, I think there is a division. The Labour voice
was for regionalism, but the voice on the Government Benches is in
favour of giving more power at a local community level and trying to
seek more local solutions.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000128">&#160;</a>

powerful speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan. She made
the point that all her local chambers of commerce, and the CBI, were
appalled at the decision to abolish the regional development agency.
One would hope that extensive consultations were made before coming to
the decision to abolish RDAs. Will the Minister outline what extensive

going to address in response to the suggestion that this was a casual
decision. It was no such thing. The hon. Member for City of Durham, who
spoke for the Opposition, made it clear that at least the Conservative
party was extremely clear, and could not have been clearer in its
manifesto when it went to the people, that the RDAs would be abolished
in the event of a Conservative Government. I am not, as I say, the most
well-informed student of the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the last
general election, but I am led to believe that there was a strong
commitment to reform how the Government support economic development.
The decision was not taken casually. The business world and the RDAs
would have been well aware of the Conservative party’s position.
The arguments were extremely well-rehearsed.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The point
about consultation is important. The Government’s amendment is
effectively a change to process, and puts the process in relation to
RDAs in a different situation to the other bodies that we are
discussing. We remain very committed to the consultation requirements
in the Bill, but we have had to accept they would not be appropriate in
the case of the RDAs, given our commitment to abolish those bodies and
the advanced status of the wind-down process. The Department has
therefore reached the conclusion that, given where we are, it is not
appropriate or sensible to proceed with a full consultation process 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 130<a class="bkMark" name="Column130">&#160;</a>
                  </div>on a process that has already started. What we believe is that, because
we gave a very clear signal of intent through the manifesto and many

given.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000131">&#160;</a>

confusion—which I outlined in my speech—the uncertainty

decision is taken it has to be implemented as quickly, professionally
and efficiently as possible. What the Opposition seem to be
recommending—I am happy to stand corrected—is that there
should be further delay. That seems to be a recipe for more confusion
and uncertainty, not least for people working in the RDAs. I will
therefore resist that temptation and say that now a decision has been

There is a difference of view on policy. There is a more localist tone
from the Government Benches and from the amendments. We believe LEPs
have the potential to be very important and have a valuable role to
play. I am disappointed by the scepticism expressed by Opposition
Members. The regional growth fund has the potential to be an important
intervention. I make no apology for it being market-based. It is there
to support and promote the best ideas that are out there, such as the
enterprise zones, the changes to tax regulation, the avoidance of tax
on jobs, or the local growth White Paper. There is a massive agenda in
terms of how we, as Governments, can play a role in stimulating and
supporting the economy, and we have to respect that there is a
difference in
views.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000134">&#160;</a>

did not want to replicate what was  there before? They wanted
something different. As far as I understand it, in correspondence
received by the Government, despite the large number of LEP proposals,
not one has covered a geographical area similar to that of the eight

tried to make the case that this is all about centralising and
renationalising, when it is actually about improving ministerial
accountability and streamlining the bloated bureaucratic
state.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000139">&#160;</a>

that the now Lord Heseltine made when he was Secretary of State. In the

Government offices in the regions, which was done primarily to provide
a local influence and a format to access European funds, alongside
making localised decisions about resources in areas. It was a wise
decision. Does the Minister accept that he is now reversing
it?<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000140">&#160;</a>

the Government expect to save by the abolition of the RDAs? I also draw
his attention to an article by Lord Heseltine in <em>The Times</em> on 23
August, in which he said that it is a mistake to abolish RDAs. He

being transferred to the Homes and Communities Agency will be managed
by stewardship arrangement. The idea is that local partners, such as
local authorities and local enterprise partnerships, will be invited to
sit on local committees that will manage the future development of the
assets. It is imagined that the stewardship arrangement will be
self-funding, so profits from the sale of assets will be reinvested.
Most of the assets will be sold on the open market once they have been
fully developed to bring them to market value.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000146">&#160;</a>

Member for Telford wanted to tease out of me a full cost-benefit
analysis of the proposed reforms. I close by saying again that we have
committed to producing an impact assessment of the reforms, which will
include that analysis. I am assured that the Department will produce
the impact assessment in November. On that basis, I return to the
central argument relating to the amendments. The Government are
committed to the consultation requirements in the Bill, but we accept
that that would not be appropriate in the case of the RDAs. Delaying
the closure programme would be costly and would jeopardise what we
believe—there will be disagreement on this—will be a more
cost-effective delivery of economic development provision.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000147">&#160;</a>

the RDAs is a core element of the Government’s reform of
economic development. We believe that the RDAs were not based on a
coherent economic geography, and that citizens did not really identify
with them. Despite spending large amounts of money, they were not
successful in narrowing the performance gap between the south-east and
the rest of England. Lastly and most pragmatically, the RDAs’
budget was unsustainable. There is simply not enough money to continue
funding them. On that basis, I support the Government amendments and
oppose the Opposition’s.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000148">&#160;</a>

amendment seeks to abolish the office of registrar of public lending
right and enable the transfer of functions of the PLR into an existing
organisation. The Government recognise the importance to authors of the
public lending right. Authors’ right to receive payment when
their books are borrowed from public libraries is protected in law.
That right will continue even if the statutory function of distributing
the PLR fund to authors is transferred from the current PLR public body
to another existing body, effectively abolishing PLR as a separate
organisation.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000151">&#160;</a>

registrar. Furthermore, a cap will be placed on the costs to be
incurred in administering the scheme, affording a degree of protection
to the funds available for making payments to authors. The amendment
therefore simply reflects the reality that there is no longer any
justification for the registrar of the public lending right to exist as
a separate legal entity.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000152">&#160;</a>

               <p>The
statement refers to the Human Rights Act 1998. Whether or not we have a
different view on the Human Rights Act—I suspect we do
not—specific human rights are enacted for children and young
people. Because this is an amendment, it is not clear whether the
Secretary of State has indicated whether, in his view, the amendment is
compatible with the Human Rights Act, particularly in relation to the
rights of incarcerated children. I raise the point now because I intend
to pursue the matter further and first want to know whether it is the
Secretary of State’s view that the amendment has been properly
assessed in light of the Human Rights
Act.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000160">&#160;</a>

Members will be aware that the Youth Justice Board forms one part of
the youth justice system, whose aim is to prevent offending and
reoffending by children and young people under 18. They will also be
aware, as we have already had a flavour, that its future is an emotive
issue, which does not surprise me one bit. We had an excellent debate
in another place, where noble Friends and others were able to express
their concerns and views, and they passed an amendment to remove it
from schedule 1. The Government listened carefully to the issues raised
in that debate and have responded to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000167">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me report the importance of the Youth Justice Board and its work over
recent years. It was established by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998,
and there is no doubt that it has helped to transform the youth justice
system. It oversaw the establishment of local youth offending teams and
has fulfilled an important role in reducing offending and reoffending
by young people, by spreading best practice and helping to make youth
justice a priority for local authorities. It has also driven up
standards in a discrete, secure estate for young people. I again
emphasise that there is no suggestion that that secure estate for young
people will disappear or be merged into the wider prison
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000168">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I have
already said, the Youth Justice Board forms only one part of the youth
justice system. We have listened to the concerns expressed by peers,
and I hope to explain why we propose that the national governance of
youth justice, not its front-line delivery, should be done differently.
The reform is consistent with the Government’s principles of
localism, their drive to reduce the number and cost of public bodies
and their commitment to clarify lines of accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000169">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I am not
going to claim authorship or to be an originator of the Youth Justice
Board, but it was established at arm’s length from Government to
provide strategic leadership and coherence to the youth justice system,
partly in response to a 1996 Audit Commission report “Misspent
Youth”. I was a member of the Audit Commission at that time; I
considered that report when we brought it forward, and my name is on
it. I am familiar with that report, which found at that point that
there was no integrated youth justice system, and that what did exist
was inefficient and expensive. The Youth Justice Board’s
arm’s-length status gave it freedom to establish a radical
blueprint of partnership working, which is key to reducing youth
offending. However, we have had a decade since
then.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000170">&#160;</a>

carefully to the protagonists of that debate to identify their
concerns, to see how their concerns can be met within the proposed new
structure, and to consider how to ensure that that discrete part of the

to the previous Government for having taken on a lot of the work that
was necessary to transform the youth justice system. At one point, it
was a mess. Thanks to the Youth Justice Board and the legislative and
administrative work that went on within the previous Government, that
context has been changed. A coherent youth justice system has now been
established, which is precisely the argument. The necessity for the
Youth Justice Board was to make those changes and it has done that.
What we need to do now is to ensure that the integrated youth justice
function is properly delivered from within Government where the impetus
is no longer on reform of the system to improve it but on maintaining
and continuing the improvement within Government.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000173">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One of the
keys to such work is direct ministerial accountability. At the moment,
there is no direct ministerial accountability; it is at one remove by
an arm’s-length body. There should be a Minister who is directly
responsible to this House and who will answer for the policy on what is
a key part of the justice system. It should be Ministers who determine
the standards required in youth custody. I have difficulties with it. I
know why it was set up in the way in which it was. I was there with the
genesis of the report. None the less, it is not right that unelected
individuals in a non-departmental public body are responsible for
spending £300 million of taxpayers’ money to purchase
secure accommodation. That is not the case with the adult estate. It is
hard to see why it should be the case with the juvenile estate. No such
specialised body exists for securing accommodation for other vulnerable
categories of offenders. That is why the Justice Secretary, in his
written ministerial statement of 23 June, set out his intention to
carry out the core functions of the Youth Justice Board within a newly
created youth justice division. He said:<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000174">&#160;</a>

talks about a new team in the Ministry of Justice. Are new posts being

Minister is aware but there are budget cuts in the Ministry of
Justice.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000177">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Let me qualify what I mean by a new team. There are
some key personnel who are the same people, moving from the Youth
Justice Board to the new division in the Ministry of Justice. I cannot
get away from and will not hide the fact, because the hon. Lady asked a
perfectly reasonable question, that there are budget cuts across the
Ministry of Justice. No part of the Ministry of Justice is entirely
free from the difficulties of meeting deficit reduction measures. It
would simply be an untruth to say to the hon. Lady that there is no
potential for budgetary reductions. Through some of the administrative
savings possible because of the transfer from the separate,
arm’s-length body to the Department, we certainly hope that that
is mitigated in the case of youth offender management in the youth
justice division. It is simply impossible, however, to completely avoid
the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000178">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
significant number of people who currently work within the Youth
Justice Board will transfer en bloc to the Ministry of Justice to
provide the key and core staffing for the youth justice division. Some
180 people in total will make that transfer, but I will go on, because
there are some key people involved who ought to provide a degree of
confidence to members of the Committee about the work of the new
division. I have certainly gained the impression that confidence has
been given to some Members of the other place who had real concerns.
The new youth justice division will be a powerful impetus behind future
improvement, with the policy leverage within Government to effect
change. At a time when Departments have a wide range of priorities and
scarce resources, it is Ministers—led by the Justice Secretary
and the Minister of State with responsibility for the youth
service—who are best placed to lead the youth justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000179">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
said right at the beginning—I repeat it now, because it is
germane to the whole argument—that the reform will not impact on
the delivery of front-line youth justice by the youth offending teams.
Front-line delivery is established locally and is completely separate
from the national leadership and the oversight provided by the Youth
Justice Board. The two should not be conflated. Under the 1998
Act—I served on what was then described as the Standing
Committee on the Bill that became the Act—local authority-led
youth offending teams were given responsibility for delivering youth
justice. We have also established a dedicated, nationally commissioned
secure estate for young people. YOTs are accountable to the chief
executive of the local authority and are well embedded in local
structures. They do an excellent job 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 137<a class="bkMark" name="Column137">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and will not be abolished. Young people will also continue to be placed
separately to adult offenders in a dedicated secure estate that is
driven by their
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000180">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
intend, as I said, to retain the expertise of Youth Justice Board
staff. The Justice Secretary has announced that John Drew, the
board’s current chief executive, has agreed to lead its
transition into the new youth justice division structure and to
continue to lead it beyond that. That will ensure continuity in senior
management. We appreciate that the Youth Justice Board successfully
brought together staff from a number of different backgrounds,
including staff with direct experience of youth justice, social and
health services and police and probation officers. We want to continue
to harness that expertise and
experience.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000181">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Justice Secretary has also recognised the need to strengthen the
Ministry’s focus on youth justice—again, this is part of
the response to the criticisms that were levelled in the other
place—by establishing an advisory board of experts to advise on
youth justice issues and to provide expert challenge and scrutiny. Dame
Sue Street, a non-executive director who brings experience and
knowledge of youth justice, will be taking an active interest in youth
justice within the Ministry and will have a direct route to the
permanent secretary and the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000182">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Other
mechanisms to secure a focus on youth justice are already in place.
Senior officials have established  the cross-departmental youth
crime and justice board, which supports the strategic agenda in this
area.  Regular inter-ministerial meetings ensure that
ministerial representation from the Ministry of Justice, the Department
for Education, the Home Office and the Department of Health supports
cross-Government work on this agenda. The Government have listened and
responded to the concerns of peers and interested parties. They have
provided reassurances about how youth justice will be treated in the
Ministry; who will lead the new division; and how it will ensure that
it retains expertise within, and effective leadership of, the youth
justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000183">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">We
have also made the case for why increased ministerial accountability is
required in this key policy area. A full public consultation is in
progress, and Ministers will carefully consider responses before they
lay draft orders before Parliament. The youth justice system needs
clear and visible leadership from Ministers, supported by a governance
structure that retains a dedicated focus on youth justice. That is what
we have proposed. I hope that hon. Members agree that we share the same
aim in reducing the harm that is caused by young people offending and
reoffending. I believe that the abolition of the youth justice board
and the creation of a youth justice division with direct ministerial
accountability is the best way to help us to achieve this
aim.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000184">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s contribution. I thought that it was curious that
the Bill had been signed off as compatible with the Human Rights Act

that it had been in the Lords.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000185">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">I referred to
the UN convention on the rights of the child, and the truth is that the
clause that I referred to is in the convention for a reason. It is not
to prevent young villains from being treated
appropriately—severely, if appropriate—by the criminal
justice system, but whenever the state decides to intervene in an
individual's life, security has to be provided. Clearly, once one
enters the criminal justice system, it is possible that the consequence
will be incarceration. Certainly, there will be questioning,
investigation and all the other processes, and people will be held
while those processes take place. In relation to young people and
children, society wants to see appropriate punishments when necessary,
but also appropriate safeguards over how the state deals with such
people. That has been recognised internationally by the UN convention
that I have just referred to.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
convention suggests, and I think that the Minister agrees, that there
should be a separation of function, particularly in relation to young
people, between incarceration and the safeguarding of the rights of
those young people, albeit that one accepts that if a young person is a
villain, they ought to be dealt with in the appropriate way. In
establishing the youth justice board as an independent body, the
country decided—I believe rightly—that there should be
some independent oversight of the processes that are carried out in the
criminal justice system. That is the core of this discussion. The MOJ
will deal with the administration of criminal procedure and the
criminal justice system, including the administration of young people
who are incarcerated or held while investigations take place. The
Government propose to place both functions inside the MOJ. That is
where we have a great difficulty with this proposal. I did not hear a
case from the Minister which said that there should be a unification of
the two functions—combining the safeguarding of young people
with the operation of criminal justice—although he did say that
there would be a separate division, presumably run by civil servants
within some sort of external advisory board, that will deal with young
people.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
safeguarding of young people, when they are in the hands of the
criminal justice system, is currently done independently. That is the
point I want to insist on as I go through my reflections. The Youth
Justice Board is an executive, non-departmental body. The Minister made
much of his case on the argument that where money is being spent it
should be accountable to Parliament through the appropriate Minister,
but the truth is that the YJB’s members are appointed by the
Secretary of State for Justice and make recommendations to him on any
conclusions that they arrive at. In all respects, as far as I can see,
those board members are accountable to the Secretary of State, who is
answerable to Parliament on how the criminal justice system operates in
relation to young people. I do not therefore accept the
Minister’s argument that there is a lack of democratic
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000188">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
YJB does a number of things. It oversees the youth justice system in
England and Wales; it works to prevent offending and reoffending by
children and young people under the age of 18; and it ensures that
custody for them is safe, secure and addresses the causes of their
offending behaviour. That last function is the key function, and it
needs to be kept separate from the civil service. The civil service and
the MOJ are obliged to deal with criminal justice as it functions. To
suggest that those same civil servants, even within a different
division but 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 139<a class="bkMark" name="Column139">&#160;</a>
                  </div>reporting to the head of the Department, should be two-hatted is
inappropriate. That they should play both the safeguarding function and
the incarceration function at the same time is wrong. When we are
talking about the liberty of young people, it is crucial that we have
an agency that is independent and capable of exercising that
function.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
YJB is made up of 11 board members and a chair. They are appointed on
the basis of their knowledge and expertise on youth justice by the
Secretary of State. They are a group of individuals, drawn from local
government, children’s services, education and skills, health,
the police, the judiciary and the voluntary sector. They go well beyond
the expertise that is contained within the MOJ. A child or young person
who indulges in criminal behaviour will almost certainly be known for
some time to various agencies of government, both local and national,
to the police, schools and so forth. It is interesting that the YJB
tries to address the issue holistically, to look at all the various
agencies and not just the MOJ playing that particular function in the
administration of criminal justice, to try to address the wider causes
of young people’s criminality. Again, it would be a blow if
those skills were
lost.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000190">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
YJB has an advisory role to both central and local government and all
those other agencies too. It informs and advises the youth justice
policy unit inside the MOJ on policy. Therefore, we know that there is
already a youth justice policy unit inside the MOJ. That is not new,
but the Minister wants to repatriate the function back inside the MOJ,
rather than keep the independence that the declaration of rights I
referred to
requires.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000191">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not want to be disrespectful. I would like to hear the argument made
more strongly than it was in the Minister’s opening comments. It
is not as if the YJB lacks success or is somehow dysfunctional. In
fact, he did not rest his argument at all on bad practice, bureaucracy
or dysfunction. I shall tell the Committee in a minute my guess on why
this is being done. It is not due to a critique of how the YJB
operates. The Committee should be aware that in the lifetime of the
YJB, there was a 45% reduction in first-time offenders in the
particular age group it covers, though I think it would be wrong to
attribute that purely to the YJB. The frequency of reoffending by young
people was reduced by 27% in the same period, and the number of
under-18s held in custody at any one time was reduced by more than 25%.
The National Audit Office 2010 report on youth justice praised the work
of the
YJB.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is hard to see an argument, first, on grounds of
independence—the point I began with—or, secondly, on
grounds of function and how the function is carried out. The Minister
has not said, “This is a bureaucratic monstrosity.” He
simply said, “I would like increasing accountability,”
but there is already accountability, as I have described.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When the
proposal went to the other place, it caused genuine concern and
consternation. Rather than being partisan, action came from the Cross
Benchers, many of whom work in the criminal justice system. Many of
them are practising barristers, lawyers, judges and so on, or have
been. They were very strongly of the opinion that abolition was a
retrograde step. In the Minister’s opening remarks, I felt that
he fudged what happened in the other place. There were two sentences
without a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 140<a class="bkMark" name="Column140">&#160;</a>
                  </div>linking sentence in between. He referred to discussions in the other
place and said that the Government had listened to what had happened,
but he failed to mention—perhaps deliberately because he thought
he had implied it or thought that we all knew it so it did not need
saying—that the House of Lords overwhelmingly rejected the
proposal.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">They
rejected it because the job of Parliament, and perhaps particularly
from time to time the job of the House of Lords, is to reflect on any
threats to liberty that the state or the Executive might offer,
particularly to the liberty or rights of young people. It was a serious
debate. Many members from all parts of the House expressed the view
that they were appalled by the Government’s suggestion. The
Minister has gone away and reproduced, as he has said, the same
proposal. I could not recognise in his argument any fresh proposal,
ideas or suggestions on why the plan is more acceptable now than it was
when it went to the other place, but something has happened, which he
did not refer to, of which we must all be conscious—the events
in cities over the
summer.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000195">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
events form a background, within the context of which we have to
reflect on all sorts of things: the way our society operates; the
nature of villainy and criminality; and how the criminal justice system
works. Something that will definitely be on people’s minds is
the fact that so many young people were involved in those criminal
actions in the summer, and that so many of them were temporarily
incarcerated. Consider the scale of what happened and how the holding
cells and the prisons were filled with young people who were
accused—remember, they are innocent until proved
guilty—of criminal actions. That is the context in which the
debate takes place, and that was not available to the House of
Lords.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000196">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many of the
agencies—from the police through to the prisons, but all the
other agencies too—that provide services to families,
communities and people in our country clearly had knowledge of the
individuals who were charged. Many of them have now been found guilty.
First, we should not turn our backs on the expertise of all those
agencies. That expertise is contained within the Youth Justice Board.
Secondly, if the Minister had had his way already, there would have
been a severe crisis, with all those young people being held in cells
or put into prison. I have seen no evidence, had this function been
repatriated back into the MOJ, that it could have dealt with the flood
of young people who were entering the criminal justice
system.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Youth Justice Board handled the situation and is continuing to handle
it. It is doing so in a wise and careful way. It is surprising that the
Minister managed to speak in September about how we deal with young
people in trouble with the law, yet failed to mention what can almost
be described as a social spasm that took place only a few weeks ago and
which we are still dealing with. It was incumbent on him to say,
“These events happened and the Youth Justice Board failed or
could have been improved if we had done things differently.” But
he did not rest his case on that at all. Nor did the Secretary of State
for Justice argue that the problem was caused by the fact that there
was a Youth Justice Board. At no point did he make that case. The YJB

Ministry has denied the suggestion, but it is a widely held view among
stakeholders that there is now an internal debate within the Ministry
about whether it makes sense, in the shadow of events that have not yet
played out, to abolish the very agency that is charged with dealing
with young people who may or may not be engaged in criminal
activity.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am baffled
as to why we are where we are, although I am not truly baffled because
the clue was given away a short time ago. The MOJ is facing the most
catastrophic cuts and the Government are attempting to have two
narratives, almost, about policing, crime and criminality. On the one
hand, they say that they want to crack down. We heard some of the
language from the Secretary of State for Justice, the Prime Ministers
and others, which was very strong. Perhaps it was merited; it is not
for me to say at this stage whether it was merited or not. At the same
time, however, the Government are cutting the process of criminal
justice for financial reasons. Those are the most shameful reasons we
can imagine, because the primary duty of a Government is to protect
citizens. It is extraordinary—is it not?—that a
centre-right Government should be cutting such services.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is a
paucity of argument in the Minister’s case. The truth is that,
shamefully, this is being done not to improve the provision of criminal
justice and the protection of young people, but to save
money.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000204">&#160;</a>

that there was a national debate in the few days after those incidents,

gave the impression that he had already come

absolutely the wrong reasons. I cannot see how we can possibly sit on

                  </strong> I know that members of the Committee have heard
quite a lot from me today, so I apologise for speaking again, but I
have a particular interest in this subject and wanted to speak on it.
Before I entered Parliament, I worked for many years for the
Children’s Society—its chief executive, Bob Reitemeier,
is a member of the Youth Justice Board—which prioritises work
with children in trouble with the law at all stages of the
process.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have
worked closely both with the agencies involved in delivering the system
with the Youth Justice Board and, much more importantly, with the
children and their families. I am deeply concerned about the move to
bring the Youth Justice Board into a central governmental Department.
One reason is the credibility that the Youth Justice Board has with the
other agencies it works with. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Hemsworth pointed out, it works with a range of agencies. I have seen
for myself the difficulties inherent in working with local authorities,
the courts and the police, and—this is often not
recognised—with a range of Government Departments, particularly
the Home Office and the Department of Education, formerly the
Department for Children, Schools and Families.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The Youth
Justice Board’s expertise, which partly stems from the board but
also comes from the staff, gives it credibility and would be a real
concern if it were lost. A point made strongly by the Youth Justice
Board, with which I agree, is that its credibility with partner
agencies is partly due to the fact that its staff are recruited from a
wide range of backgrounds with specific expertise. It recruits directly
from some of those partner agencies, which is why it is able to gain
the trust and confidence of those agencies and an understanding of how
they work, and why it can ensure that everybody works together. A real
concern about moving the Youth Justice Board into the Ministry of
Justice is that that flexibility will be lost, as will the expertise
and credibility of its work and its ability to do its job.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I will not
dwell too long on how well the Youth Justice Board works, because my
hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth talked about that. Reoffending is
down by 27% under its watch and there has been a reduction in the
numbers in custody, as well as savings made. I do not think there is
any dispute about that. It is still worth emphasising the point that
any change, even if some Members believe it is the right one, is
disruptive. It is a cause for concern that an organisation that was and
is doing such good work, and which has such a track record of success,
will suffer from all of the things we discussed in earlier debates:
loss of staff and expertise, along with the impact on morale.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One reason
why I wanted to highlight my opposition to this change is that I have
worked with many Government Departments with responsibility for
children. I have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 143<a class="bkMark" name="Column143">&#160;</a>
                  </div>worked with refugee and migrant children over the past 10 years, who,
until the creation of the Department for Children, Schools and
Families, were dealt with solely by the Home Office. Then,
responsibility was shared across Government.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One problem
is that children who end up being dealt with by any Department other
than the Department of Education become invisible. I have seen that in
so  many different areas. If they are dealt with by the Home
Office as refugee and migrant children, they are seen as migrants first
and children second. If they are dealt with by the Ministry of Justice
or the Home Office because they are in the criminal justice system,
they are seen as criminals first and children second. One really
important thing the creation of the Youth Justice Board, outside of
central Government Departments, did was to lift them out and say that
they are children first and foremost, and that we have a
responsibility, both in law and morally, to ensure their safety and
well-being.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Having
worked with many of those children over several years, I know that some
of them have done some terrible things. I also know that many of them
are victims in their own right. We owe them a responsibility to ensure
that they are safe. Children in any kind of detention or custody are
among some of the most vulnerable in the country, because they have
been taken from their homes and are with other children who may have
significant problems.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Concern has
been expressed following the recent riots about the fact that many of
the young people who have gone into custody have done so for the first
time. They did not have the skills and awareness to protect themselves
properly in such an environment, and the Youth Justice Board has played
a key role over the past few months in keeping those children and young
people safe. It is a real testament to its work that we have seen no
serious incidents of injury, harm or even
death.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <h4 class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000289">&#160;</a>
               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister mentioned one reason why the Youth Justice Board was set up:
that the co-ordination that is so crucial in this area was simply not
happening when the work was carried out within government. It is
important to remember that a number of Departments are involved. If,
like me, any other Member present has tried to work with several
Departments at once on delivering a shared objective, they will know
that it is virtually impossible, given that Departments all have their
own competing objectives that not only differ but sometimes conflict. I
would even say that trying to get different teams within Departments to
work together is hard, so delivering a shared objective when several
Departments are involved is incredibly difficult. So much depends on
the relative influence of the Departments and of their Secretaries of
State within government. I am concerned, looking at the existing
set-up, about whether the Secretary of State would have the authority
to push the proposals through and ensure that children’s needs
are highlighted.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A number of
factors mean that an independent voice is absolutely essential. Ever
since the tragic murder of James Bulger, we have seen increasing
numbers of young people catapulted into custody. There was the
introduction of antisocial behaviour orders, which require only a civil
standard of proof in order to be granted, even though breaking the
orders could result in criminal 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 144<a class="bkMark" name="Column144">&#160;</a>
                  </div>penalties. That has had a dramatic effect on the number of young people
who have been pushed into a criminal justice system in which, frankly,
many have learnt how to become even better criminals, and many have
become much more disconnected from society.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Recently, we
have seen the riots, which, as I mentioned, pushed a number of young
people into custody who have never been in such an environment. There
has also been the wearing down of youth services. The Select Committee
on Education, which I am a member of, recently conducted an inquiry
into that issue. We were overwhelmed with evidence on the virtual
collapse of youth services in many parts of the country. I mention that
because youth services often worked with these same groups of young
people, and they had a crucial role. Without them, there is a need to
ensure that, if more young people are going to end up in custody, an
independent voice exists to deal with that situation.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We have seen
increasingly harsh penalties being served on those who commit crimes,
not only in relation to the riots but in other areas. With all such
matters, it is necessary to have somebody who can step back, challenge
Ministers and see the system from an independent vantage point. What
often happens when Governments are faced with a crisis—whether
it is riots or an immigration problem—is that there is a very
fast reaction. I am not merely saying this about the current
Government; it is natural that there is a knee-jerk response from
Governments, and it is important to have somebody tugging in the other
direction. There should be a calm, rational, expert voice, saying,
“In this situation, what about children’s needs and their
safety?”<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000221">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Another
important point is that the Youth Justice Board has a good record of
innovation. I know well its decision to invite directors of
children’s services into young offenders institutions to ensure
that when young people were released from custody, they were released
to something—not only accommodation, which was incredibly
important, but a package of support. That expert co-ordination and
innovation flourishes outside of a Department because of the relative
expertise of board members, who, incidentally, put an awful lot of time
into the Youth Justice Board. I am aware of that from my work at the
Children’s Society, but it is equally true that other members
put in an enormous amount of time. They are experts with tremendous
networks, meaning that they can innovate because they have seen things
from completely different perspectives. With the best will in the
world, I do not think that will be found by moving the organisation
into a central Government
Department.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Youth Justice Board can move much quicker than I have ever seen a
Department move. When there is an incident such as the riots and huge
numbers of young people suddenly come into custody—the
sort  of vulnerable young people I have been talking
about— the board needs to be able to move and make
decisions
quickly.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to dwell on the question of accountability. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hemsworth made several excellent points that I will not
rehearse, but the point about the Youth Justice Board is that it has
formal mechanisms of accountability. The members are not only appointed
by the Minister, but can be removed by the Minister. That is important.
The Minister sets the funding arrangements and also requires the board
to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 145<a class="bkMark" name="Column145">&#160;</a>
                  </div>report to Parliament, not to the Department. That is important because
it gives Parliament a level of scrutiny that is independent and
provides accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Incidentally,
the recent scrutiny of the Youth Justice Board, particularly by the
Public Accounts Committee, has been universally in admiration of what
the board has done. When it reported earlier this year, the Public
Accounts Committee said that it thought that the decision to move the
YJB into the Department had arisen from a policy decision, rather than
from an assessment of the board’s performance. The Public
Accounts Committee made the point that I also make, which is that one
of the problems with such a change is that the skills, the expertise
and the good work that the board does is likely to be lost in
transition. I urge Ministers to take that point on
board.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have talked about the formal mechanisms of accountability, but I also
know well the informal mechanisms of accountability from my work with
the Youth Justice Board. In reality, Ministers consider major
initiatives. It is simply not true to say that there is not such a
level of dialogue and discussion and that, even if Ministers were
entirely opposed to a major initiative, it would go ahead. There is a
constant dialogue and sharing of views and opinions. The Public
Accounts Committee said that one of its concerns is that, through not
having such a free, open and honest debate and discussion, moving the
Youth Justice Board into the Department could reduce accountability,
rather than increasing
it.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the factors missing from the debate, probably rightly so given that
it should not be about money, is that the Youth Justice Board says that
the Government’s estimate of cost savings does not stand up to
scrutiny. The board estimates that it will cost £600,000 to
abolish it or to move it into the Department and that the
Government’s estimated savings of £250,000 a year do not
take account of significantly reduced administration costs, which are
reduced by a quarter. That is an important point, because it does not
make sense on moral grounds, on practical terms or on
cost.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000227">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
final message to Ministers is that, even if this were the right
approach, and I fundamentally believe that it is wrong and will cause
children harm in the long-term, this is not the right time to do it. I
urge Ministers to think
again.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000228">&#160;</a>

job, both as leader of The Children’s Society and in his wider

Government’s behalf I still do not agree with the hon. Member
for Wigan, but it is important to put those things on
record.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
do not think there is a huge difference of opinion across the Committee
on the shape of the youth justice system that we want to see: how it
operates; how it innovates; and how it does all the things that we
expect it to do. The crux of this argument is whether that can be done
effectively by a division within the Ministry of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 146<a class="bkMark" name="Column146">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Justice with direct ministerial involvement, which is the argument that
the Ministry would put forward and which I am therefore putting forward
on the behalf of the Government, or whether that can be done by the
existing process using the Youth Justice Board.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I certainly
hope that there has not been any suggestion on my part—it is not
my intention to suggest this at any point—that the Youth Justice
Board has failed in its objectives. It is quite the reverse. There is a
general view that it has done its job extremely well and has been
responsible for a lot of good things happening over the past decade in
youth justice. That is not the point. The hon. Member for Hemsworth was
trying to invite me to make the Youth Justice Board responsible for the
riots, which I certainly will not do. That would be a travesty of the
truth.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
question is, first, are the functions that it carries out ones that
cannot be carried out within the Department? Secondly, if they are
carried out within the Department, can they be done equally or more
effectively by engaging with other Government Departments, which is
exactly what the hon. Member for Wigan has said? My basic argument is
that they could.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000233">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am perhaps
being unkind to the hon. Member for Hemsworth by asking whether he was
confused about what the Youth Justice Board does, because a large part
of the youth justice system is already directly administered within the
Ministry of Justice. The youth justice policy unit is already
responsible for setting strategic policies, including youth sentencing.
The National Offender Management Service, which is an executive agency
of the Ministry of Justice, is commissioned by the Youth Justice Board
to provide secure accommodation for young people in young offender
institutions, as well as providing some of the offender management
services, such as escort and electronic monitoring attendance centres.
Within the Ministry of Justice there are analytical services that have
a new dedicated analytical programme on youth justice, which is shared
with the youth justice board. Of course, Her Majesty’s Courts
and Tribunals Service, another executive agency, operates the youth
courts. There is a large element within the Ministry of Justice that is
currently dealing with youth justice 
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000234">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is also this question about conflict of interest. On the point that the
hon. Member for Hemsworth made about the UN convention on the rights of
the child, if there was a conflict between the commissioning role of
the Youth Justice Board and any other advice roles it had, it would
exist currently. In fact, there is no conflict of interest, because the
delivery of youth justice is the responsibility of local authorities.
That is clear through the youth offending teams. That is the key area
of delivery, and those teams will remain in place. The safeguarding of
young people is done by the youth offending teams and the secure
estate, not the Youth Justice Board. The YJB provides a national
oversight, but that oversight can be delivered through the Ministry of
Justice apparatus just as well as it can through the YJB.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000235">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I entirely
agree with what the hon. Member for Wigan said about the complexities
of youth justice, but that is an argument for having it within the
Department. It means that the relevant Ministers, who have a function
in this, can be sat around a table and talk Minister to Minister. Of
course a different view can be constructed,  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 147<a class="bkMark" name="Column147">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and people can say that that independence is needed. The Youth Justice
Board has expertise, which will be retained through the transfer of
staff—the chief executive, John Drew, will have oversight within
the Department—but it will not have a Minister of the Crown, or
indeed the Lord Chancellor, in terms of seniority, who can bring other
colleagues together to consider matters in the round. That is a key
function.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000236">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
riots and disturbances were mentioned. Of course they are uppermost in
all our thoughts, but I am not clearly convinced, as some have argued,
that the Youth Justice Board did anything in response to those riots
that would not and could not have been done as effectively within the
Department. I would be interested to know exactly what people believe
was a unique function of the Youth Justice Board. I have already said
everything that I want to say about how much respect I have for the
work that it has done, but I do not believe that the immediate response
to the riots was necessarily or exclusively a function of the Youth
Justice Board.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000237">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Incidentally,
the £600,000 cost that was mentioned is simply not correct. That
is the cost associated with the transition programme as a whole, and
some of those costs would have been incurred irrespective of whether
the Youth Justice Board was abolished. The actual costs contingent on
abolition are confined to a few human resources issues associated with
moving Youth Justice Board staff to the MOJ.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000238">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
strong arguments for the move. I accept that there are sincere and
genuine concerns, which have been expressed by the hon. Members for
Wigan and for Hemsworth, as well as others outside this House and in
another place, and which must be addressed. I can only say that the key
function of the Youth Justice Board is placing children in custody, and
that function is exercised concurrently with the Secretary of State at
the moment. Other main functions are advisory or relate to purchase of
the youth estate, and I do not believe that those things cannot be done
properly within the Department under the new division
proposed.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000239">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We will
continue to discuss the matter. It may well be that I cannot persuade
Opposition Members that this is the right way forward, but I hope that
I can persuade them that the proposals are not intended in any way to
diminish the work of the Youth Justice Board. Quite the reverse; they
are meant to consolidate that work and take it forward in a hopefully
more effective way. For that reason, I hope that the Committee will
agree to reinstate the Youth Justice Board in the schedule via the
amendment. The consultations on the process will continue, and the
decision will eventually be taken in the light of those consultations.
I hope that ultimately, we will have what everyone agrees is the right
way forward for youth justice.<a class="bkMark" name="110913129000240">&#160;</a>
