Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):
						</b> I
welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Cook. I was on the point
of making a final response to the hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge. He asked two detailed questions on the clawback for the
higher amounts of personal allowances for individuals aged 65 and
above, and at what points the higher amounts of personal allowances
were taken away. He was also looking for a signpost to where the
measures could be
found.</div>
					<a name="08050640000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">The income
limit for the taper for higher amounts of personal allowance for
individuals aged 65 and above is subject to an annual statutory
increase by indexation, as is provided by paragraph 57(1)(h) of the
Income Tax Act 2007&#151;hon. Members can see that I have the detail.
For 2007-08, the limit is &#163;20,900, as set in the Income Tax
(Indexation) (No.2) Order 2006, and for 2008-09, the limit is
&#163;21,800.</div>
					<a name="08050640000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s second question, for 2008-09, the points at
which the higher personal allowance for individuals is tapered away is
&#163;28,990 for individuals aged 65 to 74, and &#163;29,290 for
individuals aged 75 and over. If further details are admitted, I would
be more than happy to return to the matter, and certainly to write to
the Committee when it has had time to consider

							<a name="08050640000284"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The schedule deals with the detailed
implementation of clause 3, which we already discussed in the Committee
of the whole House. I shall speak to the amendments separately, and to
amendment No. 12 first, because it is the simpler of the two.</div>
					<a name="08050640000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">By tabling
amendment No. 12, I seek clarification from the Government and ask them
to make explicit what is implicit in the arrangements, namely, that the
starting rate for savings will be available only on the basis of claim.
In other words, savers will see tax deducted at source at 20 per cent.,
and will then have to claim back to recover the difference
between the starting rate for savings and the basic rate that has been
deducted.</div>
					<a name="08050640000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed new
section 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007, titled, &#147;The starting rate
for savings&#148;, will mainly benefit low income savers. I do not
believe that anybody has a problem with the principle of the measure,
but the concern is that many people who are intended to benefit from it
will not routinely make income tax returns or be familiar with the
process of making a claim for recovery of overpaid tax on form R40.
Many people, even when they become aware of the process, may feel that
it involves a lot of bureaucracy for what might be a relatively small
amount. What assessment have the Government made of the situation with
regard to the likely take-up of the starting rate for savings on the
basis that a claim will have to be made? The amendment would include in
the Bill a reference to the fact that the relief is available only on
the basis of a claim, for the sake of clarification. What steps do the
Government intend to take in order to increase awareness of the
starting rate for savings and the process by which it has to be
claimed? There will be some quite complex calculations to be
done.</div>
					<a name="08050640000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a note
here from one of the major accountancy firms&#151;an internal
training note setting out examples of how the starting rate for savings
will work for different groups of individuals. I will just give the
Committee a flavour of some of the complexity. Example 6 is:</div>
					<a name="08050640000220"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Taxpayer aged 74,
married, earned income &#163;12,000, savings income &#163;3,000.
Earned income exceeds personal allowance by &#163;2,970, so according
to rules, no 10% band on savings income allowed. Therefore all taxed at
20%. So tax on pension income equals &#163;594. Add tax on savings at
20% of &#163;600. Total tax due: &#163;1,194. But married
couples&#146; allowance reduces tax bill by &#163;653, so tax bill
only &#163;541. Therefore, this is likely to be a repayment case at
year end as taxpayer would fail the R85 registration test for gross
interest.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Now we are
not talking here about a multinational corporation. We are talking
about a 74-year-old taxpayer, with an earned income of &#163;12,000
and a savings income of &#163;3,000&#151;someone with quite modest
affairs, unlikely to be professionally advised and likely to do his own
tax return. I am sure the Minister will agree with me that, in the case
of that particular taxpayer, it is quite likely that he would either
fail to recognise that he is entitled to the relief, or at some point
in that calculation, would simply give up and decide that life is too
short and it is not worth bothering to pursue the
claim.</div>

							<b class="B">John
Penrose</b> (Weston-super-Mare) (Con): Does my hon. Friend
agree that, following his earlier comments about incentives to save,
anything which is this complicated would make it virtually impossible
for the man in the street to understand whether or not he was going to
be better off with savings and inevitably reduce incentives to save and
the rate of
saving?</div>
					<a name="08050640000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000286"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is one
of the great problems as the Government wrestle with the micro-tuning
of the tax relief and support system. I suspect that we will see some
more of this when we hear the Government&#146;s intended response to
the compensation proposals for the loss of the 10p rate. There tends to
be a complex process around them, and it tends to become more and more
difficult for individuals to identify whether or not they are eligible
for reliefs and how they go about claiming them. It is that combination
of complexity of calculation, the existing culture of low take-up and
the very low absolute value of claims that often means that very few
will actually benefit. That is why it seems to us on this side that
this arrangement is unlikely significantly to mitigate the loss of the
main 10p rate. Therefore, it will not be a major part of the package
that the Government&#151;we hear&#151;are going to put together as
a
solution.</div>
					<a name="08050640000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08050640000287"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): Is it not illustrative of
precisely the point he is making that the Government almost invariably
budget for less than 100 per cent. take-up when they introduce measures
of this
type?</div>
					<a name="08050640000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000288"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> Indeed it is, and I was about to ask the Minister
what take-up is budgeted for in the figures that have been put before
the House, and on what basis the Treasury&#146;s costing of this
measure has been done. We know that we get different levels of take-up
in different parts of the system. This measure is likely to be
particularly important to elderly people. We know that pension credit
take-up is low, so we know that we are dealing with a group of people
who, typically, are disinclined to take up benefits or tax relief even
when they are available to them. That is a very important point for the
Committee to consider in thinking about how this measure will work in
practice.</div>
					<a name="08050640000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 11 seeks to leave out lines six to eight on page 120. This is very
much a probing amendment. We are trying to understand what the
Government are seeking to do. There are two questions arising from the
deleted lines. Lines six to eight effectively replace subsection (2) of
section 12 in the Income Tax Act 2007. The words in that Act
are:</div>
					<a name="08050640000221"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(2) This
is subject
to&#151;</div>
					<a name="08050640000222"></a><div class="hs_brev">Chapters
3 to 6 of Part 9 (which provide for some income of trustees to be
charged at the dividend trust rate or at the trust
rate),</div>
					<a name="08050640000223"></a><div class="hs_brev">section
504(3)(treatment of income of unauthorised unit trust), and</div>
					<a name="08050640000224"></a><div class="hs_brev">any other provisions
of the Income Tax Acts (apart from sections 10 and 11) which provide
for Income to be charged at different rates of income tax in some
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
before us today simply refers to &#147;any provisions of the Income
Tax Acts&#148;, so deleting all reference to chapters three to six of
part nine and section 504(3). It goes on to refer specifically to
&#147;an individual&#148;, so clearly the intention is that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 48</div>provision of a starting rate for savings is denied to trustees, and is
available only to individuals.</div>
					<a name="08050640000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would therefore be grateful
if the Minister would explain to the Committee why that decision has
been taken, and what impact the exclusion of trustees will have on
small trusts. Is there any reason in equity why trusts should not be
entitled to the same relief that is available to individuals. Once
again, this is a stealth tax on trusts. It has been slipped into the
small print here without any fanfare or announcement, and I think that
the Committee is entitled to an explanation from the Minister. After
all, the income of trustees is eligible under the current
regime&#151;the pre-Finance Bill 2008 regime&#151;for the savings
rate, and is now not eligible for the starting rate for savings. That
seems illogical and inequitable, so I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments on
that.</div>
					<a name="08050640000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second part
of the inserted subsection makes the starting rate of savings subject
to any other provisions of the 2007 Act. I would just like to hear
clearly from the Minister that this is not a denial of starting rate
for savings in any other cases, or a protection of a more generous
treatment. I am not expressing myself terribly well. It is unclear to
me whether the words in this section are intended to deny privileged
treatment to some individuals, or to protect an otherwise more
privileged treatment. Where we see references to provisions
elsewhere,</div>
					<a name="08050640000225"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;which provide
for income of an individual to be charged at different rates of income
tax in some
circumstances&#148;,</div>
					<a name="08050640000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
explanatory notes refer to the lower rate for dividends. Are there any
other circumstances in which this provision will be disapplied in order
to apply a provision elsewhere, in other statutes? In those cases, are
we denying a more favourable treatment by denying the starting rate for
savings; or are we protecting a treatment that is more favourable than
the starting rate for savings? I hope that that is clear. Will the
Minister tell us whether there are circumstances, other than dividends
taxed at the dividend ordinary rate, in which the provision of this
subsection
bite?</div>

							<a name="08050640000289"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> This schedule, together with schedule 3, removes
the 10 per cent. starting rate on income tax for non-savings
income, it abolishes the now unnecessary savings rate of 20 per
cent.&#151;I shall say in a moment why that is sensible&#151;and it
creates a new starting rate of 10 per cent. for savings income, which
effectively reverts to the way it was. It also makes consequential
amendments to other legislation affected by the changes.</div>
					<a name="08050640000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">For many years, savings income
has been taxed at 10 per cent., 20 per cent. and 40 per
cent. Before this year, the income tax system taxed non-savings income
at 10 per cent., 22 per cent. and 40 per cent. The 40 per cent. band
therefore applies to savings and non-savings income. A separate rate of
20 per cent. existed that applied only to savings. Since the new
non-savings income tax rates are 20 per cent. and 40 per cent., the
special savings rate is no longer necessary, as the 20 per cent. band
applies also to savings income. However, as the 10 per cent. starting
rate has been abolished, it is necessary to introduce a new provision
to ensure that a 10 per cent. starting rate for savings income is
available. That is the purpose of the changes that we are
making.</div>

The Minister said that the 10 per cent. rate would still be available
for savings. However, if I understand it correctly, that is not simply
up to the limit of &#163;2,320. If the non-savings taxable income
exceeds that starting rate limit, the 10 per cent. rate does not apply;
it is taxed at 20 per cent. Am I
correct?</div>

					<a name="08050640000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge tabled two amendments. He and I
both recognise the importance of savings in providing people with
independence throughout their lives. Savings also provide security
should things go wrong, and comfort in retirement. The Government want
more people to enjoy those benefits. About 3 million people, mostly
those on low incomes, are eligible for the 10 per cent. rate on savings
income. We maintained the savings rate in order to continue to reward
saving; we also make available vehicles to encourage others to save,
including individual savings accounts and the child trust
fund.</div>
					<a name="08050640000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal
first with amendment No. 11. I wanted to hear what the hon. Gentleman
had to say on both amendments, because it was difficult to understand
their purpose. As I understand it, having heard him and read the
amendments, amendment No. 11 would effectively remove a signpost to
provisions that apply different rates of tax to certain types of income
falling within the starting rate limit for savings, particularly
dividend income, which is taxable at special rates. Where dividend
income falls within the basic rate band, it is taxable at the 10 per
cent. dividend ordinary rate, as I said earlier.</div>
					<a name="08050640000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
result of removing the signpost would be to create confusion and
uncertainty about which rate of tax applies where there are special
rates. It might also be seen as seeking to widen the availability of
the 10 per cent. starting rate for savings beyond savings income,
creating further uncertainty. Therefore, I see no benefit in the
amendment.</div>

						</b> No new circumstances are being introduced as part
of these changes, so no further people will be caught in the way that
the hon. Gentleman appears to fear they might be. The new starting rate
for savings protects the position of individuals and does not deny
anyone a 10 per cent. rate of income tax. In other words, nothing is
broadly changing the arrangements that are already in place. He asked
about the position of trustees and whether the starting rate for
savings was not available for trusts. The starting rate for savings is
for individuals. Trustees are not individuals, so the rate for trusts
are unchanged, and that is covered by section 11 of the Income Tax Act.
He asked me about the rate for trustees, and I can confirm that 20 per
cent. is the rate.

applies to individual taxpayers, as opposed to trustees. That is the
advice, as I have it, and I will want to test that against the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s further challenge to it. That is certainly my
understanding of the position.</div>
					<a name="08050640000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 12, I hear
what the hon. Gentleman says about the complexity and about the need
for an individual to make a formal claim. The amendment seeks to
include the additional provision from the starting rate for savings, so
that it would be applied only where such a formal claim is made.
Individuals are not required to claim a rate of tax. The phrase
&#147;formal claim&#148; has a particular meaning. The rates of tax
that apply are statutory and mandatory. However, the starting rate of
savings only applies to a relatively small number of individuals whose
non-savings income does not exceed their personal allowances, plus
&#163;2,320. Given that relatively unusual combination of different
incomes, it is not possible for Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs to put in place a way of deducting 10 per cent. income at
source from savings income that is liable at that
rate.</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>I appreciate the complexity of the issues
that the Minister is describing, but I am at a loss on dividend income,
which is taxed at 10 per cent. up to the basic rate and at 32.5 per
cent. thereafter. There is no abolition of the 10p rate if the dividend
income exceeds the basic rate at which it would apply, which is the
case with savings income. I am not sure why that can be achieved with
dividends, but not with non-dividend savings
income.</div>

						</b> Dividends are subject to tax at both the
corporate and shareholder level, but the shareholder is provided with a
10 per cent. non-payable tax credit to reduce the second layer of tax
in recognition of the tax already paid at the corporate level. So
dividend income is treated differently. The initial corporate tax is
therefore partly mitigated by the tax credit. Individuals are entitled
to the 10p rate on all or some of their savings income and will receive
it when they complete a self-assessment tax return or if they claim a
repayment on an informal claim form.</div>

						</b> I am not advised that that would apply to most
people, and I want to answer some of the specific questions on this
point. Those eligible for the 10 per cent. rate claim back their money
from HMRC using R40 forms, which, along with a comprehensive guide, are
published on the HMRC website, but they are also available through the
Directgov website. HMRC has promoted, and will continue to promote, the
ability to claim through communications with taxpayers, advertising and
its website. As I have said, it has recently provided further guidance
on the new savings starting rate on its website, and it publishes a
detailed leaflet available to banks and building societies to give to
their customers. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge would
probably reply, &#147;That is fine, as long as the guidance is
clear.&#148;</div>

great to put guidance on websites, but some of the people about whom we
are talking might not pursue such matters vigorously. For example,
older people who might be unfamiliar with the world of Government
websites&#151;a fascinating subject in itself&#151;might not pursue
them. However, I should like to respond to the Minister on a specific
point: a few moments ago, she said that HMRC cannot give that relief at
source for a variety of reasons. However, I understand that, under the
R85 procedure, it is possible for some classes of individual to have
that rate applied to them at source. For the Committee&#146;s
benefit, will she clarify what R85 is and how it
works?</div>

						<b class="B"> </b>A very small number of people qualify for
the rebate&#151;if we want to call it that. They will be those whose
incomes fall below the threshold and whose savings income, therefore,
will be taken into account. A few people will have a very small savings
income representing their entire income. The main way in which the
claim is made is through the R40 form. I shall want to review the
availability of the advice and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>consider whether HMRC can do more to promote the take-up of the benefit
through banks and building societies, which pay interest to individuals
subject to the tax. The R85 form is for non-taxpayers. If the hon.

provide it to him, and I would supply a copy to the

						</b> I was finishing my response to the amendments and
was particularly interested to know the thinking behind amendment No.
12 of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. I have made note of
some of his suggestions. I hope to answer a couple of questions to his
assistance. He was probing around the issue of HMRC and asked why
arrangements cannot be made for tax to be deducted at source. I said
that that was because, generally, the payment of interest on savings is
subject to tax for a small group of taxpayers. Bank and building
societies deduct tax at 20 per cent. It is not possible for banks to
predict a customer&#146;s income and to deduct at 10 per cent. or,
indeed, at 40 per cent., so the R85 form to which the hon. Gentleman
referred is used by non-taxpayers to self-certify that they are
non-taxpayers. In those circumstances, the bank does not deduct the tax
at
source.</div>
					<a name="08050640000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000310"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I have just remembered what I was saying to the
Minister in my intervention. The way in which to ensure that people
receive the relief would not be to deduct 10 per cent. at source and
then recover the additional amounts. We would not have the problem of
potentially large numbers of people failing to claim the relief to
which they were entitled. I am sure that the right hon. Lady can also
imagine the cacophony of objection to such a suggestion from HMRC, but
it is important that we recognise that we have two players of unequal
strength: on the one hand, there is HMRC and, on the other hand, is the
individual low-income taxpayer. Matters are so structured that the
taxpayer must do all the running to get what he is entitled to, while
it should be possible, at least in theory, to structure matters the
other way round, so that HMRC had to do the running to recover the
additional tax when it was due.</div>

							<a name="08050640000311"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>How would the banks distinguish whose
savings income was to be taxed at 10 per cent. or otherwise? We would
get into the situation where the banks could not distinguish between
those who owed more tax because their thresholds did not apply and were
not part of the small group that was entitled to a rebate. We would
have just as difficult a relationship between HMRC and the taxpayer, as
HMRC sought to recover the tax that it was
owed.</div>

							<a name="08050640000312"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I do not seek to play down the difficulties, but
it could be possible to have a self-certification regime along the
lines of that outlined by the right hon. Lady for non-taxpayers.
Presumably, someone who self-certifies as a non-taxpayer will be
subject to HMRC compliance checks and will be required to pay tax
retrospectively if it turns out that they were, in fact, liable to pay
tax on the amount. It is a theoretical possibility. I am seeking to
help her, because I assume that she shares our objective of ensuring
maximum take-up of the relief by those who are entitled to it. That is
perhaps a thought to throw into the
pot.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000313"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we share the
same objective, although there is a problem with tackling the issue
along the lines that he suggested. Although it is theoretically
possible, it would draw more people into having to make a
self-assessment return than applies at the moment. Furthermore, it is
not advisable for a bank or building society to accept a
taxpayer&#146;s self-certification that they are in a particular
band. That would put a greater administrative burden on banks and
building societies. Would they be responsible for determining whether
the individual had provided a correct self-certified assessment? Where
does the responsibility lie? I believe that banks and building
societies would be somewhat nervous of that approach. As he suggests,
it is theoretically possible. However, it is probably better to
encourage HMRC to advertise to people who are in receipt of savings
income that such relief is available and seek the good offices of banks
and building societies to do
that.</div>
					<a name="08050640000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 12
seems to make no change to the long-established position, other than to
put the requirement for a formal claim on the statute book. I therefore
fail to see any benefit in either of the amendments that the hon.
Gentleman has proposed. I hope that they were proposed as probing
amendments to get on the record some of the Government&#146;s
thinking and how HMRC is dealing with the issues that he rightly
raises.</div>
					<a name="08050640000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
members of the Committee will recognise that the 10p rate is a valuable
aid to saving for those on low incomes. I assure hon. Members that the
rules have not changed. Individuals who had savings income taxable at
the 10p starting rate in 2007-08 are likely to have savings income
taxable at the same rate in the next

saying that those who had income taxable at the starting rate in
2007-08 are likely to have income taxable at the starting rate for
savings in 2008-09. That is not my understanding, for the very reason
that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has set out in the debate. The
starting rate for savings is applicable only to the first &#163;2,350
of savings income, where the individual does not have other earnings up
to the personal allowance limit. Many people who would have benefited
from the 10p income tax rate and who have savings income will not
benefit from the starting rate for savings because the savings income
will be taken as the top tranche of income. I think that that is
correct. The Financial Secretary will correct me if I am
wrong.</div>

							<a name="08050640000318"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The Minister is correct that the amendments were
tabled as probing amendments. I said explicitly that amendment No. 12
was tabled with a view to seeking clarification from the Government. I
should like to place on the record that any suggestion that the
introduction, by way of amendment, of an explicit requirement to make a
claim was not intended to change the current situation, but merely to
make explicit the current situation and to probe the Minister on the
consequences.</div>
					<a name="08050640000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
that last point, I think I am right in saying that we do not disagree,
but the Minister was in danger at one point of inadvertently
misrepresenting the situation. Somebody who earned &#163;12,235 last
year, of which &#163;10,000 was earned and &#163;2,235 was savings
income, would have paid 10 per cent. on part of their income. That
person&#151;again earning &#163;10,000 and having &#163;2,235 of
savings income&#151;will not, as I understand it, pay 10 per cent. on
any of their income this year. So that it is a significant
change.</div>
					<a name="08050640000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I did not
quite hear the Minister clarify two points in her response. I asked her
what the Treasury&#146;s estimate of the uptake of the relief is.
This goes to the central point that we have been discussing: what
percentage of people entitled to the relief does the Treasury expect to
claim and has it used as the basis of its modelling of the likely cost
of the measure? The Minister did not answer that question. Although I
accept the difficulties of devising a system that gives the relief
automatically, in the absence of an indication of what the expected
uptake is, it is very difficult to see whether this is a real, big
problem or just a real, small problem. It would have been helpful if
the Minister had given us some figures for the Treasury&#146;s
uptake.</div>
					<a name="08050640000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am also
still entirely missing clarification on whether any other form of
savings income, other than dividend income, will not be subject to the
starting rate for the savings taxation regime. The Minister was
slightly ambiguous in her answer. She made clear that dividend income
was such a form of income. However, the Committee would find it
interesting and useful to know what other form of savings income, if
there is any, will not be subject to the starting rate for savings.

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I beg to move amendment No. 2,
in page 2, line 30, leave out
&#145;28%&#146; and insert
&#145;25%&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08050640000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not often that tax hits the headlines and front pages of the
newspapers, but to have two tax issues on the go at the same time
demonstrates the scale of the concern. One area of concern has been
about the 10p rate, which we discussed last week. In this case, the
rate of corporation tax and the decision of UBM and Shire to switch
their tax domicile from the UK to Ireland has propelled corporation tax
to the front of the news agenda.</div>
					<a name="08050640000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
immediate cause of the departure for both companies was the
consultation on the tax of foreign profits. Both UBM and Shire have
significant non-UK interests, and they were concerned about the
direction that the consultation is taking; but that overlooks the fact
that there are many companies now which have trodden the same
path&#151;not necessarily for the same country of domicile, but they
have certainly chosen to leave the UK for tax purposes.</div>
					<a name="08050640000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">COLT
communications moved its domicile to Luxembourg. Kraft, Google,
Experian and Yahoo have all moved outside the UK. In some cases, that
was part of other transactions, but part of the reason involved the
competitiveness of the UK tax regime. In the financial services sector,
Omega, Hiscox and Catlin moved their tax domiciles to Bermuda, because
of its significantly lower tax rates and regulatory burdens on
insurance
businesses.</div>
				
					<a name="08050640000239"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08050640000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the crucial factors driving the debate about those companies and
others looking to move offshore is the headline corporation tax rate,
which has become increasingly uncompetitive. In 1997, the UK had the
fourth lowest rate in the EU; now we have the 19th. That is starting to
bite, and people are starting to think about it. A report by the City
of London corporation entitled, &#147;The impact of taxation on
financial services business location decisions&#148; highlights the
deterioration of our competitiveness. The summary
says:</div>
					<a name="08050640000227"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Until
fairly recently the UK had what was felt to be a very attractive tax
regime as regards both corporate and personal tax rates, but this has
changed.&#148;</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div>
					<a name="08050640000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some 80 per cent. of respondents to the
survey felt that the competitiveness of the UK regime had deteriorated
in the past few years. It is not just about the rates of tax that
companies pay. The report
says:</div>
					<a name="08050640000228"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Critical
other factors are Certainty of Interpretation and Predictability, and
Attitude and Approach of the tax
authorities.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK had
the worst scores among respondents on those factors.</div>
					<a name="08050640000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">A complex
series of issues affect the reason why companies seek to move from the
UK into other jurisdictions. When asked about the uncertainty of the
tax system, survey respondents referred to the unpredictability of
policy. Policy changes are introduced suddenly, taxpayers and their
advisers have no sight of them and consultation does not take place. We
saw that with the changes to capital gains tax announced in the
pre-Budget report last October. Concerns were expressed about the
difficulty of obtaining a definitive position from HMRC on particular
tax planning issues. Again, that concern has undermined the UK&#146;s
attractiveness.</div>
					<a name="08050640000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC&#146;s
increasingly aggressive approach to closing the tax gap has led to
uncertainty about tax rules. Some rules have been changed, which has
had a negative impact on businesses. A helpful article appeared in
<i class="I">The Tax Journal</i> last week entitled &#147;Shire plc: will the
last one to leave please turn off the lights?&#148; The author
commented on the approach by the Government and HMRC to tax
issues:</div>
					<a name="08050640000229"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Government&#146;s crusade against what it calls unacceptable tax
avoidance has moved into many areas that used to be considered by HMRC
as well as taxpayers to be perfectly acceptable tax
planning&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050640000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The article
goes on to give some examples, but I shall not detain the Committee
with them. It highlights the fact that practice has changed. It
says:</div>
					<a name="08050640000230"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
type of tax planning was common within UK groups and was what enabled
such groups to compete in the global
market.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">People have
noticed a more aggressive approach to what were hitherto commonly
accepted tax planning schemes. That brings in more revenue for HMRC,
but it caused the effective tax rate for those businesses to increase,
because it was not offset by a reduction in the headline rate of
corporation tax until last year&#146;s Budget. Although we are not in
the business of condoning aggressive tax planning, the clear lesson is
that closing down those practices has led to increased tax bills
without any compensatory decrease in the headline rate. It has made
Britain&#146;s tax regime uncompetitive and it has put the economy at
risk.</div>
					<a name="08050640000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">What are the
consequences of the deterioration in the competitive position of the
headline rate of tax and the general changes in the tax system? It is
certainly clear that tax has become an increasingly important factor in
determining where firms locate their business. The City of London
survey showed a consensus that there has been a seepage of jobs and
business from London, and it highlighted the fact that competing
financial centres such as Dublin, Switzerland and the Netherlands offer
more attractive tax regimes than London. The tax and other advantages
that Dublin offers mean, according to the survey, that about 25,000
jobs are in Dublin that could and should be in London. In the interests
of balance, the survey also says that New York is seen as an
uncompetitive centre with high 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>taxes, a particularly aggressive tax authority and a fragmented,
difficult regulatory structure. We would be in much greater trouble if
the US sorted out that regime, which would provide a further incentive
for businesses to relocate from London to other
centres.</div>
					<a name="08050640000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
report focuses on the financial services sector, which is very mobile.
People in the sector have made comments in recent months about the ease
of locating some of their business outside London. Hedge funds are
moving to Switzerland and private equity companies are moving out of
the UK. However, the problem is not specific to the financial services
sector. Shire is a pharmaceutical company and United Business Media
operates in the media sector and has relatively few UK-based assets.
Both Google and Yahoo are high-tech internet companies, and Kraft is a
food company. The concern about the deteriorating competitive position
of the UK system is clearly felt across a wide range of sectors, not
simply in the financial services
sector.</div>
					<a name="08050640000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
that in mind, it was interesting to see a quotation in the <i class="I">Financial
Times </i>last week from GlaxoSmithKline, the big pharmaceutical
company&#151;we are fortunate to have such companies based in the
UK&#151;in which the company
said:</div>
					<a name="08050640000231"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
no plans at present to relocate our headquarters for tax
reasons...However, we believe that the UK business environment has
to be realistic so it doesn&#146;t impair our ability to compete
globally, and it is important that the government ensures that the UK
is an attractive location for companies who have headquarters
here.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, that is a
clear signal that multinational businesses, working in a flexible
global climate, are keeping an eye on all the factors that determine
whether or not the UK has a relative competitive advantage over other
locations in tax and so
on.</div>
					<a name="08050640000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
identified the issue, what is the correct response? Amendment No. 2
proposes that we focus on the rate of corporation tax. The Government
are mindful of the importance of the matter, and last week, the
Chancellor issued a press release stating that a working party would be
set up to consider some of these issues. It was surprising that there
was so little detail in that press release. The working party&#146;s
members had yet to be identified and its terms of reference were in
draft rather than finalised. I suspect that the Government were
responding to the news about UBM and Shire, and were trying to
demonstrate that they were doing something about it. At the Institute
of Directors conference last week, the Prime Minister hinted that
corporation tax rates could be cut. We always welcome imitation as a
sincere form of flattery on tax matters. There is a long list of tax
policies that the Government have tried to copy in recent months, and I
shall not detain the Committee by naming
them.</div>

					<a name="08050640000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prime
Minister has followed the lead that we set. Earlier this year, my hon.
Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne) said that we
supported a cut in the rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent., as
suggested in amendment No. 2. To reassure Labour Members and the
Financial Secretary, this tax cut has been funded. We have identified
the fact that we could make further reductions in the rate of capital
allowances to fund the reduction from 28p to 25p, so it would not cause
a fundamental change in the overall fiscal position. Given that the
Prime Minister has signalled his intention to follow our approach,
Labour Back Benchers might wish to embrace that signal and support us.
If they back the measure there will not be any calls from the Prime
Minister asking them to change their minds, whether he is in the west
wing or not.</div>
					<a name="08050640000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said, this is not an unfunded tax cut, and we would finance the
reductions in the headline rate by reducing the rate of capital
allowances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge
said, by virtue of the conventions that govern these Bills we cannot
table the opposite and equal tax increases, but hon. Members should be
aware that that is our position. Our position is well expressed in the
following quote:</div>
					<a name="08050640000232"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Promote investment and
growth by reducing tax-driven distortions on commercial activity,
ensuring that business decisions are based on commercial rather than
tax considerations; stimulating higher levels of foreign and domestic
investment through a lower CT rate on a broader tax
base&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08050640000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">That encapsulates
our policy admirably. In case any Labour Members query it and do not
think that they can support that line of attack, may I point out that
that quote was taken from &#147;Business tax reform: couple allowance
changes technical note&#148; (2007), produced by the Treasury.
Clearly, the Treasury has cottoned on quite quickly to the idea of
reducing capital allowances and the distortion that takes place as a
result of the Government giving tax relief to particular types of
activity, and using that to reduce the headline rates of corporation
tax. That is the right policy to tackle, as one of a series of steps,
the lack of competitiveness in the UK tax system.</div>
					<a name="08050640000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not
act, there is a risk that Britain&#146;s tax base will shrink. Not
only will UK-domiciled companies seek to relocate for tax purposes
overseas, companies seeking locations in which to invest will look at
the UK and see a high rate of corporation tax that is out of step with
our European competitors, and thus seek to locate in those countries,
rather than in the UK. The impression that the impact is
double-edged&#151;companies are driven out of the UK if our system is
uncompetitive in relation to other jurisdictions, and people are
discouraged from moving to this country&#151;was borne out in the
City of London survey, in which respondents thought that, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>based on current trends, the seepage of jobs out of London would
continue and accelerate. The report highlighted academic research that
said that low-tax regimes successfully attract inward investment over
time&#151;the opposite is true of high-tax regimes. The amendment
recognises the truth of that statement, and it is in the
country&#146;s best interest to reduce the headline rate in the way
that we have outlined. Given the state of public finances, the only
proven way to do so is to reform capital allowances,
too.</div>

							<b class="B">:</b>
						 When considering the merits or otherwise of
the amendment, we have to remember that the Conservative party is
committed to the same overall levels of spending and taxation as the
Labour Government. There is nothing in the Conservatives&#146;
proposals that represents a net tax cut&#151;every single proposal
that they have introduced has to be paid for somewhere else in the
system. The hon. Member for Fareham was commendably honest when he
admitted that the beneficiaries of the tax cut would be asked to fund
it themselves, so it was not as attractive a proposition for business
as it might appear to someone who was casually reading the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="08050640000240"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div>
					<a name="08050640000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">In fact, I can
almost imagine the meeting that took place. The Conservative party, to
try to reassure business that, despite their reputation for high taxes,
they were still on the side of business, went along to the meeting and
said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry: we&#146;ve tabled an amendment in
the Finance Bill Committee that says that we are going to cut the rate
of corporation tax by 3p&#148;. The business audience says,
&#147;Wow, that&#146;s very impressive. It&#146;s exactly the
sort of policy that we hope the Conservative party would put forward on
our behalf&#148;. However, the meeting was brought to hasty
conclusion before it was explained to the business audience that they
would be paying for the 3p cut through the allowances that they would
lose elsewhere in the system. I shall return to the motivation of the
Conservative
party.</div>
					<a name="08050640000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Liberal
Democrats support help for business through cuts in corporation tax,
but we have made it absolutely explicit that that would have to be
funded through removals of research and development reliefs and other
business allowances. As a party, we are not instinctively hostile to
the Conservative&#146;s proposal, but we should be honest and
straightforward with the business community and not dress up such a
proposal as a tax cut&#151;it is not a tax cut&#151;which is what
the Conservative party are doing. In the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i> in December,
Ireland&#146;s decision to cut corporation tax to 12.5 per cent. was
described by the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Tatton
(Mr. Osborne), as being exactly the sort of policy that the
British Government ought to follow, but he has not identified how we
will get to anything like that position. The shadow Chancellor has said
on other occasions, including on &#147;The Andrew Marr Show&#148;
in March this year, that there was &#147;no scope&#148; for cuts in
business taxes because of the UK&#146;s budget
deficit.</div>

private companies that benefit from them should pay for them, as
opposed to the taxpayer. However, there are other matters on which R
and D needs to be stimulated through taxpayer subsidy. The overall
point is that the system should be simplified and the headline rate
reduced, and that that should be funded through the removal of a
complicated system of reliefs. Does that mean that we are sympathetic
to what the Conservative party aspires to do? Yes it does, but we are
not trying to dress it up as a tax cut, or persuade business audiences
that that is what it is. We are leaving that to the Conservative

The Conservatives think that they need only to mention Ireland to make
themselves a business-friendly party. They need to say to business:
&#147;We are committed to the same levels of taxation as the Labour
party and a much bigger state in terms of public spending than was the
case when the Conservatives were last in Government, and we are not in
favour of reducing the overall tax burden on business. When we mention
the magic word, &#145;Ireland&#146;, we&#146;re afraid, dear

that the Conservative party wish to put forward at the next general

						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman clarify his objection to
the policy? He said two contradictory things. First, he said that the

capital allowances, and that we were therefore trying to hide that part
of our tax policy. Secondly, he cited my hon. Friend the Member for
Tatton, who made it explicit on &#147;The Andrew Marr Show&#148;
that because of the state of the Government finances, there could be no
overall reduction of the tax burden. We are both open and closed,

Simplifying the tax regime full stop is beneficial for businesses and
for individuals, and one of the criticisms that I and many others would

Si&#244;n Simon</b> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab): Although
the hon. Gentleman keeps telling us that he will simplify the research
and development tax credits, is it not the case that the hon. Member
for Twickenham has had for several years a big bee in his bonnet about
R and D tax credits, which he thinks do not work or are uneconomic? The
issue is not about simplifying them but about getting rid of them,
because the hon. Gentleman has a really big, buzzing bee in his bonnet
about them. The hon. Member for Taunton does not know what is going to
happen with them. All he knows is that the hon. Member for Twickenham
does not like them and would not have them.</div>

						</b> That was a fascinating analysis of the different
strands of opinion within the Liberal Democrats. The policy to which we
in my party are all committed is ensuring that public money is spent as
efficiently as possible and is as supportive as possible of British
industry. We are trying to raise the necessary money to fund public
services and to support a healthy business environment, and my hon.
Friend the Member for Twickenham and I are both enthusiastic about that
approach.</div>
					<a name="08050640000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
establish two points: first, that the Conservative party favours as

policies to a wider audience, although, I fear, it is a rather partisan
and uneasily persuaded one. My party is not committed to raising the
overall 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>burden of taxation. We think that taxes are high enough in Britain.
However, we think that there is scope within the existing level of
taxation to make taxes fairer and to place the burden better. I cited
that point this morning. We could increase taxation on
pollution&#151;on activity that is damaging to the
environment&#151;and reduce taxation on people who are on low to
middle earnings and who require greater assistance. I do not wish to
test your patience, however, Mr. Cook. If, at the next
general election, we are able to reduce the overall burden, our
priority will be to help people who are on low earnings and at the
bottom of the income tax threshold.</div>

					<a name="08050640000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have established that the
Conservative party favours high business taxes, as does the Labour
party. My other point, which is on the same theme of greater
simplicity, is that business in Britain has not been done a favour by
the chopping and changing of corporation tax rates over the years. As I
understand it, corporation tax has changed seven times in the 11 years
that the Labour party has been in government, and that makes it
difficult for businesses to plan ahead.</div>

							<a name="08050640000350"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I shall give way in a moment. Having said that I
would not, my generosity has got the better of me. Before I give way,
however, I shall leave people with this thought. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies, in its green budget, says on that very
subject:</div>
					<a name="08050640000233"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
does not seem a helpful contribution to the stable business environment
that Gordon Brown has so often stated is vital for investment and
economic growth.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, the Government must have the flexibility to make changes, but
business likes to have the security of being able to plan in
advance.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000351"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Just before the hon. Gentleman&#146;s train of
thought hits the buffers completely, is he saying that he is against
reducing the rate of corporation tax, despite saying a couple of
minutes ago that he was in favour of reducing it? He must clarify his
thought process. Is he in favour of reducing it or not? If he is, how
does he rebut the IFS argument that that creates instability in the tax
system?</div>
					<a name="08050640000241"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000352"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I do not believe that those positions are
contradictory. I keep explaining the same points, but I will explain
them once more. My party is in favour of reducing the rate of
corporation tax, funded by removing or reducing reliefs and allowances
elsewhere so that there is greater simplicity, but that does not
detract from the fact that businesses&#151;and
individuals&#151;like to have some ability to plan their tax affairs
in advance. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>Therefore, if there are more years when changes are made than years when
changes are not made, that potentially builds uncertainty into the
system for those who seek to plan ahead for their business taxation.
Our view is that this would be the right way to go: if the Government
were to make changes, but less frequently, in the direction we approved
of, that would be beneficial to business.</div>
					<a name="08050640000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, the objective of
reducing the overall level of corporation tax is laudable. Simplifying
the system is laudable as well, but we must remember that we are all in
this Committee debating the changes knowing that we favour an identical
overall level of taxation on British
businesses.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000353"></a>Mr.
Field:
						</b> It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Member
for Taunton, eventually. I give my wholehearted support&#151;perhaps
not as wholehearted as that of the hon. Member for Taunton&#151;to
the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for
Fareham.</div>
					<a name="08050640000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
sympathy at some level with the Government&#146;s plight in relation
to the overall rates. The Government obviously need to balance their
books, with public debt spiralling out of control, and I understand
that there is a reluctance to get into a downward auction of rates,
whether on capital gains tax or in other areas. However, as my hon.
Friend rightly pointed out, we live in a global market and all too
often too many of the new business ideas&#151;he referred to Yahoo
and others&#151;are very mobile. I discovered only today, chatting
with a friend who is a senior executive of an outfit called Betfair in
the gaming industry, that it has also left these shores, moving part of
its operation to Malta. That is down in part to rates, but also to
regulations, a point which my hon. Friend
addressed.</div>
					<a name="08050640000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend rightly pointed out, the biggest damage is in relation to the
uncertainty that has become part and parcel of the tax regime. It is
greatly to the Government&#146;s credit that for their first nine or
10 years they were able to maintain&#151;during what was
clement global economic weather&#151;a sense of a strong economy
going forward. They inherited a strong economy. Although many in
business, many of whom I represent in central London, feared the worst,
the ship sailed fairly smoothly on. Many of us feel that the biggest
problem caused by some of the botched changes that have taken place,
particularly over the past nine months, is that there is now a level of
uncertainty in the system which is doing great damage to
Britain&#146;s global competitiveness in the business
sphere.</div>
					<a name="08050640000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
has been little proper consultation on a number of the changes in the
capital gains tax regime, on issues regarding non-domiciles, and the
like. Importantly, there should have been prior sight of many of those
changes. There is, therefore, an inherent difficulty in getting a
definitive position in relation to a range of taxation
measures&#151;capital gains tax and beyond. As my hon. Friend rightly
pointed out, there has been a sense of an increasingly aggressive
approach by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs, partly I fear,
going back to my initial point, because of public finances that are
spiralling out of control. There needs to be a much clearer approach to
ensure that there is guidance from the authorities and professional
advisers of corporations in advance, so that corporations can properly
plan their tax affairs.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>
					<a name="08050640000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear that
the biggest problem is that uncertainty, and for that reason we tabled
the amendment. The amendment is not just about rates, but about some of
the longer-term damage that has been done to Britain&#146;s role and
competitiveness. One can look at a range of league tables, the figures
in which can in many ways spiral, but we have also had an incredibly
solid economy in many ways, which has been dealt with fairly solidly.
We all had disagreements about particular elements of the tax regime
over the first 10 years of the Government&#146;s administration. Over
the past nine months, however, we have seen some real problems that
will do lasting damage to our external investors, particularly in the
globalised economic world in which we live. The one thing that we can
be certain about is that international competitiveness will become ever
more important in the years and decades to come. I fear that the
biggest and most damaging legacy that this Government will pass on will
be uncertainty surrounding our economic
welfare.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000354"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fareham for
tabling the amendment, although we might have had the debate on the
clause anyway. As he says with some justice, the weight of corporation
tax is one of the factors that is quoted by some of our major companies
when they make investment decisions. It was cited in the case of Shire
and United Business Media, when they announced that they intended to
insert a Jersey-incorporated Irish tax resident company as the top
holding company for their groups.</div>
					<a name="08050640000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I answer some of the points
made by the hon. Member for Fareham in his opening speech? Both of the
companies to which he referred have stated publicly that they do not
expect the move to have any impact on the level of activity and jobs,
which will remain in the UK. Therefore, both will continue to be liable
for UK corporation tax, as they are now, on the economic activity that
they have located here. However, inserting a non-UK tax resident
holding company on top of a multinational group provides an opportunity
for the group to escape the application of the current rules on the
taxation of the foreign profits of the group&#146;s overseas
subsidiaries. A review of the reform of those rules is under way and
has been discussed, in detail, with business. The hon. Member for
Fareham and I would share the goal of maintaining the most competitive
corporation tax rate of the major economies. The Prime
Minister&#146;s speech to the Institute of Directors last week
reiterated that when he
stated:</div>
					<a name="08050640000234"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our
aim is to reduce corporation tax even further when we can afford to do
so...and we&#146;re looking at how we&#146;re going to do
it.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08050640000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have continued our engagement with business over recent months on the
shape of proposals for the reform of taxation of foreign profits. We
are committed to issuing a consultation document on the proposals in
the summer, and we remain committed to engaging and consulting fully
with business on those proposals both prior to and after publication.
As part of that commitment, the Chancellor announced the formation of a
working group of industry representatives to discuss with Ministers
ways in which the tax system can provide the long-term certainty that
multinational companies need considering the competitiveness and other
challenges facing both 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 66</div>business and Government. As businesses have become more global in their
reach, we are keen to work with them to understand how the UK&#146;s
tax system can reflect the challenges of globalisation. Businesses have
asked us to respond to global challenges, but they have also made it
clear that they value stability and certainty.</div>
					<a name="08050640000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Throughout my period in office
as Financial Secretary, it has become clear, as the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster rightly said, that certainty and the
ability to make planning decisions knowing what the tax implications
will be are highly prized by business. Striking a balance between the
objectives of responding to global changes and providing certainty is
not always easy. We recognise that sometimes the Government may have
reacted too quickly in responding to the need for change.
Sometimes, we may not have reacted quickly enough to keep pace with
globalisation. At the same time, other countries are also changing
their own regimes, which also affects the perception of UK
competitiveness. Ireland has been quoted a number of times as having a
very low rate of corporation tax in comparison with ours and therefore
is seen as a highly attractive place. However, I believe that <i class="I">The
Observer </i>had an article this weekend in which it described the
downturn affecting the Irish economy, which is causing employment in
Ireland to reduce, the availability of jobs to reduce and the
attractiveness of working in Ireland to reduce in comparison with the
United Kingdom, which would indicate a different trend. Therefore,
there is no developed economy in the world that is not affected by the
global changes that we are dealing with.</div>

business.</div>

					<a name="08050640000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
2 sets out to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 25 per cent.
for the financial year 2009. As I have said, the Government remain
determined to maintain the best possible environment for business in
the UK and with unprecedented economic stability in the UK, businesses
have been able over the past decade to plan and invest more effectively
for the long term. That has brought us a lot of benefit, as
today&#146;s high rates of employment underline. Companies have also
benefited from a competitive tax regime.</div>
					<a name="08050640000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">To maintain that position last
year&#146;s Budget saw the announcement of a further reduction in the
main rate of corporation tax to 28 per cent. That rate was legislated
for in the Finance Act 2007 and came into effect from 1 April this
year. With that step, the Government have maintained the UK&#146;s
position as having the lowest corporate tax rate in the G7. The rate
cut was accompanied by a series of reforms to wider business taxation,
which will be discussed in later debates in this Committee. As a
package, these reforms constitute the most extensive set of reforms to
the business tax system since the 1980s. The package modernises the
outdated system of investment allowances for plant, machinery and
buildings; I know that we will return to that subject later. It also
gives further support to innovative businesses through the research and
development tax credit.</div>
					<a name="08050640000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been a pleasure to

					<a name="08050640000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">More than
&#163;2.3 billion has been given in support of 30,000 claims for R
and D tax credits since they were introduced for small and medium-sized
enterprises in 2000 and for large companies in 2002. This Bill goes
further. It includes clauses that increase the generosity of both
credits, from 125 per cent. to 130 per cent. for large companies and
from 150 per cent. to 175 per cent. for
SMEs.</div>
				
					<a name="08050640000242"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

					<a name="08050640000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
questioning our commitment to R and D tax credits as an important and
welcome support for businesses to invest and develop. Competitiveness
is about more than just the headline rate of corporation tax. The UK
tax system has other advantages, including a generous system with R and
D tax credits, but also there is no withholding tax on dividends, which
is regarded as very welcome. We have one of the largest networks of tax
treaties in the world, and relatively low administrative burdens. We
are unusual in offering full interest
deductibility.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div>
					<a name="08050640000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Looking at
the tax paid by companies also indicates the UK&#146;s continued
competitiveness. As a share of gross domestic product, UK taxes on
corporate income amounted to 3.4 per cent. of GDP in 2005, the latest
year for which there are comparable figures. That was below the OECD
average of 3.7 per cent., and in line with the EU15 average. The OECD
ranked the UK among the most attractive places for foreign direct
investment in the world. Indeed, there have been a number of recent
examples of foreign investment with Toyota in Wales, and China Mobile
locating to London this year. However, it is important to reiterate
that we are not complacent.</div>
					<a name="08050640000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">On non-tax measures, the UK
consistently performs well in comparison to other competitors. Perhaps
I could turn to the amendment. The proposed reduction in the main rate
of corporation tax to 25 per cent. from next year, would cost as much
as &#163;8.5 billion over the three years to 2011-12. That is
probably around the global figure that we could agree between us. The
hon. Member for Fareham says that this is not an unfunded tax cut, and
that he would recoup all the tax through changes and reductions in
capital allowances. The Opposition have proposed a package of
corporation tax reforms, the key parts of which are, as I have said,
the reduction of the main rate to 25 per cent., and a reversal in the
rise of the small companies rate back to 20 per cent. That would be
funded by reducing the main rate of plant and machinery capital
allowances to 125 per cent., sorry, 12.5 per cent.&#151;one would
think I did not have my glasses on&#151;reducing the long-life asset
of integral features of expenditure rates to 6 per cent., and
abolishing the annual investment allowance.</div>
					<a name="08050640000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In putting
the package together, I do not believe that the Opposition have made
the right calculations based on the available figures. The whole
package would be funded by changes to the capital allowances. I
believe, and we have looked in some detail at the package, that that
would penalise sectors investing in shorter-life assets, for example,
technology. Capital-intensive sectors, such as transport and
manufacturing would lose out, as would utilities, and I do not believe
that the package would be sustainable in the long term. As I understand
it, the Institute for Fiscal Studies acknowledged that the figures on
which the package was based were drawn from figures available from 1971
to 1990&#151;they do not reflect increased investment in computers or
other short-lived assets, although they include long-life assets. The
IFS acknowledged that rates of depreciation used in the accounts would
have increased since that time.</div>
					<a name="08050640000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for the opportunity to have a wider debate about the
implications of corporation tax and its importance to business, we do
not believe that the proposal in the amendment is sensible. Sticking
with our proposals and the corporation tax that we have tabled is, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, West acknowledges, part of our
ongoing work to reduce corporation tax, so long as it is done in an
affordable way and in consultation with the businesses that are
affected. Therefore, I hope that he will not press his amendment to a

made by the hon. Member for Taunton really betrayed to me his problem
in setting out his tax plans. He spent time in the Committee of the
whole House trying to establish the point about tax burdens and what we
were in favour of with regard to whether it was higher or lower, but he
managed to avoid any commitment himself until my hon. Friend the Member
for South-West Hertfordshire rather pinned him down. He said, &#147;I
not committed to raise the burden of tax&#148;, so it will not
increase unless his hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)
changes his mind.</div>
					<a name="08050640000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Taunton was not entirely clear that he was going to
lower the tax burden either, because he said that the measures outlined
today in his speech would be funded by the abolition of the research
and development tax credits and other reforms. This morning, he seemed
to suggest that the 4 per cent. decrease in the starting rate for
income tax would be funded through other tax increases, so unless he
has something to wow us with later in our proceedings, the logic of his
argument is that every tax cut that he proposes has to be funded by a
tax increase elsewhere. Intellectually, that is a perfectly respected
position, given the state of the Government&#146;s finances and the
way the economy has been handled, but he should be frank and
transparent about the position that he reached, rather than forever
trying to nibble away at other people&#146;s
views.</div>

							<a name="08050640000362"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> I will be frank and clear. At the last general
election, the Liberal Democrats proposed an increase in the tax burden
over and above what the Government and the Conservative party proposed.
That is not our position now. We do not wish to see the tax burden rise
and think that it is high enough as it is. Unlike the Conservative
party, however, we still hold to the possibility that we could fund
cuts in the overall tax burden. I understand that the Conservative
party is committed to an overall tax burden that is absolutely
identical to that of the Labour Government. The hon. Member for Fareham
is right that, when we propose that spending should be increased in one
area or taxes reduced in another, we are seeking for that to be offset
by changes elsewhere in the system, but we are not in favour of an
overall rise.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000363"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I think that we are now clear on that, for
the time being at least. With regard to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comment about instability in the tax system and the earlier comments
from my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, it
is absolutely right that uncertainty is a factor in Britain&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 70</div>deteriorating position when compared to our neighbours, particularly
with regard to the competitiveness of our tax position.</div>
					<a name="08050640000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary talked about the need to consult on the taxation of foreign
profits and mentioned that she would chair an informal group that
included representatives of multinationals, but part of the problem is
that business leaders will say, &#147;We&#146;ve heard all these
pledges to consult before.&#148; Look at what happened in the
pre-Budget report in October. Totally unexpected and unplanned changes
in capital gains tax came from a Government who were committed to
consultation. Therefore, consultation on how the Government are
managing corporation tax will not wash with the business community at
the moment. We need a more certain and stable tax regime in which
people understand the Government&#146;s direction of travel on tax. I
would not see any inconsistency in that if one were setting out a path
that a Government might follow to reduce the rate of corporation tax. I
do not believe that that would introduce unnecessary instability to the
system&#151;a point that the hon. Member for Taunton made. Certainty
and predictability play a key part, and the erosion of that in the tax
system has led to a deterioration in the competitiveness of our tax
regime.</div>

Pound:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is too tolerant; I am sure he
will learn.</div>
					<a name="08050640000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we
move on from the delicious flights of fancy that are Liberal Democrat
taxation policy, I would say that the hon. Member for Cities of London
and Westminster referred to consumption on a fence. He should have
added &#147;dreaming of jam tomorrow&#148;. The logic of what the
hon. Member for Taunton said was that stability was so important that
business would even resist a cut in corporation tax because of the
terrifying destabilising effect. Will the hon. Member for Fareham say
whether members of his party concur with that perspective from Taunton
or whether they have a different
view?</div>
					<a name="08050640000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08050640000365"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> Moving an amendment that would reduce the rate of
corporation tax suggests that we do not believe that business would be
unhappy with that reduction. To be fair to the hon. Member for Taunton,
I do not think that he quite meant to refer to reductions in the
headline rate of corporation tax. As I was saying, the issue of
uncertainty, complexity and predictability is quite important for
businesses and we need to introduce reforms that help to deliver it in
a more sustainable way that can be clearly understood by the business
community.</div>
					<a name="08050640000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of the rate, I think that the Government are at risk of being
complacent, despite the protestations of the Financial Secretary. For
too long, the Government have felt that people in the City have been
crying wolf about this. The Government would rather dismiss the
concerns as the view of a narrow group of people, but the scale of
activity suggests that there is much broader concern than the
Government have hitherto recognised. One can always tell how serious
businesses are about a change when they spend real money on
it.</div>
					<a name="08050640000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conversations that
I have had with tax advisers over recent months have indicated that a
substantial number of large businesses have commissioned serious pieces
of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>work on how to move their tax residence from the UK to other
territories. That is a serious issue , and we need to respond to it. It
is in the interests of the economy as a whole that we get that response
right. While I hear what the Financial Secretary is saying about the UK
having the lowest rate in the G7, the position has deteriorated. We
have moved from having the fourth lowest rate in Europe to the
nineteenth lowest. That is an important fact that we need to bear in
mind. This is not just about Ireland. There are other countries looking
at the same route which offer attractions for businesses to relocate
away from the
UK.</div>
					<a name="08050640000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Financial Secretary said that UBM and Shire were not going to move
employees out of the country, would not reduce their activities and
would continue to pay UK corporation tax. That is their position at the
moment, but who knows where they will go to? The other message is that
this matter will affect businesses looking to invest in the UK. They
look at the signal given by high corporation tax relative to our
competitors and use it as a factor in their decision making, as the
Financial Secretary recognised in her response. It is time for us to
take action. The amendment sets out a very clear path for the way that
the tax system should go and I will press it to a
vote.</div>
