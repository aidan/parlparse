<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we resume, may I ask hon. Members to comply with one or two rules, which may make for better order than there was this morning? I ask hon. Members to switch off their pagers and mobile telephones, and I am grateful to see that happening. Perhaps they would also resolve--and carry out the resolution--either to keep conversations very quiet or to have them in the Corridor. If hon. Members wish to catch my eye, they should stand up; leaning forward and looking hopeful is not helpful. If hon. Members wish to withdraw amendments, perhaps they would do so promptly; otherwise they may find that the amendments have been proposed to the Committee.

Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 96, in page 24, line 16, after `(4)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `One month after he submits a report to the Police Authority under Section 48(1)'.--[Mr. Moss.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: No. 98, in page 24, line 16, leave out from `shall,' to `submit' in line 17.
<P>
No. 97, in page 24, line 18, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and arrange for it to be published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. James Cran </B>(Beverley and Holderness): We shall try to accommodate you on all points, Miss Widdecombe, as I am sure will Labour Members.
<P>
This morning, we were discussing clause 49 and the serious proposition that the Police Authority believes the Chief Constable's annual report to be one of the most important ways in which he demonstrates his accountability to the authority and, perhaps more important, to the community. The authority believes that clause 49(4), which requires the Chief Constable to submit a copy of the report to the authority and the Secretary of State ``at the same time''--those are the crucial words-- diminishes its authority and standing. The purpose of our amendments is to remedy that. 
<P>
I suggested to the Minister that on reflection after lunch--I met him and he was in good form and good heart, as I am--he would accept that such concerns must be taken seriously. I am not implying in any way, shape or form that the channel of dialogue that has been opened between him and the Police Authority has been broken, but it seems to need a push. I hope that in the process the Minister will be able to resolve this issue as well as others that we raised in previous sittings.
<P>
	Before the Committee adjourned this morning, the Minister rose to his feet as if he were about to fire an Exocet missile or set off a land mine, but he simply asked about the Committee on the Administration of Justice. Throughout lunchtime and afterwards I was wondering about the great significance of the intervention and I am still not sure what it was. The Minister simply reminded me to refer to the representations of that body, and if he had not risen to his feet, I would have forgotten. It might be for the edification of the Committee if I took a second or two to canter over what the Committee on the Administration of Justice thinks about the matter.
<P>
You would rule me out of order, Miss Widdecombe, if I spoke about clauses 47 and 48 and I have no intention of doing so, but there is a link with page 12 of the document that was circulated by the Committee on the Administration of Justice in February 1998. The Minister said that he had read it, and if he says that he has read it, I believe that he has read it. He will remember that page 12 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reporting mechanisms proposed in this section overall are, in our opinion, far from satisfactory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister's Exocet missile of an intervention--or so it appeared--might have been intended to stop me quoting from the Committee on the Administration of Justice because it said nothing that suited my purposes. The opposite is true. I repeat that it says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the reporting mechanisms proposed in this section overall are, in our opinion, far from satisfactory.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If Opposition Members had adopted the amendment proposed by the committee it would not have been the same as that tabled by my hon. Friends. The committee's proposed amendment stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament every report''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the words ``every report'' are the important ones in relation to clause 49(5)--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``submitted to him/her under subsection (4), and shall append thereto the Police Authority report covering the same period and submitted in accordance with article 47.3b.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It appears that, contrary to the Minister's suggestion that the committee is happy with the Bill, the committee is most unhappy. That is illustrated by another statement that the committee makes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``This will mean that the Chief Constable's `general report on the policing of Northern Ireland during that year' is laid before Parliament, whereas no similar mechanism is made available to the Police Authority . . . assessment of that report.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
On that account, therefore, the Committee on the Administration of Justice is at odds with the Minister and the Government. Perhaps when the Minister replies--I expect him to do shortly--he will tell us his answer to that conundrum. The committee continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``At the very least, the assessment of policing which the Police Authority is expected to produce . . . should be submitted with the Chief Constable's report to the Secretary of State and the Houses of Parliament.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Again, that seems an entirely reasonable request. Although the committee might not be supported by all members of this Committee, it none the less deserves an answer. The committee's final statement in the section relating to clause 49 is especially deserving of an answer. It is a fairly stunning statement:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Otherwise, one must question the value of any scrutiny function afforded by the Police Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an arresting statement, and although the committee's conclusion is not entirely the same as that of the Police Authority, the anxieties lying behind the different amendments that it proposed are almost identical.
<P>
I will not try the Committee's patience further, but I ask the Minister to consider our arguments sympathetically. We will temper our reaction in the light of the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> We have had a longer debate than I expected on the amendments. I shall respond to some of the earlier points made by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Cran). He spoke as if there was a new dawn--those are not the words that he used--or a new realisation of the need for officials, the Police Authority and me to consult. We have not gone away; we have been waiting to participate in such consultation. Many offers have been made to achieve that objective. The process is now under way because the Police Authority has decided to discuss the working group, which it would not do before. There has not been a dereliction of duty by me or my officials, nor has there been any unwillingness to participate in such discussions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> Does the Minister accept that we did not intend to accuse him of dereliction of duty, or of anything else? But it did seem to almost everyone that the need to kick-start the relationship was an important objective. That was our only point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is good, Miss Widdecombe, to know that I am not being accused of anything because that will help us to make more rapid progress.
<P>
I raised the matter as it relates to the CAJ, which has been selectively quoted, not because I wanted to debate its opinions but because the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness has consistently referred to it. He omitted it in this instance and I was worried that he was not going to give us the benefit of his interpretation of its opinions. I mentioned the CAJ to help the Committee and to ensure that he did not fall down in his duties as the CAJ's spokesperson.
<P>
We must deal with the nub of the argument. The amendments would require the Police Authority to hold the Chief Constable's annual report for one month before it was forwarded to the Secretary of State and published. I have listened to the debate and, having considered the Bill's procedures, I see no good reason for the amendments. The Chief Constable would not have the same control over the publication and distribution of his annual report, which is, after all, his document. That power is given to every other chief constable in the United Kingdom by sections 22(1), 22(2) and 44(4) of the Police Act 1996 and section 15 of the Police (Scotland) Act 1967, as amended. The amendments would deny the Chief Constable of the RUC the proper control that he should have over his report.
<P>
The amendments would introduce a delay into the publication of the Chief Constable's annual report for no good purpose. That would weaken the accountability of the Chief Constable to the wider public because it would deny to the people of Northern Ireland the knowledge contained in the report. The amendments would also blur the clear demarcation of responsibility that the Bill is designed to introduce.
<P>
The Bill contains generous provision to ensure that the Police Authority is able to make public its view on the policing of Northern Ireland. Elements in the Bill allow the Police Authority to hold the Chief Constable to account and to make its views on policing and the police plan known. The amendments would place further restrictions on the Chief Constable's ability to comment on policing in Northern Ireland and would not add to the authority's role. However, they would detract from the quality of relationships and the proper balance of views that the tripartite structure is designed to ensure, including how it is perceived and received by the public.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke):</B> The Minister has not dealt with my point that simultaneous awareness of the Chief Constable's report might result in a nod or a wink, or an explicit statement, from the Northern Ireland Office or the Secretary of State's office, which might influence the Police Authority's response to the report. I tried to argue that that would be detrimental to the Police Authority's ability to make a fair appraisal of the report. What is the Minister's view?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was just coming to that important matter. The nub of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that the Police Authority could be influenced by the Secretary of State's reaction to the Chief Constable's report--if the report went to the Secretary of State and to the Police Authority at the same time, the Police Authority could be influenced by the Secretary of State's reaction to it. There is no evidence to suggest that that has happened, although the hon. Gentleman's argument contains the implication that somehow or other the Secretary of State might seek to influence it. On what grounds would she do so, and what would she be trying to achieve? A suspicious mind does not normally rest on the shoulders of the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter)--his questions and speeches are normally logical and structured. I fear that he is implying that somehow or other the Secretary of State might try to bring undue influence on, and to distort, the Police Authority's consideration of the Chief Constable's report. There is no evidence to suggest that that has occurred, and it is not the way in which the Secretary of State goes about her business.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I do not suggest that any previous Secretary of State--or the present Secretary of State--has acted in that way, or might seek to do so. It is our responsibility to scrutinise the Bill and to ensure that it is watertight and that circumstances that have not yet happened cannot happen in future. That was the point behind my line of reasoning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall not continue to debate the point with the hon. Gentleman--I understand his argument and I shall try to answer his question as best I can.
<P>
Supporters of the amendments have argued that the Police Authority should have effective control over the report before it goes to the Secretary of State. However, that would substantially diminish the Chief Constable's role in the tripartite structure. He has to report to the Police Authority, which has to consider the report before the Chief Constable sends it to the Secretary of State, who deals with such matters in the House. Our differences are about that system rather than about the need to diminish the role of the Police Authority. We must ensure that the Chief Constable's status is upheld and given due prominence--it must not be seen to be subject to the Police Authority's will. I do not want to use the word ``puppet'' again, but I am sure that Committee members appreciate the logic that might take us there.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said that the Chief Constable was, first and foremost, accountable to the Police Authority. However, the Chief Constable is accountable to the Secretary of State--and, through her, to the public--and he is also accountable before the law. A unique set of requirements are placed on him. It is not helpful to argue that he could be subject to the Police Authority's will. Once the Chief Constable is ready to publish, he should do so in the public domain. He should make it clear that the views expressed are his views and that they have not been filtered through the Police Authority to the Secretary of State. There should be no dilution of his views and no interference should be brought to bear on him. It should be his report, it should contain what he considers to be the best assessment of that year's plan, and it should be published in the public domain. That would correctly elevate his status and it would put him on an equal footing with the other parts of the tripartite system.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness asked why the clause is so prescriptive about the form in which information should be set out. The answer is clear. Information should be given in a form appropriate to the Secretary of State's purposes. With crime statistics, for example, the Secretary of State, who is accountable to Parliament and the wider public for the policing of Northern Ireland, will prescriptively say what information she wants because she knows what she wants to report on. The Police Authority is similarly accountable, and the Chief Constable is accountable for delivering the policing plan and the strategic plan and for ensuring proper, fair and equitable policing for all citizens. The prescriptive element in the clause will ensure that the Secretary of State has the information that she wants in the form in which she wants it.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked to whom the Chief Constable should be accountable, giving the example of a company's board of directors. I must disabuse him of the notion that the Police Authority is equivalent to a board of directors. That would make the Chief Constable subservient to it and there would be no equivalence of responsibility within the tripartite structure.
<P>
In fact, the Police Authority can be more appropriately defined as shareholders who invest for the community and who are responsible for monitoring the Chief Constable and making him accountable to the wider community.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I said, when I gave that analogy, that it was not exact. However, a chairman or chief executive is an equal member of a board of directors. The Opposition are edging towards the equality for two legs of the stool--the Police Authority and the Chief Constable--about which the Minister keeps talking. We do not seek a subservient relationship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> But that is precisely what the amendment will create. We are trying to ensure that the Chief Constable must report to two important parts of the tripartite structure and meet the wider public interest. Reporting simultaneously to the Police Authority and the Secretary of State gives him his own status. The amendment effectively says that he should not report directly to the Secretary of State but should go through the Police Authority.
<P>
There is already a reporting mechanism for the Police Authority, which has a responsibility in all these matters on an equal footing with the other legs of the tripartite structure, each of which has its own areas of responsibility. The Chief Constable has responsibilities to the law, Parliament, taxpayers, the Police Authority and every citizen affected by the actions of officers under his direction. The clause has been constructed to ensure equality for the three strands and to avoid making one subservient to another. Subservient may be too strong a word, but it has been used, and people understand its meaning.
<P>
A filter mechanism would diminish the role of the Chief Constable if it meant that he felt that he was not reporting equally to the Secretary of State and had instead to go through the Police Authority. It is the Secretary of State who must report to the House and the wider United Kingdom public on policing in Northern Ireland. The clause is not intended to elevate the role of the Secretary of State. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire):</B> The Minister has not yet addressed a simple argument. He mentioned the 1996 Act, which covers England and Wales, and argued that the clauses are analogous to sections 22(1) and section 44(4) of that Act. I agree that clauses 47, 48 and 49 have similar wording to those sections.
<P>
We seem constantly to be getting hung up on achieving equivalence among the three parts of the tripartite structure. No one argues that there should be equivalence: indeed, equivalence is not possible, as the Secretary of State is the most important leg of the stool. Certainly, the Bill gives far more power to the Secretary of State than to either of the other two legs of the stool. That is right and proper: the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament.
<P>
In the context of accountability, the Chief Constable can never be on the same level as the Police Authority; one is accountable to the other. The word subservient is inappropriate; I do not know why the Minister uses it. In that context of accountability, one is stronger than, or superior--not the best word to use--to, the other. The Bill attempts to make that clear, by stating in clause 48(1):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall, not later than 3 months after the end of each financial year, submit to the Police Authority a general report on the policing of Northern Ireland during that year.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not say, as it might, that the Chief Constable shall submit to the Police Authority and to the Secretary of State. Why not? It should say that if it is to be an equal submission, but it does not. The interpretation is that it is part of the accountability process: the Chief Constable's report goes to the Police Authority. That is the submission.
<P>
We have already carefully examined the clause that deals with the assessment of how well the Chief Constable has implemented the annual policing plan and of other matters, such as the composition of the police force. Clause 49 largely deals with ad hoc reports by the Chief Constable to the Secretary of State. Under subsection (2)(b), the Chief Constable must respond
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``within the period of one month from the date on which that requirement is made''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Chief Constable cannot hang about: the Secretary of State demands a report and it must be submitted within a month.
<P>
That requirement is new: it is not in the 1996 Act. It does not appear in section 44. The Government argue that we are being presented with something similar, almost identical, to the 1996 Act, but at every twist and turn we find that some things have been left out and others added. Subsection (2)(b), which requires that the Chief Constable respond within a month, does not appear in the legislation for England and Wales, nor in the 1970 Act. Why has it been slipped in? Is the Minister fixated by dates, months and time scales? He will not change the four months specified in clause 47; he will not change the three months specified in clause 48. Clause 49 specifies a period of one month. The time periods are tight, but life is not like that. The wording in earlier legislation for England and Wales is looser; it simply states that reports should be submitted as soon as possible.
<P>
If clause 48 provides for the Chief Constable to submit a report to the Police Authority, why does it not specify that the report should go to the Secretary of State at the same time? That requirement is slipped into a later clause.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Clause 49(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall, at the same time as he submits a report to the Police Authority under section 48(1), submit the same report to the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In his answer, the Minister cited the 1996 Act. But that measure does not use those words. Section 44(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is required by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words ``at the same time'' do not appear. The requirement for the Chief Constable to submit a report simultaneously to the Police Authority and the Secretary of State is new.
<P>
The Police Authority made a reasonable point. The public perceive the accountability of the Police Authority to be on a par with that of the Secretary of State. The Police Authority believes that the Bill should make a distinction, and it suggested the amendments, which the Minister will not accept. He has not discussed the point with the Police Authority. He claims that meetings have been set up but that they have not discussed such subjects yet. The amendments reflect the position of the Police Authority up until this morning. There is some justification in its arguments and in the reasons for the amendments. There is no comparitiveness in the legislation for England and Wales. The Bill introduces new words and a new concept.
<P>
The Minister quoted from the Police Act (Northern Ireland) 1970, under which the report is submitted to the Police Authority, which is asked to send a copy to the Minister. The Chief Constable does not have to send a copy to the Minister at the same time as he submits the report to the Police Authority. The Police Authority has enjoyed a distinction historically. The report mainly deals with the policing plan that the Police Authority has established with the Chief Constable. Therefore, it is right and proper that the Police Authority should be the first recipient of the report. The Government are right in clause 48(1). If they want the Secretary of State to receive the report at the same time, provision for that should be made in clause 48(1), not later in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I listened to the Minister with interest. The debate lasted longer than he would have liked. The group of amendments and the clause that we are considering go to the heart of the difference between the Government and the Opposition. Therefore, it is worth examining the matter in considerable detail.
<P>
I was fascinated by the Minister's assertion that the amendments would affect the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. I cannot deny that. However, the Minister used the word in a pejorative sense. I do not mean pejorative in an offensive way--if the Minister thinks about it, he will understand what I mean. His problem is that relationships are already affected; we are not operating in a vacuum.
<P>
I cannot deny that. However, the Minister used the word in a pejorative sense. I do not mean pejorative in an offensive way--if the Minister thinks about it, he will understand what I mean. His problem is that relationships are already affected; we are not operating in a vacuum.
<P>
I know that I have said it already, but I want to remind the Minister of one short sentence:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Police Authority believe that the role of the authority is diminished.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Minister must ask himself what the ramifications of that are for the future relationship between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. The relationship has already been affected.
<P>
The Committee on the Administration of Justice does not say that the reporting mechanism is a shambles, although it comes close to doing so. It would be unfair of me to use the word shambles, and therefore I will not do so. Part of that reporting mechanism is exactly what is contained in clause 49. I am worried that the Minister does not seem to understand that relationships are already affected.
<P>
Conservative Members did not just want the Minister to read from his brief--although he does a lot of that, and why not?--but to give a reply that would have assuaged the Committee on the Administration of Justice and the Chief Constable, if they had been here. As it is, I fear that they will remain unassuaged.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Wait and see.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> The Minister is being hasty. I was just about to say ``but we will wait and see''. Perhaps the Chief Constable and the Committee will hear, or read, our discussions and they might be convinced. I venture to say that ``I ha'e ma doots''. I do not think that they will be convinced. These are strong statements.
<P>
The Minister did not address himself to the points that my hon. Friends the Members for Basingstoke and for North-East Cambridgeshire and I made. They spoke of the ramifications of the provisions on public perceptions. Conservative Members believe that there will be ramifications: people will have their own perceptions of what the Government are deciding and doing. If Conservative members have got that wrong, we would like to be told.
<P>
The Minister has not answered the point that I raised about how the Police Authority regarded its role under the Bill. The representations that we have received have expressed concern--to put it no higher--on a considerable number of points, of which that was one. The Police Authority is considering the Bill and making judgments about its workability and so on. I would have though that the Minister could also have cantered over that territory.
<P>
I do not want to repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has said; if I do so, it is because I was making notes when he was speaking and heard only bits and pieces of what he said. Clause 48(1) requires the Chief Constable to submit--that is a fairly prescriptive word--a report to the authority by 30 June every year. Neither the Minister, nor anyone else, has said that that diluted the Chief Constable's authority or his ability to operate. However, in clause 49 the Police Authority and we, in Parliament, are asking that the annual report should be submitted--I do not know whether the word is ``submitted''; whatever it is, I am not hung up about it--or presented to the Police Authority one month before publication or onward transmission. If the Minister thinks that that amounts to dilution--I may have missed part of his argument, which I shall read carefully tomorrow--he should explain more carefully why the other instance is not perceived as dilution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman think would happen in that month?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I was coming to that. The Minister always anticipates me, which perhaps means that we sometimes think alike, even though we do not always reach similar conclusions. My view of the provision--and I wrote these words down a while ago, not just because of the Minister's question--is that it is in the nature of a safety valve. I accept, without understanding it, the fact that it is possible to place on it a different construction, as the Minister clearly does. Under that interpretation, the amendment is viewed as making the Chief Constable a vassal of the Police Authority. However, I envisage simply a safety valve in the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. The office of the Secretary of State does not come into that relationship, so I need not mention it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman think the Police Authority would do with the report during the month--just keep it on a desk before transmitting it to the Secretary of State? Or would some change be made to the Chief Constable's report--a practice that the hon. Member for Basingstoke complained about in the context of the Secretary of State's role?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> In my background, communications are extraordinarily important, whether they are between two parties to a contract, employer and employee, Government and Opposition, or Government and the organisations that are affected by legislation. Clearly, good communications are beneficial. I view the amendment as a means of facilitating communication in two directions; between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. I do not perceive all the bogeymen that the Minister does in what I propose. He clearly anticipates conflict, and the generation of heat rather than light between the two parties. That is the difference between us. I think that the amendment would merely help to shed light between the two.
<P>
A good relationship between the Police Authority and the Chief Constable must be the aim of all members of the Committee. We all want a solid foundation for policing in Northern Ireland. I continue to be astonished at the construction that the Government put on a document called an annual report, which simply sets out recent evenets and may, in the company sector which is my background, look forward. That does not seem to be the sort of document that would--I shall avoid using extravagant language--bring about immediate conflict between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.
<P>
I am genuinely perplexed by the Government's attitude on several aspects of the matter, and it would help if the Minister could answer some of my points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I shall confine myself to only a few sentences, as we are in danger of flogging this subject a little far. However, the debate on amendments Nos. 96, 98 and 97 encapsulates a fundamental divide between the two sides of the Committee. I want to put on record my perception of that divide. The Opposition accept that the structure envisaged by the Government for the police service in Northern Ireland is tripartite, and we acknowledge that the Secretary of State must have a certain primacy within it. Our quarrel with the Bill--exemplified by our amendments--is that the relationship between the duties and responsibilities of the three entities is unclearly, inadequately or wrongly defined.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have pressed our argument because we believe that within the tripartite relationship defined in the Bill, the authority, standing and status of the Chief Constable are given insufficient attention. That is our main problem with the Bill. We want the Chief Constable's report to have greater standing, which is why we have argued for so many minutes in favour of a phased delivery of his report so that it can receive the sole attention of the Police Authority for a specified and limited period of time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I want to pick up on a question that the Minister put to my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness because it threw some light on my own logical deliberations. There is some logic in the Police Authority's approach exemplified in the amendment. Clause 47 has the Police Authority issuing its report four months after the end of the financial year. It is then sent straight to the Secretary of State. Under clause 48, the Chief Constable produces a report three months after the end of the financial year.
<P>
The main bone of contention is why that report should go simultaneously to the Secretary of State and to the Police Authority. If the report goes to the Police Authority after three months, it will have an extra month to finalise its report to the Secretary of State. As we argued earlier, the extra month gives the Police Authority the opportunity to see the Chief Constable before it reaches its final conclusion.
<P>
Amendment No. 96 deals with the one month difference and it fits in perfectly with the two different time scale dates that appear in those two clauses. It is logical and sensible to make that provision. It is not that the Police Authority necessarily wants the one month's grace: it considered what was required of it under clause 47 and of the Chief Constable under clause 48; one requirement was three months, the other four. The extra month provides an opportunity to look carefully at the Chief Constable's report before the Police Authority makes its own. There is nothing sinister about it: it is logical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was hoping to reply to some considered detailed points, but we are dealing with the trivia of the debate. I asked the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness what would be done in the extra one-month period and he did not know. It proved that he had not followed the debate because good answers could have been provided to that question. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire pointed out, the Police Authority could exercise a role after it received the report.
<P>
However, whose report is it? It is the Chief Constable's, not the Police Authority's. The Police Authority can of course use it--it is important for that authority to know what the Chief Constable is saying. Under the partnership arrangement, which is part of the tripartite arrangement, the authority can give due consideration to the report and make known its views of the period that is under review.
<P>
The Opposition have not accepted the fact that it will be the Chief Constable's report. In one sense, it does not matter what the 1970 Act said--although that Act did not give the Police Authority the power to publish a report. We shall give it that power and, by adding to its powers, we are improving on the 1970 Act. We have clarified the position--and the meaning of the word ``transmit''--in clause 49(4).
<P>
We could discuss this matter interminably all evening. As I have said, the Opposition have not accepted that the report will be the Chief Constable's. He is responsible not to the Police Authority alone but also to the Secretary of State, and the Opposition do not like that. We have already discussed the fact that they want to exclude completely the Secretary of State from the structure or to diminish her role.
<P>
What is wrong with the Chief Constable submitting his report to the Secretary of State the minute that he publishes it? Clause 48(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Chief Constable shall arrange for a report submitted under subsection (1) to be published in such manner as appears to him to be appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When the Chief Constable submits the report to the Police Authority and to the Secretary of State, I am sure that he would want the public to be made aware of it. He does not need the filter, which will have a different purpose, in that it will assist the Police Authority to come to a conclusion on its report. The Chief Constable's report is one part of the reporting mechanism and the Police Authority's report is another part. It is better for the Police Authority to build on the Chief Constable's report. However, that in itself does not mean that the Secretary of State should not see the report or--importantly--that the public should not be made aware of it. It is sad that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has greatly misunderstood the Police Authority's role, but we may be able to explain all the system's benefits in the working groups. If we had done so earlier, we could have avoided this somewhat extended debate. The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that a fundamental matter is involved. We should now vote on the amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Cran:</B> That is for us to decide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> There can be no other conclusion. Clearly, the Opposition do not accept my explanations, and I have nothing new to say to them. I could discuss in detail some of the points that have been made, but I have tried to clarify the substantial issues for the Opposition--and for the Police Authority, if and when it receives the Official Report of our debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> We are approaching the end of our deliberations; there is no doubt about that. The Minister said--and I wrote down his words--that the report would be the Chief Constable's. I must say to him, eyeball to eyeball, as it were, that we do not contest that--our argument is about what will subsequently happen to the report. Rather mischievously, the Minister tried to misconstrue my comments. He said that when he asked me about the point of the whole exercise I gave him an answer. He may not have liked my answer, but he must accept it. My answer was that the process facilitates communication. The Minister did not get my point the first time so I hope that he will get it this time. Our amendments would facilitate communication between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. That is an extraordinary good point, not a bad one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I invite my hon. Friend to elaborate. The Chief Constable will report on the previous 12 months. The Police Authority will be in the process of forward thinking and re-evaluating priorities for the next 12 months. It is reasonable that the authority should have time to deliberate on the Chief Constable's report free from outside influence. That means, of course, the influence of the Secretary of State, but it includes media influence too. If the report is to be made public, it is right that the Police Authority should have time to prepare coolly, calmly and in solitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> I understand my hon. Friend and I hope that the Minister has been listening to him.
<P>
The Minister rather rhetorically asked to whom the Chief Constable is responsible and said, as the record will show, that it was not solely to the Police Authority. I thought that an interesting revelation of his views. The Minister's parliamentary private secretary, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson) laughs. She has not contributed to the debate. These are important issues and we want to get to the heart of them. The Minister will be delighted to hear that there will not be a debate of this length on all the groups of amendments.
<P>
The Minister has conceded that the Chief Constable is, in a sense, responsible to the Police Authority. The sort of relationship that we want between those two entities would not give rise to the problems that clearly loom large in the Minister's mind.
<P>
The Minister chose to misrepresent my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke and to tease him. The Minister was wrong to do that as he gave a mistaken impression of what the Opposition believe. The Minister is trying to say that this is a teeny weeny point and that we are dancing on the head of a pin. However, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and I have said that clause 49, like others clauses, is about the relationship between the two entities that we have spent so long discussing. The Minister must concede that that relationship is important. If he will not, we will go in other directions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We have been accused of misunderstanding the Bill. The Minister said that he thought that the Police Authority must also have misunderstood the Bill when it submitted its amendments. Another eminent contributor, Dr. Maurice Hayes--to whose report on the ombudsman we shall come in the next section--said on page 81 that--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be brief. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make a speech later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cran:</B> We shall all look forward to hearing later what we have been prevented from hearing now, Miss Widdecombe. I laid a silent bet with myself on whether you would allow a long intervention. It is perfectly obvious that you will not.
<P>
The Minister has failed to address many of my points, but I shall mention two. First, he did not address my point on public perception, and we must draw our own conclusions. Secondly, he did not answer my point on what members of the Police Authority perceive to be its rather diminished future role. I do not have answers to that. In sorrow rather than anger--I could never be angry with the Minister; I have said more than once that I think that I like him immensely, even though he tries to be acerbic every now and again--I am disappointed that he has not addressed the real concerns of those who have submitted representations to us and to his colleagues.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I shall finish the quote which I started in my intervention. Dr. Maurice Hayes, a third party to the Police Authority and the CAJ, refers to the relationship between the Chief Constable and the Police Authority. Paragragh 18.17 of his report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Operational issues should be a matter for the Chief Constable, answerable to the Police Authority. Operational independence is valid only within a framework of accountability in which the Chief Constable justifies his stewardship of these substantial powers to the Authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not think that it could be any clearer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That is not the point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> It is absolutely the point. It places the Chief Constable's report in juxtaposition to his accountability to the Police Authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I tried to express my incredulity to that. We have tried to demonstrate that the Bill specifies the Police Authority's accountability and stewardship, relative to what the Chief Constable does on behalf of the public. We have argued consistently about the operational independence of the Chief Constable.
<P>
The hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness and for North-East Cambridgeshire have not accepted that the report is the Chief Constable's report. It is up to him to decide what happens to it. The hon. Gentlemen's and, I assume, the Police Authority are arguing that the Police Authority should get the report and hold it for a month. That would deny the public, to whom the Chief Constable also has a responsibility, the knowledge of what he wants to say to them. Why dilute the power, responsibility and reporting mechanisms of the Chief Constable? That is the nub of the argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire kept on about time limits in the clauses. They are there because the Police Authority wanted them. I intimated in relation to clause 47 that we would consider the basis of the precise time limits but not the principle of them. I accept that the Police Authority might not like the precise time limits in the Bill, but they are subject to further consideration.
<P>
We have reached a fundamental disagreement. Clearly the hon. Members for Beverley and Holderness and for North-East Cambridgeshire are not convinced of my argument, and I am not convinced of theirs. I suspect that we may have to vote on the amendment.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 50</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation of this Part</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I should like to explain why the clause is important to part VII of the Bill, which covers police complaints and disciplinary proceedings. The clause interprets each of the various elements and concepts that arise in subsequent clauses and it is important that the terms are properly defined. Part VII meets the main principles set out by Dr. Hayes in his report, to which the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred earlier, for the complaints system. The definitions help us to understand the detailed proposals made in that report.
<P>
We all want a system in which the public first and foremost, but, importantly, also the RUC, have confidence. That system must be one in which the Chief Constable is responsible for the discipline of the force, with the Police Authority being responsible for senior officers and the Secretary of State having an appellant role. That is an easily understood and accessible set of principles, which were defined by Dr. Hayes in his report. The proposals provide for a system that allows independent investigation, which is important because it is a key safeguard for everyone involved--the public and the police. It is a system that reflects the main thrust of Dr. Hayes's recommendation, which he defined as independence. Part VI of the executive summary of his report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Independence should be demonstrated by the person . . . concerned having control of the process: the power to decide what is a complaint, the power to intervene in the public interest, the power to decide how and by whom the complaint should be investigated and the power to recommend action to the relevant authorities.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>This part of the Bill meets both the principles and recommendations of Dr. Maurice Hayes and the definitions in clause 50 refer to the various elements. The guidelines and recommendations are to be complemented by regulations and guidance from project groups involving all the relevant bodies: the police, the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, the Police Authority and staff representative bodies. Those project groups have, unfortunately, not yet started their work and some of the definitions in the clause may be subject to further clarification. I do not know whether the Committee will enter a detailed and tortuous debate on the clause and the meaning of words, but the project groups are not yet up and running because the officials who are serving me in that Committee are those who will serve on the project groups and it is not easy for them to do both at the same time.
<P>
Clause 50 provides an interpretation of the terms used in part VII of the Bill, including ``complaint'', ``disciplinary proceedings'' and ``officer of the Ombudsman''. ``Serious complaint'', which the Ombudsman must investigate, covers conduct resulting in death or serious injury. ``Officer of the Ombudsman'' includes civilians, civil servants on secondment, Royal Ulster Constabulary or British Officers on temporary service or providing assistance--for example, making door-to-door inquiries. ``Complaint'' is defined to include complaints about both police conduct and policy issues and we shall debate that when we come to clause 52, which covers policy matters.
<P>
I have tried to explain quickly the main thrust of the clause, and to give a brief overview of why it--and, more importantly, part VII of the Bill--is important. I hope that we can have a good and healthy debate about the principles that are set out in part VII of the Bill, and about the individual elements of clause 50.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> We welcome the Minister's comments and acknowledge that part VII is an important part of the Bill. We accept in the main the thrust of the recommendations by Dr. Maurice Hayes. The report was set up under the aegis of the previous Government, and it is interesting that most of its recommendations have been accepted.
<P>
	The clause deals with definitions and although I do not intend to get into semantics, I have one small query. The Minister might not be able to give me an immediate answer, and it might be one of those instances--alluded to by the Minister--in which it is necessary for the working group to consider the definitions more closely to put meat on the bones. What especially struck me was the definition--if I may call it that--of a serious complaint. The definition under (a) is obvious, but the definition of a serious complaint under (b) as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of such other description as may be prescribed''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is less clear. The word ``prescribed'' refers to regulations prescribed under clause 64, but that clause does not make it clear that any regulations can be laid by the Secretary of State to prescribe the nature of a serious complaint. No doubt the definition will be improved at some stage so that everybody knows exactly what a serious complaint is in a legal sense. That definition is important as it will affect where the ombudsman sends the complaint.
<P>
<B>Mr. Seamus Mallon </B>(Newry and Armagh): I shall try to expand on the points made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. I also have doubts about the distinction between the definitions of serious complaints and--if I may term them so--tripartite complaints. The distinction is arbitrary, and as the debate proceeds we will find substantial difficulties inherent in it.
<P>
	I hope to elaborate on my points with clarity at a later stage, but as we debate this part of the Bill I hope that we will not become worked up about project groups. I see all the signs of various elements of an Act of Parliament being explained increasingly in terms of regulations and what might happen in consultation and project groups. It is crucial that, given the nature of the Bill and the time at which it is being considered, we have the clearest possible understanding and as few escape hatches as possible.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I should like to reinforce the hon. Gentleman's point. One of the essential achievements--it is an objective first, but must be an achievement--is to establish and maintain mutual confidence in the whole system and functions of the police ombudsman. That confidence must be shared by the police and public. Thinking from the point of view of the police here, I am struck by the vagueness of the definition of a serious complaint under (b) as being
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of such other description as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I endorse the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshrie and by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon). If we are to achieve that balanced, mutual confidence, there must be clarity. I fear that there is too much vagueness and lack of definition in clause 50 as drafted. It is not a sound basis on which to attempt to build the mutual confidence of police and public.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): My party has made it clear that we welcome clause 50 and the creation of a complaints system that will be independent and that, we hope, will create confidence in society and among police officers. However, I agree with hon. Members who are worried about the definition in line 10 of page 25. I do not want to repeat what has already been said, but I believe that the vagueness of the definition will present unnecessary future difficulties--unnecessary because the terms could be more carefully defined.
<P>
I am also worried about the definition of ``complainant''. The term itself does not give me difficulty, but as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``
`complainant' means the person by, or on behalf of whom, a complaint is made'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I look for a definition of that third person, who frequently pops up as the alleged spokesperson for someone who has a complaint. One of the difficulties that the Independent Commission for Police Complaints experienced in the past is that complaints are easily made on behalf of an alleged complainant. However, when an attempt is made to examine the complaint, the complainant frequently--I cannot say ``more often than not'' as I cannot provide any figures--tends to imply that he did not authorise a complaint being made on his behalf. That leads to a false impression about the extent of genuine complaints that are made against the RUC.
<P>
It would have been helpful to have a definition of those third parties, who act on behalf of complainants, but I cannot find it in the Bill. The Bill should include a definition that would not dissuade genuine complainants or their agents from using the system, but might go some way to prevent complainants or, especially, their agents from abusing the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hesford </B>(Wirral, West): Part VII--dealing with the new complaints procedure--is widely welcomed in Committee. Is the hon. Gentleman not confusing the old discredited system with the new one? Does he not agree that greater confidence will emerge under the new system? He spoke about third-party complaints turning out to be on behalf of people who did not want to complain, but under the old system the subject of the complaints often did not want to carry on because he or she did not want to be part of the complaints procedure. People were reticent about coming forward themselves, although others were prepared to do that on their behalf.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> That sounds a little like one of my interventions!
<P>
<B>Mr. Hesford:</B> Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> When the hon. Gentleman tries to put a case, it is best to try to get the premise correct. If that is wrong, irrespective of the logic, the argument will fall down. The hon. Gentleman says that the complaints procedure in Northern Ireland in the past had become a discredited system, but that is far from the truth. The past system was successful. It worked well enough for people to want to improve the deficiencies that were deemed to exist within it, which is entirely different from it being a discredited system.
<P>
We should pay tribute to James Grew, the chairman of the ICPC, and others who served on the body and contributed so substantially to a process that has served the people of Northern Ireland well over a considerable period. I repudiate the idea that the fault lay exclusively with a discredited system. We must examine the Northern Ireland context in which the system operated. For many reasons, it appeared at times inadequate to society's requirements. One reason for that was the presence in Northern Ireland of some well-organised people whose political objective was to discredit the Royal Ulster Constabulary and everything pertaining to and peripheral to the police force--whether the Police Authority or the Independent Commission for Police Complaints.
<P>
In pursuit of the objective of discrediting the RUC, the complaints process is abused by those who are organised to attend every potential flashpoint, and to submit complaints on others' behalf. Those others might be young people with too much alcohol, who behave unwisely and find themselves in confrontation with the police. In sobriety they consider their position and recognise the problems that they have brought on themselves. They are often surprised to find that someone has on their behalf pursued a complaint that they, in a sober state, realise is unjustified. It can happen that someone, bolstered by alcoholic beverage, will make a complaint in person and then withdraw it. I have no difficulty with that. That was not the point that I was making. I hope that the hon. Member for Wirral, West (Mr. Hesford) recognises the point that I am making about third parties to the process.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The hon. Gentleman is understating his case. The primary reason for the fact that in some circles the Independent Commission for Police Complaints became discredited was precisely such third-party complaints on behalf of someone else. Although there may be strong objective, dispassionate and academic arguments for the creation of a police ombudsman, that plan has the same inner flaw as the system that it would replace. We may be going from the frying pan to the fire.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I entirely accept that. Incidentally, the hon. Gentleman used the term discredited, and I think that he meant to use the words ``allegedly discredited''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Yes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I wanted to help the hon. Gentleman on that point.
<P>
If we create a system that is patently open to such abuse as took place under the previous system, we shall fail society, the ombudsman who will be appointed and the police--who are the most vulnerable within the system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I note with interest the point that the hon. Members for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) and for Basingstoke made. The phrase ``failing society'' was used. Clause 52(4) refers specifically to the subject that we are considering. The opportunity to amend that provision might have been taken. How could one, by amendment or definition, both establish the right to have a complaint made on one's behalf and tackle those who might be tempted to make spurious complaints?
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> The hon. Gentleman and I are probably largely on the same side on the issue. I do not know the answer to his question. I have not invented a word. Perhaps it could be ``agent''. I am not worried about that, but I want to emphasise the necessity of eradicating a flaw that existed because some people were politically, and sometimes emotionally, motivated to presume to act on behalf of someone they deemed should be a complainant. It wold have been helpful if the draftsmen could have provided a definition of such people. Steps could have been taken in the Bill, or further legislation could have been produced, to deal with the problem.
<P>
I do not underestimate the difficulty of tackling the problem. If we go too far down the road that I propose, we run the risk of being accused of trying to inhibit genuine complaints. Therefore, I do not disagree strongly with the Minister. I merely want to draw the difficulty to his attention. As long as it is not tackled, the problem will lead to the impression that the hon. Member for Wirral, West had of the previous system. He believed that it was discredited. We could find ourselves in the same position.
<P>
I leave it to the Minister to enlighten us about whether the specific difficulty can be tackled. If we could eliminate or lessen it, we could have a complaints system that was better for society and the Royal Ulster Constabulary--that vulnerable element within society.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal with one or two of the main points that have been made. Some of the other points will come back again and again as we discuss further clauses and their amendments.
<P>
The main point by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire and the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh was about ``serious complaint'' and how that was defined. Clause 50 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```serious complaint' means a complaint--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) alleging that the conduct complained of resulted in the death of, or serious injury to, some person; or
<P>
(b) of such other description as may be prescribed.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>It then goes on to define ``serious injury'' as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a fracture, damage to an internal organ or impairment of bodily function.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In this part of the Bill, we have tried to set out the range of known serious injuries that would relate to a serious complaint. However, as we cannot envisage every possible eventuality, we need the provision in paragraph (b):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``of such other description as may be prescribed''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We can deal with that by regulation if required. Paragraph (b) gives flexibility in the implementation of the legislation.
<P>
It is sensible to provide latitude in the legislation, which can then be prescribed by regulation. When the Bill becomes an Act, it would be difficult to amend it through primary legislation.
<P>
Mr. Hesford
<P>
: Is not the definition of serious injury too narrow? It does not seem to deal with the prospect of mental injury.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My hon. Friend has proved my case by making that point. If we defined everything in the Bill, we would be here all night, and for many other nights, discussing amendments about definitions. We need to establish a balance between legislation and the use of regulation for the known concepts of serious injury and new concepts that might be developed.
<P>
I understand what my hon. Friend is referring to, but such matters are difficult to define and might become contentious. If a limb has been broken, or there has been damage to an internal organ, or impairment of a bodily function, that can be confirmed. There is usually contradictory evidence about mental impairment, although there was the recent example in which someone who had been held in one of Her Majesty's prisons was not extradited because of mental impairment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke said that the Bill is vague. I do not agree. It takes definitions from existing legislation and transposes them flexibly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone spoke about the third-party element in relation to the definition of complainant. Complainant is defined in clause 50(1) as meaning
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the person by, or on behalf of whom, a complaint is made''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have set out a series of arguments. In dealing with the point, Dr. Maurice Hayes recommended that that concept should remain as it is in the 1987 order, allowing solicitors, political representatives and others to complain for someone else.
<P>
If the hon. Gentleman is saying that there will be a plethora of third-party representations, let me give him some figures. In December 1997 there were 60 complaints from solicitors, representing 36 per cent. of all complaints, and none from any other third party. In the whole of 1997 there were 3,108 complaints, one of which came from a third party who was not a solicitor. Solicitors made 1,294, or 42 per cent., of all complaints. Complaints from Members of Parliament and councillors on behalf of others amounted to seven--or 0&#183;2 per cent. of the total.
<P>
Those statistics hardly support the argument that third parties other than those whom one would expect to make complaints--Members of Parliament and councillors, who make a few, and solicitors who, as might be expected, make many--will come forward.
<P>
In cases where there is no evidence to back a complaint--even if from a third party--the ombudsman can establish that in preliminary investigations and can curtail further investigation without being accused, as the police are, of giving up on cases. The ombudsman is being given a new investigative role and can say whether a case is frivolous or vexatious, or is a repeat complaint with no substance. The ombudsman has the power to curtail such an investigation.
<P>
Under existing procedures the RUC would curtail investigation, inviting unwarranted but easily made allegations of a cover-up. Some newspaper or journalist will always say that a legitimate complaint by a third party is being covered up by the RUC. They will not be able to get away with that with an independent ombudsman, who will be able to show by the rigour with which he acts that he is dealing seriously with all complaints.
<P>
There is no need to define third parties in the Bill. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has such a definition; he seeks others who can draw up one for him. I have set out the reasons why we have not produced one. If he has one, I am, as usual, prepared to listen to it. However, I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has a solid argument. I hope that we can proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I want to make three points about what has been said by the Minister and others.
<P>
First, the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone raised a point about third-party complaints. As someone who, over many years in my representative capacity, has made many complaints as a third party on behalf of others, I can say that some were spurious, but very few. Many were not proceeded with because once the complainants--especially young people--discovered that the investigation would be carried out by the people against whom the complaint had been made, they saved themselves any further difficulties by saying, ``Oh, forget it,'' and dropped it. That was probably the biggest factor. I do not deny that there have been spurious complaints, but very few. That attitude accounts for the biggest number in the category.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
For that reason, the definitions of the terms ``serious'', and therefore also ``less serious'', are crucial. That point will crop up throughout our consideration of the Bill. An offence could be serious not because of bodily injury but because there was a breach of confidence between a citizen and a member of the police service that will carry out the investigation into complaints against him. Unless we define ``serious'' properly, we cannot define ``less serious''. That could cause problems in the Bill, as it has done in previous legislation. We face the perennial question of what to do when those against whom an accusation is made investigate the complaint.
<P>
Since the establishment of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints, I have found its staff to be remarkably diligent and committed to their work. It was not their fault that Parliament did not give them sufficient powers to deal with some of the problems that they face, or that political agencies appointed people whose experience of life did not allow them to comprehend what was happening on the sides of roads and streets in the north of Ireland.
<P>
Given the nature of the legislation, the clause should contain somewhere--any little place would do--a definition of the word ``independent'' that refers to the ombudsman. That is a quibble--a small point about definitions--but it would have helped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I thank the Minister for his helpful figures. I am astonished that 42 per cent. of the occasions on which complaints were made, the third party turned out to be a member of the legal profession. Unfortunately, in Northern Ireland, it is the nature of some people to try to disrupt administration, and we tend to be litigious. There are people in the legal profession who are the equivalent of what are known in the United States as ambulance chasers--they seek out the business to which we alluded earlier because they realise that there could be something in it for them.
<P>
I do not expect the Minister to have the information, but I must ask him a lighthearted question about the 42 per cent. of the more than 3,000 cases. How many solicitors' firms or solicitors were involved in bringing those 42 per cent. of cases on behalf of third parties? I do not want the Minister to go to any undue expense to answer that, but I think that a comparatively small group of people act for third parties. He may not be able to answer that.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 51</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 41, in page 25, line 21, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) The Ombudsman's role shall be characterised by his independent control of the police complaints system, through which he shall promote high standards of police conduct, and public and police confidence in the independence and impartiality of that system.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the reasons why I tabled the amendment relates to what I said about the terminology in clause 50. It is crucial that the independence of the ombudsman's office should be written into the primary parts of the Bill that deal with police complaints. It is essential that nothing in the Bill would or could put the complete independence of the ombudsman in question. In paragraph 11.2 of his report, Dr. Maurice Hayes made it clear that everyone he spoke to thought that there were three words of importance--independence, independence and independence That element is essential.
<P>
Groundbreaking legislation--and the proposed ombudsman's role, in Northern Ireland terms, is groundbreaking--should articulate the founding principles on which it is based in the preamble to the Bill. There is a precedent for that in health and social services orders and in the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, in which the primacy of a child's welfare is set out as a touchstone for the rest of the order. The amendment aims to establish a touchstone for police complaints.
<P>
The touchstone for the police ombudsman, as Dr. Hayes's report clearly states, is independence. The purpose of that independence is to ensure standards of conduct and confidence. I cannot think of any two factors that could be more beneficial to the issue in Northern Ireland than standards of conduct and confidence. I hope that the amendment encapsulates those themes. If adopted, it would embody in the Bill up front, not hidden, the principles by which the ombudsman will order his or her work and the criteria by which he or she will be judged.
<P>
Embodying the concept of independence in the Bill will also serve as a defence against any unwarranted interference and possible infringement of that independence on the part of others. It is beneficial to embody that in the Bill because we are not discussing an ordinary board or trust that will be appointed by the Government. The appointment will not even be in the same category as the Police Authority, on which we had an interesting debate, because the independence of the person appointed will be essential to the success of the Bill. That person will need to be strong enough to take on the vested interests in the police service, among representatives of policing, and all related areas.
<P>
During an interesting debate earlier we heard about the sensitivity concering the division of authority, power, responsibility and accountability between the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State and the Police Authority. The clause is different because there are not three legs to the stool. One person will have one powerful weapon at his or her disposal--the ultimate and absolute independence of the office. Some will say that the Bill shows that the office will be independent and that commitments will be given to ensure that it will be independent, but the only commitment that is worth its salt is a commitment in the Bill. The more one reads the Bill, the more one realises the need for a declaration of intent to be included on independence.
<P>
That independence is required not for churlish reasons but to enable independent action, which is crucial to promote a high standard of police conduct and police confidence in the independence and impartiality of the system. It is crucial at the present stage of development to establish a beacon that shines from the Bill and Parliament. There should be no ``tricky Dicky'' elements which allow the key issue of independence to be avoided. For that reason, I was intrigued by the reference to a three-legged stool in an earlier debate, but it was not really about that. I was also intrigued by an all-day debate yesterday at the all-party talks, in which the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and I took part. We know that a wind of change is blowing. It would be remarkable if all members of the Committee read the paper that was presented at the talks yesterday. There will be fundamental changes; this is one. Let it be the harbinger--

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to a document that was presented at the talks yesterday. Was it a document entitled ``The Principles of Policing in Northern Ireland''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> It probably was. I was furnished with a typewritten version; I am not one for glossy brochures, as hon. Members might have guessed. If that is the document, it is well worth a read and consideration.
<P>
As I was saying, this must be a harbinger of the mood and the need for change. It can be done through the clause; to include that little sentence could be the Bill's declaration of intent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> If I have counted them correctly, it is for the greater part of 15 years that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh and I in innumerable debates on Northern Ireland matters have exchanged opinions. Certainly, on some occasions we have agreed; I regret that there have not been more. This is one of those occasions: I agree strongly with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh.
<P>
I must confess that I continue to have some misgivings about the creation of the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland. That is clearly a minority view. The hon. Member for Wirral, West is no longer in his seat, but I challenge his assertion that the Committee unanimously accepts the police ombudsman. Nevertheless, Dr. Maurice Hayes unambiguously concludes in his report that the current system lacks credibitility becuase it lacks independence. I am prepared to apply my thinking to his conclusion. However, I also note that Dr. Hayes utters words of caution, which, I assure you, Miss Widdecombe, are strictly related to the amendment.
<P>
Dr. Hayes's words of caution are that public confidence should not be gained at the expense of police confidence. That is the all-important balance that must be maintained. It is the criterion by which we judge the clause and amendments to it. We can judge the merits of the clause and amendments to it by whether they maintain that balance between maintaining public and police confidence.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh; his amendment passes that litmus test and therefore enhances the Government's wish. My first point in support of the amendment is that it does precisely what I have just said. It is entirely consistent with, and enhances, the Government's intentions in clause 1. The Government are seeking to create a police ombudsman who controls the process by which complaints are handled. The amendment requires that the ombudsman's role should be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``characterised by his independent control of the police complaints system''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The emphasis, as I read it, is on the word ``control''. Secondly, the amendment rightly stresses that the ombudsman should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``promote high standards of police conduct''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is ultimately the purpose of having the ombudsman. The ombudsman should ensure the continuation of the promotion of high standards as, all things considered, there is generally--and has been generally--a remarkably high standard of police conduct in Northern Ireland. There is no valid objection to the inclusion of the amendment in the Bill.
<P>
Thirdly, the amendment specifies the importance of establishing and maintaining mutual confidence--of ``public and police''--in the complaints system and the workings of the ombudsman. Such confidence is self-evidently necessary. Some people would--and do--argue that the absence of such confidence is the reason for the suggestion that the police ombudsman should be introduced and that the independent commission for police complaints should be abolished. I have some reservations about that argument, but the essential point is that mutual confidence must be established.
<P>
Fourthly, the amendment specifies that that mutual confidence should be manifested in the ``independence and impartiality'' of the complaints system. Surely that is the raison d'etre of the proposed office and function of the police ombudsman and the amendment is therefore also consistent with the Government's aspirations in that respect.
<P>
Amendment No. 41 is essentially a mission statement for the office and function of the police ombudsman. In that respect, it has parallels elsewhere in the Bill. Clause 2 contains what one might call a mission statement, which describes the general functions of the Police Authority. It could be argued that clause 14 contains a mission statement for the Secretary of State, as it prescribes her role in setting police objectives and performance targets. Similarly, clause 16 could be regarded as a mission statement for the Chief Constable in outlining his strategic police planning role. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh therefore completes the pattern by providing a mission statement for the other essential ingredient in the policing of Northern Ireland.
<P>
In setting out the ombudsman's role, the amendment matches those earlier clauses that outline the functions of the Police Authority, the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. There are strong arguments for the inclusion of the amendment in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> In respect of the amendment, I shall begin by alluding to the way in which the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh approached his argument. Over many years I have come to recognise the hon. Gentleman as, at least metaphorically, a poker player. I can recognise poker players.
<P>
Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman from the outset that I am not going to disagree with him to any great extent, but he played a clever game in alluding to the talks process in which he and I were engaged yesterday and saying, ``Remember.'' The inference was that the political opposition know exactly what it is that they are defending. He suggested that the nationalist political interest was not engaged in the poker-playing role, as though we would not recognise his point.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, which emphasises the independence of the ombudsman, is not unacceptable in stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Ombudsman's role shall be characterised by his independent control of the police complaints system...and public and police confidence in the independence and impartiality of that system.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, a phrase in the middle has been slipped in, stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``through which he shall promote high standards of police conduct''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If there is one thing that the independent chairman will not do, it is to ``promote'' anything. It may be that as he carries out his work efficiently, awareness of the standards set by others for the RUC will become more apparent. However, the ombudsman will not ``promote'' anything within the police service, because doing so would be to extend his role to interfering in policy and operational issues. That would detract from rather than enhance his independence. While I agree with the tenor and intent of the amendment, I oppose it because of its phrasing.
<P>
The emphasis on the word ``independent'' suggests a belt-and-braces approach. Dr. Maurice Hayes, in suggesting who might serve as the police ombudsman, said that the post should be full time, and that it should be filled by a judge or a person of the quality and experience of a senior judicial figure.
<P>
Many of us have concluded that the ombudsman will at the outset be someone of exactly that sort. We will be reassured by the fact that, although things can go wrong--the judicial process has on a limited number of occasions gone wrong, not just in the difficult circumstances of Northern Ireland, but in Great Britain--the vast majority of people in both traditions have felt great confidence in the judicial system. The route suggested by Dr. Maurice Hayes, of choosing a judge or someone with the experience of a senior judicial figure, will lead to the necessary, almost innate, degree of independence being exercised in the post.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I take him back several paragraphs. I have been considering the objection that he raised to the phrase ``promote high standards'' in the amendment. I do not necessarily quarrel with him, but I should appreciate further comment. The ombudsman would initiate the consideration of complaints, which in some instances would be resolved and action taken as a result. On first reading the words ``promote high standards'', I interpreted them to mean that the ombudsman's rulings would promote high standards. That would not be a departure from that narrow role.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. Such a wording could be used loosely to define an intention, but in legislation the word ``promote'' strikes me as having a proactive connotation, requiring a specific activity from the person who is to do the promoting. I want to establish what interpretation would be acceptable. The hon. Member for Basingstoke will recall that I was careful to express the idea that the ombudsman should be detached, day to day, from the policy or operational aspects of policing. I hope that he will be content if I leave it at that. The tenor of amendment No. 41 is not unacceptable to Ulster Unionists, but we resist the current wording.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I have a slightly different view from those that have been expressed. We can make too much of precise wording. The word ``independent'' has different connotations and meanings for different people. The ombudsman will be independent; it is in the nature of his task. Therefore, I am cautious about going overboard and accepting the amendment that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh has tabled. It could be inferred from it that not specifying ``independent'' on the statute book would mean that the ombudsman was not independent. I refute that strongly.
<P>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke presented strong arguments about previous clauses and various mission statements for the Chief Constable and the Secretary of State. He described the amendment as a mission statement, and I appreciate the logic of his argument. I was going to propose that the substance of the amendment should be included in a mission statement. None the less, I appreciate the arguments that the hon. Gentleman presented.
<P>
I do not want to be ungenerous to the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh, but his words implied that suspicion would remain about the ombudsman if the word ``independent'' did not appear in the clause. The ombudsman will not be judged by a description in the Bill, but by the way in which he or she carries out the duties for which the measure provides. If they are undertaken with the full vigour that we expect, the ombudsman will be wholly independent.
<P>
I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment. I never intended to accept it as a whole, but having listened to the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone--although I do not accept all his views--I shall consider it further and return to it on Report. I shall take account of all the points that have been made, and I assure the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh that I shall table an amendment on Report. Therefore I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mallon:</B> In the interests of everyone, and with the same grace that the Minister offered, I accept some of his points. I shall await Report stage. I have made the point, however inadequately, and I look forward to the Minister's response.
<P>
I claim no sanctity for the words of the amendment. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone found fault with the word ``promote''; I could suggest ``ensure'', ``foster'' or ``inspire'' as a way around the problem.
<P>
One issue worries me. There is almost a convergence--if I can use a paradox-- of the points made by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and the Minister. The hon Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone said that the quality of the person selected would confer the independence of the office. I hope that I do not misunderstand the hon. Gentleman, but if that is his position, I cannot agree with it. In public life, I do not accept that the quality of the person confers anything on the office except those qualities that are rooted in the requirements of office. That is fair comment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone earlier referred to metaphorical poker. The one thing that none of us does in a poker game is to by a pig in a poke. One plays the value of the hand and there is nothing metaphorical about that, and nothing is taken on trust because poker is that type of game. My experiences do not lead me to accept that the quality of the person--and I do not doubt that it will be a person of quality--would confer independence on the office.
<P>
I do not accept what I understood the Minister to say. He will correct me if my understanding was wrong. He said that the office itself would confer independence on the holder. That is true, if that independence stems from only one place: not the quality of the office, nor of the person, but of the legislation upon which it is created. There is the rub. I do not want to overplay this hand--to extend the metaphor--but I repeat that that will be a difficult task. There are huge, political vested interests in the north of Ireland, because of the unique experiences there. The vested interests within the police service itself should not be underestimated, nor should those of the Police Federation. There are vested interests within the legal profession. The police ombudsman must be armed with all the advantages of definition within the legislation.
<P>
However, I take the Minister's assurance on these matters with the good grace in which it was given. I look forward to Report and, as they would say in the game of poker, we will take it from there. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
