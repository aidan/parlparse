                           </span> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship once again, Mr Gale. Before
we adjourned I was talking about the additional costs faced by the
state as a result of young people going into care and how we can
mitigate some of those deleterious effects and look to support young
care leavers and those within the care system. In the long run, that
may save the Government money, whether in benefits or additional costs
to the NHS, council services or costs for those young people who
unfortunately may end up in prison as a result of their difficult start
in life, which is through no fault of their own.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I was asking
whether the Government had made any assessment of those long-term costs
and what measures could be put in place to mitigate the effects of
those negative outcomes for young people. I was also saying that I do
not for one moment suggest that a savings scheme will solve all of
those problems. However, young people in the care system and those
leaving care often face significant disadvantage, do not have families
to fall back on and do not have a nest egg, so it is important that
they receive the support that they need through the scheme that the
Government are introducing. That is why it is vital that we receive
proper information 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 372<a class="bkMark" name="Column372">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and proper detail to allow us to scrutinise the Government’s
proposals and to make sure that they are implemented to best
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern is that, according to the Treasury’s impact assessment
of the junior ISA, only 20% of children will benefit from the new
scheme and no distributional analysis has been provided. However, it is
fair to assume that the young people who will benefit from the scheme
will unfortunately not necessarily be those in care or care leavers,
who struggle to gain access to a range of services that other young
people may ordinarily access. So I hope that the Government can provide
some further information on what distributional analysis has been done,
whether young people in care will be properly supported through this
new scheme, and whether those who will benefit will come from low and
middle-income families.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As my right
hon. Friend the Member for Delyn described at length this morning, our
concern is that those who benefit may be those who would save
anyway—those whose families are able to save—and that the
proposal is simply a tax break for such families. We want to encourage
saving across the board, particularly in families on low and middle
incomes. They may be finding it incredibly difficult to save at the
moment with the squeeze on their living costs through the VAT rise and
the rising price of fuel and reduced wages, but even small amounts of
savings can make a big difference to a child’s life when they
reach 18 and need that money to fall back
on.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
gave an example in an intervention of a case study in the report by
Barnardo’s and Action for Children. A young woman was in and out
of the care system through most of her teenage years and was awarded
compensation after being involved in a car accident. As a result of
that compensation she was able to buy a car and to go to university and
move on with her life. That is something we all want. We all want to
see young people able to progress, aspire and achieve the best that
they possibly can. But for some young people that is more difficult
than for others. That is certainly the case for care leavers, but it is
also the case unfortunately for many people from low and middle-income
backgrounds who do not always have that financial nest egg to fall back
on or families who can support them
financially.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
discussed this morning the costs of university and tuition fees and
whether people might put those savings towards university education. We
also had some exchanges about the scheme that the Government have
brought in. I will not speak at length about that, but the point that I
made then and that I would make now is that the cost of university
includes not only tuition fees but living costs. It is also about
allowing young people to benefit properly and fully from a university
education. Unfortunately, some people from better-off backgrounds, who
have more at their disposal financially, find that easier than young
people from low or middle-income backgrounds, who do not necessarily
enjoy the same
advantages.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000030">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is therefore important that, when the Government introduce schemes such
as the junior ISA, they give proper consideration to ensuring that
young people and families from a range of backgrounds and incomes
properly enjoy its benefits. That is why I am concerned that the
Treasury has not done a distributional analysis of where the impact
will be felt and which particular families will benefit and
save.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000031">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Another
concern is that some families, particularly those on lower incomes, are
not necessarily aware of the financial products or institutions
available to them or of how they can best save. The
benefit of the child trust fund was that, because it was a
Government-supported scheme and the Government strongly encouraged
parents to take it up, parents had confidence. From my previous
professional experience, I know that parents from lower incomes had the
confidence that, because the Government brought it into being and were
backing it and supporting it strongly, they did not have to worry about
looking for the best rate or speaking to a bank. Clearly, there are
other options open to families, but, the universal nature of the
benefit, meant that families could have confidence in
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000032">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
know from my professional experience that a time of particular
difficulty for young people is when they move from the care system into
a life of independence. That transition is a critical period for young
people. It is often when placements fall apart. Young people are
expected to go and live independently. While big strides forward have
been made in the leaving care service to support young people at that
difficult time, it is still fair to say that those excluded young
people face additional challenges that young people from supportive or
stable families simply do not face. It would be wrong not to recognise
those additional challenges. Care leavers are often forced to be
independent at a far younger age than their peers from stable families
with supportive parents who are able to encourage them, which is why it
is so important that the Government ensure that they take due notice of
young people within the care system. I am glad that the Government have
backtracked somewhat and announced the £5 million fund to
support care leavers. It is precisely those young people who would
benefit from having that financial nest egg to fall back on to allow
them to prosper and achieve their full
potential.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Returning
to the contrast between the child trust fund and the proposed junior
ISA, the general difference was that the child trust fund—my
right hon. Friend touched on its background this
morning—involved a Government contribution. While those outside
the care system could have a reasonable expectation that, if their
parents could afford to do so they might make a contribution, the
difference for young people in the care system is that they often have
no parents. If they do, their parents have often had legal rights
removed from them, and the state acts as a corporate parent. That is
why it is all the more important that the state sends out a clear
message to those young people that they will be fully supported to open
up their life chances, to build their confidence and also to build
their sense of
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000034">&#160;</a>

                           </span> My hon. Friend is making an
important point about the message that we send to looked-after children
about the corporate parenting that the state provides. Does she agree
that it is more than a message? Sometimes, for a looked-after young
person at that crucial period when they are about to leave care, a
financial asset might give them a wider choice that will make them a
much more effective member of society in the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000035">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for those
comments. Choice within the care system is incredibly important for
young people, because, as a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 374<a class="bkMark" name="Column374">&#160;</a>
                           </div>result of their life experiences and the damage that has often been done
to them, choice has been removed. That is right; the state has to
intervene, but such young people have not always enjoyed the same
opportunities and choices that young people with a stable family from
other social backgrounds have. It is therefore important that on this
point, the state sends a clear message to young people in the care
system that they have choices, and that they can broaden their horizons
and have aspirations. The unfortunate reality is that too many young
people leave the care system not in a position to fully benefit from
the opportunities that are available in society, and not fully able to
contribute. That is why so many care leavers still end up not in
education, employment or training and why, unfortunately, a small but
significant minority end up within the prison system. Everything that
we can do to help young people, give them choices, and support them in
those choices is to be welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000036">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 98
calls on the Government to publish a report on children’s
savings accounts and on saving across society, which would include the
impact of Government policy. The DWP structural reform plan had
“Get Britain saving” as a key strategic goal in the
Department’s plans for the years ahead. However, the measures
that the Government propose would not support low-income families to
save in the same way as the child trust fund, which is a concern. We
want to encourage a saving culture within society, so that young people
and their families are encouraged to save throughout their lives. As we
all know, saving even a small amount over the course of 18 years can
build up a significant nest egg for a child, so that, at the age of 18,
they can enjoy the privileges that many people take for granted. That
may be the opportunity to buy a car or have additional money to support
them at university, so that they do not have to work full time when
they are there. A whole range of other life
opportunities—travelling, for example—are not always
available to families from low or middle-income backgrounds, but such
opportunities broaden a young person’s horizons and allow them
to contribute more fully to society.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000037">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Resolution Foundation carried out a new study on the living standards
of some of Britain’s 6 million low and middle-income households,
all of whom were in work, and who were earning just at or below the
national average. It said that six in 10 were struggling to pay the
bills, and that savings are already pitifully low. Half have less than
a month’s salary to fall back on, and two thirds are not
contributing a penny to a pension. Clearly, that is a big concern, and
anything we can do to support such people, even in difficult,
straitened financial times, is to be welcomed. Low and middle-income
earners are unlikely, at this point, to have the money spare to invest
in a junior ISA, but it is not unreasonable to think that
they may, in future, have an opportunity to increase their income,
particularly if they are able to take on extra hours at work, and be
encouraged to save throughout that time. The Government could send a
clear signal —and could have done so through the child trust
fund—that they wanted to support low and middle-income families
to save for the future.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000038">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I press the
Minister to publish the final details of the contribution-based ISA for
children in care. We know that the Chancellor agreed £5 million
a year for the scheme, but we are still short on the details, which is
why amendment 97 proposes the following:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p>What
is also crucial, and I would like to stress this point to the Minister,
is that the scheme should cover the whole of the UK, and not simply
England. I would be grateful for reassurance that that will be the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am pleased
that the Government have listened to some arguments being made by
organisations supporting looked-after children. I have referred to
Barnardo’s and Action for Children, but I know that others have
been working with the Department for Education to press for the scheme
to have the effects that we all hope it will. It is disappointing that,
although the Conservative party promised in its manifesto to keep the
child trust fund for the poorest two thirds of families and for
families with disabled children, it has backtracked. It has taken
significant pressure for us to get the Conservatives to recognise the
difficult and very different challenges facing young people in the care
system. It is right and proper that we support such young people, not
only because it is the right thing to do but because we should help
those young people to have proper choices in their lives, so that once
they leave the care system, they have the same kind of choices and
opportunities that many young people outside the care system enjoy. I
hope that we can get some answers from the Government about how the
scheme will operate, so that we can have confidence that young people
in the care system will see a proper scheme that supports them, gives
them choice and allows them to benefit and contribute fully to society
as they grow.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000041">&#160;</a>

all my professional life with young people, I sometimes find the

disappointing. From the health in pregnancy grant to Aimhigher, from
the complete dismantling of youth services to the pulling back on

                           </strong> That is fine; I will continue. The question of
rhetoric and reality is at the heart of the clause and of the
amendments, and the amendments try to turn rhetoric into reality. The
concerns about the child trust fund uncannily resemble those about
education maintenance allowance; support will be taken away from young
people at the start of their lives and at a point of significant
transition. Those are questions that disturb me.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000044">&#160;</a>

the child trust fund, let us look at a couple of quotes from people who
know far more about such things than I do. David White, the chief
executive of The Children’s Mutual, said in May 2010:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000045">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Child Trust Fund is the single most successful savings policy to date
and this sort of short-term cut does not address the pressing need for
families to save, or recognise the significant
benefit to society that the Child Trust Fund will bring from 2020 as

economy”.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000341">&#160;</a>

Toynbee Hall has said. She
stated:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000046">&#160;</a>

real concern around the removal of the child trust fund is not across
the whole population; it is for the lowest income groups. We really
believe that, for that particular income group, from 16 to 18 years was
a really important time to have no assets to fall back on. That really
puts people in a difficult position. It reduces their opportunities,
and we think the child trust fund was really effective in tackling
that.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
child trust fund is overwhelmingly endorsed by people who know what
they are talking about. Unfortunately, as my right hon. Friend was
saying earlier, despite the manifesto commitments of the two parties
that gained the most votes at the general election, it is not being
taken forward. Instead, it is being replaced by the junior ISA
proposal. No Government contributions will be made to the junior ISA,
but it will be tax free up to a limit of £3,000 and will operate
in a largely similar way to the adult ISA. As my right hon. Friend has
pointed out, the question is who benefits. Where is the equality impact
assessment? Who will get the advantage? It is good to encourage anybody
to save, but the danger is that it will not encourage those families
with the least income to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000047">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The worry—not only mine, but that of the
sort of commentators whom I have quoted—is that it will have the
opposite effect, and that the top third rather than the bottom third
will take advantage of the junior ISA. That is the danger. It is quite
misleading of the Government to claim that the junior ISA is a sort of
successor to the child trust fund, because it is not; it is a different
instrument, which performs a different function and achieves different
things. My hon. Friend’s intervention and the way in which he
expressed his point pulls that out very well. The measure does not take
a progressive asset-based approach. There will be a tax-based break for
wealthy savers, rather than an investment in people who usually do not
save. The provision will not increase the saving culture that we want
to encourage through the child trust
fund.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to the Treasury’s impact assessment for the junior ISA, just 20%
of children will end up with one. No distributional analysis is
provided but, as my hon. Friend has indicated, we can guess which 20%
of children are most likely to take advantage of this tax break. The
junior ISA will not improve the life chances of people from the least
wealthy backgrounds, which was a Conservative party manifesto
commitment; it will enhance the life chances of people who are the most
advantaged.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000050">&#160;</a>

                           </div>have approached things in the past. There is a social liberal tradition
stretching back to Thomas Paine and his call for assets for all. I
would have hoped that modern liberals would build on that strong basis
today, rather than tearing it up in their approach to the child trust
fund. Although the Conservatives do not talk about their “Red
Tory” guru Phillip Blond much these days, his ideas about
recapitalising the poor are right at the centre of things such as the
child trust fund. It is disappointing that two great parties with two
great social traditions should be missing the opportunity to build on
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000051">&#160;</a>

hon. Friend the Member for Delyn said, it is far from clear what the
scheme will mean—whether it will cover the whole of the United
Kingdom and how it will operate. The hon. Member for Erewash helpfully
celebrated the fact that the commitment is there but, like her, I want
answers from the Minister on how the measure is being taken forward.
Today’s debate gives the opportunity for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000055">&#160;</a>

us consider the proposals made by Barnardo’s and Action for
Children in their very good document, “On our own two
feet.” Their proposals sketch out various ingredients of a
scheme and draw attention to those elements. I would be interested to
know from the Minister whether they are the sort of elements that will
be included in the scheme being initiated by the Government. The first
part of the proposals contained in “On our own two feet”
states that the scheme should
apply<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Any

                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000058">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“After

                        </p>
                        <p>The
fourth element is that HMRC’s initial payment would be of
£250, and the fifth
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000059">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That

in the House welcomed, will be taken forward. Now is the time to
act.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000061">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
conclude my remarks by quoting an anonymous care leaver. After all, it
is care leavers on whom we should focus, because they are the
beneficiaries—or non-beneficiaries—of Government plans.
My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South drew
attention to how investment in young people now, through such a
mechanism, could have great benefits to the Exchequer in the long term
by assisting them when they leave the care system to find positive
pathways into their future. The quote is on the final page of the
Barnardo’s document and was given this year. The care leaver
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“By
having some savings I could have set myself up when I came out of care.

one”.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000350">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Those
words should echo round this Committee Room. Our responsibility is to
step up to the plate and show leadership. The Government have committed
the money, but we now need leadership, a message of hope and a
direction forward, and I am sure that we will get them from the
Minister when she
replies.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000063">&#160;</a>

Mr Gale. My hon. Friends have made many important points on these
amendments, and the issues are important for all of us. I sat on the
Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Committee in 2010, which
removed child trust funds, and I remember those debates well. I do not
propose to go through them again, but I will use them as an
introduction to my remarks on transparency and the differences in
savings across
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">This
is part of the debate about whether Government’s role is to
support income now, which Governments have a long history of doing, or
to address asset inequality. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Scunthorpe said, this is part of a broader, more long-standing debate
about how to redistribute wealth, and what doing that does for people,
especially those who have the disbenefit and misfortune to have been
born without wealth or any great inheritance. I hope that most
Committee members accept that one thing we have learnt over the years
in this debate is that it is right for the Government to address asset
inequality. There is cross-party agreement on that, although the
Liberal Democrats disagreed with it when they wrote their manifesto for
the last election. It is right for the Government not only to support
people today, but to look at how people can build wealth, because from
wealth comes independence, and from independence comes a sense of
dignity and pride, which ought to be what Britain is all about. I am
proud of the strides forward on that issue that my party made in
government.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
wanted to make a point about transparency, because both amendments call
for the publication of information. We have debated in this Committee
and on other related Bills how important it is to get information and
data

                           </div>out there, and how the Government should consult properly. We
politicians have given the financial services sector a bit of a rough
ride in recent months and years. For a moment, I would like to set the
record straight and balance the argument slightly the other way. People
in the financial services sector led, were involved in and consulted on
the establishment of the child trust fund. I recall conversations with
several experts in the field who were trying to find a way to build a
product for families that would work for them. Yes, it would send a
message from Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe
said, but would also encourage saving.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">People in the
financial services sector brought a great deal of expertise. I hope
that the Minister will listen to those same voices now, as we go
forward with a product for looked-after children. There is a need for
complete transparency. I hope that those voices will be listened to in
the design of the product, drawing on their expertise about which
products work, are least complex to understand and most likely to bring
in contributions from elsewhere. I would be grateful if the Minister
could tell us what discussions there have been.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When we
debated the Bill that took away the child trust fund, we discussed the
possibility of establishing a product for looked-after children, who
have the greatest call on us as politicians to stand up for their
interests—not just their income and life chances now, but the
possibility and choices they have for the future. If local authorities
wanted to join us and build on this policy, and themselves make
contributions to such a financial savings product for looked-after
children, they might want to make it part of their own strategy for
improving the asset-base, wealth, possibilities and choices in life for
thousands of looked-after children. They also need to be involved in
the
discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000068">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> My hon. Friend is right; that is exactly what I
am doing. In a previous life, I was a local councillor in a borough
with pretty serious deprivation in parts, although great wealth in
others. It was the one responsibility that I felt more than any other.
The financial management of the council was a great worry at times, as
was the broad sweep of the local authority’s responsibility.
However, our role as corporate parent worried me more.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000070">&#160;</a>

with this pledge, the Government will open up an opportunity for us to
do better by looked-after children than we have in the past. That is
what we should aspire to. If we are going to do that, we need to learn
the lessons of the most recent past, when we tried to build a savings
culture among people who were disadvantaged and did not have one. It
would be a terrible shame if we lost that learning, and did not
encourage the people designing the project to talk to local authorities
with expertise, and to the financial services sector that built the
child trust fund and thought through what would work, in order to get
this scheme going now that the Government have agreed to it. Will the
Minister say what consultation there will be? The amendment calls for
the details to be published as soon as possible. We know how difficult
it can be to take

will turn now to amendment 98, about savings across society, and shift
away from the particular needs of looked-after children, which are
great. We also need to watch what happens in children’s savings
accounts, and savings across society, because not all homes have a
culture of saving. We might think specifically about people’s
inability to save at the moment as we see inflation rising much more
quickly than wages. People’s ability to save is squeezed every
month of the year, so we need to monitor it and be very careful. There
is no doubt that, in relation to looked-after children, but also the
rest of society, people’s ability to make investment choices
about their lives is limited by their savings.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000072">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is a fact
of life that, as I go around my constituency, and as I know from
friends and family, not everybody has copies of “Which?
ISA” on the shelf. Not everybody is investigating the pages of
<em>The</em> 
                           <em>Guardian</em> money supplement to discover the most
beneficial savings account and which is the best ISA; I know that that
is true. One of the most interesting parts of the book written by Cass
R. Sunstein and Richard H. Thaler, “Nudge”, about how
Governments ought to manage their relationships with people, is the
section on saving, and how saving money is habit-forming. People do not
save because they sit and calculate like a cold logician. They do not
calculate that they want to invest at some undefined point in the
future so will therefore save a proportion of their income, and that
gratification sacrificed now will lead to greater gratification in
future. People just do not do that. They either get into the habit of
saving, or they do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000073">&#160;</a>

need to build a culture in which people have a rough idea of how much
of their income they will save. This was part of the point of the child
trust fund, and other projects that the last Labour Government
introduced to try to build a savings culture. It is habit-forming, but
people also need knowledge and information. The amendment specifically
refers to the “impact of Government policy”, which I
think is very important, whatever else we might think about the state
and whether it crushes
individuality.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000074">&#160;</a>

undoubtedly be aware of, but which I would like to push home, is the
fact that people’s capacity to save varies greatly from region
to region. Last week Ministers gave examples of the regional
concentrations of higher rate taxpayers; those people have the greatest
capacity to save because they earn the most. Out of the 275,000 higher
rate taxpayers, 195,000 are in the three southern regions—the
eastern region, London, and the southern region—yet there are
only 5,000 in the north-east. In my constituency, Gateshead, average
incomes are around £17,000 or £18,000. The capacity to
save is markedly different in different parts of the
country.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000075">&#160;</a>

is absolutely right, and that is the point I am making; there are
disparate cultures and abilities to save among different groups in our
society. We can say, “It’s fine, everybody has the same
ability to save in principle and in theory,” or we can say
“Governments shouldn’t care about that, they should care
about the

that the savings culture—the ability to save—is different
in different parts of the country and among different communities, we
deny the Government their proper role in addressing
inequality.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000076">&#160;</a>

course, it does. We can talk about the importance of financial
education, but the best financial education people get is by doing it.
From my life, I know the importance of having been given a
demonstration of what saving can do. I remember my Dad saying to me,
“Look, you’ve just started a new job. Bank a bit of that
because you’ll need it later.” I did. Demonstration is
the best teacher in the case of financial education.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000078">&#160;</a>

children know that they are at a disadvantage because they are
different from the other children in school, and they know that it is
not a good difference. It is important to demonstrate to them that
there is something there for them that is supposed to rebalance that
and that if they work hard and invest in themselves, they will have a
far better future. We will then have a really strong

expertise with looked-after children and how he uses his experience to
inform us all in the House. He is right. We had that debate at length
on the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Bill and,
unfortunately, Labour Members lost that argument. However, he is
absolutely right. I hate the thought of looked-after children being
stigmatised in any way, shape or form. The point of the child trust
fund was that it was a universal benefit that everybody got, although
some people got topped up a little bit more behind the scenes. However,
as children grew up and were out in the playground together, they all
knew there was something there for them and that the Government and
hopefully their parents, grandparents and other people were investing
to enable them to have a bedrock of saving. It is a shame that that is
now
gone.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000081">&#160;</a>

shall conclude by saying that people take state advice very seriously
and that it is important to recognise that Government policy can have
an impact on savings across society. The Government provide advice
through the national health service and the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. In Britain, we would not be

through NHS Direct—helps us all to take the right decisions on
our health. In many ways, the NHS is an absolute model of how we
disperse excellent advice to ensure that people can keep themselves
healthy. People take state advice about finances and savings equally
seriously, so it is important that we deal with this measure
transparently and that the Government publish what they believe to be
the state of play with savings across society. They should also provide
further information about savings, so that people can use that advice
to make the best
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000082">&#160;</a>

the debate we had about looked-after children, Barnardo’s could
not have chosen a better title for its report, “On our own two
feet.” To me, it describes exactly the dignity and the sense of
pride that we want for looked-after children. We do not want them to
feel as though they are permanently a burden or the responsibility of
the state; we want them to feel as though they have been invested in
because they are worthwhile members of our society. I truly hope that
the Minister will recognise that and move heaven and earth to get the
savings scheme for looked-after children ready and available to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000083">&#160;</a>

                           </span> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Gale, in this important debate on
asset-based saving, about which many people in the House feel strongly.
I want to set a series of tests, which I hope the Minister will address
in his or her summing up, about the proposals for the junior ISA and
what we can learn from the child trust fund, which offers some
interesting evidence about how we can encourage saving in our society.
In all parts of the House, there is agreement that that is a good idea;
that we should do more to try to help people to develop assets so that
they are able to make choices in their life to advance their own
progress; and that there are things that Governments can do, and things
that they should not do, to help.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000084">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With that in
mind, I will start with the concept of asset-based mobility and why it
matters. I am struck by the words of the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury, who was in a different place—a different party,
perhaps—when he talked about the importance of assets to social
mobility. That is the first test that all of us would set for this
proposal. Baby bonds and child trust funds were about social mobility.
They helped people who did not have access to the resources that other
young people did, in order to level the playing field and help them
make the choices that others were making because they had access to
such resources. The child trust fund was doing precisely that because
of its universality, so it met the first test that we must set for the
junior ISA, which is about reach. Will the junior ISA be able to reach
everyone in our society and therefore be a motor for social
mobility?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000085">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is a marvellous experience to be able to
introduce the hon. Gentleman to the concept of time and, therefore, the
ability of the child trust funds to come to fruition. In 2020, the
first child trust funds will do so, and I would be interested to
discuss with the hon. Gentleman at that point whether he felt that the
acquisition of £3,000, £4,000 or even £15,000 as a
result of the child trust fund was likely to help young people make
more choices in their lives at the age of 18. I wager that were he to
ask that question of many of the 18-year-olds in his constituency, they
might well offer him some strong evidence on that.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000087">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One of the
central points about social mobility is building up such assets. We
have evidence from the child trust funds, and from independent
research. I direct the hon. Gentleman to the work of the university of
Bristol, which is not far from his constituency; perhaps he can stop
there on his way over to Westminster and talk to university researchers
about their research into access to funding through the child trust
fund by poorer families. We have all talked today about the evidence
that the child trust fund was helping all families to save more, and we
would all agree that that was a good thing. The crucial point, however,
was that families on lower incomes were saving regularly, and that that
was making a massive difference.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000088">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We know that
there are about 4.5 million trust funds. The Children’s Mutual,
which is responsible for about 1 million of them, has done some
research about the people who have trust funds with it that shows
that 30% of children in households with an income of about
£19,000—well below the free school meals level that most
people generally accept as a good measure of disadvantage—were
receiving £19 a month in their child trust funds. Clearly, the
child trust fund was encouraging families on lower incomes to make
regular payments. Some interesting qualitative research showed that a
lot of that was to do with grandparents putting money into child trust
funds. That is a very good example. I am conscious that the Committee
has had many discussions about how taxation policy can be used to
influence behaviour, but if ever there was a good policy that reflected
how taxation and Government action could be used to encourage
particular behaviours, it is the child trust fund. It is important that
we judge the junior ISA according to whether it encourages that level
of regular saving by those
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000089">&#160;</a>

the Government seem to think that poverty and social mobility have
little to do with money? The choices that people make are often
determined by money. Allowing choices to be open for young people at
the age of 18 would be of great benefit to young people from more
disadvantaged backgrounds. As with many things in life, it comes down
to money, and poverty is about
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000090">&#160;</a>

earlier, I am struck that in 2008, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
agreed with us, too. He agreed that the key to social mobility is
asset-based welfare. It makes me wonder what has changed the
Government’s thinking in the past year and a half. Apart,
perhaps, from access to ministerial cars, what has changed the belief
that assets are part of social mobility?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000091">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For me, one of
the tests is whether the junior ISA will have the same reach that the
child trust fund has had. The universality of the child trust fund has
encouraged take-up in a way that many other savings products have not.
The first simple test is this: some 10,000 families in Walthamstow have
a child trust fund, so will the junior ISA reach 10,000 families in
Walthamstow in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000092">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Walthamstow
has a high level of deprivation. Even on the Treasury’s equality
impact assessment, only 2,000 families in Walthamstow will have
access to the junior ISA but, assuming the impact of the junior ISA is
equally distributed, as the impact of the child trust fund was equally
distributed, some 2,000 families in Walthamstow would have access to
the junior ISA. We can set a good test for the success of the junior
ISA with that question of reach. Will it reach the same
number of families, or will those families who
benefit—that 20%, rather than 100%, of families—not be
evenly distributed throughout our constituencies? Many Government
Members claim to represent areas with high levels of deprivation, but
will they see the drop-off in access to, and use of, these financial
saving measures that many Opposition Members
fear?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000093">&#160;</a>

my age, I go back a little further than she does—families on
smaller incomes were saving for their children before the child trust
fund was introduced. People who save in future will not want to use the
junior ISA; they will want to use whatever saving mechanism they think
appropriate. The hon. Lady simplifies it by saying, “All saving

when making key transitions in life. The more we do to help more young
people to make those choices and to access those assets, the more
likely they are to make choices that realise their potential which,
after all, is what social mobility ought to be about. The test we
should set for the junior ISA, if it is to be a successor to the child
trust fund, is whether it has that reach and whether it has that
ability to advance social
mobility.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000097">&#160;</a>

Government are moving towards using the taxation process to try to
influence behaviour—I hope that members of the Committee who are
also members of the Public Accounts Committee will join me in proposing
that we look at whether this is a value for money process that we
should undertake. We might conduct an investigation into that. The hon.
Member for North East Cambridgeshire shakes his head, yet normally he
is vigorous in his support for the idea of doing investigations. I am

are child trust funds that could yield up to £50,000 for the

of £500 million, the return we get in terms of the value for

of return than perhaps the hon. Member for Stockton South expects. For
example, I note that some child trust funds are yielding a 30% return,

would be the tax implications when I turn 18? Also, I could be the

                           </div>My hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland is
absolutely right to argue that there are some anomalies in the system.
We might see that young people are able to put the money that they may
have had in a child trust fund into a junior ISA, because they will
have access to that funding. There is a crossover, and there is an
interesting issue about the tax relief that might accrue as a
result.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000111">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
would certainly ask the hon. Member for Stockton South whether he has a
view about us spending £27 billion on pension tax
relief when only 40% of people are in pension schemes. There is a
question of the return from, and value for money of, investing in a
product that only certain groups of society are able to access, as
opposed to a scheme that all sections of society are able to access,
with the state actively ensuring that that is the case. Is that an
effective use of funding when compared with some of the other schemes?
That is the test that I am trying to set. Is the junior ISA, with its
limited reach, going to be as effective a use of tax relief—of
public investment—as the child trust fund? I know that we spend
£1 billion on tax relief for ISAs, but only 29% of people have
one. That necessarily calls into question the measurements that we
might make in the Public Accounts Committee about whether the money
invested has delivered as great a return as we might expect. In the
years to come, I hope that we will look at these schemes and ask
whether they were effective by delivering on that
investment.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000112">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Actually, I do not, because one of the interesting
statistics that we have seen is that of those 25% of families who did
not start a child trust fund, and therefore had them start up
automatically, 40% were affluent families. The scheme was a partnership
between the state and the individual, and it was taken up by
lower-income families in particular. It is right that we test the
junior ISA accordingly. Without investment from the state, will it have
the same
impact?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000114">&#160;</a>

shall draw my comments to a close because I know that other Members
want to get involved. These are the tests that we should be setting:
will the scheme have the same level of reach; will it advance social
mobility in  the same way as the child trust fund; and will it
deliver the same behaviour change delivered by the child trust fund to
encourage saving among those young people and their families who
previously had not been involved in a savings
culture?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000115">&#160;</a>

are the alternatives? The amendments are important because if we all
want Governments to make good policy that is based on evidence, rather
than evidence that is based on policy, we need to be able to review the
alternatives. We need to be able to say that the child trust fund, with
that small investment from the state up front, delivers a
disproportionate benefit compared

the greatest challenges in realising their aspirations. I say that as
someone who represents a constituency that straddles the heart of
Sheffield. In the east and in the centre, we have some of the poorest

born in the east and parts of the centre of my constituency face
enormous barriers to reaching the position of those who live just two
or three miles away. The lack of assets is one of those key barriers.
Finding effective ways of asset-building is a challenge for us all. As
I said in an intervention on my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn,
it is also a challenge in other countries. Having scrapped the child
trust fund, we need to look carefully at its replacement. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Scunthorpe pointed out, the child trust fund was
acknowledged by experts as an effective way to encourage savings,
particularly among lower-income families. For those Government Members
who might be sceptical, I cite Professor Le Grand of the London School
of Economics, who
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000118">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Encouraging
a savings culture among Britain’s families is vital if
we’re serious about tackling debt and borrowing. The Child Trust
Fund, the most successful Government savings scheme ever, has made
great strides towards helping families
save”.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000351">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the Government’s combination of policies hits families on a
lower income with a triple whammy: removing this proven scheme that
assists in the development of assets; withdrawing education maintenance
allowance while trebling tuition fees at the critical point when young
people move towards adulthood; and making it more difficult for
families to save. One of the constituency issues with which I am
dealing relates to a pension scheme that is struggling for a number of
reasons, one of which is that those on the lowest incomes, who face
pressures such as a reduction in real wages, are no longer opting into
the scheme. We know from our constituents that in straitened times,
people use their limited funds for the present and are less likely to
save for the future. We need to look positively at schemes that
encourage saving, particularly among those on lower incomes. It is
therefore right that amendment 98 calls for a review of the issue of
savings and the impact of the policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000119">&#160;</a>

of asset-building is faced by a number of countries. The trajectory of
the Government’s policy is in conflict with that in many other
countries. I mentioned the United States in my earlier intervention.
There is a growing movement in the US, led by the Child Savings Account
Coalition, where, state by state, accounts are being initiated that
involve public funds contributed by the state to back up schemes.

should look at those who are most in need and, as several of my hon.

critical. Clearly, the Liberal Democrats took no account of the needs
of looked-after children when they went for a sweeping manifesto
commitment to abolish child trust funds. Given that they won so little
else from their coalition partners on key policy issues, they might
want to ask themselves why their partners were so willing to roll over
on this issue. I shall give a hint: that was not because this is a

argument, particularly about looked-after children. The

importance of giving the poorest and most vulnerable people in our

point. It was unfortunate that the Government would not acknowledge the

who do not have the same advantages as those from wealthier families.
It is a shame that child trust funds, which made a difference for many
of those families, have been abolished.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000125">&#160;</a>

Friend the Member for Wirral South talked about the critical importance
of support in the transition to adulthood, which is much more difficult
for looked-after children. The Barnardo’s report highlights the
fact that 21% of looked-after children leave care as young as 16, while
16% leave at 17 and 62% at 18. The “cliff edge”
transition into adulthood that it describes, without the same support
and networks that other children have, means that those children need
intervention and support.

doubt that the Government have had to make some tough choices in order
to cut the deficit that we inherited. One was stopping the child trust
fund. We believed the scheme to be poorly targeted, and the debts
handed over by the previous Government make it unaffordable. It is hard
to escape the conclusion that  it would be reckless to leave
the fiscal deficit and hand it over as a debt to future
generations—the very people we say we want to
help.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000129">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Debt is
obviously what was left on the nation’s balance sheet by the
previous Government, who borrowed like no Government before. The
deficit is the nation’s P&amp;L—its profit and loss. We
were making a loss. The problem is that the deficit was structural. In
other words, it did not matter what the economy was doing in terms of
the economic cycle, because the Government were still spending more
money than they received in taxation. It is that structural deficit
that we seek to address. If we do not do so, we will continue to have
to borrow every year. However, despite the fact that we are addressing
the problem, the hon. Lady is correct that we will still have to
continue living with the legacy of year-on-year debt that the Labour
Government handed over.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000132">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
perversity in all of this is that the Labour party wants the deficit to
continue. The most worrying thing is that even the shadow Chancellor
seems to think that the structural deficit does not exist. That is
deeply concerning, given that we are dealing with yet another clause
that is part of what we are doing to sort out our public finances so
that our children do not have to pick up this huge debt. It is baffling
that the Opposition should set their face against pretty much any
measure that would get our economy back on its feet and our public
finances back into shape.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000133">&#160;</a>

as they saw it. At that point, they were committed to a targeted child

child tax funds. Another simple fact is that when the new Chief
Secretary walked into the Treasury and opened his desk, he saw that a
letter had been left for him by the previous occupant of that office;

                           </strong> It is like a parallel universe—we are
debating the importance of savings when the savings ratio declined
dramatically under the previous Government. People might have saved
more if a Labour Chancellor had not told been telling them for a decade
that there was an end to boom and bust. He gave no indication that they
were ever to expect financial hard times.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000139">&#160;</a>

factor that has emerged in this debate is that, to my mind, we are
genuinely seeing a behaviour pattern emerging from the Opposition. They
have an inability to stomach taking difficult decisions. They have a
brilliant ability to complain about decisions and to put off having to
make them. They would say, “Let’s pass a Bill to tackle
half the deficit and, when we’ve passed that, let’s not
actually have a proposal underneath it or set out where our £14
billion of cuts would be compared with the current Government’s
£16 billion.” It is a bit rich for the Opposition to
claim to have any credibility. One of the reasons they did less well in
last month’s elections is because the public can see through
their lack of economic policy, even if they are unaware of
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000140">&#160;</a>

Government, we are tackling the structural deficit. She will know that
that is a related but slightly different matter to the question of
public finances during an economic cycle. A worrying problem that our
economy had and that the markets could see clearly was that, even in
the boom times, we were running a deficit. Therefore, the deficit was
there whatever the economic weather. That is simply not sustainable.
Any household—and everybody in Britain apart from the
Opposition—knows that it is simply not sustainable to borrow,
borrow, borrow and never have a plan to pay it
back.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000144">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will finish my remarks on why we need to be getting on with the fiscal
deficit reduction with this point. The strategy of the Labour party in
the good times is, “Let’s spend because we can afford
to.” The strategy of the Labour party in the bad times is,
“Let’s spend because we can’t afford not
to.” The strategy of the Labour party in relation to the fiscal
deficit when the economy is growing is, “Let’s not kill
the growth.” The strategy of the Labour party when the economy
had one quarter of flat growth is, “Let’s not have the
fiscal deficit because we’re slipping back into a double-dip
recession.”<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000145">&#160;</a>

never going to be a good time for the Labour party to start tackling
the deficit and there was never going to be a good time for it to stop
borrowing taxpayers’ money and passing on huge debts to future
generations. That is what the markets can see very clearly. That is
why, thank heavens, we have a different Government who are prepared to
tackle that point. Those broad comments set out the reason why we need
to get rid of the child trust fund, despite our sense that that was a
difficult

should perhaps not have devolved some of the regulations on
looked-after children, and the responsibility for developing them, to
the devolved Administrations. It is a debate that we can continue to
have in the House, no doubt, and I am sure that different Members from

landscape and the existing responsibilities that have been devolved
down, I should say that the broader junior ISA policy will be
nationwide. On looked-after children, however, the policy has to be
aligned and worked up with the devolved Administrations. That is simply
a matter of fact; we have to ensure that it is delivered alongside
them. In many respects, it is important to do that anyway, and I hope
that the devolved Administrations will engage with us, as I believe
they are doing. Given what many Committee members have said, I think
that they can see that it is important to ensure that we get this
policy in place, so that looked-after children are

the same launch, if you like, or the same time period. We will make
sure that the two work in sync, so that we do not have any problems, as
the hon. Member for Houghton and Sunderland South mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000171">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We are
working with the devolved Administrations, because they clearly have a
role in relation to looked-after children and the ongoing, day-to-day
policy, to ensure that they are in a position to implement that policy
once

                           </div>we have set out more details. Today, officials at the Department for
Education are meeting the charities that were mentioned, to discuss how
Government can best support this vulnerable group of
children.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members from
all parts of the House want to provide much-needed support to
looked-after children, and the Government have confirmed that we will
do so through junior ISAs. I understand the frustrations of the
charities, and I know that they want to see some fully worked-up
proposals. They have played their role in pointing out the specific
aspects that they want us to bring forward. We have to get this right
first time, and those discussions are happening
intensively.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000173">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the Minister take the opportunity to put on
the record how those discussions with devolved Administrations will
move forward? Is she committing personally to meeting the relevant
Ministers in the Welsh Assembly Government and the Scottish Government
to discuss the matter? It is such a priority for us to get
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000174">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady will know that the lead Minister
in the Treasury for this policy area is the Financial Secretary, who
would have been here were he not on the Floor of the House handling a
debate about the eurozone. I know that he is keen for this aspect of
junior ISAs to work effectively. I will make sure that he writes to the
hon. Lady setting out the meetings that he has had and plans to have,
and the meetings that officials will have, working alongside the
Department for Education, with the devolved Administrations. I assure
her that when we work with the devolved Administrations on a whole
range of policy areas, we are in contact with them very regularly, and
this fits into that overall
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
have published a fair amount of information about the impact of junior
ISAs in the tax information and impact note alongside the Budget, in
which we stated that about 6 million children will be eligible for an
account when it is introduced, and a further 800,000 will be eligible
each year. As we said, we believe that over time 20% of children may
have a junior ISA. Equally, the product is entirely voluntary, so we
will work with providers to make junior ISAs easy to use and as broad
as possible. For example, although this has not been raised today, they
may be sharia-compliant, which is important for many of us who have
diverse communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
particularly concerned to make sure that junior ISAs are accessible to
people on low incomes; that has influenced many of our decisions on
their design. However, it is for parents to decide whether they want to
invest in the product. Ultimately, the Government’s clear
approach to our national deficit is a clear signal that we believe that
we must live within our means. That is a signal that many people and
families will take and apply to their own lives.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 98
refers to an analysis of the impact of clause 40 on children’s
savings. The Budget and the Office for Budget Responsibility report
both provide information on savings ratios, and HMRC publishes
statistical reports on—among other topics—ISAs, the child
trust fund and pensions. HMRC will publish statistical reports on
junior ISAs after they are launched. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 397<a class="bkMark" name="Column397">&#160;</a>
                           </div>That fact base will therefore be disclosed. The Government also
commission a number of savings reports, including the wealth and assets
survey and the family resource survey, so a range of data will be
published that will enable people to see the take-up of junior ISAs. I
do not believe, therefore, that either of the amendments is
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To conclude,
my colleagues in the Department for Education are working intensively
with charities and across Government to develop with the Treasury
junior ISAs for looked-after children. My right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Education will provide more information on the
scheme to help looked-after children through junior ISAs in due course.
I have explained why we believe it is so important to encourage savings
for children and to instil a habit of saving that will last a lifetime.
I do not believe that the amendments are necessary and I ask the right
hon. Gentleman to withdraw
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000179">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We have had a full debate, which is important, and
I am grateful to my hon. Friends for their contributions. We will
support clause 40 because, despite our reservations about the ending of
the child trust fund, we support the scheme as a replacement.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, I
remain concerned that we still have, several months down the line, a
distinct lack of clarity on the replacement of the child trust fund,
particularly for looked-after children. The previous child trust fund
was a UK non-devolved Treasury-led matter, which has apparently morphed
into a Department for Education-led matter that will potentially be
discussed with the devolved Administrations. That is not the way to
devolve issues in this Parliament. We have strict conventions for
devolving issues, and this is not the way to do
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
still do not have details on how much the payments will be, who will
administer them, when they will be made and over what period of time,
and how the £5 million will be distributed. I
therefore wish to press amendment 97 to a Division to secure a legal
requirement on the Government to finalise the scheme quickly. For the
reasons given by my hon. Friends, we need to have a review of the
impact of the whole Government savings policy by the end of this year,
so I will also press amendment 98 to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000182">&#160;</a>

his words. It increases the limit on gift aid benefit from £500
to £2,500. As we all know, the Government are placing special
emphasis on the role of charities as part of their big society agenda,
with the voluntary sector expected to fill the void left by the
Government’s cuts. That will not be an easy task, not least
because charities themselves are being so drastically affected by the
cuts, particularly with the loss of local authority grant funding. That
loss is difficult to quantify, because the information has to be
collated from all the local authorities across the country and the
impact must be assessed on charities large and small.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations has
estimated that charities will lose £900 million in
public sector cuts this year and £2.85 billion a year
by 2014-15. The association established a commission on the big society
and published a report, “Powerful People, Responsible
Society”, which
warned:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000256">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“If
the big society is to be a success, the Government will need to ensure
that it protects and promotes this sector—and does not allow
over-rapid and poorly-managed public spending cuts to damage it
disproportionately and

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
addition, Sue Ryder, among other organisations, is leading a campaign
against irrecoverable VAT, which we shall discuss when we debate new
clause 2. The Charity Tax Group has estimated that the new 20% rate
will cost the charity sector an additional £150 million a year
in irrecoverable VAT. This year, charities have lost the transitional
relief for gift aid, which provided an additional 3p per pound to help
them adjust to the reduction in the basic rate of income tax. That loss
is estimated to cost them approximately £100 million. Moreover,
many charities and groups, such as the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations, have called for an extension to the transitional relief
fund, arguing that the £100 million was not sufficient to help
them adapt to the big society agenda and that it is dwarfed by the
additional £250 million that the Government will receive from
charities.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000257">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Meanwhile,
the National Council for Voluntary Organisations reports that
charitable giving remains at £700 million below pre-recession
levels. In total, taking into account the consequences of all the tax
and spending changes, plus the decline in charitable donations, ACEVO
has identified a £4.5 billion funding gap. Clearly, that gap
will make the charitable sector even more dependent on private
donations. Presumably that is why the Government are so anxious to
promote charitable giving.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Announcing
the change that is proposed in clause 41, the Chancellor stated that
the Government would<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000259">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>It
is worth noting that recently published Cabinet Office figures show
that the poorest 10% of society gives 3.2% of its income to
charity, whereas the richest 10% gives only 0.8%, although
the amounts that are given by the richest 10% are obviously higher.
They could, however, be encouraged to give, as a proportion, a fair bit
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Will the
Minister elaborate on why she thinks that the measures in the clause
will encourage people to give more? What estimate has she made of the
impact? Will she clarify why the Government have chosen to introduce
this measure first, which prioritises wealthy donors, while the new
gift aid scheme to enable charities to claim gift aid on small
donations more easily is being delayed until 2013? The focus on small
donations might be more relevant to small local charities, which rely
on lots of people in their community donating small amounts. That would
have fitted well with the Government’s big society agenda. So
often, the local small charities are hardest hit by cuts to the
voluntary sector grant funding, because they are less likely to attract
the substantial donations from the big
donors.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000261">&#160;</a>

comments. Is there a concern that the big society agenda, with what
seems to be a focus—if the clause is an example—on
wealthy donors, to the exclusion of smaller but more generous donors,
will act to the detriment of communities to which the big society could
be of the greatest
benefit?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000262">&#160;</a>

                        <p>In
the light of such reports, does the Minister not think that the
Government ought to have gone further to help small community groups,
rather than introducing provisions such as clause
41?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000264">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
gift aid scheme for small donations is projected to cost the Treasury
£50 million in its first year and £85 million
in 2014-15, while the changes to inheritance tax to promote
philanthropy are estimated to cost £25 million in
2012-13. It is unclear, however, how much clause 41 is estimated to
cost the Treasury. Can the Minister tell us the estimated gain for
charities’ incomes and how much it will cost the Treasury in
gift aid if the measure works as a greater incentive to
donate?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000265">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Undoubtedly,
any additional donations or gift aid will be gratefully received by
charities, but they do not seem sufficient to offset the increased
bills this year, let alone the funding cuts. As ACEVO said in response
to the
Budget:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000266">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
will also be making clear that in addition to the positive measures in

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to a recent National Council for Voluntary Organisations survey, 55% of
charity chief executives plan to cut staff and 35% plan to decrease the
extent of their services by June this year. I would be grateful for the
Minister’s comments, and to know to what extent the Treasury
thinks clause 41 will help to mitigate the impact of charities’
reduced income from the
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000267">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The clause increases the amount of benefits that
charities can provide to their larger gift aid donors, increasing the
cap fivefold, from £500 a year to £2,500. We are doing
that because the increase in the benefit limit will help charities to
build sustained relationships with their largest
donors.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000268">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
the shadow Minister pointed out, if we look at the amount donated by
the wealthiest people in our country and compare it to the proportion
of income donated by people on more modest incomes, there is a
disparity. Working with the charity sector, we have an opportunity to
deliver, if we are willing to look innovatively and creatively at how
we can stimulate more charitable giving and a sense of philanthropy,
which we might have lost in many respects over time. Not only the tax
system can deliver that—the hon. Lady talked about the Cabinet
Office paper on giving, which came out earlier this week—but tax
has a role to play, and the Committee can see that in the package we
proposed in the Budget this year, which included a number of
measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000269">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked about the small bucket donations aspect of our
policy, but that is a spending measure, and it
takes a bit longer to bring into legislation because the law around it
is slightly more complex. By contrast, this measure is a much more
straightforward change, which we can introduce quickly in the Finance
Bill. However, it will be of benefit, because charities  will
be able to mark their appreciation of donations from their largest
donors with a gift or reward that is still proportionately
small—no more than 5% of the donation—without
disqualifying the donation from gift
aid.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000270">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
background to the clause is that donations made to charities by
individuals and companies are eligible for gift aid tax relief but only
if any benefits that donors receive as a result of making those
donations are within certain limits. For donations of more than
£1,000, benefits are limited to 5% of the donation, subject to
an overriding cap of £500.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I may be pre-empting what the Minister is about
to say, but she said that what she described as the “bucket
donations” clause is a spending clause and therefore it will
take longer to introduce. I appreciate that on the face of it clause 41
is not a spending clause, but if the underlying aim of the clause is to
encourage more charitable giving and therefore more people will qualify
for gift aid, surely there will be expenditure consequences. Will she
go on to say what costs there will be to the Treasury, depending on how
successful the measure is?<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000272">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In our consultation with charities, many of them
told HMRC that the old £500 limit had hindered their fundraising
efforts at a time when increasing charitable giving was more important
than ever. It also became clear that there were misconceptions about
how the gift aid benefit rules operated. For example, many charities
felt that they could not offer to host a gala dinner for a major donor,
to thank them for their gift and to stimulate more donations from
others attending the event, without the whole dinner becoming some kind
of a gift. Of course, that is not the case because those kinds of
events are not benefits to the donors at all; they are also part of the
fundraising process.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">So charities
are quite properly allowed money to pay for those events. To help them,
alongside this measure HMRC also published in April some revised and
improved guidance, which will help charities to understand how they can
thank their donors in a way that means that they can still receive gift
aid on the donation that they have received.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We expect
that the impact on the Exchequer will be under £5 million, in
terms of extra gift aid tax relief. During the course of this
Parliament, however, the package that we announced at the Budget should
see about £600 million more tax relief and support for
charities. However, I must stress to the hon. Member for Bristol East
that this is not just about getting more tax relief to charities. It is
also about trying to make some changes in the tax system that will
generally foster a system of philanthropy in Britain, which we can all
benefit from.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000275">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We talked
about clause 27 earlier in our deliberations. It is perhaps wise at
this point for me to correct the record, because I spotted in

                        <p>However,
I am absolutely sure that I said “most
donors simply make a donation and do not enter into an arrangement with
the charity.” Having clarified those comments, perhaps I have
made sure that I have absolutely got on the record what I said at the
second time of trying.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In relation
to this clause, charities want to express their gratitude to donors in
a small way. It helps them to develop a long-term relationship that
will encourage the donor to continue making donations and contribute to
the charity’s income over the years. However, there is a balance
to be struck, between making sure that charities follow charity law and
spend their donations on charitable causes, and enabling a charity to
develop that long-term relationship with a donor. When a charity wants
to say “thank you” to a donor who has given, say,
£1 million, £500 is obviously a very small amount of
money to help to promote that relationship between the charity and its
donors. We think that increasing the maximum amount of benefits that
may be given over a year to £2,500 strikes that balance more
effectively. Also, it should ease the administrative burden on
charities and donors who currently become involved in time-consuming
paperwork to keep within the £500 limit. At the same time, it
will ensure that the vast majority of any large donation—at
least 95% of it—will be used for charitable purposes.
Representatives of charities will continue to talk to HMRC about this
measure and indeed other measures during the coming months through the
new charity tax forum that we have established.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Charities are
at the heart of the Government’s ambition to build the big
society. We want to encourage people to give more to charities. The
increase in the benefit limit will allow charities to foster long-term
relationships with their largest donors, by letting them give a modest
but meaningful recognition of their contribution. This is one part of a
much broader philanthropy package that we brought forward in the
Budget. I therefore beg to move that the clause stands part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000279">&#160;</a>

instructions have been given to officials with regard to the package of
changes in this clause and clause 43, and their discussion with the EU?
It has been suggested to me—though I cannot believe it is
true—that the Government do not believe that most of this
package will get through the EU, and that they have announced certain
things that they might not get final approval for. I cannot believe
that to be true, so I would welcome the Minister’s confirmation

                        <p class="tabbed">Will
the Minister provide costings on the income tax relief? My assessment
is that, according to Treasury information, the costing for this
measure is £580 million of additional investment coming in, due
to schemes, over five years. The cost to the Government, however,
appears to be around £450 million, which means that we would
gain a maximum of £130 million due to the influence of the

of it would have happened

would like the Minister’s view on one more point. Before the
Budget, his right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer
questioned whether venture capital trusts were simply tax loopholes; he
is on record as saying that. Yet we find ourselves in a position where
the Minister is extending that very tax loophole with the clause.
Perhaps he could enlighten me as to how his right hon. Friend said one
thing before the Budget, in which he passed certain measures, and is
now extending that loophole considerably with clause 42, all—to

which investors in companies qualifying under the enterprise investment
scheme are entitled. It raises the rate from 20% to 30%, and it is
intended that this will apply to shares issued on or after 6 April

                        <p class="tabbed">The
enterprise investment scheme is designed to encourage investment into
smaller, high-risk companies by offering a tax incentive to investors
in qualifying companies. It has been in operation since 1994, with
around £7 billion from private investors being contributed to
qualifying companies. It is recognised as a successful scheme, and the
Government intend to build on that. Small businesses are the lifeblood
of the economy, and the ability to start and grow companies is vital
for the country’s economic well-being. That is particularly the
case now, given the need for a private sector-led recovery. The
Government wish to encourage investment into start-up and small,
growing companies. The plan for growth, published alongside the Budget,
sets out our ambition to make the UK one of the best places in Europe
to start, finance and grow a business. The reforms to the EIS and the
VCT scheme announced in the Budget will help the Government to achieve
that
ambition.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000290">&#160;</a>

Government recognise that higher risk companies struggle to attract
external sources of finance, and that private individuals need an
incentive to invest capital in them. The current level of incentive at
20% of the amount invested up to a maximum of £500,000 a year,
has produced a significant amount of investment over the existence of
the scheme. The Government want that

                           </div>amount to grow and are offering a greater incentive for individuals to
invest by increasing that relief from 20% to 30%. Those changes will be

illegal to introduce changes without state aid approval, but we have
already submitted notification of the changes to the European
Commission and are currently waiting for its response. Once that has
been received, the rate increase will apply to investments made after 6
April 2011. We believe that state aid approval will be
received—we see no reason why not—and the scepticism of
the right hon. Member for Delyn about the likelihood of that happening
is not well placed. We want to increase the relief to

do not want to place a date on that at the moment as I am not in a
position to do so. The matter is not in our hands. We are currently
waiting for the response, and I hope it will arrive in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000294">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman asked whether the arrangements, particularly VCTs,
encourage tax avoidance. We do not believe that to be the case, but the
Government will continue to monitor the operation to ensure that
investment is properly targeted. As we announced in the Budget, we want
to ensure that the scheme is targeted at genuine risk capital
investments, and in the context of the other steps that we are taking
to make the UK an attractive place in which to do business. That is a
sensible approach. We will continue to work with industry
representatives to ensure that schemes operate in a satisfactory
manner, and with the European Commission on the expansion of the
scheme. In conclusion, the increase in the rate forms an initial part
of the Government’s drive to encourage the entrepreneurship and
risk taking that is vital to the country’s economic
growth.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000295">&#160;</a>

this is a probing amendment. I want to get to the bottom of what the

things do happen—clause 43(6) was not mentioned during the
Budget on 23 March, and that aspect of the relief for expenditure on R
and D and SMEs was not included. The Chancellor covered over the
measure:<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000299">&#160;</a>

I want some clarity from the Minister about when state aid will be
approved. Secondly, I want him to stand up and say to me—if I am
wrong, I will withdraw it—that clause 43(6) was not mentioned at
the time of the Budget. I would be grateful if we could have that on

                           </strong> As we have heard, the amendment would leave out the
provision in clause 43 that reduces the figure used to calculate a
company’s payable credit under the small and medium-sized
enterprise research and development tax credit scheme. Although the
Bill reduces the figure that is used to make that calculation from 14%
to 12.5%, the overall effect of the clause is to increase the
value of the payable credit from 24.5% to
25%.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000302">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
appreciate that it is a probing amendment, but let me explain how the
provision works. The amendment would further increase the payable
credit so that it would be worth 28% of the original qualifying R and D
expenditure. Although that might appear to the right hon. Gentleman to
be more generous, the situation is not quite so
straightforward.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000303">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As
hon. Members will be aware, the SME R and D tax credit scheme is
approved by the European Commission as a state aid. As such, it must
comply with the Commission’s guidelines for state aid for R and
D. The guidelines state that the aid intensity of aid given through the
scheme must not exceed 25%. That is, the amount of aid given must not
be worth more than 25% of the company’s original expenditure on
R and
D.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000304">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment, which I appreciate is a probing amendment, would amount to
aid intensity of 28% and would mean that the overall changes to the R
and D tax credit scheme proposed by clause 43 would not be accepted by
the
Commission.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000305">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The key point is whether the reduction from 14% to
12.5% for SMEs was announced in the Budget as part of the overall

                        <p class="tabbed">The payable
credit is calculated as a percentage of the company’s total tax
relief for R and D. In the Budget, the Government announced that the
total relief for SMEs will be increased from 175% to 200% in 2011, and
then to 225% in
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000309">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
current rate at which the payable credit is calculated is 14% of the
relief, which gives a cash value to the company of 24.5% of the
original qualifying R and D expenditure: 14% times 175% equals
24.5%—I hope the Committee appreciates that I am showing my
working. If the rate of relief increases from 175% to 200% without a
reduction in the surrender rate, the cash value to the company will
increase. To be precise, it will increase to be worth 28% of the
original qualifying expenditure, as 14% times 200% takes us to 28%,
which would exceed the permitted aid intensity limit set out in the
Commission’s guidelines for providing state aid for R
and D. That is why the Government propose to reduce the percentage
figure used to calculate the amount of payable credit from 14% to
12.5%, meaning that the payable credit will be worth 25% of the
original qualifying expenditure. That still represents an increase from
the previous value of 24.5%, but importantly, the increase remains
within the threshold set out in the Commission’s guidelines. I
am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman tempted me into giving that
explanation, but I hope that all becomes clear as a
consequence.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000310">&#160;</a>

change will increase levels of support for small businesses while
remaining within the permitted limits. I am sure that hon. Members will
accept that the measure is important for stimulating innovation in the
UK, as it will support more than 6,000 small firms to the tune of

                           </strong> The amendment responds to comments on the Finance
Bill clause from numerous corporate groups and their accountants, who
asked that the provisions of schedule 10 be made available to companies
in respect of transactions undertaken before the passing of the Finance
Act. It will allow a group of companies to elect to apply the
provisions of the schedule from 1 April 2011. I announced the fact that
the Government would introduce the amendment in a written statement on
4
April.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000325">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
degrouping charge ensures that tax is paid on gains when, instead of
selling an asset directly, a group of companies sells a company that
owns an asset. Otherwise, tax could be lost, either as a result of
normal commercial arrangements or through tax avoidance. Business
identified the degrouping charge rules as one of the most complex and
burdensome aspects of the capital gains rules affecting corporate
groups.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000326">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
45 and schedule 10 make a number of significant changes to the way that
degrouping charges are applied. The changes are intended to simplify
the operation of the rules for groups acquiring or disposing of
subsidiary companies. The changes made by schedule 10 will mean that
when a group disposes of a company’s shares such that it leaves
the group, any degrouping charge will be treated as additional
consideration for the disposal. That will ensure that shareholder
reliefs such as the substantial shareholdings exemption will also apply
to the degrouping charge.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000327">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
new facility for claims to reduce the amount of a degrouping charge
where tax is charged on the same economic gain both through the
degrouping charge and through a chargeable gain on the shares. It will
be a useful alternative way to avoid unnecessary degrouping charges
where the substantial shareholdings exemption is not available and
using the associated companies exception is either burdensome or
impractical. We have

			Column number: 408<a class="bkMark" name="Column408">&#160;</a>
                           </div>clarified the rules for the associated companies exception to degrouping
charges, in line with expectations following the
decision of the
court.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
combined effect of the changes to the substantial shareholdings
exemption and others outlined above is that companies will face fewer
degrouping charges when they are planning an acquisition or disposal of
a company. Every corporate group that makes an acquisition or disposal
of a trading business will find something in schedule 10 that is
useful. The improved interaction with the substantial shareholdings
exemption will remove tax barriers that get in the way of assembling
the assets of a trade ready for
sale.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000329">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
changes improve the targeting of the rule, ensuring the aim of
preventing tax avoidance is still achieved, but without the potential
for double taxation. This amendment provides that these benefits are
available straight away if a group would find them useful. There is
protection to ensure that a company cannot be disadvantaged by an early
commencement election made after it has left a group, since such a
company would need to consent to the making of the election.
I urge the Committee to accept this
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000330">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have one question. I am grateful to the Minister
for his explanation, but we touched in discussion of an earlier clause
on the question of intangibles and he said he would return to the
question on clause 45. I want to be clear about what he means in
relation to that. I am concerned that intangibles, such as goodwill in
a business—for example, when purchasing a hotel—could be
disadvantaged by this clause, or are not consistently addressed by this
clause. There is an inconsistency in that old
goodwill—pre-2002—will be treated as a corporate capital
asset and therefore will not suffer a degrouping charge, where
post-2002 goodwill could be subject to degrouping charges, so for some
businesses the simplification is not as useful as it is for others. I
would welcome clarification on goodwill being dealt with as part of
this
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="11052522000331">&#160;</a>
