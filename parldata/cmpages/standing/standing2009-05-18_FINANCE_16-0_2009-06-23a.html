<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000460"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I welcome you to the Chair, Mr.
Atkinson. From the outset, I make it clear that we do not necessarily
object to the use of the naming and shaming provisions in clause 93.
However, we have a number of specific concerns, some of which we have
addressed in this group of
amendments.</div><a name="090623119000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
93 sets out a new regime for publishing details of deliberate tax
defaulters. This is, as we will debate at slightly greater length, an
arrangement that was not consulted on before the Budget and, with the
publication of the Finance Bill, a number of specific concerns have
been raised about the regime. I will briefly set out the concerns that
we attempt to remedy in the amendments, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column566" />Column number: 566</div>the first of which is that the application of the naming and shaming
regime applies where there has been potential lost revenue, in relation
to the relevant penalty, of more than &#163;25,000. That can be an
amount that applies to a number of different taxes and may have accrued
over a number of different tax years. The particular concern of a
number of outside bodies is that the &#163;25,000 limit is a blunt
instrument. Clearly, &#163;25,000 in lost revenue would be quite
considerable for most individuals or small companies. However, for a
very wealthy individual or a large company or partnership,
&#163;25,000 is not particularly considerable and there is a danger
that this naming and shaming regime may apply to relatively small
amounts.</div>
<a name="090623119000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently,
amendment 81 seeks to make the &#163;25,000 test a bit more
sophisticated, if I can put it that way, in the sense of still having a
de minimis requirement of &#163;25,000, but for an entity or for a
person with a large income there shall also be a test of a percentage
of that income. That would prevent the concern, raised by a number of
outside bodies, that persons may be caught for what is, in their
overall tax liability, a small amount of money.</div>
<a name="090623119000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are keen
to hear the Minister&#146;s assessment of why the &#163;25,000
figure was chosen and whether it is possible to have a differential
rate so that we can assess the scale of the mischief, or the scale of
the tax default, by the person concerned.</div>
<a name="090623119000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
82 and 83 look at the issue of a relevant tax penalty and what sort of
activity should fall within that. It is an attempt to tighten this
definition set out in clause 93(2). We are not wedded to any particular
wording in this area, but we would like to explore the thinking here.
There is a reasonable argument to be made that a new penalties regime
has just come into effect, that this naming and shaming regime is being
bolted on to it and that, at least in the initial months and years of
this regime, it should be focused upon the very clearest cases of tax
default, where we are looking at deliberate inaccuracy and concealment,
rather than being broader. A criticism could be made of this regime
that it is not focused as much as it might be, but I would put this in
the context of a new regime&#151;why not start it off in a fairly
narrow circumstance with a view to broadening it
out?</div><a name="090623119000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000461"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Todd</b> (South Derbyshire) (Lab):
<i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="090623119000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000462"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I give way to the hon. Member, who is looking
quizzical.</div><a name="090623119000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000463"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, but the
thrust of his amendments appears to be to protect the privacy of those
with very substantial net worth who may have significant tax
liabilities on which they deliberately default. Am I right in thinking
that that is the thrust of what he is attempting to do
here?</div><a name="090623119000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000464"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I think that the concern that he is raising is with
amendment 81, rather than 82. The concern behind amendment 81 is a
relatively small error on the part of a large taxpayer. I suspect that
the hon. Gentleman is going to make the point about deliberate
inaccuracy, and, do not get me wrong, these are not people whom we are
desperate to protect. None the less, this is a new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column567" />Column number: 567</div>regime coming in which is in addition to the existing penalties regime.
If we are going to have something in addition to it, it is right to
test the scope of it. In particular, the concern raised by outside
bodies is that this new regime may be a bit broader than it should be
in its initial stage. There is an argument for extending it as we see
how it works. For most of us, a sum of &#163;25,000 is a very
considerable one, but not so in the context of a larger business. The
point has been made by, I think, the Chartered Institute of Taxation,
that a relatively small failure to account for tax on a transaction
between a company and a director may involve additional PAYE, National
Insurance contributions, VAT and tax under the beneficial interest
rules and that these quickly accrue to a sum greater than
&#163;25,000.</div><a name="090623119000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000465"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> Surely the test is deliberateness, is it not? One
would agree that honest errors are dealt with in a different way. Quite
how one establishes deliberateness, other than by a paper trail showing
that someone conspired to achieve this, is another matter, but that is
the critical
test.</div><a name="090623119000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000466"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Of the various levels of misbehaviour, the highest
test is deliberate inaccuracy and concealment, and we are suggesting
focusing on that because that is the clearest case of what, not to put
too fine a point on it, most of us would consider to be of a fraudulent
nature. Why not focus on the most egregious cases? Outside bodies argue
that the measure is broader than it might be, so let us explore
that.</div><a name="090623119000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments, which are less controversial, focus on the issue of
publication and the circumstances in which publication should be made.
Amendment 84 proposes that consent should be given by the chief
executive of HMRC before information is signed off with regard to a tax
defaulter. Again, this is partly a probing amendment. I hope that the
Minister will be in a position to reassure the Committee that
publication will occur only after a senior executive from HMRC has
signed off these matters. Naming and shaming should not be a decision
that is taken lightly.</div>
<a name="090623119000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
85 and 86 relate to the issue of a right of appeal. It is worth making
the point that naming and shaming in this way is very much a penal
action. It is likely to have a very significant effect on the
reputation of the person being named and shamed. In the stand part
debate, I hope that we will be able to examine in a little more detail
the potential human rights angle to this and concerns about a breach of
privacy. Clearly, in defending their case against an action brought on
the basis of the Human Rights Act 1998, it will be helpful to the
Government to have a satisfactory appeal mechanism. Clause 93, as
currently drafted, does not seem to address that particular concern. It
may well be that the Minister can give the Committee some reassurance
on that particular point. The need for an appeal mechanism is addressed
by amendments 85 and
86.</div><a name="090623119000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have various broader points that I do not intend to go into at this
stage, but we would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response on a
number of points that seek to ensure that clause 93 works as
effectively as
possible.</div><a name="090623119000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000467"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
Welcome back to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. Clause 93, as set
out by the hon. Member for South-West 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column568" />Column number: 568</div>Hertfordshire, provides for HMRC to publish details of deliberate tax
defaulters. The clause has been introduced to send a clear signal that
evading tax is wrong, to deter people from doing it, to reassure those
who pay the right tax and to encourage those who do not do so to come
forward and make good. Amendments 81 to 86 and Government amendment 305
all seek to ensure that clause 93 is closely targeted and that strong
safeguards are in place. I should like to reassure the Committee that
the Government support both those aims.</div>
<a name="090623119000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
relates to a deliberate intention to give HMRC inaccurate documents or
not to meet obligations so as to gain a tax advantage. Careless errors
or failures, whether or not penalised, will not trigger publication
whatever their size, nor will taking a reasonably arguable view of the
tax situation, even if it is not upheld. There will be exemption from
publication for those who make a full disclosure of their defaults,
either unprompted or prompted by HMRC. That means that everyone will
have the chance to escape publication by coming forward and making
good.</div>
<a name="090623119000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000468"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):
Although I am reassured that there has to be some deliberate intent, is
there not a concern that powerful people with deep pockets and concern
about their reputation and libel laws will be able to muscle their way
in to ensure that their position is protected. Notwithstanding any
Human Rights Act opportunities, it will be the less powerful who fall
foul of the measure. The overwhelming concern is that individuals who
realise the potential for reputational damage and the risk of going to
court&#151;the cost and everything else&#151;will have an
opportunity to ensure that officials are persuaded not to put them on a
list, whereas the less powerful will be voiceless in that
regard.</div><a name="090623119000409"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000469"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I do not agree with that premise. We will
probably come on to that matter when we debate clause stand part. The
clause will strengthen our ability to bring people who deliberately
withhold information and default to
account.</div><a name="090623119000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000470"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): Minister, is the
problem not that there are normally two points of view to an argument?
If the Revenue says, &#147;This is a deliberate error,&#148; the
client will say, &#147;No, actually it wasn&#146;t a deliberate
error.&#148; The Revenue will then go back to them and say,
&#147;If you make a full confession now, we won&#146;t publish, but
if you don&#146;t, we will name and shame you.&#148; My advice to
the client would be to say, &#147;Even if you haven&#146;t done
wrong, accept a confession because your name won&#146;t be
published.&#148; Is that not very unfair on the
taxpayer?</div>
<a name="090623119000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000471"></a>The

should say that this is moving into clause stand part territory. I
would be grateful if the Minister answered the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question
later.</div><a name="090623119000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000472"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I take your advice, Mr. Atkinson,
and will answer that question when we come to the clause stand part
debate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column569" />Column number: 569</div><a name="090623119000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Both
amendments 81 and 82 deal with the criteria for publishing the names of
deliberate tax defaulters. The Bill states that the deliberate
understatement must be at least &#163;25,000. Amendment 81 would
change that to the greater of &#163;25,000 or a certain percentage of
the person&#146;s income, but it does not specify what the percentage
could be. Two things are wrong with the amendment: it is wrong in
principle and in practice. The Bill states that at least &#163;25,000
of tax must have been understated. That is the amount of tax uncovered
in an investigation, which may include more than one tax, more than one
period and more than one type of deliberate default. A number of
factors were taken into account in arriving at &#163;25,000:
international comparisons, sentencing guidelines for non-tax financial
frauds and the need to send a clear message that tax evasion is
wrong.</div>
<a name="090623119000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
most people agree that evading tax to that extent is a serious matter,
whatever the level of income. There is no justification for taxpayers
on higher incomes to be subject to different limits. To impose such
limits would be wrong in principle and unfair. Taxpayers on higher
incomes and large companies who evade tax should face the same
consequences as others and, like any other taxpayer, they may avoid
publication by making a full disclosure to HMRC, even when challenged.
I also think that the amendment is technically flawed. The
&#163;25,000 limit relates to the tax lost. That might be a reference
to income understated, as suggested by the amendment, but it could just
as easily relate to understated capital gains, VAT or excise duty on
goods misused. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment on
that
basis.</div><a name="090623119000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
82 would narrow the scope of the scheme, so that it applies only to
those whose defaults are both deliberate and concealed. However, clause
93 already ensures that publication is restricted to where a person
knowingly and intentionally gives HMRC an inaccurate return or
deliberately does not tell HMRC of a new taxable activity to gain an
unfair tax advantage. Concealment, such as submitting false evidence to
HMRC, is aggravating conduct and attracts a higher penalty. All
deliberate understatements, whether involving concealment or not, are
fraudulent. It is important to send a clear signal that all tax evasion
is wrong, and consequently the &#163;25,000 limit is a better
restriction than using the deliberate and concealed category of the
penalties.</div><a name="090623119000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
83 would reduce the scope of the scheme so that it covered only
inaccurate documents&#151;returns, claims and accounts. It would
exclude other forms of tax evasion such as deliberately supplying false
information, causing a tax return to be inaccurate or, for example,
knowingly supplying red diesel, which is subject to a lower rate of
duty, to commercial haulage firms rather than for agricultural use as
permitted. Each of the other categories specified in the Bill creates
an illegal, unfair advantage for the perpetrator. Some categories, such
as the misuse of red diesel, represent a significant attack on the tax
system. It is estimated that &#163;350 million is lost to the
Exchequer each year from the illicit market in petrol and diesel. It is
important that HMRC has the full range of tools at its disposal to
combat such attacks. Those responding to HMRC consultations have
consistently called for HMRC to come down hard on those seeking an
unfair advantage. For that reason I cannot support amendment
83.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column570" />Column number: 570</div><a name="090623119000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
84, 85 and 86 concern safeguards within the scheme. Amendment 84 would
require the chief executive of HMRC to authorise publication of all
details. Amendments 85 and 86 seek to create a separate appeal right
against a decision by HMRC to publish details and to create a
requirement to inform the person of their right to appeal. I want to
emphasise and put it on the record that the Government agree that there
should be robust safeguards. These are already built into the scheme
and the penalty regimes on which it is founded. Government amendment
305 further strengthens the safeguards. There is a right of appeal to
an independent tribunal against all the tax and penalty decisions that
determine whether a name will be published. The criteria for
publication are tight and are laid out in primary legislation. Everyone
will have an opportunity to escape being named by making a full
disclosure, even after challenge by HMRC. Taxpayers will be informed
prior to publication and may make representations to HMRC that naming
would not be appropriate. Names will be removed after 12 months. Both
HMRC and I recognise the importance of getting this right. A senior
HMRC officer and a central team separate from the investigators will be
responsible for pre-publication checks to ensure that the details
published are accurate. I do not think it necessary or practical to
include such authorisation in the Bill.</div>
<a name="090623119000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
concluded that a separate appeal right against publication is not
appropriate for a number of reasons. There is an appeal right to the
independent tribunal against all of the decisions that underpin
publishing details: the amount of tax and penalty, the behaviour
category&#151;whether the default was deliberate&#151;and the
quality of the taxpayer&#146;s disclosure. Government amendment 305
further strengthens taxpayer safeguards by ensuring that all
considerations about disclosure, including its timing, will be taken
into account when arriving at the penalty level and will be appealable.
All of these appeal avenues must be exhausted or expired before details
may be published. This leaves the only element of discretion within the
publication scheme itself at the start of 93(1) which provides
that</div><a name="090623119000369"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Commissioners may publish
information&#148;.</div><a name="090623119000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
ensure consistency and fairness, the presumption will be to publish
where the criteria are met, unless there are exceptional circumstances
after consideration of the taxpayer&#146;s representations. Examples
might include prejudice to an ongoing criminal investigation or risk of
physical harm.</div>
<a name="090623119000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
appropriate route for a taxpayer to challenge such administrative
decisions is directly with HMRC or by judicial review. Although
amendments 85 and 86, as I have already said, would create a separate
right of appeal, it is difficult to see what the grounds for such an
appeal might be. An appeal against publication would also be a one-way
bet, with the taxpayer having nothing to lose by appealing. We are
concerned that tribunal resources would be unduly tied up with spurious
appeals and the impact of this important deterrent effect would be
undermined.</div>
<a name="090623119000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">By contrast,
Government amendment 305 reflects a small but significant change in
policy in the taxpayer&#146;s favour. It will reduce the extent of
HMRC&#146;s discretion and provide greater clarity to taxpayers as to
how they can avoid their details being published, namely by making a
full disclosure, whether prompted or unprompted, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column571" />Column number: 571</div>which would qualify for the full reduction under the penalty
legislation. That means that all consideration as to whether a
taxpayer&#146;s disclosure is sufficiently complete and timely to
warrant exemption from publication will now be subject to appeal to an
independent tribunal. That will be under the penalty appeal provisions.
This strengthens taxpayers&#146; safeguards and addresses concerns
underlying amendments 84 to 86. The amendment will also bring greater
clarity for taxpayers about what they must do to escape publication.
First and foremost, the message is not to evade tax in the first place
but, if they have done so, taxpayers should come forward to HMRC
swiftly and make good in full. One of the lessons learned from the
Irish experience is the importance of having clarity and certainty in
this area. The amendment should help to achieve that. The safeguards we
already have in the Bill together with Government amendment 305 are
robust and sufficient. I hope that I have managed to satisfy the
concerns of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and would ask
him to withdraw his
amendments.</div><a name="090623119000073"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000477"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Let me reiterate that we share the
Government&#146;s objective in clause 93 of having an additional
sanction to take against those who deliberately do not pay the
appropriate amount of tax. We welcome the use of social pressures in
that context. It may be that the Government are waking up to the nudge
agenda that is so popular among the Opposition. We also recognise that
countries such as the Republic of Ireland have made use of this kind of
regime. The objectives are worthy, but we have some practical concerns,
many of which the Minister has allayed with the amendments that we have
discussed.</div><a name="090623119000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall begin by asking where the naming and shaming measure came from.
There was no indication prior to the Budget that the Government
intended to do anything like this. When it has been considered in the
past, the Government have been unenthusiastic about it. On
22 May 2002, the then Paymaster General, the right hon.
Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo), stated in evidence to the
Treasury Select
Committee:</div><a name="090623119000370"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
have to say that I am not at all attracted to it because of naming and
shaming incorrectly or the consequences and the balance with taxpayer
confidentiality.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to know why the Government changed their mind. Why was
there no consultation before this proposal was announced in a Budget
notice?</div><a name="090623119000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate is similar to the one we had this morning on the new signing off
requirements for senior accounting officers, because this measure
appears to have emerged from nowhere. Has it been sitting on the back
burner for years before being suddenly plucked out? Was it introduced
because of changing economic circumstances and the crisis in the public
finances? What caused the Government to bring it forward this year,
when they previously had no interest in
it?</div><a name="090623119000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also raise the point about timing in the context of the new penalties
provisions that have just been brought in. Given that we spent a great
deal of time last year and the year before debating penalties, why was
this measure not dealt with then? If it is something that the
Government have come to relatively recently, was there any thought of
holding it back, at least until we see how the new penalties regime
works? It seems that the Government are somewhat open to the criticism
of making policy on an ad hoc
basis.</div><a name="090623119000410"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="090623119000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
seek some clarity from the Government. Presumably they have looked
closely at the extent to which the naming and shaming provisions will
actually be used. In implementing the new penalties regime, I believe
that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column573" />Column number: 573</div>they looked at several dead cases to see how the new regime would have
applied to them. Have they looked at those cases also in the context of
clause 93 and the naming and shaming provisions? Do the Government have
a view as to how many cases the provision will apply to in the course
of a typical year? What scale of offence are we talking
about?</div><a name="090623119000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
next area of concern relates to privacy implications, and I say this in
the context of the Human Rights Act. I know that the Government are
reluctant to reveal any legal advice that they have received, but the
Chartered Institute of Taxation brief on the clause
states:</div><a name="090623119000371"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
understand that HMRC have taken advice and consider that the right to
privacy in such cases will not apply on account of the exception for
economic wellbeing of the country given the current economic
climate.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be helpful to the Committee if the Minister could say as much as
possible about the legal advice on this matter. What concerns do the
Government have that there is not a privacy issue, or at least not one
that cannot be overcome, and is that on the basis of the economic
circumstances?</div><a name="090623119000089"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000478"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> My hon. Friend raises an important issue. It would
appear that the measure has been introduced only because we are in the
depths of this terrible, Government-caused recession. Does that mean
that it would disappear after a few years, or do the Government believe
that we will be in recession for so long that it will not be a
temporary
measure?</div><a name="090623119000090"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000479"></a>Mr.

point.</div><a name="090623119000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000480"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Whatever the merit of the point, it seems
to be wide of the
clause.</div><a name="090623119000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000481"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I accept that
the Government-made recession is wide of the clause, but there is a
legitimate question. If the human rights angle on privacy is overcome
only because of the exception for the economic well-being of the UK,
which is acute, given the crisis in the public finances, if that is
right&#151;this is based on what I received from CIOT&#151;and if
that is how the legal concern of privacy will be dealt with, what will
happen if and when we are not in a public finances
crisis?</div><a name="090623119000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough raises an interesting point
about whether the legal analysis allowing the clause to exist will hold
together only as long as we are in a crisis. He makes a good point, and
there is all the more reason for the Minister to provide a little more
guidance to the Committee about the basis on which the Government are
confident that they will not run into any legal difficulties with the
clause. If it is the case that the clause will work only for a few
years and then the privacy issue becomes more acute, the Committee is
entitled to know that.</div>
<a name="090623119000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">In relation
to privacy, outside bodies have raised concern with regard to the
information that is provided about the tax defaulter, in particular the
address. That sounds similar to a debate that we have had more
generally in this House about the publication of addresses. Some people
have raised concern that revealing that information may cause
particular difficulties to, say, family members and so on. So I would
be grateful to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column574" />Column number: 574</div>Minister if she could give some guidance about how HMRC will use its
discretion&#151;it has discretion in this area&#151;in the
publication of addresses.</div>
<a name="090623119000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Wellingborough touched on another interesting
point a moment or so ago about the behavioural effect that the clause
will have on individuals, in particular whether they are more likely to
settle a case or fight on. I can see that matters could go in one of
two directions. On the one hand, the clause could be a sanction that
may encourage someone who has a dispute with HMRC to settle, for fear
of being named and shamed. That was the concern that was raised by my
hon. Friend. There is a particular concern in the context of technical
disputes in which a party is acting in good faith and HMRC says,
&#147;You must settle&#148;. I do not think that that is too great
a concern, because we are talking about deliberate failure to pay.
However, I am very keen to ensure that the clause is not used to put
pressure on a taxpayer who has a legitimate and honest disagreement
with HMRC. I do not think that that is a major concern, but perhaps the
Minister could say a word or two on that
issue.</div><a name="090623119000096"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000483"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I give way to the hon. Member for South Derbyshire.
I have already acknowledged the point about deliberate
non-payment.</div><a name="090623119000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000484"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> The hon. Gentleman has indeed acknowledged that
point, and he has been gracious in giving way. Surely the point here is
not just that the failure to pay must be a deliberate act. In addition,
as the Minister acknowledged, if the taxpayer had an honest dispute and
an arguable case, they would also not fall within the scope of the
clause.</div>
<a name="090623119000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000485"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> That is exactly the point that I am making; I want
to ensure that honest disputes do not fall within the scope of the
clause. So I do not think that the hon. Gentleman and I have any
disagreement on that subject.</div>
<a name="090623119000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000486"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I think that it would help the
Committee if the Minister could give some indication of how many names
are likely to be published. Are we talking about 10, 20, 50, 100 or
1,000 names? Also, as people who have been named might well end up in
our surgeries, is there any kind of procedure to determine, for
example, how many people in Poole will be named and shamed? I would
just like to have some indication of what HMRC thinks the numbers will
be.</div>
<a name="090623119000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000487"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right; indeed, I
touched on that point a moment or so ago. Can the Minister break down
her estimate on a constituency basis? I am sure that the good people of
Poole will not be affected by the clause. However, my hon. Friend makes
a very reasonable point.</div>
<a name="090623119000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
point that I was going to make in the context of appeals goes in the
opposite direction, as it were. Some taxpayers may be reluctant to
settle when they might otherwise do so because they are afraid of being
named and shamed, and if they bring finality to a dispute they will be
more vulnerable to being named and shamed and might be more inclined to
fight on. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column575" />Column number: 575</div>Presumably HMRC has considered whether that is likely. That concern has
been raised by some outside bodies, and it will be helpful if the
Minister lets us know whether she has any thoughts on the
matter.</div><a name="090623119000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also want to touch on an issue that the Minister raised during our
previous debate on disclosure and protecting taxpayers. Have the
Government considered providing a definition of unprompted disclosure
in the Bill? That might provide additional
clarity.</div><a name="090623119000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have raised various issues in an attempt to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking, but we recognise the benefits that may be
gained from using social pressure to change behaviour. We tabled new
clause 4 to start a debate on how to take that approach further. Clause
93 is the stick, but the new clause could provide the carrot. We are
suggesting a published list of taxpayers who have performed their
taxpaying and reporting obligations in an exemplary way. That list
could be published with details to be agreed between HMRC and the
taxpayer. The requirements would depend on the size and complexity of
the taxpayer&#146;s affairs, and inclusion on the list would not be
prevented because of an honest and technical dispute. We would seek to
provide some certainty about how that would work by requiring HMRC to
publish guidance and to consult with outside
bodies.</div><a name="090623119000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will
the Minister let us know whether the Treasury and HMRC are considering
something similar? A gold list of companies that co-operate with HMRC,
pay when they should do, are open when they should be, and provide
information when they should do would be a useful and positive addition
to HMRC&#146;s armoury. It is likely that large plcs and accounting
practices would be keen to demonstrate to the outside world that they
have exemplary tax processes and co-operate with HMRC. It would be a
badge of honour to be on such a list, and that would encourage a
culture of tax compliance. If the Government are not already doing so,
we urge them to consider such
proposals.</div><a name="090623119000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000488"></a>Mr.
Bone:</b> I just want to go over a case from a few years ago,
when I was advising a client&#151;it was at the time of Customs and
Excise, and before the combined service was created&#151;who had
taken advice on the treatment of their turnover, which was partly
overseas. They had followed that advice to the letter, but some years
later, a different VAT inspector said that they were wrong and that
they had been deceiving Customs and Excise, which proposed not only
recovery of the VAT, but penalties. The new procedure benefited my
client, who became entitled to a repayment overall. In their case, it
was acceptable to say, &#147;We&#146;ve done it wrong, we&#146;ll
accept penalties and, when we recalculate it, we&#146;ll actually get
a refund of VAT.&#148; They were lucky. However, the managing
director was livid because he had followed the advice of the original
VAT inspector and was absolutely certain that he had done nothing
deliberately
wrong.</div><a name="090623119000411"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="090623119000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
always advise my clients to accept any liabilities and penalties,
because the cost to the business of fighting them is far more than any
penalty imposed. If someone overcomes that hurdle and says that they
want to fight a case, the Revenue will name and shame, whereas if
someone agrees that they have done something wrong, the only thing they
end up with is a penalty.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column576" />Column number: 576</div><a name="090623119000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can see the
Government&#146;s reasoning, but, in practice, I believe that more
people will accept that they have done something wrong when they have
not, and that they will not test the case, because being named and
shamed will do enormous damage to their business. I understand what the
Government are trying to do, but there are some practical
difficulties.</div><a name="090623119000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000489"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It has been an interesting debate. On the
stand part debate, we regard the clause as necessary and proportionate
in relation to the response to serious non-compliance. The clause is
carefully targeted and contains robust safeguards. It also sends a
clear signal that evading tax is wrong, and will be a deterrent for
people who are doing
that.</div><a name="090623119000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
penalty regimes on which the publication is based were the subject of
extensive public consultation, and respondents consistently supported
HMRC taking a harder approach towards those who have deliberately
flouted the rules. HMRC has already met with interested external
representative groups about the publication scheme and will continue to
do so up until 1 April 2010 to sort out the practicalities for
implementation, including draft guidance. I emphasise that that will be
introduced only for any penalties after April
2010.</div><a name="090623119000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000490"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for what the Minister is saying, but
does she not accept that, ideally, the consultation should be done and
the guidance should be issued before, and not after, we
legislate?</div><a name="090623119000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000491"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We are talking about a point of principle. A
lot of the consultation that we have done has shown that people want
HMRC to take a harder approach, and the provision is part of
that.</div><a name="090623119000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000492"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister before she has
a chance to get going. I accept that the provision is part of a harder
approach, but it is a different type of sanction from those previously
implemented. I do not disagree that tough penalties are necessary; that
is not our concern. This is a new type of penalty and we think that it
is justifiable to use it, but, ideally, surely she agrees that, as far
as this type of penalty is concerned, one should consult first, rather
than produce something out of the blue and then begin the consultation
process.</div><a name="090623119000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000493"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> If we as a Government, the Committee and the
House agree on a way forward on the issue that will help, and the
consultation is ongoing as legislation makes its way through the House,
I think that that satisfies our twin aims. We are trying to bring in a
harder line while also ensuring that we bring stakeholders with us in
the way that it is
implemented.</div><a name="090623119000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked why, in 2005, the
Paymaster General declared her opposition to naming and shaming, but
there have been wider changes since 2005 and there is a worldwide move
towards more robust regulation and responses to financial misconduct.
Our recent reforms of the tax penalty regimes mean that it is now
possible to create a scheme in law that is carefully targeted at the
most serious offenders, which was one of the Paymaster General&#146;s
caveats at the time. As regards the Human Rights Act, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column577" />Column number: 577</div>I assure the Committee that HMRC has carefully considered all
the issues in developing the publications scheme, and believes that it
is, as set out in law, necessary and
proportionate.</div><a name="090623119000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman took an extrapolation too far; it is a justifiable
interference in the right to privacy to protect the economic well-being
of the country and prevent crime, but that refers to the economic
well-being of the country at any time. Tax evasion in general is a
threat to the economic well-being of the country. We have carefully
designed the scheme so that any interference with the right to privacy
is kept to an absolute minimum, while still achieving its aims, which
is why the law requires published details to be removed after 12
months.</div><a name="090623119000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000494"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister is providing helpful clarity. The
briefing that we received from CIOT was that the question of privacy
did not apply due to the need to protect the economic well-being of the
country, but in addition, it
said:</div><a name="090623119000372"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;given
the current economic
climate.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
she assure the Committee that there was nothing in the legal advice
that focused on the current economic difficulties and the state of the
public finances and that this is a general requirement to address tax
evasion.</div><a name="090623119000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000495"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I can certainly confirm to the hon.
Gentleman that it is about the general economic picture and is not
specific to current economic difficulties. Currently the names of those
convicted for deliberate tax defaults are published, but those of
people subject to a civil penalty for such defaults remain
confidential. We are bringing the publication of the details of those
subject to civil penalties for deliberate defaults into line with those
convicted in a criminal court.</div>
<a name="090623119000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Poole asked how many names were likely to be published. The
measure is prospective and applies to penalties after 1 April 2010, so
it is difficult to say. We expect the number published to be low
initially, but it could be up to hundreds each year if people do not
change their behaviour as a result of the measure. At this stage I
cannot begin to think what the figures per constituency would
be.</div>
<a name="090623119000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000496"></a>Mr.
Syms:</b> When we talk about published, what do we mean? Do we
mean put on the web? How do you remove a name from the web after 12
months? Are we talking about the <i class="I">London Gazette</i><i class="I"> </i>or will
there be a press notice every quarter? Can we have a little more
information about that please?</div>
<a name="090623119000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000497"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> We can put such details in the guidance and
consult further on them. It will be published in a way that meets the
requirements of the legislation, so the names will be removed after 12
months. I take on board the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>
<a name="090623119000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000498"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): As Members of the
House we have been subjected to a degree of innuendo that has been
translated into an untruth by people out in the big wide world. What is
to stop somebody taking the list for a given 12 months and using it for
four or five years thereafter to create a situation of fear or of
considerable embarrassment for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column578" />Column number: 578</div>people, when that should not happen? Are there any remedies that a
person who has been on the list, but is then taken off might take to
prevent that happening?</div>
<a name="090623119000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000499"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> HMRC will put processes in place to ensure
that names and details are removed. We anticipate publishing details on
the website quarterly with a press notice. We will remove them from any
official publications and from archived press notices. We are not
responsible for whether details remain in the public domain in media
outside our control, such as newspapers. That also applies to those who
have evaded tax deliberately and are subject to the criminal rather
than the civil procedure.</div>
<a name="090623119000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000500"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> This is a pretty unsatisfactory state of affairs,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South points out. It is
not simply a matter of having something on a particular website,
because information gets transported to blogs and other websites. Other
than through an extremely extensive and costly mechanism, it will not
be possible to cleanse the entire web of references. Even with not
particularly well-known people, a quick Google search will immediately
bring up a range of blogs containing such
details.</div><a name="090623119000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
return to my earlier point, more often than not, wealthy individuals
will be able to bring libel cases against newspapers. If such a case is
victorious, they will ensure that there is an ongoing cleansing of the
web along those lines. For the less well-off, there will be no such
safeguards.</div><a name="090623119000127"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000501"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I return to the point that we are not
responsible for other media. The same applies to those people who have
deliberately defrauded and are subject to criminal penalties. That is
the same if cases are reported in the media. I think that we have the
balance right in pushing this forward. We have the safeguard that the
proposal covers only deliberate actions, which we have debated at
length. Taxpayers will also have the opportunity not to have their name
published if they make a full disclosure. I have explained umpteen
safeguards as we have gone through this
clause.</div><a name="090623119000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000502"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I am puzzled by the turn of this debate because a
large amount of activity through our minor courts ends up in the public
domain and is then manipulated and used freely by other people for
years to come. Minor county court judgments against people can become
widely available. I am not sure why the thrust of this argument applies
to this particular
circumstance.</div><a name="090623119000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000503"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> I think that we are spending a little too
long on this point, given that most people agreed at the beginning that
it was a good measure that would help in the fight against fraud and in
changing people&#146;s behaviour through
deterrence.</div><a name="090623119000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000504"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Perhaps I can attempt to answer the point raised by
the hon. Member for South Derbyshire. He is right that once something
has been published, it is in the public domain. That brings into
question the value of subsection (9), which
states:</div><a name="090623119000373"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;No
information may be published (or continue to be published) after the
end of the period of one year beginning with the day on which it is
first published.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column579" />Column number: 579</div><a name="090623119000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
information will be taken off the HMRC website, it will be in the
public domain. I do not think that that is an enormous deal, but it
brings into question whether subsection (9) is a worthwhile
safeguard.</div><a name="090623119000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000505"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> It is important because HMRC will take the
information off that list. If there is subsequent referral to, that
list was for that period of
time.</div><a name="090623119000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a question about refraining from publication when there are
security issues. As well as exemptions for those who make full and
timely disclosure, HMRC will not publish names in exceptional
circumstances in which doing so would not be appropriate. Taxpayers
will have an opportunity to make
representations.</div><a name="090623119000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
got a bit confused over the two conflicting arguments. One was that
people would fight on, but not settle. The other was that people would
not settle, but fight on. I think that we have sufficient safeguards in
the clause to enable taxpayers to go through the appeal procedure,
which means that whether their tax disclosure is sufficiently complete
and timely to warrant exemption from publication will be subject to
appeal to an independent tribunal. That strengthens the
taxpayer&#146;s
safeguards.</div><a name="090623119000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 would allow HMRC to publish a list of taxpayers whose record
in paying tax and reporting their liability HMRC considers exemplary. I
welcome the motives behind the clause and the implicit recognition that
publication can affect taxpayer behaviour, whether it be publication of
those who are exemplary or those who have deliberately defaulted. In
many ways, new clause 4 is a mirror image of new clause 3. I share the
view that an exemplary payment and reporting record is something to be
encouraged.</div><a name="090623119000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
93 reassures taxpayers that there is a level playing field. Under later
clauses, we will examine how the Government propose to reform the
penalties for late filing and late payment to change the behaviour of
those who fall short of this high standard. We will also look at how
the Government aim to make it easier for businesses and individuals to
pay on time using managed payment plans. HMRC is continually reviewing
its relationship with taxpayers, both large and small, to identify what
motivates them to file accurately and pay on time, and what changes
could be made to improve voluntary
compliance.</div><a name="090623119000412"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="090623119000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are some practical issues in the clause itself, which means that I must
resist it today. HMRC consulted on the idea of a tax clearance
certificate scheme in June 2007 and in November 2008. Such a scheme is
similar to the aim of the new clause: an assurance that the taxpayer is
in good standing with HMRC, because of the filing and payment record. I
have to say that support for the proposal was lukewarm, with many
unsure how the certificate would be used and seeing it as an additional
level of bureaucracy. For example, the LITRG in their response
said:</div><a name="090623119000374"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;What
will such a certificate be needed for? There is little point in
introducing a system which lacks purpose, as this simply creates a
burden of cost, administration and
complexity&#148;.</div><a name="090623119000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, we think there would be significant resource implications
from the proposal and it might help if I gave the Committee a flavour
of these. HMRC receives around 23 million returns each year across all
the taxes. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column580" />Column number: 580</div>It collects around &#163;450 billion, of which around two thirds is
paid on time. Based on those figures, HMRC would be faced with a
significant burden in potentially publishing the names of the many
million taxpayers whose record appears exemplary. Such a lengthy list
would be of little benefit to taxpayers if their details were buried
away and might not influence the behaviour of others. Employees with
simpler affairs, whose tax is all dealt with through PAYE, should, by
rights, also be on the list and that would render it meaningless.
Furthermore, what would &#147;exemplary&#148; mean in practice? A
taxpayer might file their return on time and pay the liability shown on
that return, but what if the figures on that return were simply
understated? HMRC focuses its resources on high risk cases in order to
deter non-compliance. However, it cannot know the risks in all cases
and cannot check every return to find out more. Doing so would not only
require much greater resources, but would also inconvenience many
compliant
taxpayers.</div><a name="090623119000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Publishing
the names of people whom HMRC describes as exemplary, but who are known
to others to be otherwise, could have a detrimental impact on voluntary
compliance. The clause includes several areas where HMRC would have to
exercise discretion: &#147;may publish&#148;, &#147;in their
opinion&#148; and &#147;acting in good faith&#148;. As hon.
Members know, safeguards have always been a key feature of our work to
modernise tax administration. I should have thought that we would need
to see some statutory safeguards here. For those reasons, I would
resist new clause 4 and ask hon. Members not to press it. However, I
repeat that we are sympathetic to the sentiment behind it and we will
continue to look at the best way to encourage taxpayers to file and pay
on time, and we will keep this suggestion in
mind.</div><a name="090623119000140"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: left;"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000506"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Minister for her remarks on clause 93
as a whole. I am not sure that she answered the concern about whether
more taxpayers will fight on rather than settle. In my remarks, I
stated that it could affect behaviour in two different directions. I
welcome her comments that the intention of new clause 4 is correct,
however, I am not sure that all her objections were particularly
strong. There is a case for targeting it towards larger entities, so it
would have a beneficial effect in the corporate area rather than on
every individual taxpayer. I note her comments that the Government
focus on the high-risk areas and do not necessarily dig in to ensure
that the information provided is necessarily correct, but of course it
is a further sanction available to the Government&#151;loss of gold
list status would be something that a large company would be very
reluctant to lose.</div>
<a name="090623119000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
acknowledge the point that there is more that can be done on safeguards
in primary legislation. I hope that this clause will encourage HMRC to
look further on this and to allow a debate to begin on this particular
point. As I said, the measure would add value, particularly in dealing
with larger companies. When we reach the relevant point, I do not
intend to press new clause 4 to a Division&#151;although I think it
would be a valuable addition to our armoury. I am pleased that the
Minister appears to be suggesting that HMRC and the Treasury will
continue to look at the
matter.</div><a name="090623119000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<a name="090623119000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000509"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for drawing the
Committee&#146;s attention to the grouping. That is helpful because
essentially the same points are being made. Clause 94 relates to
various amendments of the information and inspection powers brought in
under schedule 47. Clause 95 relates to the extension of information
and inspection powers to further taxes. I am sure that we will discuss
briefly the contents of schedule 47 in a moment, but the concern raised
by this group of amendments is that both clauses 94 and 95 are Henry
VIII clauses that enable primary legislation to be amended by secondary
legislation. Such measures are increasingly being used. Those of us who
had the pleasure of serving on the Committee that considered the
Banking Bill will remember the lengthy debates on that subject. This is
perhaps not of a similar scale, but the concern remains the
same.</div><a name="090623119000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us remember the context in which we are debating the Bill: again, it is
a matter of balancing the powers of the state with the rights of the
individual. That is an issue with which any liberal democracy has to
wrestle. Again, I note that the Liberal Democrats are not present while
we deal with that issue. When the new regime was brought in under the
Finance Act 2008 in the context of information and inspection powers,
the matter was debated in some length and in detail. The measure was
set out in primary legislation, and rightly so.</div>
<a name="090623119000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In schedules
47 and 48, there are a number of amendments to what we debated in
primary legislation. I suspect that we will not be detained for a great
length  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column582" />Column number: 582</div>of time in debating these matters, but, none the less, the measure was
published in primary legislation and there was an opportunity for
outside bodies to examine and comment on it. There is an opportunity
for the Committee to give its view on the provisions, but clause 94(2)
states
that</div><a name="090623119000375"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Treasury may by order make any incidental, supplemental, consequential,
transitional or transitory provision or saving which appears
appropriate in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with,
Schedule 36 to FA 2008 or Schedule
47.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
those matters that we debated carefully last year can now be changed by
secondary legislation. The issues that relate to the important balance
between the powers of the state and the rights of the individual can
now be changed by secondary legislation, and clauses 94 and 95 enable
the Government to do so.</div>
<a name="090623119000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
concerned about that. We do not see why those matters could not be
dealt with by future clauses and schedules contained in future Finance
Bills, and we therefore suggest a number of amendments. First, I want
to look at clause 94, although the same amendments essentially apply to
clause 95. Amendment 87 would delete subsections (2) to (5) of clause
94, which deal with this matter altogether. So schedule 47 will remain
part of the Bill, but the power given to the Treasury to amend primary
legislation by secondary legislation would be struck out.</div>
<a name="090623119000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government can make a strong case against amendment 87, amendment 88 is
more difficult for them to oppose. It would provide a safeguard in the
Bill that</div>
<a name="090623119000376"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under this section may
not&#151;</div><a name="090623119000377"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
remove or weaken a safeguard available to a taxpayer,
or</div><a name="090623119000378"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
increase a penalty or HMRC
power.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that that is the Government&#146;s intention in this area, or
at least as far as these orders are concerned. Perhaps some sort of
reassurance to the Committee would be helpful. None the less, amendment
88 would at least provide some safeguard from misuse of
clause
94.</div><a name="090623119000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
61 states that any statutory instrument in this area should be subject
to an affirmative resolution as opposed to the negative procedure,
which it is envisaged will apply. Essentially the same amendment
applies to clause 95. Amendments 62 to 64 relate to the extension of
information and inspection powers to further taxes.</div>
<a name="090623119000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
incumbent upon the Minister to explain why it is necessary to have
clause 94. What do the Government have in mind? Why can the matter not
be dealt with in primary legislation? What scrutiny will exist as far
as these provisions are concerned? I can see that there is an argument
for administrative convenience. However, given that we are talking
about quite important powers that HMRC may have and that potentially
there will be a loss of some safeguards for the individual, we are
reluctant to allow clauses 94 and 95 to remain unamended. We look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
comments.</div>

deeply disappointed not to be able to contribute to this
morning&#146;s proceedings, Mr. Atkinson, so it is a great

<div class="Column"><a name="Column583" />Column number: 583</div><a name="090623119000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire indicated, the group of amendments
also relate to the powers introduced in schedule 36 to the Finance
Act 2008. As he also rightly pointed out, those powers are
part of a package of measures to align and modernise the various
powers, deterrents and safeguards inherited by HMRC from the former
Inland Revenue and Her Majesty&#146;s Customs and Excise. We had a
significant debate last year on these matters.</div>
<a name="090623119000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers
in schedule 36 allow HMRC to check if the right tax has been paid or
claimed in respect of VAT, income tax, capital gains tax and
corporation tax. They came into force on 1 April.</div>
<a name="090623119000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right
to say that last year&#146;s debate focused on the need for proper
safeguards. I believe that that debate was invaluable as it directed
HMRC to the key issues that needed to be addressed in the guidance to
staff. In turn, that has helped to ensure that the powers can be used
appropriately and proportionately. I can report to the Committee that
that guidance, along with associated training information, has now been
published, following consultation with key stakeholders.</div>
<a name="090623119000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">What we are
trying to do as a Government is to ensure that there is a balanced
approach to the way in which HMRC uses these powers. That approach has
been warmly welcomed and I want to put on record my appreciation and
that of the Chancellor and the Financial Secretary to those who have
helped HMRC to develop
it.</div><a name="090623119000413"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

clauses contain a provision to make Treasury orders and consequentially
to amend other legislation as a result of the powers in schedule 36.
The intention is to repeal existing information and inspection powers
when schedule 36 can be used instead, and to make other consequential
amendments to avoid leaving overlapping powers in place. The hon.
Gentleman said that these are Henry VIII powers, and I think he was
referring to our debates on clause 75 of what was then the Banking
Bill. Clearly, we are discussing something of a different order
here.</div><a name="090623119000166"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000511"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> The Economic Secretary referred to repealing. Does
he mean simply repealing, or is there a suggestion that something in
the clause could enact, by secondary legislation or otherwise, new
offences under which taxpayers, whether errant or otherwise, could find
themselves falling foul of the
law?</div>
<a name="090623119000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000512"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will cover those points as I discuss the
amendments.</div><a name="090623119000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
87 would omit from the clause the whole of subsections 2 to 5, which
contain the provisions to make incidental, consequential or
transitional changes by Treasury order. That would mean leaving the
legislation unclear and prevent a significant number of repeals. We do
not believe that that would be right. The orders proposed under clauses
94 and 95 will enable the repeal of more than 30 pages of legislation
containing powers that are no longer required. We believe that it is a
good thing to repeal
them.</div><a name="090623119000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
88 would insert provisions to ensure that an order under clause 94
would not remove or weaken safeguards or increase a penalty or HMRC
power. I appreciate that it is a probing amendment, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column584" />Column number: 584</div>I assure the Committee that the Treasury order provisions merely allow
the repeal of legislation that is made redundant by the powers in the
provisions, and consequentially to amend legislation as a result of
those repeals or to take account of powers in schedule 36 to the
Finance Act 2008, as amended by schedule 47 to the Bill. They will also
ensure transitional arrangements for those repeals. Given the nature
and scale of the changes, the broader power of amendment is needed to
facilitate accurate consequential amendments to untangle a lot of old
and complex tax legislation. I assure the Committee that orders will
not be used to alter safeguards or the powers. Drafts of the proposed
orders under clauses 94 and 95 are before the Committee and show that
to be the case.</div>
<a name="090623119000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 61
would call for the provision to make orders under the affirmative
procedure consequently to amend existing legislation and to repeal
information powers that are no longer needed. The Opposition often
raise that as a debating point. To make orders under the affirmative
procedure would be contrary to normal practice for orders covering tax
matters, which are usually made under the negative procedure. The
consequential, transitional and incidental changes to be made under
Treasury order, even to primary legislation, do not involve changes in
policy and are simply tidying up, but they are essential to ensure that
the law is clear. We believe that the negative procedure is appropriate
because of the narrow scope and effect of the consequential changes
that will be required, so there seems to be no sensible reason to make
an exception to normal
practice.</div><a name="090623119000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
62 to 64 would amend clause 95 in the same way as amendments 87, 88 and
61 would amend clause 96. The same reasons for resisting those
amendments apply, and I invite hon. Members to resist them if they are
pressed to a vote. It is important that, in clauses 94 and 95 and the
associated schedules, we have an effective way of employing our tax
legislation in this area. We have listened, and learned from the
operation of schedule 36. We believe that we have the legislation right
and that the proposed amendments are
unnecessary.</div><a name="090623119000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000513"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I thank the Minister for his response. I note his
comments that wanting to use the affirmative procedure is a point that
Oppositions frequently make and that Governments equally frequently
reject. I dare say that we may have that debate again at some
point&#151;perhaps with the parties taking different
views.</div><a name="090623119000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assurances the Minister has given the Committee have been clear. If
there was an attempt to use the provisions contained in clauses 94 and
95 in anything other than the manner in which the power was used to
appeal existing provisions to provide transitional rules and very minor
consequential rules, the Minister would be in great difficulty, because
his wording is very clear. I wonder why the provisions could not be
more narrowly defined. Clause 94(2) is still pretty broad, and the
protection contained in the Bill is fairly minor. None the less, every
time such a clause is presented to a Public Bill Committee, it is
valuable to highlight such matters and Ministers should be forced to
give the kind of assurance that we have heard today. On the strength of
that, I beg the Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000514"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment 66, in

out sub-paragraph
(5).</div><a name="090623119000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have only a very brief point to make. Concern was raised with us that
new paragraph 21(9) in schedule 36 to the Finance Act 2008, inserted by
schedule 47 to the Bill, is somewhat vague and adds nothing to the law.
It
states:</div><a name="090623119000379"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
this paragraph, references to the person who made the return are only
to that person in the capacity in which the return was

the Minister explain what the wording is designed to
do?</div>
<a name="090623119000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000515"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendment would remove paragraph
9(5) of schedule 47, which inserts a new sub-paragraph in paragraph 21
of schedule 36 to the 2008 Act. Paragraph 21 provided specific rules on
how the information powers could be used in cases in which a
self-assessment return had been submitted. The new sub-paragraph
clarifies that the specific rules apply only in relation to checking
the person&#146;s tax position in the capacity in which the tax
return was made.</div>
<a name="090623119000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provision is needed as there are people who are responsible for making
returns in more than just their own personal capacity&#151;an example
is a trustee who has filed a trust return, but has not filed their own
personal return. As a result of the new sub-paragraph that the
amendment seeks to remove, the legislation would not prevent HMRC from
issuing a taxpayer information notice in relation to the
individual&#146;s personal tax position. It would be wrong to leave
the legislation so that the way in which one return could be treated
was affected by the filing of another, unrelated, return. Without that
provision, the legislation in schedule 36 would not work as originally
intended and would remain unclear. The provision is concise, clear and
helpful and should not be omitted.</div>
<a name="090623119000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might
help the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and those who follow
these proceedings closely if I explain that we are concerned only about
cases where someone is required to make more than one tax return in
different capacities. For example, the situation of an agent who
submits tax returns for several clients would not be affected by the
provision. I hope that is helpful, given the probing nature of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment, in explaining why we need the
power.</div><a name="090623119000182"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000518"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The schedule deals with the extension of
information and inspection powers to further taxes. My question relates
to paragraph 5, which deals with the powers to inspect property for
valuation. That is clearly a sensitive area, in that under those powers
HMRC officers may enter private premises, accompanied by</div>
<a name="090623119000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any person
who...is needed to assist with the
valuation&#148;.</div><a name="090623119000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
safeguards are that an inspection can only be carried out with the
agreement of the occupier, who has been given notice of the inspection
in writing; or with the consent of the tax tribunal, when the occupier
must still be given seven days&#146; notice in writing. I ask the
Minister whether those safeguards are sufficiently robust, given that
the power enables HMRC to enter a person&#146;s private
residence.</div>
<a name="090623119000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, I put to the Minister concerns raised with us that there
should be a specific right for the recipient of the notice to be heard
by a tribunal, if he or she wishes to object to access to the private
premises. I also ask whether there should be a specific right of appeal
in this area. It is a sensitive matter, as is always the case when the
authorities are allowed access to private premises. I would be grateful
if the Minister let the Committee know what representations he has
received and whether any consideration has been given to additional
safeguards.</div><a name="090623119000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000519"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that the
schedule contains a power to enter property for valuation purposes,
which rationalises and aligns several existing powers. Schedule 36 of
the Finance Act 2008 gives a power to enter and inspect business
premises. However, it can be necessary in specific circumstances to
value private premises or the assets on those premises. For example,
the valuation of all types of property is an essential form of check
for inheritance tax. The aligned valuation power contains significant
extra safeguards that go beyond the current legislation. The
legislation will now specify that valuation inspections can be carried
out only with the agreement of the relevant person or the tribunal. The
ability to visit unannounced has been removed. I am happy to clarify
that.</div><a name="090623119000414"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="090623119000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the consultation, the majority of proposals in the schedule were
welcomed. Some respondents were concerned, however, that the involved
third party power could be applied more widely; for example, to the
beneficiaries of someone who had died. I can give 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column587" />Column number: 587</div>reassurance that that is not the case. Specifying in primary legislation
precisely where the power can be used means that if HMRC did wish to
extend its scope, proposals would need to come before Parliament. I am
happy to respond on that
point.</div><a name="090623119000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
respondents to the consultation noted the difference between
inheritance tax and mainstream taxes. We accepted that and have removed
the proposal for a record-keeping requirement for inheritance tax,
which I know has been a bone of contention. That means that records
created or kept solely for inheritance tax purposes will not be capable
of being inspected. That has allowed us to respond to concerns that
inspection visits might have been made to the vulnerable or bereaved at
short notice. The schedule provides rights of appeal against
information requests and flexibility for any part of the outstanding
lifetime estate to be dealt with alongside the inheritance tax issues
using the same
legislation.</div><a name="090623119000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
general, the safeguards are much stronger. Powers already exist to
ensure that there are safeguards to protect the taxpayer from misuse of
the valuation power. All valuation visits to which the occupier does
not agree will have to be authorised by the independent tribunal, which
will ensure that the power is used only when it is necessary and
proportionate to do so. I do not believe that a further appeal process
is needed as we already have an independent tribunal that will have
authorised the visit in the first place. I believe that we have gone a
long way towards addressing all the concerns of respondents to the
consultation.</div><a name="090623119000197"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div><a name="090623119000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 67
deals with the requirements relating to when a Revenue and Customs
officer may reasonably request contact details for a debtor from a
third party for the purpose of collecting a sum. It would simply
require that Revenue and Customs must first use all reasonable efforts
to ascertain the contact details of the debtor. In other words, it
should check the information that it currently has. It is unreasonable
for HMRC as a matter of course, as the first port of call, to go to a
third party to ask for information which it may have. The amendment
would simply require it to check its information
first.</div><a name="090623119000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
68 relates to the requirements to comply with notices. Paragraph 3 of
the schedule currently states:</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#147;If
a notice is given to the third party under this Schedule, the third
party must provide the
details&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) within such

by such means and in such form (if
any),</div><a name="090623119000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">as
is reasonably specified or described in the
notice.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
simply want a little clarity on the duration of that period by
proposing a minimum period of 30 days from the date of the notice. It
would be helpful if the Minister outlined what the Government have in
mind for the duration of that period, but 30 days is not an
unreasonable amount of time to respond to the
notices.</div><a name="090623119000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
69 probes the grounds for a right to appeal. At the moment, such a
right exists if it would be</div>
<a name="090623119000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unduly onerous
to comply with the notice or requirement.&#148;</div>
<a name="090623119000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment suggests
that an additional ground should be stated explicitly&#151;that the
third party does not have the information. One could argue that if one
does not have the information, compliance would be &#147;unduly
onerous&#148;, in which case the amendment is unnecessary. The
amendment might, however, provide a degree of clarity for third parties
that receive such
notices.</div><a name="090623119000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
70 would provide some protection for a third party that provides
information to Revenue and Customs as a consequence of the powers
contained in the schedule and that runs into difficulties with data
protection legislation. The Minister may well be able to provide some
reassurance that the amendment is unnecessary. We would welcome some
reassurance that any third party acting in accordance with the
provisions of the schedule would not face any data protection
difficulties.</div><a name="090623119000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have one other concern in relation to the schedule that I would like to
put to the Minister. I should be grateful for your guidance,
Mr. Atkinson, on whether I should mention it now or during
the stand part debate. It is a brief point, and it might be to the
convenience of the Committee if I address it
now.</div><a name="090623119000212"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000525"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I hope to be able to provide the assurances and
clarification that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Amendment 67 would require
HMRC to make all reasonable efforts to trace a debtor before using the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column589" />Column number: 589</div>formal power. I assure the Committee that HMRC will use that power only
as a last resort in the most difficult cases, where it considers that
all relevant checks have been made. For its own reasons of
cost-efficiency and making progress, HMRC will make reasonable efforts
from within its own resources, including the use of commercial products
and informal requests, before concluding that there is no way forward
other than to issue a formal notice. That is set out in HMRC&#146;s
guidance, which has been published in draft form and supplied to the
Committee. I therefore do not consider it is necessary to legislate on
that
matter.</div><a name="090623119000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
68 would put in statute a period of 30 days for the third
party to comply. Again, for clarification, we recognise that that is a
reasonable point to make, but I believe that it can be safely left to
guidance. HMRC has published draft guidance stating that it will
usually allow not less than 30 days for a reply. Although in most
cases, 30 days would be long enough to provide simple information, such
as an address that differs from that on a notice, in exceptional cases
a longer or shorter period might be appropriate. HMRC wants the
information, not the penalties, and will be open to representations to
extend the period if particular requests cause difficulty. Leaving the
time period in guidance is in line with schedule 36 to the Finance Act
2006, which operates in a similar
way.</div><a name="090623119000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
probing amendment, 69, would allow the third party to appeal on the
grounds that it does not have the information sought by HMRC. There is
no need to appeal. Confirmation by the third party that it holds no
contact details that differ from those provided by HMRC is enough to
satisfy the notice. Again, that is set out in the draft guidance
published by
HMRC.</div><a name="090623119000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000526"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am concerned about vulnerable people who could
be approached by the Inland Revenue for information. Will the Bill give
leeway to the Department, for example in a situation in which an
80-year-old mother is the third party? Will there be some compassion
over the whole business of application? What guidelines will be given
to achieve
that?</div><a name="090623119000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000527"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> We have published extensive guidance through
HMRC. HMRC tries to act compassionately in cases such as the hon.
Gentleman describes. It is unlikely that an 80-year-old woman will have
information that HMRC cannot secure through other means, but if she
did, every effort would be made to secure that information in an
appropriate way. We want the information, not the penalties. We want to
work with people and believe that the system will be voluntary. The
third parties that have such information are not likely to be
80-year-old women, but banks, other financial institutions, tax agents,
landlords, letting agents and other professionals. There might be an
octogenarian letting agent, but such circumstances will be
rare.</div><a name="090623119000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that third parties will want assurance that in providing the
contact details, they will not be liable for the disclosure under data
protection law. I do not consider that amendment 70 is necessary to
achieve that. The clause will create the lawful means by which third
parties can provide information to HMRC. The  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div>Data Protection Act 1998 states that when disclosing personal data, it
must be lawful and fair to do so. This provision will provide that
lawfulness.</div><a name="090623119000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC
considered statutory protection for the third party carefully in
development and concluded that no further protection was needed. That
view is supported by the Information Commissioner&#146;s office,
whose website includes published guidance on dealing with requests
under tax legislation. It states
that</div><a name="090623119000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;if
you are required to disclose personal information under HMRC
legislation, it will not breach the
Act&#148;,</div><a name="090623119000384"></a><div class="hs_Para">meaning
the 1998 Act. There is no comparable provision in other HMRC
information powers and that has not caused problems to date. Many
organisations already provide such information voluntarily when asked
to do so. I am sure that they will continue to do
so.</div><a name="090623119000385"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the amendments are probing and hope that my assurances
and clarifications will enable the hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire to not press
them.</div><a name="090623119000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000528"></a>Mr.

have a brief query for the Minister to do with how the schedule relates
to the Child Support Agency. It touches on the point made by the hon.
Member for Northampton, South. The guidance suggests that Departments,
friends, neighbours and relatives do not fall within the power, but
where does the CSA come in all this? It is moving to a position where
private contractors will do a lot of its work and debt collection, but
it clearly holds an awful of information that would be of use to HMRC.
I would welcome my hon. Friend the Minister&#146;s advice on where
the CSA sits and whether HMRC can use the information the CSA holds and
its expertise to pursue
debt.</div><a name="090623119000415"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

Gauke:</b> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for
Plymouth, Devonport. May I make a not entirely dissimilar point?
Paragraph 1(3)
states:</div><a name="090623119000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
Schedule does not apply
if&#151;</div><a name="090623119000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
the third party is a charity and obtained the details in the course of

the third party is not a charity but obtained the details in the course
of providing services on behalf of a charity that are free of charge to
the recipient of the
service.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Lady rightly points out, there are similar provisions in
relation to local
authorities.</div><a name="090623119000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should be grateful to hear what the situation is for those who are part
of a non-charity not-for-profit organisation that provides assistance
to people. One can envisage that certain organisations that might fall
within that definition could well find themselves not receiving the
protection contained in paragraphs 1(3) and 1(2). Has any consideration
been given to broadening out the measure, for example, to volunteers
who work for a local authority or non-charity not-for-profit
organisation? 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div>In addition, has any consideration been given to extending that
carve-out along similar lines to those suggested by the hon. Lady? Will
the carve-out be too narrowly defined for some of the circumstances
that could
apply?</div><a name="090623119000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000531"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth,
Devonport for her comments. In general, HMRC can obtain information
from other Departments under the appropriate information gateways. The
terms of those obviously vary, but HMRC will make use of such gateways
before considering using this power. That could apply to the Child
Support Agency, but I do not think that it necessarily applies under
this specific clause. However, the Child Support Agency should be able
to provide information to HMRC if it is needed for HMRC to perform its
duties.</div><a name="090623119000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised the issue of whether
charities should be excluded. Charities are excluded where they
obtained the contact details in the course of giving free advice to the
debtor. The exclusion also protects those who staff helplines on behalf
of the charity, even if they are carrying on business elsewhere. The
power will not be widely available and will be used only by specialist
staff in the most worthwhile cases. HMRC will use the power only if
there is or has been a business relationship between the debtor and the
third party. I hope that clarifies the point for the hon. Gentleman. He
also raised a point specifically about local government employees, and
I think that might well depend on whether there is a business
relationship.</div><a name="090623119000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000532"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am concerned about the matter more in the context
of not-for-profit organisations that might not be a charity, rather
than in relation to charities. They do not appear to benefit from the
protection contained in paragraph 1(3) and, indeed, I am not sure
whether volunteers working for a local authority benefit from the
protection contained in paragraph 1(2). Will the Minister say something
specifically about that?</div>
<a name="090623119000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000533"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding of the policy intention is that
there should be a business relationship between the debtor and the
third party. That is unlikely to be the case for not-for-profit advice
given on the types of case that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. I
give an assurance that HMRC will treat voluntary bodies that acquire
addresses in the course of providing free advice to the debtor alike,
whether they are a charity or otherwise. I hope that provides the
reassurances that he
seeks.</div><a name="090623119000233"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000539"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I beg to move amendment 71, in
schedule 52, page 377, line 23, leave
out &#145;, or ought reasonably to have
known,&#146;.</div><a name="090623119000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me say first that this schedule addresses the recovery of overpaid tax.
Amendment 71 deals with those circumstances where the commissioners are
not liable to give effect to a claim if particular circumstances apply;
there is a list of those circumstances in the Bill. Specifically,
amendment 71 relates to cases where the
claimant</div><a name="090623119000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;could
have sought relief by taking such steps within a period that has now
expired, and knew, or ought reasonably to have known, before the end of
that period that such relief was
available.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
particular words that we have concern with
are:</div><a name="090623119000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;or
ought reasonably to have
known&#148;.</div><a name="090623119000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">Essentially,
this is an objective test that may exclude from claims those taxpayers
who should have realised that they had an opportunity to act but did
not do so. Consequently, the people most likely to be affected by this
particular provision are the less sophisticated and unadvised. They may
well be caught by this restriction and would therefore not be able to
recover overpaid tax. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why
that is justifiable. For the sake of completeness, the &#147;ought
reasonably have known&#148; test applies in one other place in this
schedule&#151;in paragraph 2(6). I will turn to that in a brief stand
part debate, but I would be grateful if the Minister explained the
purpose of the objective test in these
circumstances.</div><a name="090623119000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000540"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The provisions are intended to provide a
final opportunity for taxpayers to reclaim overpaid tax. They modernise
a system originally enacted in 1923, which has increasingly been
criticised by the courts as anachronistic and inconsistent with a
rights-based culture. The provisions simplify the recovery of overpaid
income tax, capital gains tax and corporation tax by providing
taxpayers with a single route of claim. Claims will be possible only if
no other statutory steps can be taken to reclaim an overpayment.
External commentators have recognised that that is an area of law that
would benefit from clarification. The proposed changes have been
exposed informally to external stakeholders, who responded positively
to
them.</div><a name="090623119000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
71 would widen the scope for taxpayers to make claims still further by
relaxing the restrictions relating to matters that the claimant could
have appealed. However, taxpayers are already entitled to make a late
appeal if they have a reasonable excuse for not having appealed within
the normal time limit. The tribunal also has discretion to permit a
late appeal when it is fair and reasonable to do so, and HMRC has
discretion to allow late claims, elections and notices when
appropriate, and to give full effect to the consequences of the claim.
The amendment would enable taxpayers to reopen a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column593" />Column number: 593</div>matter that could have been dealt with on appeal, when they do not have
a reasonable excuse for failing to appeal in time and when the tribunal
does not consider it fair and reasonable to allow a late appeal. The
amendment goes too far and would compromise the effectiveness of the
appeal process as a means of determining disputes, so I ask the hon.
Gentleman to withdraw it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000541"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I note the Exchequer Secretary&#146;s comments on
the appeal process when a taxpayer has a reasonable excuse. That
provides some comfort, but there is concern with such a test&#151;we
have seen it elsewhere&#151;that it may leave the unadvised, least
sophisticated taxpayer in a difficult position. I am sure that the
Government and HMRC are aware of that, and that it is a legitimate
concern to raise. I accept the point about the practical difficulties
if the exclusion were widened too much, and I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="090623119000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000542"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I want to highlight two other areas where the
commissioners are not liable to give effect to claims. One is paragraph
2(6) of new schedule 1AB to the Taxes Management Act 1970, which is
another occasion when the &#147;ought reasonably to have
known&#148; test applies. The other is paragraph 2(7), which requires
a little clarity, and refers to case F,
which</div><a name="090623119000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
where the amount in question was paid or is liable to be
paid&#151;</div><a name="090623119000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
in consequence of proceedings enforcing the payment of that amount
brought against the claimant

think that seeks to prevent claims from being made when HMRC has begun
proceedings to recover tax debts&#151;for example, when tax was due
under self-assessment. We have been advised that that is likely to have
quite a wide effect, and that quite a large number of taxpayers will be
excluded as a consequence of the provision. I should be grateful to
hear from the Minister whether that interpretation is correct, and
whether this is quite a significant
carve-out.</div><a name="090623119000258"></a>

McCarthy-Fry:</b> As I said, the schedule changes the error or
mistake rules for repayment of overpaid income tax, capital gains tax
and corporation tax. Error or mistake relief is intended to provide a
final opportunity for taxpayers to reclaim overpaid tax. The changes
modernise the system and simplify the recovery of overpaid income tax,
capital gains tax and corporation tax. The provisions widen the relief,
and the requirement that the tax must have been paid on the assessment
as a result of a mistake on a return is removed. Claims will not be
possible unless there are no other statutory steps that can be taken to
reclaim an overpayment. Taxpayers&#146; safeguards are improved, and
aligned more closely with the indirect tax error correction provisions,
which cuts burdens for taxpayers and HMRC.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000544"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I have a question about subsection (9), which
states:</div><a name="090623119000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this section any reference to the payment of an amount
to HMRC includes a reference to its being set off against an amount
payable by HMRC (and, accordingly, the reference to the date on which
an amount is paid includes a reference to the date from which the
set-off takes
effect).&#148;</div><a name="090623119000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">How
will interest be assessed when setting off? If the amount is to be
treated as paid when the offset takes effect, it appears that if HMRC
delays making the set-off, the taxpayer may incur an additional
interest charge because of the differential in the interest rates that
apply. When the taxpayer owes money, a higher interest rate applies
than when HMRC owes money to the taxpayer. Consequently, if there is a
delay in the date of setting off, it is to the financial advantage of
HMRC and, correspondingly, to the financial disadvantage of the
taxpayer. The concern has been put to us that subsection (9) gives HMRC
more flexibility than it should have in determining the date on which
the set-off takes effect. I should be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s assurance that the clause will not be used to leave
taxpayers out of
pocket.</div><a name="090623119000266"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000545"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> In the Finance Act 2008, the Government
introduced legislation covering the set-off of sums that HMRC must
repay against debts it is owed. Setting off reduces the administrative
cost to both parties by cutting down the number of unnecessary
transactions. A creditor&#146;s right to set off mutual debts is
founded in common law and enshrined for HMRC taxes in section 130 of
the Finance Act 2008. Under common law, such liabilities are not
discharged until payment is made, whether by circulation of actual cash
or cheques, or by an appropriate adjustment in the creditor&#146;s
books. Clause 100 sets out clearly that both late payment and repayment
interest runs until the amount is repaid and the date of payment is the
date on which any set-off takes effect. I assure the hon. Member for
South-West Hertfordshire that HMRC always seeks to make repayments
promptly.</div><a name="090623119000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000546"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I rise not merely to note that we have managed to
make it into triple figures, but to ask the Minister a question that
relates to the issue of differential rates that I raised under clause
100. As I understand it, those who owe money to HMRC pay a higher rate
of interest than HMRC pays taxpayers to whom it owes money. Does the
Minister have any figures on the benefit to the Exchequer of those
differential rates? What is the policy on interest rates here? In a
period in which interest rates are low, has any consideration been
given to setting a minimum interest rate for taxpayers owed sums of
money, and where does the Exchequer Secretary see the policy on
interest rates going
forward?</div><a name="090623119000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000547"></a>Sarah
McCarthy-Fry:</b> The clause is a further part of the package
of provisions that will create a new harmonised interest rate regime.
It creates the vires for secondary legislation to be made that will set
the rates of interest to be charged and paid under the new regime.
Regulations will provide for a harmonised interest rate that is aligned
across the taxes and offers both transparency and consistency in
approach. Government estimates of the potential difference between what
is currently charged and paid and future amounts under the new regimes
show a negligible difference in the years scored until 2012-13. The aim
is not to raise revenue but to offer a regime that is based on

regulations will also provide for rates that will apply to interest
charged on late-paid taxes and paid on overpayments. The rates
themselves will track all changes in the Bank of England base rate,
with one rate charged on late-paid taxes and a further rate paid on
overpayments. Rate changes will apply 13 days after any rate changes
announced by the Monetary Policy Committee, to allow for systems to be
updated with the new rate. The two rates will apply to all taxes with
the exception of those companies paying under the quarterly instalment
payments arrangements, which will continue to have their own rates.
Basing the harmonised interest rates on the Bank of England base rate
was warmly welcomed by respondents to the consultation process as it
offered a transparent basis for setting the rate that could be clearly
understood by taxpayers. Regulations will also provide for the setting
of a repayment interest floor of 0.5 per cent. That is intended to
ensure that even when the Bank of England base rate reaches zero, the
rate of repayment interest paid by HMRC will never reach
zero.</div><a name="090623119000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment and the clause to which it relates make changes to the
existing interest regime, setting the scene for the long-term
introduction of interest harmonisation. Subsections (1) to (3) bring
the due dates for the withdrawal of any income tax relief under the

The removal of that difference will provide greater consistency and
certainty for
taxpayers.</div><a name="090623119000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
307 introduces two new subsections to this clause after subsection (3).
The amendment is required to ensure that interest is charged and paid
on estate duty and inheritance tax at the same rates as interest for
other taxes. We announced at Budget 2009 our intention to align
interest rates where interest is currently charged and paid, with a
differential between the rate charged and paid, after the Bill receives
Royal
Assent.</div><a name="090623119000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the existing legislation provides that repayment interest for
inheritance taxes should be paid at the same rate as interest charged
on late payments. The amendment removes that anomaly and will ensure
that rates charged and paid can be harmonised across taxes. Those
responding to the consultation on the new interest harmonisation
proposals were in favour of harmonising rates across taxes and the
majority also recognised the need to have a differential between the
rate charged and paid.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000549"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I rise to speak to clause 105 but it could be
clause 106 because my question relates to their interaction. A penalty
is chargeable for both failure to make a return, under clause 105, and
failure to pay tax, under clause 106. Concern has been put to us that
there is an issue of double charging in a failure to make a return and
failure to pay tax due on the same return. This point was considered
during consultation, with HMRC concluding that two distinct penalties
are required in order to encourage both payment and filing on time. It
appears, however, that there is scope for taxpayers to be charged
penalties of more than 100 per cent. of the tax due, in the event that
a return is not filed within 12 months and payment is
delayed by the same
period.</div><a name="090623119000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
concern is that this will impact most significantly on the
unrepresented taxpayer who is not aware of his obligations. I know that
HMRC has indicated in consultation that work is ongoing to ensure
education and support for those taxpayers but there are no safeguards
in the Bill. I would be grateful if the Economic Secretary reassured
the Committee about how these two separate penalties&#151;for late
filing and late payment&#151;will interact. I also ask him, with
regard to clauses 105 and 106, to say a word or two about
implementation of the regime. I understand that HMRC has indicated in
consultation that the regime will be introduced by statutory instrument
on a staged basis, with the first area to be addressed being late
returns and late payment of PAYE through the year. The intention is
that it will be applied to the worst offenders first, on a
risk-assessment basis. There is no provision in the legislation to
enable such an approach to be taken. Clearly, HMRC has not laid out its
approach in primary legislation, but perhaps the Minister might say a
word or two about how the provisions made under clauses 105 and 106 are
to be
implemented.</div><a name="090623119000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000550"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause introduces schedule 55, which provides
for penalties for late filing of tax returns. I appreciate the point
raised by the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire and the fact
that he might have raised it under clause 105 or 106, or perhaps at
other opportunities. It enables the Treasury to make an order to bring
into force the whole schedule or parts of the schedule for specified
circumstances. It also allows the Treasury to make incidental,
supplemental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving
provisions by order, as appropriate, to give proper effect to the
schedule. The hon. Gentleman asked about the interaction of penalties
in the Bill. Any tax-geared penalty is reduced by any other tax-geared
penalty charged by reference to the same amount of
tax.</div><a name="090623119000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Safeguards
outlined in the legislation include a right of appeal to an internal
review and an independent tribunal against all penalties; a common
legislative formulation of reasonable excuse, aligned across taxes,
which is similar to that devised for penalties in the Finance Act 2008;
provision in law for reduction of penalties in special circumstances
not otherwise covered; and improved accessibility to appeals by
specifically ensuring that penalties do not need to be paid in advance
of any
hearing.</div><a name="090623119000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also raised the question about implementation and why it
is not in the Bill. As he is aware, these are major changes which we
believe are most appropriately introduced sequentially. He referred to
the fact that we will take a risk-based approach. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column598" />Column number: 598</div>Implementation does need to consider HMRC&#146;s capacity and resource
issues. Also, introducing change too quickly for taxpayers and their
advisers could be problematic. We want to make progress, and the hon.
Gentleman will be aware of the broader package of reforms that are
being introduced. We think that we are getting the balance right in
this area. If he has any further points that he wants to make on the
schedule or on clause 106, I will happily address
them.</div><a name="090623119000293"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

Government amendments 309 to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000553"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Amendments 308 to 311 relate to paragraph 13 of
schedule 55, which provides for fixed sum penalties incurred by persons
who fail to make a first construction industry scheme return by the due
date to be capped at &#163;3,000. The purpose of the cap is to
prevent disproportionate results from an accumulation of fixed sum
penalties if someone is late joining the CIS, which has monthly return
filing obligations. The cap is a response to concerns expressed about
the current CIS penalty regime, and the four amendments are designed to
ensure that the taxpayer protection works as intended. It is more
generous than what was in the Bill as originally published, and I
believe that it has been welcomed by the
industry.</div><a name="090623119000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
308 makes it clearer that the provision applies only during periods
starting from when a person should have made the first return under the
CIS, so a person who has been making returns in the scheme for several
months and then stops making returns, even for a prolonged period,
would not be subject to the
cap.</div><a name="090623119000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
13 of the schedule caps only the fixed sum penalties but does not
restrict tax-geared penalties, even if they are the minimum value of
&#163;300, where no payment is due. Therefore, for those who have
very small or nil liabilities, but who still need to make a CIS return,
the protection of the cap was not as generous as intended by the
Government. Amendments 309 and 310 disapply the minimum value of
&#163;300 for the tax-geared penalties where the cap
applies.</div><a name="090623119000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
311 defines more clearly the circumstances in which the cap applies. It
does so by refining the definition of &#147;earlier return&#148; to
be those with a filing date earlier than when a first return is made,
rather than when it is due to be filed. It corrects a technical
deficiency in the
drafting.</div><a name="090623119000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the amendments have been welcomed by industry and
therefore ask the Committee to accept

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000556"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The amendments correct a technical deficiency in
schedule 56 that could lead to participators in the petroleum revenue
tax regime being liable to penalties for late payment from the wrong
date. The amendments align the date that a participator will become
liable to a penalty with the other taxes in the table in schedule
56.</div><a name="090623119000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
intention is that for all annual and occasional taxes, including PRT,
the penalty date for principal amounts of tax will be 30 days after the
due date for payment. If extra tax comes into charge after the due
date, the taxpayer should become liable to a penalty only if they fail
to pay within 30 days of the due date for the additional tax. The only
exception to that is if the taxpayer has failed to submit a return
where the penalty date should be the original due date for the tax.
That is to ensure that taxpayers do not gain an advantage by avoiding

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000558"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The clause and schedule 58 relate to the recovery
of debts using PAYE payments. The provision enables HMRC to collect
small debts of no more than &#163;2,000 across all the taxes it
administers from taxpayers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div>through the PAYE system. The provision specifically excludes HMRC from
using the PAYE system to collect debts in respect of tax credits or any
debts due from an employer during the current tax year. Regulations can
be made through secondary legislation to effect the
proposal.</div><a name="090623119000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is intended that the provision will be used by HMRC as a last resort in
the event that a debt cannot be paid in full or through a time to pay
arrangement. I would be grateful if the Minister confirmed that the
provision is a last resort&#151;there is no specific safeguard in the
legislation or in PAYE regulations to say that that is the case.
Currently, small sums relating to self-assessment liabilities from
previous years are collected through the PAYE system on a regular
basis.</div><a name="090623119000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given
that &#163;2,000 is a large sum for many taxpayers, it would be
appropriate to have some form of statutory safeguard in the
regulations, such as a referral to a more senior officer, to ensure
that the mechanism is utilised only as a last resort. I would be
grateful if the Minister provided assurances that regulations will
reflect that, or at least that the provisions of the clause and
schedule 58 will not be used as a routine method of collecting small
debts.</div><a name="090623119000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000559"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The clause introduces schedule 58, which allows
HMRC to collect certain debts owed to it through the pay-as-you-earn
system. HMRC faces a particular problem with small debts, which
represent a large percentage of what it is owed by volume, but only a
small percentage by value. That makes its traditional methods of
enforcement&#151;going to court to obtain judgment or seizing goods
to sell at auction&#151;increasingly less cost-effective. Those
traditional methods can cause the debtor stress and extra expense. The
clause allows HMRC to use the PAYE system it administers to collect
small debts over time. Doing so reassures compliant taxpayers by
ensuring that tax debt is pursued, while offering debtors an easy way
to spread their payments.</div>
<a name="090623119000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-West
Hertfordshire asked whether such matters can be appealed on grounds of
hardship. The PAYE coding rules are designed to prevent hardship being
caused through excessive deductions, either on a single pay day or
through the year as a whole. If a taxpayer feels that a coding change
will cause hardship, they should object by contacting HMRC immediately.
HMRC also offers help to older people, those with disabilities, people
on low incomes and those from diverse backgrounds, in a variety of ways
as part of its day-to-day work. It recognises the need for
clear and strong communications with those groups, and talks regularly
to voluntary groups, including TaxAid and the Low Incomes Tax Reform
Group, about problems faced by particular groups of debtors, such as
the financially vulnerable. I understand that some hon. Members&#146;
representations come from that source.</div>
<a name="090623119000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving on to
statutory safeguards and limits on how much can be coded out, the
amount that can be coded out will remain subject to the normal limits,
which prevent excessive deductions. The limits are &#163;2,000 a year
or 50 per cent. of gross taxable income. The &#163;2,000 is in the
clause and the 50 per cent. is in the existing PAYE regulations. That
gives important safeguards.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column602" />Column number: 602</div><a name="090623119000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire is aware, my right hon. Friend the
Financial Secretary has written to the Committee about the order-making
powers, which I hope provides
clarification.</div>
<a name="090623119000338"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090623119000560"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): Just for clarification,
when the Minister says 50 per cent., does he mean 50 per cent. of
income or 50 per cent. of income less national insurance contributions?
What is the tax take? How much income do such people have
left?</div>
<a name="090623119000339"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000561"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> My understanding of the safeguards is that the
limits are &#163;2,000 a year or 50 per cent. of gross taxable
income. As I explained, the &#163;2,000 figure is in the clause and
the 50 per cent. figure is in the current PAYE regulations. I do not
believe that the regulations have caused problems for those who comment
on such tax matters.</div>

<a name="090623119000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000562"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> A moment ago the Minister referred to
representations received from the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group during
the passage of the Bill. I rise to raise points from that group on
managed payment plans.</div>
<a name="090623119000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 110
is welcome, but I have a few questions about its details. The clause
gives HMRC the ability to set out further requirements for managed
payment plans in regulations. However, it appears that much of the
detail will be set out in non-statutory guidance, a draft of which has
been published and is on the HMRC website.</div>
<a name="090623119000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
original consultation document, HMRC proposed to limit MPPs to payment
by direct debit and to online filers. Following representations from
the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, HMRC offered the following points of
reassurance in its consultation response, both of which are vital for
low income taxpayers to take advantage of MPPs. First, HMRC said that
it
was:</div><a name="090623119000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;exploring
other methods of payment for MPPs (ie not limiting them to direct
debit) and have agreed to accept standing
orders.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
HMRC
said:</div><a name="090623119000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Paper
tax return filers will be allowed to set up
MPPs.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
draft guidance appears to cover both these points. It confirms that
HMRC will accept both standing orders and direct debit, but suggests
that direct debit is preferred, one of the requirements being
to:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div><a name="090623119000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Make
payment by Direct Debit or Standing Order. HMRC will need some
assurance that payments will be made at a precise time and be posted to
the correct record, and this is best achieved through Direct
Debit.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister give some indication of what information will be sought
from those people who use standing orders? The LITRG&#146;s concern
is that such people will be pressured into agreeing to a direct debit.
It would be helpful if the Minister outlined what HMRC&#146;s policy
will be in those circumstances.</div>
<a name="090623119000351"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
concern that the LITRG has mentioned to us is that paper filers will
also fare worse than those filing online. Again, the LITRG quotes from
the draft guidance, which
says:</div><a name="090623119000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Those
who cannot file online, or do not wish to do so, will still be able to
set up a payment plan by filing a paper return but will have to
calculate their self-assessment
themselves.&#148;</div><a name="090623119000352"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
paper filers tend to be older people, some of whom may be lacking the
technological sophistication to file online, or those on low incomes
who cannot readily afford access to the internet, there is a concern
that that guidance may be somewhat unfair. The regulations or perhaps
even the guidance itself, should require HMRC to provide those people
with help in making their calculations, on request. I would be grateful
if the Minister responded on that point.</div>
<a name="090623119000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also the question of penalties in the event of failure to maintain a
payment plan. In the event of a taxpayer failing to keep up agreed
payments, subsections (6) and (7) of clause 110 allow HMRC to give
notice to the taxpayer that he is relieved from penalties that would
otherwise arise. However, that safeguard appears to operate at
HMRC&#146;s discretion, so that it would be reliant on the guidance
and individual officers applying that guidance in practice. The LITRG
argues that there should be a statutory right of appeal if HMRC refuses
to give such a notice. If there is no such right, the taxpayer would
have no recourse against HMRC if it exercised its discretion
wrongfully, except by way of judicial review, which is no real remedy,
as the Minister will know, because it is well beyond the means of the
majority of individual taxpayers and certainly beyond the means of most
of the taxpayers that we are talking about. Again, I would be grateful
for the Minister&#146;s comments.</div>
<a name="090623119000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally the
LITRG has highlighted to us that Budget note 88 tells us that MPPs will
not be introduced before April 2011, because changes are needed to
HMRC&#146;s systems. I seek some reassurance from the Minister that
HMRC&#146;s systems will be able to cope, given the increased
pressures on its finances. Also, has any consideration been given to
trialling the new scheme prior to widespread and national
implementation in
2011?</div><a name="090623119000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090623119000563"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I welcome the Opposition&#146;s overall support
for MPPs. As the Committee will be aware, entry to a plan will be
wholly voluntary. First, the taxpayer must agree to pay the tax in
instalments and HMRC must agree to accept payments in that way.
Secondly, instalments paid before the normal date must be balanced by
those paid afterwards. I believe that MPPs are an important way in
which we can help taxpayers to manage their money.</div>
<a name="090623119000356"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked a number of detailed questions. First it is right, as
he will appreciate, that the guidance that we published in draft sets
out a framework 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>for MPPs and how the HMRC will operate them. Clearly, most of the detail
is contained in the guidance, on which we have been consulting, rather
than in the Bill. The detail of any particular payment plan will be in
the terms and conditions under which HMRC makes it available and the
taxpayer chooses to accept. We do not believe that it is necessary for
such a level of detail to be in regulations. If a default
occurs&#151;obviously, we hope that such cases will be few and far
between&#151;the taxpayer would be in breach of the terms of their
own plan and would therefore be liable for the consequences of their
late payment.</div>
<a name="090623119000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(7) allows HMRC to relieve the taxpayer from penalties following a
failure to make agreed payments, where that is appropriate. It is not
an entitlement, but may be offered to taxpayers where they continue to
pay by agreed instalments. That will happen where the taxpayer has
approached HMRC before the payment date and has either made good the
deficient payment within a few days, or arranged time to pay the
balance</div><a name="090623119000358"></a><div class="hs_Para">Independent
research commissioned by HMRC and by others shows that direct debit is
favoured by many, including most businesses. Although it is
HMRC&#146;s preferred method of payment, its officers will not put
pressure on taxpayers to pay in that way. Following representations
made in the consultation, HMRC will offer MPPs for some of the
electronic payment methods, such as standing orders. Assorted
information that HMRC would require would include fully completed pay
slips showing the correct taxpayer reference, year, and amount of
payment.</div>
<a name="090623119000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">On statutory
rights of appeal, it is not the case that there is a statutory right of
appeal. We certainly want to encourage anyone in difficulties to
approach HMRC. As I have indicated, where the taxpayer has approached
HMRC before the payment date and has either made good the deficient
payment within a few days, or set up an arrangement for time to pay the
balance, HMRC would want to respond favourably. Of course, all late
payment penalties can be appealed in the usual way.</div>
<a name="090623119000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
confident that HMRC&#146;s systems will be able to cope with
implementation. Strong governance will be provided by a dedicated
implementation team, overseen by an implementation forum of leading
officials and industry figures. HMRC will continue to look at whether
it will be appropriate to trial the changes in the course of
development, but we believe that MPPs are an important initiative and
that is why they have been included in this year&#146;s Finance
Bill.</div>
