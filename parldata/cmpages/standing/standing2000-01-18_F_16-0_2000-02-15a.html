<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am advised that when the Committee adjourned last Thursday, we were dealing with amendment No. 169 to clause 29.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I welcome you back to the Chair; it is nice to see you returned from your globetrotting on such good form. Can the Minister of State tell us what progress has been made on the drafting of the amendments relating to rebates, so that we know how to pace ourselves in that respect?
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Jeff Rooker):</B> We do not need to pace ourselves while waiting for the amendments. They are on their way, but I cannot yet say when they will be tabled. Drafting the amendments on rebates is extremely complicated. Although the issue is simple, putting it into legislative language is difficult. Two people are working on the amendments, and first drafts are floating around. They will take the form of new clauses and consequential changes, and we intend to table them as soon as possible, so that we can have a debate while the Bill is still being considered in Committee. I regret that I cannot give more precise information at the present time. However, I know that the parliamentary draftsmen and the Department's lawyers are working their socks off—perhaps their shoes as well.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. As the Minister said, the amendments are extremely complex, and I hope that adequate time will be allowed for their consideration not only by the Committee, but by outside bodies. I should like to put down a marker that if there is not enough time for a proper and thorough debate in Committee, we shall want extra time on Report.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I suggest that the matter should be discussed through the usual channels, rather than here this morning. All we can do in the meantime is take note of the Minister's remarks.
<H4><center>Clause 29</center></H4>
<H4><center>Calculation</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [10 February]: No. 169, in page 27, line 16, at the end to insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`This subsection shall not apply to those working for companies with fewer than five employees.'.—[Mrs. Lait.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I also welcome you back, Mr. O'Brien. I have made a mental commitment to jazz up our discussions on this interesting and vital part of the Bill, on which we made some progress last week.
<P>
In a nutshell, amendment No. 169 is unique in that it would tie a state benefit to the number of employees in a company. As far as I know, no state benefit entitlement anywhere in our system is dependent on the size of the company for which a person works. It would be wholly wrong to deprive someone of a state benefit because they happen to work for a firm with fewer than five employees. The stakeholder pension measures are not comparable in that sense. People will not be deprived of a stakeholder pension because they work for a firm with fewer than five employees; it is simply that they will not be able to join a stakeholder pension as of right through an employer with fewer than five employees.
<P>
Pensions are retail products that are available on the retail market. Employers can voluntarily give access to them, but will not be required, under the regulations, to do so as a statutory right. A genuine comparison cannot be made. There is a distinction, in that the state second pension is a state benefit, not a private benefit. One cannot possibly restrict a person's state benefit, in which they build up an entitlement on the basis of their own contributions, merely because of the size of their employer. On that basis, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I fully understand the limitation of the amendment to which the Minister has drawn attention. However, I hoped that he would have abandoned that position and acknowledged the size of the problem, to which the amendment is intended to refer. The problem is that 10 per cent. of the work force are employed by firms that have fewer than five employees. Does not that mean that there is a hole in the proposal? The Minister was correct to say that small firms might voluntarily provide such dedicated pensions, but they may not. People may go into the market where such pensions are available, but they may not. In general, they will have a low income and a marked lack of financial sophistication. The state second pension was intended for them.
<P>
The amendment was designed to deal with that problem. I acknowledge its weakness, but the Minister has not addressed the problem that the amendment is designed to cure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Let us look at the facts. My recollection is that 750,000 employees work for firms that have fewer than five employees, which is nowhere near 10 per cent. of the work force, although they are an important group of people. There are 5 million people in the target group in relation to the stakeholder provisions, which we are not discussing in this context. Those people fall into the band of people whose earnings are roughly between £10,000 and £20,000 and they have no second pension provision. I accept that 750,000 may be a fairly significant percentage of 5 million, but the Government's advertising will ensure that people are aware of the relevant opportunities. We shall review the matter after three years, in an effort to embrace as many people as possible.
<P>
The amendment would tie state benefit entitlement to the size of the firm that one works for, but—I say that with due humility to Opposition Members—that could not possibly be done.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Does the Minister's estimate of 750,000 people include sole traders?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not know. I recall the figure from memory—it arose in relation to the stakeholder orders. In relation to companies and employers, about two thirds of the original figure would be excluded. In relation to deductions from earnings and access, we are seeking to take a burden away from employers at the start of the stakeholder scheme. I cannot say how sole traders fit in with the 750,000 figure—they may well be included.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): Sole traders represent 13 per cent. of employed people. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) is not as far off the mark as the Minister suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall obtain further information. My recollection is that 750,000 employees work for firms with fewer than five employees. That is why we considered the limit carefully. If we had raised it to 10 employees, we should have involved almost 1.4 million people, but that was too large a percentage of the target group of 5 million people who do not have second pension provision. We had to strike a balance between the size of the firm and the number of employees who would have access to the stakeholder provisions through their employer. The employer will not provide the pension but will give access to the pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): Does the Minister accept that to argue about the numbers is to miss the point? In my constituency, the vast majority of companies fall within the category described by the hon. Members for New Forest, West and for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles). How onerous will the red tape be for those small companies? I agree with the principle described by the Minister, but will the requirement for deductions from earnings be so onerous as to add an unacceptable burden to small companies?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> For the purposes of clause 29, there will be no burden on firms in relation to the state second pension. The hon. Gentleman may want a debate on stakeholder pensions—a totally different pension system to the one that we are discussing—and the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, but I have not been briefed to give detailed information on that.
<P>
I have been told that the figure of 750,000 does not include sole traders. I had wondered about that when I was speaking on the matter earlier and I did not want to mislead the Committee. The target group of stakeholders comprises approximately 5 million people in the moderate earnings band between £10,000 and £20,000 a year who have no second pension provision, such as a private or occupational pension. The figure of 750,000 represents part of the target group. The total number of employees in a firm would not be included, as those earning more than £20,000 in a small firm would not be part of the stakeholder target group.
<P>
The Government will measure the success of the stakeholder pension scheme by the number of people on moderate earnings without a second pension—those in the target group—who take up a second pension. People in small firms who are on high earnings and have private or occupational pensions will not be part of the target group. They could hold a stakeholder pension, but they would not be part of the group that the Government will use to measure the success or otherwise of the stakeholder pension scheme. This brings me back to the point that the state second pension is a state benefit. In some ways, it qualifies as a national insurance contributory benefit. One could not seriously consider tying that to the size of firm in which a person worked.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Perhaps we are talking at cross-purposes. I shall try to explain the problem as we see it.
<P>
Right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee accept that there is a potential for sole traders, and for people working in companies with fewer than five employees, to miss out on stakeholder pensions because of the exemption. During our deliberations on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, we argued that those firms should be exempt, and we welcome that. However, we are left with the problem of people who currently have access to the state earnings-related pension scheme on a compulsory basis unless they are contracted out—which would suggest that they had some form of second pension—and who will be missed out under the state second pension provisions. However sophisticated the advertising and information given to them, they will not take out a stakeholder pension. They will lose under future SERPS and they will be considerably worse off under stage 2 of the state second pension because of the way in which S2P works.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That will not happen. Stage 2 of the state second pension—the flat rate—will not occur until stakeholder pensions are established. Later amendments will provide for ways of measuring whether they are established. They will not have been established if great chunks of the work force miss out on them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I realise that we are coming to that group of amendments soon, and we shall probe the Government on that issue. Will one of the criteria for the Secretary of State not introducing the stakeholder pension be based on whether a high proportion of sole traders and those working for companies with fewer than five employees have not taken up stakeholder pensions? If so, what will that proportion be? My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West is right—sole traders and people in that category constitute a significant part of the work force, who would not benefit from SERPS.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I could jump the gun by saying that, under amendment No. 170, we shall accept the spirit of that point, which I hope will answer the hon. Lady's question on this amendment. It is impossible to list how to measure success, and I shall say more about that matter when we debate the next amendment. If large chunks of the market are missed out, for various reasons, a flat rate will not apply. ``Established'' means established; it does not mean started up and available. We have an avowed target in terms of the numbers of people who take up second pensions, if only on a voluntary basis. Nevertheless, we want a fairly large part of the market to be involved. I cannot comment on the issue of sole traders; our policies are not predicated just on the basis of sole traders, to which the hon. Lady continues to refer. There will not be a flat rate unless the scheme is established. We will have a set of criteria, which will be debated in Parliament, to assess whether it is established. As I have said, the spirit of amendment No. 170 can be accepted even before we debate it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> On the basis that we will consider the issue in more detail under amendment No. 170, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 27, line 16, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6A) The Secretary of State, before implementing the regulations of subsection (6) shall lay before Parliament a report indicating the satisfactory establishment and progression of the stakeholder pension scheme.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We move swiftly to what will be a long discussion on the meaning of ``established'', how it affects the withdrawal of SERPS and whether it is worth while for people to continue to stage 2 under the state second pension. We are concerned about paragraph 8 of page 40 of the Green Paper, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``We envisage that the move towards a new flat-rate State Second Pension might begin, for those with a significant part of their working lives still remaining (for example, those aged under 45 at the point of change), five years after the introduction of stakeholder pension schemes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we discussed the previous amendment, we focused on a group of people who might risk losing out on their entitlement. We have to bear in mind the fact that one of the complications is that the target audience for stakeholder pensions is those who earn between £9,500 and £21,000, and there is a real and meaningful debate about whether it is worth while taking out a stockholder pension or state second pension, or whether it is better to rely on the minimum income guarantee, housing benefit and council tax benefit. There is no guarantee, other than promises, that stakeholders will evolve as the Government hope, for precisely the reasons that I mentioned. I do not want to bore the Committee by saying how much someone would have to save, in a stakeholder or state second pension, to have a better benefit than the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> It is a question of not so much being bored as being enlightened. Many constituents need to have those facts drawn to their attention.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Indeed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): Does my hon. Friend agree that one can be enlightened and bored at the same time?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I hope that people will be enlightened, and not in a boring way. If it is to be effective, advertising information must not bore people. One problem is that too many people are bored by the subject of pensions, because of its complexity. Frankly the Bill only adds to their difficulties instead of making it simpler.
<P>
The Government want to ensure that as many people as possible opt for stakeholder pensions. As I say, there are rival attractions. The minimum income guarantee has yet to prove that it is a worse deal for people than the amount that they could save either through stakeholder pensions or through the state second pension. We want to tease out from the Government what criteria they would use for establishing stakeholders pensions.
<P>
I am always aware, particularly in regard to pensions, that there is an iron law of unforeseen consequences, as people act in an economically rational manner. By definition, we cannot foresee what that rational manner will be, but we are well aware that, for people on a tight budget to commit to putting away a certain amount every month, can be a strain. However well intentioned they are and however much we want them to save for the future and provide for themselves, they may be better off investing in something like an ISA.
<P>
We hope that the Minister will say something more positive than he did on amendment No. 169 in relation to ``established''. Can he define ``established''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We touched in earlier debates on the interaction between couples and single people, and we must bear that in mind, because comparisons can be misleading, but what the hon. Lady said about ISAs is crucial. We must not give people the impression that there is equal treatment. The ISA is a savings scheme. If a person falls on hard times and goes on MIG, those savings are taking into account. If a person takes a stakeholder pension, his assets are treated slightly differently for means-tested benefits. People will lose their savings for what they might have thought was a pension because they were in an ISA rather than a pension scheme.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I have no difficulty with the Minister's point if somebody has the spare cash to save from a continual stream of income. The difficulty arises when one looks over the whole term of life and saving, because the pressures on a family or a person to save at different times of their life are different. It is possibly easier to save when one is young and unmarried for, say, a starter pension, and then get married. If both the couple work, as is normal these days, they will be relatively well off and they can then both invest in stakeholder pensions or in the state second pension. Then children come along.
<P>
All members of the Committee who have children, and even those who do not such as myself, are well aware of the costs that children impose on a family, however well off they are. We know, because we have talked about child support issues, how a woman's income can fluctuate. The state second pension, in which the credits are up to £5,500, recognises that, when women are looking after children, their income can go down and, suddenly, a relatively affluent lifestyle is under enormous pressure. That is when saving long term becomes less of a worry and an ISA becomes a better way of putting money away tax-free for 10, 15 or 20 years until the children leave home.
<P>
I read today that the average age at which children leave home is 22, which I cannot believe. Clearly mothers make their sons far too comfortable, and the daughters are probably looking after the sons, but we shall not go into the details of that. Until the children leave higher education, and these days more and more children are going into higher education, the pressure on the family budget is enormous.
<P>
People on the incomes that we are talking about could find their budgets under huge pressure for at least 20 years if they make a monthly payment to a pension. That is when people decide, in a cold and calculated way, not to invest in a long-term pension, but, if they have some spare cash, to invest in an ISA. I admire such people because that is a jolly tough decision. Ministers must accept the need for flexible savings. However flexible a stakeholder pension is, it is not as flexible as an ISA. As families struggle to bring up their children, they will have a huge savings gap in the middle.
<P>
What criteria are we talking about for success? We have said that those who work for small firms may pick up an ISA. In Standing Committee debates, a figure is often produced as being typical of the problem under discussion. On this occasion, the dentist's wife turns out to be the figure to whom people refer when they talk about stakeholders. I feel sorry for dentists' wives everywhere for being stuck with this image. We are talking about the fairly well-off, middle-class wife who stays at home, perhaps acting as a receptionist or keeping the books for the dental practice. It seems sensible that the dentist should be able to invest in a stakeholder pension on behalf of his wife, but is that one of the criteria? What is the take-up? Will it be broken down by, say, social and demographic classes to show whether the stakeholder pension is successful? Will such people come into the target group to which the Minister referred—those with an income of between £9,500 and £20,000—because of what they do to sustain the dental practice? It does not take a great deal of imagination to read across into similar situations. If middle-class people take up the stakeholder pension on behalf of a lower earner in the family, will that be regarded as success for the stakeholder pension?
<P>
We need to know what percentage is needed to show whether the stakeholder pension is established to ensure that the Government's policy for the interaction of stakeholder pensions and state second pension stage 2 can go forward. Those who have to go on to the second stage of the state second pension after five years will find themselves badly affected, as the Minister has said on many occasions, because they have moved on to the flat rate. The Minister is trying to shoehorn them all into stakeholder pensions to make everybody save in the private sector.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I found my hon. Friend's comments profoundly depressing, if it is true that I can continue to expect my income to be frittered away on children's vests until my children reach the age of 22.
<P>
However, I draw your attention, Mr. O'Brien, to the amendment, which would require that, before establishing regulations that will bring in stage 2 of the state second pension arrangements, the Minister must lay before Parliament a report indicating that the stakeholder pension scheme has been successfully implemented. That is an important provision, which Parliament would do well to require of Ministers.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, according to page 40 of the Green Paper, the Minister will decide when the stakeholder scheme has been established. It has been suggested that it might be established five years after implementation, but that will be a judgment for the Minister. Before we do away with the exhaustive provisions that were discussed during last week's proceedings, it is proper for Committee members to consider whether the Minister, before making such a judgment, should explain to the House why he believes that the stakeholder scheme has been successfully established. Having established the state second pension arrangements, we are suddenly about to pull the rug from under many people's feet and encourage them to go for the stakeholder pension.
<P>
Let us consider precisely the factors that ordinary people who will be affected by this decision will have to take into account. Under the clause, a pension will provide defined benefits at a fairly low administrative cost. Certainly, I anticipate that the cost will be no higher than the current arrangements under SERPS. As a result of the change in policy and the implementation of stage 2 of the state second pension, people will be required to enter the marketplace and purchase a pension of unpredictable value. Employers will not be required to contribute to those pensions and will not be responsible for their performance. People in the target group are of relatively low financial sophistication, are at the lower end of the income scale, and will lack independent advice on those pensions. Initially, they will be able to seek such advice only from the schemes themselves, which leaves much to be desired. We anticipate that the administrative cost will be about 1 per cent. of the fund, which, compared to the existing arrangements, is quite expensive. That might represent between 20 and 30 per cent. of contributions over a fund member's lifetime, which is a very significant figure. Certainly, it is 10 times the cost of administering current schemes.
<P>
As we discovered during discussion of the previous amendment, there are a number of exemptions from the scheme. Before we remove this important part of our welfare and benefits system, the Minister should come to Parliament and explain precisely why the stakeholder scheme has been so successful that it is now appropriate to trigger the change. That is not an onerous requirement. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. When we were debating the previous amendment, he said that he accepted the spirit of it. Stakeholder pensions might be described as pensions for poor people. When considering people at the lower end of the income scale, who may enjoy less financial sophistication than Members of Parliament, Ministers should be clear about why it is appropriate to make the change, and they should justify it in a report to Parliament.
<P>
Given the magnitude of the change, it is important for the Committee to be familiar with the submission by the National Pensioners Convention, of which Ministers are certainly aware. It deals with the alternative view on stakeholder pensions, which was set out in 1998–99. It is a powerful document, which deals with precisely the issues that I have drawn to the Committee's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> It is pleasing that the Minister is—rightly—sympathetic to the amendment. My hon. Friends have explained the reasons behind it. Clearly, the introduction of stage 2 will mean that the amount of state pension available will drop sharply for those on middle to low incomes. Neither the Government nor the Opposition want that, and much will depend on how successful they are in introducing a second pension in conjunction with the first. The Government face a dilemma. I reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) about dentists and dentists' wives, although I am hoping for an appointment with a female dentist—I do not know where that leaves them.
<P>
My vision of dentists is that of Lord Olivier in ``The Marathon Man'', when he tortures Dustin Hoffman in his chair, so I am not sure that we should build up pension provision around dentists. An incident occurred in the filming of that entertainment, which is analogous to the Government's dilemma in relation to stakeholders. It is a short tale, which will aid the Committee's understanding. You are probably aware, Mr. O'Brien, that Mr. Hoffman is a method actor. To prepare for the torture scene he went without sleep for four days.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is that necessary with regard to the stakeholder pension?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> State second pension.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> State second pension, of course. I promise you that it is in order, Mr. O'Brien. Mr. Hoffman arrived to do the scene, and wandered around looking completely shattered. Lord Olivier said, ``Are you all right?'' Hoffman replied that he wanted to get into character for the torture scene, to which Olivier replied ``That's interesting, have you ever thought about acting as an alternative?'' The Government are so hung up on stakeholder, and the success of stakeholder, that they are ignoring all the other forms of secondary pensions. If the move to stage 2 is just on the basis of the stakeholder pension, it might be a mess, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West illustrated. We have all received briefings from various organisations about a possible repeat of the pensions misselling scandal in respect of stakeholder pensions, and we should be concerned that such an important reform rests on the back of the success of those pensions. I had the honour to serve on the Committee that considered the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, which was enacted last year. We discussed how difficult it was for anyone on a middle income to decide whether to take out a stakeholder pension. The Minister seemed to be saying, ``You can't go for an ISA, because if you go on half time the rules are such that your income might be taken away.'' Shoehorning people into stakeholders, which is the Government's approach, is not necessarily the best solution. After all, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had doubts about them when the Treasury proposed its LISA—lifelong individual savings account—scheme as an alternative. It is not good enough for the Government to say, ``This is how the rules operate'', when the Government dictate the rules.
<P>
The Minister was not so forthright in discussing the nature of the minimum income guarantee, which may put people into a system in which they will not be financially better off. As he conceded, we produced figures some time ago suggesting that the minimum income guarantee might offer lesser provision than the state second pension.
<P>
Before my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham moved on to talk about dentists, she mentioned the growing problems of different calls on people's incomes. Pensions are boring; they represent delayed gratification. We must make an assumption that if we save conscientiously throughout our working lives we will comfortably off in our old age, but inflation could take care of that, or the grim reaper may intervene before we receive any of our benefits. Sometimes when one faces the pressing need for finances—whether for new vests, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West suggested, or for more urgent requirements—it is easy to put the matter off. The absence of compulsion in stakeholder pensions works against making sensible assessments for stage 2 of the state second pension. That is despite the changes that the Government have made—largely to adopt suggestions that we made in Committee, which they voted down but have belatedly accepted.
<P>
The Minister's point about couples was important in respect of means-tested benefits. However, we must bear it in mind that there is an increased likelihood that when people draw this pension, they will be living in single households as a result of either bereavement or divorce. The increase in the number of pensioners living in single households in the past 10 years or so is a trend that stands out. We should bear that in mind in devising measures that are aimed well into this century, because those social trends have not necessarily reached a plateau. We must be realistic. We cannot use pension provision as social engineering; it should reflect what is happening in the community.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): I support my hon. Friend in asking the Government to consider accepting our amendment. I am glad to hear that they are thinking of doing so, because they should not have anything to hide and there is no good reason why they should not adopt our suggestion.
<P>
When we are creating a new pension system, there must be a social compact and as much clarity as possible so that people can plan for the future with certainty, and understand how their pension arrangements will work. The Government must give us a full and clear explanation, because the nature of pension provision is opaque. I suspect that we all share that view of pensions when we try to see how they will work when we reach pensionable age. Therefore, I hope that the Government will consider our amendment this time. It would be a triumph for the Committee if they accepted it. We are optimistic that the Minister will have good news for us.
<P>
The state second pension applies to people on earnings as modest as £9,500 and the transitional arrangements for state second pension will apply to those at the lower end of the spectrum. Average wages are now between £18,000 and £20,000. Therefore, only those on below average earnings will apply to move on to the stakeholder pension, having been in the state second pension during the transitional arrangements, because the Government have chosen to make the transition to stakeholder pensions apply to those on half average earnings and up to and around average earnings. That group of people is likely to find it difficult to understand how their pension arrangements will work in future.
<P>
I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. I think that most people are pretty ignorant about the way in which their pension arrangements work and are horrified when they have to decide what to do, because the pension is based on so many forecasts. The figures that one puts into the compilation change the outcome considerably, because it relates to so many years hence and one percentage point can make a huge difference to compound interest. Therefore, it is a complicated subject to come to grips with when we are working out how best to look after ourselves in future. I think that that applies to everyone, but particularly perhaps to those on modest incomes who are considering a stakeholder pension.
<P>
If the Government did not consider accepting our amendment, Conservative Members might be suspicious about the value that stakeholder pensions represented for this group of people. People on higher incomes will get more out of a second pension, primarily because they can save more. The higher one's income, the more one can afford to save and therefore the bigger the pot becomes when one is older and the more one is protected from falling back on to state benefit. However, at modest levels of income, the difference between relying on a state second pension and providing a pension for oneself, with the loss of income today in order to look after tomorrow, is significant. However right and proper it may be for society to encourage such behaviour, saving for a stakeholder pension represents a significant loss of income for people who want jam today. In the best of all worlds, they might have enjoyed spending that income on entertainment or even necessities.
<P>
People need to understand by how much they will be better off if they save for a stakeholder pension, how much income they will be required to put aside, and how much more that money will buy on taking out their pensions. The Government have shied away from compulsory pension contributions—a question on which hon. Members have differing views. In the absence of any compulsion, many people on £9,500 a year—and perhaps as much as £12,000 or £15,000 a year—will not buy a great deal more. I recognise that, as the Minister explained in respect of previous amendments, a couple who both save for their pensions could be much better off, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, that does not always happen. Sadly, for reasons such as divorce or bereavement, people can end up alone in later life. In such circumstances, their own pensions may not prove as valuable as they had hoped.
<P>
People must understand the level of savings that the stakeholder pension will require. We are worried about the amount that people will need to save to lift them above what the state second pension would buy. Is it realistic for people on low incomes, albeit it not as low as £9,500, to make such savings? The figures are calculated over a lifetime, but they add up to many thousands of pounds. Because they depend on what assumptions are made, it is difficult to calculate them precisely. For some people, £60,000 to £100,000 is a huge amount of money to save during a lifetime, and constitutes an enormous amount of forgone income that could have been spent each year. It is right and proper that they save that money, but the Government do not intend to compel them. Such people will have a choice, and some who consider the hard facts about loss of short-term income will say, ``Hang on a minute—if this is what stakeholder buys, I'm not sure that it's for me. I'm happy to fall back on the state second pension, and what the state will guarantee in later life on the basis of my earnings.''
<P>
As we all know, some people think that tomorrow will never come and that life is better spent in the pub than worrying about what will happen when they reach 65. That does not help the rest of us, who may have to pick up the bill for such people. When the Government launch the second phase of the state second pension, it is important that people realise that they are buying something worth while that will greatly enhance their living standards when they reach pensionable age.
<P>
The Government rightly made a big fuss about the mis-selling of pensions. Pensions were mis-sold because it was not generally understood that, for example, it is preferable for the NHS to contribute to a nurse's pension and guarantee a certain outcome, than for the nurse to contribute to a private pension. I understand that people who lack the sophistication of a pensions expert did not realise that it was wrong to proceed on that basis—

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to be too sharp about this, but the nurse took that action because Tory Ministers told her that she would be better off, and they lied. That is the truth of the matter in relation to pensions mis-selling.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I do not agree—Ministers did not lie in that way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Oh yes they did.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> No one who enters the House—
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. Is it in order to say that a Minister, or anyone else in the House, has lied?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Perhaps the Minister will say who lied. He said previously that a Minister had lied, but if it was not a Minister, he should say who it was.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> The hon. Lady made her point in shades of grey, and I was trying to put it in black and white. Pensions mis-selling was done deliberately—the previous Government deliberately encouraged people to leave the national insurance system using the argument that they would be better off. The Government did nothing to protect those people from mis-selling by the pensions industry.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we return to the amendment, which refers to the submission of a report by the Secretary of State to Parliament? Committee members have discussed whether the pensions system was correct, but they have not mentioned the report. We should return to the amendment and dwell on arguments relating to the report.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My point was entirely germane to that. I argued that in order to prevent future mis-selling and to ensure that people understand the nature of their pensions scheme, the Minister should accept the amendment. He should satisfy himself that he is not one of the wicked Tory Ministers who behaved improperly and that he has done his best in this context for what we might call financially unsophisticated people. The mis-selling of pensions is germane to that.
<P>
It was outrageous of the Minister to suggest that anyone who enters the House, whether Labour or Conservative, does so in order to do a disservice to the British public. We may disagree about how such services should be provided, but I reject the idea that any hon. Member seeks to do a disservice to our constituents. Pensions mis-selling occurred and was wrong, but I am glad that things are being sorted out. The previous Government certainly did not have the intention of encouraging it. When we compare pensions provision in the United Kingdom with that in the rest of the world, it is clear that the previous Government's pensions policy was a massive achievement. The Minister is a decent man, but it was wrong of him to ascribe such motives to Conservative Members.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I remind my hon. Friend that the pensions problem was being sorted out when the general election began—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Can we move away from the history of pensions and dwell on the amendment? I must ask you, Miss Kirkbride, to stick to the amendment. Let us get the Committee's business under way.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> Of course, Mr. O'Brien. I shall conclude my remarks.
<P>
The Minister's interventions and our wider discussions suggest that he has no reason to recommend the rejection of the amendment. We look forward to hearing his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has been in the House for a long time. He may have been here in September 1974 when a White Paper was published that set out the ideas behind the Labour Government's new pensions scheme. Barbara Castle, who was responsible for the scheme, said that its main aim was to reduce dependence on means-tested benefits in old age by providing better pensions for retirement, widowhood and chronic ill health. She also said that it would
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``raise the standard of living of retirement pensioners, both in absolute terms and in relation to the rest of the population''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That document, which was published when the Minister had recently become a new Member of Parliament, led to the foundation of SERPS. We have been trying to solve this problem ever since. That is why the amendment is important: there is still a huge well of ignorance about the subject and people are still trying to grapple with whether they will be better off under the new schemes. Parliament owes them an explanation.
<P>
The Labour manifesto said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Labour will retain SERPS as an option for those who wish to remain within it. We will also seek to develop the administrative structure of SERPS''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
SERPS is not to be retained. Therefore, as people move from SERPS into the new pension provisions, the Government must lay before Parliament, as the amendment asks them to do,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a report indicating the satisfactory establishment and progression of the stakeholder pension scheme.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Before it came to power, the Labour party gave a clear undertaking in its manifesto that it would retain SERPS, and it is not doing so.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand where the Government are coming from. In their December 1998 Green Paper ``A new contract for welfare'' they say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Those on very low incomes can save through SERPS all their working lives and still need income-related benefits in retirement. This means they gain nothing from their years of saving. This is because SERPS, being earnings-related, gives least to those in greatest need.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We accept that SERPS has not proved to be an ideal vehicle. That is why we have spent some days debating the establishment of the second state pension. It may be true that those earning less than £9,500 will benefit from the new proposals. However, it is not entirely clear—it may be true, but I do not know, as I do not claim to be an actuary—whether those on higher incomes will benefit from the move from SERPS to the stakeholder pension. That is the point that the Government must establish. Such matters as stage 1 and stage 2 are complex, and I am not sure that there is any great public understanding.
<P>
I also hope that the Minister will tell us something about how we can ensure that more women have a satisfactory pension arrangement, a point made particularly by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham. The 1996 general household survey found that 75 per cent. of men in full-time work were members of an occupational personal pension scheme, compared with 65 per cent. of women working full-time and only 33 per cent. of women working part-time. I am sure that the Minister will say that the thrust of his proposals is to encourage women, carers and those with interrupted earnings to get into a decent pension scheme, but the facts are not laid before us to explain how that will happen.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will be able to reply positively in a spirit of open government. After all, we are talking about people's lives and their savings. I do not know how the report could be framed. A skilful operation would be needed to explain the scheme accurately, in a way that people can understand and that relates to their personal circumstances. I do not pretend that it would be easy, but it would be useful, so I hope that the Minister can respond positively to our proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I do not want to be too hard on the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), as I suspect that she was still at school when the pensions mis-selling scandal was going on, but occasionally I need to remind my hon. Friends why they are sitting on this side of the Room and the Opposition on that side.
<P>
We inherited a pension system designed to ensure that one in three people retiring would move straight out of work on to a means test. I have already admitted, and apologised for the fact, that our estimate of the changes is that one in five will retire on the means test. That is a deliberate change to keep people off the means test. The state second pension is designed so that people will not retire on to the means test. I accept that we have had earlier debates when you were not present, Mr. O'Brien, but I have no doubt that you have read the relevant Hansard reports. We considered combinations of couples and single people—our typical constituents—and showed that there would be a period of perhaps eight, nine or 10 years, or, in the case of couples, 14 or 15 years, during which even people in low-paid jobs whose working life had had interruptions would be above the means test threshold. I remember giving an example of a couple for whom that was the case for 16 years. The interaction with the minimum income guarantee is important, but MIG is only a safety net. It is not something to which people should aspire. We want them to earn more than that.
<P>
It crossed my mind while listening to an earlier speech that a person who had taken out no extra pension provision but relied on the MIG might, for example, inherit his grandmother's house. The right to buy has enabled one of the greatest redistributions of wealth in this country to take place. I make no apology for that; I was new Labour about a decade before my hon. Friends, and supported that change of policy a long time ago. Opposition Members would be the first to complain on behalf of the person with a legacy saying that he had lost his money because he had savings. They would not have explained to him that, with such an asset, one would not get the MIG. People are vulnerable, but we do not want them to be in such a situation.
<P>
I remind the Committee of a provision for the future. In terms of making the law catch up with society—rather than using it to engineer society—pension splitting on divorce is a reaction to changes in society. In fact, it is a reaction 30 years after divorce law reform was enacted in the late 1960s. We did not catch up with the changes precipitated by that reform in terms of the pension system until recently. Those provisions are now coming into force.
<P>
A major thrust of the Opposition's argument this morning was couched in terms of ``public is good and private is bad''. One almost had to pinch oneself. We are trying to run a mixed economy.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No one said that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No one said that, but the thrust of the Opposition's debate was that one should rely on the state; the state should be one's security blanket. They almost advocated a nannying approach, saying ``Stay, and you will be okay''. We know that people who rely on the state without taking up the incentives to make extra provision will end up on the means test. They could end up with nothing if certain assets accrued to them, as is sometimes the case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I will give way in a moment. These are just my introductory remarks. This will teach me a lesson. I shall never again forecast while debating one group of amendments that we are minded to accept the spirit of the next group. That dampened the Opposition's fervour for explaining why we should support amendment No. 170. I shall think twice before doing it again.
<P>
Another point that seems to have been lost on some hon. Members is that the state second pension will be at least twice as good as SERPS for people on low incomes. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) was right in his reading of the extract, and in his conclusion that there was general agreement on the matter. In this respect, SERPS has been a failure.
<P>
I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment, when I have made one more point. I may have made this point when he was out of the Room. I understand that his duties involve serving on another Committee as well as this one. An earnings-related element will still apply for people who have moved out of the state second pension in respect of their rebates, so their contributions into other stakeholder and other provisions will still be earnings related.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Have I completely misunderstood? The Minister said that people who rely on the state would end up on means-tested benefits. Surely that is not entirely true in relation to SERPS, which bites between the upper and lower earnings limit. The lower and upper earnings limit for NICs in 1999-2000 was £66 per week and £500 per week respectively. A person who is in SERPS and who is earning £500 per week will not end up on means-tested benefits by relying on the state.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I was referring to the safety net and to the means tested element. By the term ``relying on the state'', I meant the safety net of means-tested benefits. I did not intend to give any impression that that implied what the hon. Gentleman suggests. SERPS is a contributory benefit that produces good pensions for people who have had a good working life without many gaps and who have been at or near average earnings for the past 20 years. It provides an income of £50, £60 or more a week for such people. The maximum SERPS, which is limited because of the way in which the scheme works, is currently set at about £120. The scheme produces good pensions for many people, but it does not produce anywhere near good pensions for people who have been on low pay.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister has been fair in his responses. SERPS gets a bad press, and I know that he does not want to present it in that way. It does not, however, deliver for people on low earnings. I accept the Government's intentions and I am not trying to belittle them. However, I do not want Committee members to go away thinking that SERPS is bad per se and that it can therefore be swept away without adequate explanation of how people above the £9,000 level will be helped.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> That is right. SERPS has had an unnecessarily bad press. The problem of inherited SERPS has caused worry, we accept that, and I shall not comment further on the matter. There has also been a lack of understanding. Constituents who receive their pension forecast six months before they retire or who have requested a copy ask what the additional pension is, as it has never been fully explained to them. I have only once heard anybody use the phrase ``I have been a member of SERPS since''. It was in a television interview shown before Christmas. I had never heard anybody use that term before. People refer to being members of occupational or company schemes, but I had never heard anybody say ``I am a member of SERPS''. The scheme was not marketed in that way by the previous Government, who set it up, or by the current Government.
<P>
A lack of general pension education has unnecessarily given SERPS a bad name. The scheme is producing good pensions for most people who retire and who have stayed in it. However, unless changes are made, increasing numbers of people will be dependent on means-tested benefits. The hon. Member for Gainsborough was right—nobody is denying that a major change in pension provision is being made. The interaction of the stakeholder pension and the state second pension is a case in point. I meant what I said. The thrust of the amendment should and will apply. A report will have to be submitted to the House and a Government statement must be made about the point when the state second pension goes from stage 1 to stage 2, but we do not want to include the amendment in the Bill. Specifying in the Bill the production of a report ``indicating . . . satisfactory establishment'' will merely make work for the lawyers, who would have to draft regulations defining ``satisfactory establishment'', which would probably be 20 pages long. The matter is a bit like the elephant on the doorstep. When it is there, one knows that it is there. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary used the example of trying define the colour yellow. One know it when one sees it. I cannot give the detail that the hon. Gentleman legitimately asked for before stakeholder pensions start. We are still working on the target start-up date of 2001. We hope to publish the draft regulations before the end of the month. That is the final legal locking in, and the House and the industry will then know the legal position.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The regulations will be on the statute book at the turn of the financial year or by Easter time. The industry will have a full year to prepare. Stakeholders will start to be registered from some time in October. The Government are marketing the generic concept of stakeholder pensions and the need for second pensions. We shall do what we can for the target group, and the industry providers will then use their own techniques to sell the product. The Government can sell the generic idea, but not the product. The traders can organise that for themselves.
<P>
Planning is continuing, and I cannot say how quickly such schemes will take off. Only last week, the Trades Union Congress announced that it wanted to provide stakeholder pensions. That could permeate throughout the industry. Indeed, providers are now marketing stakeholder pensions. Once second state pensions move from earnings-related to flat-rate contributions, it will be quite right for hon. Members to demand that the Government should set out their position.
<P>
Last week, I gave members of the Committee a copy of a graph from the Government Actuary's report. It was a snapshot which showed that second state pensions will be better than the basic pension plus SERPS for earnings up to £21,000. The quirk is that the graph goes up to earnings of £30,000. I can explain the graph to the hon. Member for Gainsborough. The part of the graph in dark grey represents the excess of state second pensions over SERPS; the middle section represents SERPS; and the white section at the bottom of the graph represents the basic state pension. State second pension is planned to be better for low and moderate earners, but to a varying degree.
<P>
Two stages will be needed, because it will take time to establish stakeholder pensions. We have not set a date; but it will certainly be between four and five years. Less than that would be unreasonable, but, because it will affect millions of people, it certainly is not right to wait before giving some real help to the low paid, which is why the state second pension will be introduced in two stages. The first stage will give the low earners a boost, while we build up stakeholder pensions. The only reason for there being two stages is that it would be wrong to leave the low paid as they are now, and because SERPS is no good for them. Two years lost on a pension scheme can make quite a difference.
<P>
We have made no secret of the fact that people on moderate earnings and above should choose funded contracted-out schemes. It is part of the change of pension provision from 60 per cent. state provision, 40 per cent. private provision, to 40 per cent. state, 60 per cent. private. It is a grand plan, and each bit makes its contribution. Hon. Members are right that we cannot fix an arbitrary date. However, although I cannot say that the Government will accept the amendment, We accept its spirit and we accept the fact that we shall have to make reports to the House. I cannot say whether they will be debated—that is up to my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Kevin Hughes) and his colleagues who manage the business of the House. The Social Security Committee will have a role. There is no question about it. It is unthinkable that it will not inquire into the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 and report to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): As a member of that Select Committee, I believe that it would be useful for Parliament to consider what is happening before the five-year cut-off point is reached. If the Government's expectations are unrealistic, will the proposal fall flat? It would be better to consider the scheme's success incrementally.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, but that is up to the House. The Government do not organise Select Committee inquiries. I am not saying that it should wait five years; it could have an ongoing inquiry, but that is up to the Committee. The Government want to be as open and proactive as possible. We have a mission to explain why people need a second pension. It is incumbent on all Members of the House, certainly on the Government, to put a case on behalf of millions of our fellow citizens. We are accountable to them for the money that we spend, how we introduce the scheme and its successes and failures. I am not saying that everything will be smooth and hunky-dory. A great deal of work is being put into the scheme and we are happy to be accountable to the House.
<P>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that some dentists are ladies. I think that we got carried away when we started talking about the dentist's wife. The hon. Member for Beckenham asked whether the dentist's wife would be in the target group. She would not, because she would not be a low earner in the £10,000 to £20,000 category. However, she could be a stakeholder if her husband bought her a pension. I am assuming that she is a non-working wife who supports the practice. The target group by which the Government will measure the success or failure of the scheme will contain low to moderate earners who earn more than £9,000 but less than £21,000 and who have no second pension provision. The target group will not contain the person who is on £40,000, the person who has left a pension scheme to take up a stakeholder pension because its charges are lower or the non-working spouse whose stakeholder pension has been purchased by a husband or wife.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the Minister accept that if the dentist's wife is paid between £9,500 and £21,000, she will be part of the low-earner category and therefore in the target group?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Yes, but not if she is non-employee who is working to support the practice. She must be working as an employee and receiving a salary that puts her in the target group. There is nothing wrong with that. Although we do not accept the amendment, we acknowledge the spirit of it. It is right that the Government should make such reports of their own volition and at the request of the scrutiny Committees.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for being so open and accepting the spirit of the amendment. I accept his point that lawyers would have a wonderful time discussing the meaning of the phrase ``satisfactory establishment'', but whenever we table an amendment, we are happy for it to be redrafted. Without wishing to be ungracious, it would be reassuring if the Government would agree to include in the Bill a provision to the effect that a report would be submitted to Parliament outlining the reasons why the Government wished to proceed to the next stage. That would be the icing on the cake. I have a terrible fear about the widow's entitlement, which has scarred the Government as well as the Opposition. That shows how it is possible for matters to be forgotten quietly, although not deliberately, and it would be helpful if the Bill stated that a report to Parliament would be made.
<P>
I do not want to push the Minister, but for the record, I want to ask about the criteria for success. On what statistical evidence and market breakdown will the Government make their decision? To extrapolate from the debate about the dentist's wife, if she is a low earner, how will she be situated differently from somebody for whom the practice purchases a stakeholder pension? What sort of distortion would there be with the middle-class purchase of a stakeholder pension? Knowing how many husband and wife teams there are in the House, in which partners work as researchers, I can imagine that many hon. Members might purchase stakeholder pensions for their partners, who could potentially benefit. How will the Government know whether they are reaching their target audience? I hope that the Government will consider the points that have been made about the criteria that need to be established and, on the basis that the Government accept the spirit of the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment 259, in page 27, line 37, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8A) Those pensioners falling within band 1 above shall receive a total retirement pension.
<P>
(8B) For the avoidance of doubt, a total retirement pension is not an earnings related pension.
<P>
(8C) The pension falling within band 2 above shall be separately described as the State Earnings Related Pension.
<P>
(8D) For the avoidance of doubt, the State Earnings Related Pension is earnings related.
<P>
(8E) The Secretary of State shall be required to make an annual statement to Parliament to explain how the value of the total retirement pension compares in real terms to earnings related pension schemes.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I should like to explain that I do not intend to move amendment No. 234, which is in this group, because it would not have achieved its intended purpose. Amendment No. 234 did not state that our idea for a total retirement pension relates only to pensioners who fall within band 1, so we amended it in amendment No. 259. That explains why we tabled two very similar amendments.
<P>
We want to emphasise that stage 2 of the state second pension is no longer earnings related. We accept the Minister's argument that people who earn less than £9,500 should have access to a better state pension. However, as the Minister will notice from the many debates that we have had on the subject, we are concerned about the interaction between the state second pension and other forms of pension provision, and especially about the fact that the state second pension is an incentive for people to stay in the state sector, if they so wish. It could result in such people deciding to stay on the minimum income guarantee.
<P>
The Minister has often correctly said that benefits are different from pensions, and we would not disagree with that. A culture has grown up in which it is acceptable to rely on benefits as income throughout one's life. We all want a change in that culture, but that will take a long time. We do not agree with using benefits as income in that way, and neither, I am sure, does the Minister—one of the aims of his policy is to move away from such a culture. However, until there is an incentive not to rely on state benefits and not to think that the minimum income guarantee, housing benefit and council tax benefit will be as good as if not better than a state second, or a stakeholder pension, rational people will make that decision, and will save or use the £20 a month—or whatever sum it is—for other things that may be more important at the time.

Amendment No. 259 highlights the fact that SERPS is being abolished and there will be no earnings-related element once stage 2 of the state second pension is introduced. There will be a flat rate on earnings between the lower and upper earnings limits.
<P>
I quote again from Professor Agulnik, of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion at the London School of Economics. He said that stage 2 was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``rather like an increase in the basic pension, but with a fifty year time-lag.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a glorified but delayed increase in the basic state pension. With proposed subsection (8A), we are trying to introduce the concept of the total retirement pension, which is the basic state retirement pension plus the band 1 element of S2P. They are combined in the total retirement pension because they are both flat rate.
<P>
Proposed subsection (8C) makes it clear that the earnings-related element is for a gentler accrual policy, which we debated at great length last week. It should be described as a state earnings-related pension, because it is an attempt to recreate SERPS and to get away from the high pensions threshold that the flat rate of stage 2 of the state second pension introduces. We have tried throughout to keep an earnings-related element in the state second pension, and have not wanted stage 2 to be introduced. That would show the difference between the earnings-related state second pension and the flat-rate scheme, and may also be useful for contracting-out regimes, which we shall debate later.
<P>
We also want to see yet another annual statement to Parliament on the relationship between the total retirement pension, which is the flat rate element, and the earnings-related element. The Government Actuary could be involved, and could project the likely earnings-related pension that would be due to employees with different earnings.
<P>
I hope that the proposal will strike a sympathetic chord. The Minister has said that people rarely regarded themselves as members of SERPS, but an awful lot of people are attached to it and to the basic state pension, as they are to national insurance. The Minister tried to deride many of our amendments for emphasising state control. We tabled our amendments because politicians of both main parties have been tempted to play with the system over the years and many have done so, as pensions have become such an important issue and involve such large sums of money. The net result is a caution on what any politician can do. Some people prefer to get the money away from the state because they think that politicians interfere, whereas other people want to stay in the state pension because they think that politicians will interfere less. A balance is needed; indeed, all the amendments that we have tabled attempt to achieve a balance between state and private provision. The amendments would make it clear that state second pension stage 2 is not earnings-related and is not, therefore, an attractive arrangement.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Amendment No. 234 is not moved, so we are considering amendment No. 259.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I have a great reservation about the concept of what the Government are doing. I recognise the need to help people on low earnings, as they fall through the net and do not have adequate pension provision. Indeed, people who cannot work, for whatever reason, may not have any pension provision and should be helped. However, I have never quite supported adding to the problem with pay-as-you-go schemes. According to the Library, the cost of the state pension plus SERPS is in the region of £37 billion this year. As I have said before, 50 years ago, there were four million pensioners; there are now 11 million. Not only are the arrangements becoming more expensive, but we are building up a big problem for the future. Indeed, we have a big problem now. As people live longer, retire earlier and so on, an even worse problem is created. Retired people who are dependent on the state pension and not on a funded scheme are dependent on people who are still at work. We do not know what future economic circumstances will be or how generous future Chancellors will be. It would be wrong to make the current situation worse, yet that will be the net result of the Government's proposals.
<P>
A short while ago, the Select Committee on Social Security interviewed the Secretary of State. Several hon. Members—myself especially—asked him why no increase was to be made in the basic state pension for retired people, as the Government Actuary's report suggested that the Government had more in the national insurance fund than was needed. Off the top of my head, I think that the report suggested that about £8 billion surplus in the account was needed and should be kept as a sensible level. In fact, the account contains about £13 billion. The Secretary of State replied that it would not help poorer pensioners to increase the basic state pension, and that the Government did not know what the economic circumstances might be—in a sense, he agreed with me. As my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said, it is rather like increasing the basic pension with a 50-year time lag. Was the Secretary of State right? Can the country afford an increase in the basic state pension or not?
<P>
What is proposed will cause great confusion. I support the amendment because, to an extent, it makes it clear that there will be no earnings-related provision. As we move towards stage 2, it will apply not only to those in band 1, but to band 2, although I accept that those who have contracted out will have an earnings-related element. I support clarity. I therefore support the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) said, the amendment adds clarity. The only reason for rejecting it is that Ministers may not wish to see such transparency. It spells out precisely the impact of the state second pension after stage 2. It is an amendment that no right-thinking person would reject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> In due course, I shall ask the hon. Member for Beckenham to withdraw the amendment—I may as well start on the wrong foot.
<P>
I shall stick to my notes, Mr. O'Brien. We were not clear what amendment No. 234 meant, and I am grateful to the hon. Lady for explaining amendment No. 259. However, we differ over whether it would clarify the Bill. Under the state second pension, everybody will get at least twice as much additional pension as those currently earning £9,500 would get under SERPS. We have said that many times, but it needs repeating.
<P>
The additional pension accrued by low earners will be more than double that under SERPS. They will get the boost to £9,500, and the rate at which the pension builds on that is doubled from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. We know that many low earners do not have the chance to join a second pension or salary related occupational pension scheme. If they do, they will still gain from the state second pension. Under the contracting-out proposals, people earning less than £9,500 will receive a top-up.
<P>
Moderate earners—whose earning between £9,500 and £21,600—will also benefit from the state second pension. About 9.5 million people earn between those two amounts, and they will accrue larger pensions than they would have done under SERPS. They will also gain if they opt out into a funded scheme. The top-up will be extended to those in occupational schemes who earn less than £21,600. That removes the risk of people facing difficult decisions about whether to join or remain in a scheme run by their employers. They will not be worse off if they do; in many cases, they will end up much better off. In the second stage, which will only be introduced when stakeholder pensions are established as low-cost, flexible, funded second pensions, the state second pension will become a flat rate scheme. The move to a flat rate scheme will only apply to those with a significant part of their working lives ahead of them, as they will be best placed to benefit from the scheme. That was referred to in the earlier quote from the Green Paper. People who are still contracted into the state scheme will be treated as if they had earnings of £9,500. Low earners, carers and the long-term disabled will continue to be considerably better off than under SERPS. People whose earnings, actual or treated, fall solely within band 1 in the second stage—low earners, carers and long-term disabled people—will therefore continue to be much better off under state second pension than SERPS. Those who fall within earnings band 1, but also have earnings in band 2, can remain contracted into the state scheme, although it will not be in their interest.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We have always said that a key element of the pensions strategy is that those who can afford it should be encouraged to provide for their own retirement, by means of a funded pension scheme. The system of rebates, and a second state pension top-up, means that low and moderate earners in contracted-out provision will receive extra help. They will get the best of both worlds. That is a bold sentence; I meant to say that they can get the best of both worlds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Or might.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, my briefing says can.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 234 and 259 suggest that an annual statement should be presented to the House to show how the value of an additional pension under state second pension compares with an earnings-related pension scheme. If that means a state pay-as-you-go earnings-related scheme such as SERPS, the comparison is straightforward. If it is a privately funded earnings-related scheme, the comparison becomes fairly meaningless. State and private pensions complement each other; one is not a replacement for the other.
<P>
I assure hon. Members that raising public awareness of the reforms, and of pension matters generally, is a key objective. Otherwise, none of this will make sense. That is one of the great failings in pension education. A major part of our programme will be to provide, in conjunction with employers and pension providers, much-improved pension forecasting details and supporting information. From 2002, although not on the same day in the year, everybody will receive an annual pension forecast, in a similar form to a P60. I hope that it will be on a single sheet, but I do not know. It will provide a statement of the individual's state and private pension. It will be a better quality version of what hon. Members received last year—for the first time ever, the trustees issued us with a pension forecast, on a single sheet of A4, which was absolutely first class. It did not include state provision, although the pension forecast would do so. It will be piloted in seven or eight large companies later this year, and is currently being pre-piloted by Sainsbury's. That is important. The Bill will be amended later, because of data protection and the need for it to run smoothly.
<P>
Our aim is to provide a better basis for people to make informed decisions on their pension options. Time will prove that the proposed scheme will improve pension provision for future generations. It would not be feasible to make annual statements of the nature suggested by the amendments. That is the distinction.
<P>
Amendment No. 259 suggests that the pension accrued on band 2 earnings, which are between £9,500 and £21,600, should be called SERPS. It is unclear whether the intention is that people earning within that band should remain in an unreformed SERPS. If so, they would lose out. As I have said, moderate earners will be better off under the state second pension than under SERPS. They will benefit from the new 40 per cent. accrual rate on surplus earnings up to £9,500. Thereafter, the extra will gradually be clawed back, so that everyone who earns less than £21,600 will be better off. If SERPS were retained in its current form for those moderate earners, 9.5 million individuals would miss out on the extra that they will otherwise gain from the state second pension.
<P>
I apologise for laboriously reading out my speaking notes, but it was necessary to do so because the meaning behind the amendments is unclear, and I hope that Opposition Members will think twice before pressing them to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> May I clear up the Minister's reference to the tabling of amendments to the pensions forecast? Is he referring to amendments that have already been tabled to schedule 4, or will we have to wait for such amendments along with the rebates?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am sorry—I should not make comments without the relevant information in front of me. Because we want the pension forecast to be made through the employer, in the manner of a P60, employers must have details of an individual's state provision. In the pilot scheme, each of the 60,000 workers in the pension scheme had to be asked in writing whether, under data protection provisions, they were willing to allow their employer to transfer their details. We want the process to work the other way around, which will be less onerous. If employees wish to prevent their employers from having details of their state provision, they will be able to do so. That is the amendment to which I was referring.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Well, I look forward to that with pleasure, but it would have helped if the Minister had said whether such an amendment had already been tabled. His comments, particularly his reference to large employers' piloting the provision, raise many questions. I accept that it is a good idea to begin with large employers, but it seems a substantial regulatory burden to place on medium and small employers. I do not have a problem with the Minister's suggestion in principle, but decent pension schemes should already be making such provision. Some in which I am involved outside this place already do; in fact, some do so on a quarterly basis, which is rather wearing.
<P>
I apologise if the reasoning behind the amendments is not clear, and I accept that confusion arose because of the need to table a second, more accurate amendment. The amendments' purpose is to point up that, although stage 2 of the state second pension is not the same as SERPS, it is still a flat-rate scheme. The amendments will probably help the Government by driving home the point that people should not believe that the scheme is earnings related. We were keen to make it clear to everyone that stage 2 will not be a good deal and, as the Minister knows, we have continually tried to prevent him from introducing stage 2.
<P>
Although we accept that, given the size of the Government's majority, it is inevitable that stage 2 will be introduced, it is only fair that people realise that what is on offer is not the best possible deal. We tabled the amendment on that basis, but I am prepared to withdraw it because the debate has now taken place. I hope that such issues will enter more widely into the public domain, and that people will become aware that stage 2 is not the best possible deal for them.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 28, line 8, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(11) The Secretary of State shall provide that those who currently contribute to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme may continue to do so by allowing the scheme to continue operating unchanged for those presently within it and who want to stay within it.
<P>
(12) The Secretary of State shall make regulations to ensure full transferability on a present value basis between all pension schemes for all members.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 168 covers two different issues—two for the price of one. I shall deal with them separately, if I may.
<P>
The amendment would add a new subsection (11) giving people who believed the Labour party's manifesto pledge to retain SERPS the option to continue within SERPS without moving to the state second pension. The Labour manifesto stated that changes to the administrative structure of SERPS would bring carers and others within the framework of a citizenship pension and get them off means-tested benefits. The state second pension does that, and we have not significantly challenged that aspect of it. However, the Bill does away with SERPS for any new contributions, and the state second pension does not improve on SERPS. It offers bigger benefits for those earning less than £9,500 a year, and tries to ensure under stage 1 that nobody will be worse off, which is why we keep returning to the complicated structure of accruals. However, under stage 2 anyone earning more than £9,500 will find their entitlements abolished, pushing them into stakeholder pensions. Stage 2 of the state second pension will abolish the last earnings-related benefit in the social security system, which will make a major difference to those who hoped to remain within SERPS. This part of the amendment would improve the choices for those on low to middle incomes, as well as helping the Labour party to keep its manifesto pledge.
<P>
The second part of the amendment would add a new subsection (12) stating:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall make regulations to ensure full transferability on a present value basis between all pension schemes for all members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One of the problems with the Bill that we have highlighted in previous discussions is that it establishes a pensions apartheid, with a sharp cut-off at the £9,500 earnings level. It will be hard for someone who has been on low earnings, and then experienced an increase, to switch out of the state second pension and into an occupational or private pension. It will be especially difficult for women, as we have discussed on many previous occasions, because of the interrupted nature of so many of their earnings and the fact that many are carers who have been able to get back into work. Broadly speaking, women have much greater fluctuations in their earnings.
<P>
We want to see full transferability. Someone who is in the state second pension should be able easily to switch into an occupational or appropriate personal pension. We propose that sums equivalent to the present value of the accrued rights can be transferred across to the new scheme.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Would it be fair to say that the amendment, especially the part that my hon. Friend is now discussing, is more in keeping with current employment trends than the rather rigid distinction that is drawn in the Bill, which assumes that during their working lives people will tend to have a fairly fixed level of income that changes less than in fact it does in reality?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> My hon. Friend is right. There is increasing flexibility in employment, and increasing numbers of people find that it is better to have a portable pension of some kind. Portable pensions came in because occupational schemes had poor transfer values, although some of the schemes' providers realised that there was a problem with that. Therefore, we want to make the state second pension as portable as any other pension. Indeed, there is no reason why it should not lead the way in improving portability. My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury referred earlier to the fully funded state pension being moved to the employee's ownership, getting away from a state system. That would be one way of moving towards such a system. It is worth pursuing the amendment on that basis alone, to see whether the Minister thinks that there is an argument for giving people the right to their national insurance contributions for their own pension, taking it away from the state and getting it into the private sector, where returns have historically been better than those provided by SERPS or annuities.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The two groups of amendments make it easier for people to move their pension around. They could then move in and out of a portable pension, or into a state second pension, if they needed to. As we have said, different employment patterns are emerging, and there is a possibility that a person will have relatively high earnings in one year of, say, more than £20,000 and, the following year, much lower earnings. People must be able to rely on their pension being as flexible as their working circumstances. The cut-off at £9,500 could prove to be a block on people's pension savings, which none of us wants to see.
<P>
Another issue that has emerged relates to women receiving the working families and disabled persons tax credits who can at present claim SERPS if they have earnings in this band. As I understand it, and I am seeking confirmation from the Minister, a lone parent working 16 hours a week at the national minimum wage of £3.60—according to the newspapers, that will go up to £3.70—will be paid £57.60 a week. That is below the lower earnings limit, which is currently £66 a week. Would a person with those earnings and WFTC be credited for the new state second pension? Under SERPS, the WFTC counts as additional earnings towards their final SERPS calculation. Would WFTC and DPTC be counted into the new state second pension? That question is causing some concern, because clearly it could cause unfairness. The Minister may simply have overlooked it. I am sure that he would not wish these changes to harm the opportunities of those on low earnings, who can currently get credits towards SERPS from their WPTC and DPTC. I look forward to hearing his response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I support my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, particularly in relation to our proposed subsection (12), which seeks
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``full transferability on a present value basis between all pension schemes for all members.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As my hon. Friend said, I spoke about this matter a few moments ago. My concern is the increasing cost to the Exchequer of continuing to have non-funded pension arrangements.
<P>
A few days ago, the Minister corrected me on this issue and tried to allay my fears by saying that the extra money that would be given to those earning less than £9,500 would be offset by the fact that the cost of SERPS would be reduced as a result of changes made by the previous Government. I do not know whether he was suggesting that that Government's good financial management had enabled him to make the changes, but I was a little concerned, so I looked in the Library at the projected cost of SERPS. At present, the cost is £4.3 billion, but it is forecast to rise in 2001–02 to £5.4 billion. Therefore, I am not sure where the reduction in the projected cost is. If those on incomes below £9,500 are to receive double the value of SERPS, it is an extraordinarily expensive way of going about it. Therefore, I restate what I said earlier. It will be an expensive scheme, which will mean that future pensioners must rely on those who are working now, and that depends on the economic circumstances and on the Chancellor's generosity. Therefore, I urge the Government to accept an amendment that would allow people to transfer their benefits to another scheme.
<P>
Twenty years ago there was much less transferability, which made even occupational pension schemes less attractive. If one stayed with a company for 50 years, as people used to do, the pension scheme might have been very attractive. If one left after five years—in those days one could not transfer one's pension rights—it was not very attractive. I am glad to say that we have moved on considerably. Transferability is extremely important, so I support that part of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury is right in his implied criticism that the amendment is probably a second-best option to the one offered by the Conservative party before the election, which the Conservative party lost. The Minister of State, in an exciting intervention, suggested that pension policy might be part of the reason why.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham and I are part of a newly formed manifesto watch group, which tries to ensure that manifesto policies are implemented. That is what the first part of the amendment seeks to achieve.
<P>
The manifesto said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Labour will retain SERPS as an option for those who wish to remain within it.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clearly the Bill seeks to abolish SERPS and to replace it. That did not appear in the manifesto, which promised that the administrative structure of SERPS would remain, while also offering a framework for a citizenship pension. The state second pension is a watered-down version of the citizenship pension. We are acutely aware that, when we move on to stage 2, the state second pension will abolish the last remaining earnings-related benefit in the social security system. The amendment would improve the choices that are available to those on low or middle incomes and—this is where our manifesto watch comes in—it would help the Labour party to keep its manifesto pledge, which would be honourable.
<P>
The Minister will know from Hansard that we are concerned about the way in which the Bill will affect people's ability to move between the various forms of pension provision, but the amendment would help in that regard. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) said that we would table amendments in Committee that would allow people to move more smoothly between the various forms of provision. That is what the proposed new subsection (12) in the amendment would do.
<P>
The Minister explained in earlier debates that there would be some portability— we are seeking, in a sense, to extend his approach. We are concerned about inflexibility, which is a problem for women in particular. When my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham moved the amendment, she pointed out that, on average, women experience much greater fluctuations in earnings. The amendment proposes that funds that are equivalent to the present value of accrued rights can be transferred across the new system. Our proposal is not revolutionary—national insurance rebates are calculated on a similar basis. We are seeking to build on a pledge to make the system work.
<P>
The amendment would give flexibility to those who experience big changes in their earnings and it would replace the rigid and divisive structure of the clause. I cannot believe that the Minister wants such a structure. The Government's approach is no doubt an oversight—we have frequently said that this is a complicated matter. The Government's and the Opposition's proposals are complementary, rather than contradictory. We are extending pledges that the Minister made on various occasions. I hope that he will say that he finds the amendment extremely satisfactory.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Before the Minister responds, I hope that we shall hear from other Labour members of the Committee. This subject should exercise their minds a great deal. The Labour party gave a manifesto commitment to retain SERPS. The fact that it is being abandoned means that Labour Members, who supported that manifesto commitment, owe us an explanation—they should tell us why this change has occurred. They were voluble in relation to earlier provisions on child support, but it appears that a great wet blanket has descended from the ceiling—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is nothing in the amendment that mentions the need for Labour Members to speak in the Committee. The hon. Gentleman should restrict his remarks to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Of course I accept your correction, Mr. O'Brien.
<P>
The Minister explained his position, gave his reasons for abandoning the commitment and made it clear that he believed that he had a better proposal. Earlier this morning, he said that members of the new scheme would get the best of both worlds. I entirely accept his argument, but I am not convinced that he is correct. The whole system is predicated on a change in stage 2 of the state second pension, which will introduce a scheme that has yet to exist in any form. We have yet to see what the new beast—the stakeholder pension—will produce. Ministers have said that it will be much better, and that they intend to reverse the proportion of pension provision, which is currently 60 per cent. state and 40 per cent. private. We are told that that will produce a much better outcome for future pension provision, and will reduce significantly the number of people relying on means-tested benefits. The proof of the pudding, however, should be in the eating. Instead of the prospect of things being better, we should allow consumers to choose for themselves—which is provided for by subsection (11) of amendment No. 168. Consumers should be tempted to give up SERPS after the introduction of the stakeholder pension and stage 1 of the state second pension.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Ministers have told us about all the benefits, and insisted that no one will be worse off—I accept that those on lower incomes will be significantly better off—but I am more concerned about the margin beyond the £9,500 threshold. If such people will really be better off, they will freely choose to be better off. They will make that jump without ministerial assistance. It is therefore important to provide choice within the system. With stage 2 and the provision of stakeholder pensions, a usefuI element of competition will be introduced within the system. The Bill will provide captive customers for stakeholder pensions they will have no choice but to enter the new schemes. The amendment would provide an important additional element of choice—the choice to stay precisely where they are. Stakeholder pension providers will have to address that and tempt them out. The amendment would be a useful provision.

<P>

<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I choose my words carefully because the second line of the amendment says ``may'', it does not say that people must continue in SERPS. Under the amendment, if everybody continued in SERPS, £12 billion of pension provision would be lost in the long run, compared with the cost of the Bill's proposals. Those people might find it difficult to decide whether they want to lose £12 billion—I concede that is over a long period—but I think that that would be classed as a Tory cut. I hate to introduce a note of hardness into the debate, but that would be the ballpark figure. My official advice politely refers to a pension saving, but if I am responsible, it is a cut. There will be a saving of nearly £6 billion because of reduced national insurance rebate expenditure. If everybody was conned into maintaining SERPS, the grand total lost would be £18 billion by 2050. That is a cut, whichever way one looks at it. It would be hard to explain to people that they should stay in SERPS because they would be worse off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is not what the amendment proposes. We are not proposing that everyone should stay in SERPS—
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Or anyone.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Or anyone. The point is that they should have the choice. The Minister is surely not suggesting that everybody would be worse off if they chose to stay in SERPS, but if he is not suggesting that, I do not understand the point of the argument that he has spent the past three minutes advancing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> We have deliberately not costed every amendment that has been tabled because many are probing amendments. Some would create additional expenditure and others would lead to savings.
<P>
This amendment has provided a good opportunity to explain to Committee members what would happen if everyone who currently contributes to SERPS were to continue to do so. I do not want to mislead Committee members. I acknowledge that the amendment uses the word ``may'' and that the Opposition are not trying to introduce an element of compulsion. I merely said that if everyone who currently contributes to SERPS had listened to the pension sellers of the 1980s and remained in that scheme, they would have lost out as a group after 50 years. I was simply saying that that would constitute a cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> No doubt the right hon. Gentleman wants to introduce a certain degree of robustness, given that we are tearing up a commitment made to the electorate. As he correctly points out, the amendment says not ``must'' but ``may'', so his figures are bunkum. I hope that ``bunkum'' is not an unparliamentary word, and I do not use it in an unpleasant way. All the speeches made by my hon. Friends dealt with people on the margin. We are trying to prevent problems for individuals, not the mass.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> It is strange for Opposition Members to propose that our fellow citizens should be allowed to stay in a scheme that makes them worse off than the scheme that we are proposing. That is the top and bottom of the matter. Perhaps I have misunderstood the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> Yes, you have. [Laughter.]
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Minister is right—[HON. MEMBERS: ``Ah!''] So Labour Members are not all silent: I thought that they were not listening.
<P>
The Minister is right, to the extent that there was a certain amount of contributory negligence on the part of some people in respect of the alacrity with which they leapt out of SERPS. With the connivance of the industry, many people made a grave mistake. Of course, as the Minister has pointed out and as we have accepted, people in band I would be moronic were they to do anything other than transfer to the new state second pension. If they did not, they would collectively lose billions of pounds. Nevertheless, for a number of people in the system, the choice is not so clear and the benefits not so obvious. We are merely saying that those people should be given a choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall not wind up the Opposition further and I shall respond to the legitimate points that they have raised. I merely wanted to put my remarks in context, so that people can understand where we are coming from and where the Opposition are coming from.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I am trying to make some progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robertson:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way—I am sure that my point will not prove quite that devastating. Does he agree that, if our amendment were successful and the Government made what his official described as savings—the Minister himself described them as cuts—his comment that the changes would not prove more expensive than SERPS would be incorrect?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's point in my own time. We have admitted that the state second pension will have a net cost of £5 billion or £6 billion over a 50-year period. The Opposition refuse to accept that SERPS has changed twice. Not all those changes, which took the form of cuts, have taken effect, but they will do so in April this year. That is partly because of long-term planning, which is mentioned in the Government Actuary's report. Last week, I was about to use a table in a brief, then found out that it was wrong. On that basis, I prefer not to quote figures unless I know that they are all double-checked. The Government Actuary's report makes it clear that during the next 50 years the changes in the Bill, together with the changes in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, will bring about a reduction in the joint employer–employee national insurance contribution from around 20 per cent. to around 13 per cent. The changes in the Bill for the first approach and second approach of opt-outs will take that figure up to about 17 per cent.
<P>
The cost of SERPS is increasing. Nobody will lose any SERPS that has been accrued over a working life; it will be fully paid. Under SERPS, it is possible for someone to pay contributions just above the lower earnings limit for the whole of their working life and still come out on the MIG. That will not happen with the state second pension, once it has built up. It will take 30 to 38 years to build up for people retiring after a full life of employment, or periods of caring or disability, behind them, which will take them above the MIG.
<P>
I refuse to accept that the state second pension replaces SERPS; it reforms, and indeed enhances, SERPS. There is no question about that, and it remains the case even when it becomes flat rate, because the rebates are earnings-related. They will buy a better pension than the state second pension. The manifesto pledge has not been torn up. Moderate earners will also gain, and for high earners the state second pension will be neutral, compared to SERPS, as it is intended to be.
<P>
I emphasise that any pension or accrual under SERPS will be fully protected and paid in full. The amendment would give those already in SERPS the choice of continuing to build up a pension under the existing arrangements rather than under the state second pension. Who would benefit from that choice? We have not been given a single configuration of age, family arrangement or salary to represent someone who would benefit from staying in SERPS. That is because nobody would. It is a con. People would lose out; that is clear from the graph in the Government Actuary's report. The only people who would choose to remain in SERPS would be those who were ignorant of the benefits of the alternative. We are trying to get rid of ignorance about pensions, so that people will not find themselves in that position. The only choice involved would be a choice to accrue less pension.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> It is a Tory choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> My hon. Friend is being rather partisan.
<P>
Incidentally, enormous administrative difficulties would be involved in running two sets of schemes at the same time. It would be an administrative nightmare.
<P>
People who remained in the scheme would be worse off. Some of those people, of course, suffered from the reduced generosity that resulted from the changes that took place in 1985 and 1996. No options were provided in 1985. People were not given the chance to say, ``I want to keep my SERPS as it has been from 1978 to 1985; I do not want the Fowler cut.'' It was the same in 1996. People could not say, ``I don't like what this man from Huntingdon has done to SERPS; I'd rather keep what I've got, because it's better.'' People were not given those choices. Conservative Members came in with a false prospectus this morning, and they have been rather disingenuous.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The Minister predicated his remarks entirely on stage 1 of the state second pension, neglecting to address the fact that in stage 2 the whole ball game changes. We do not know what projected earnings will be under the new arrangements, so his argument falls. As for his statement that people did not have a choice during the Fowler reforms, was that not one of the reasons why Labour Members complained so bitterly?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> Perhaps we shall return to this, but for the time being I shall stick to what I have said. I will not rush my response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Rooker:</B> No, because I have to deal with some other matters, especially the point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham about the working families tax credit. I want to do justice to that, and to her point about the second part of the amendment. I have not responded to that, and it is important that I do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I want to ask the Minister—
