opportunity for me to make my official debut in the Committee. I have
waited for 17 or 18—or is it 19?—sessions to get on my
feet and speak about this important Bill. The applause and cheers that
greeted my rising were suitable, given the weight of the Bill. I am
particularly pleased that thousands of people have turned out in the
streets this afternoon to mark the occasion, although my colleagues and
friends in the police force do not necessarily need to keep my
supporters under such scrutiny.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000129">&#160;</a>

addressing the hon. Gentleman’s specific questions, may I use
this opportunity to talk about the important point behind schedule 6?
Its objective is to ensure that there is a clear framework under which
Ofcom must operate when imposing regulatory conditions on the sector.
Taking one step back, now that we have moved into a new and perhaps
more entertaining phase of the Bill, it is important to talk about part
3 in general. It is worth pausing to reflect on what we have covered so
far and what we are moving on to. We have spent some interesting hours
debating Ofcom’s duties and powers and what it would be able to
do under the Bill. The next clauses and schedules that we will be
debating are about how Ofcom goes about implementing its duties and
powers; how it must go about its work; how regulated parties can appeal
against Ofcom’s decisions; and how we will move from the current
regime to the new one, which is known as the transition
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000130">&#160;</a>

those, although no amendment has been tabled.

obtain the evidence on which the regime will be based. As we have

those who need to challenge Ofcom’s decision and we have ensured
that the Secretary of State can provide guidance to Ofcom, if needed,

                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
you will indulge me, Mr Hood, if I use the questions that I have been
asked about schedule 6 as an opportunity to speak generally about part
3 of the Bill. Clause 65 requires the Secretary of State to review the
regulatory provisions that we are discussing after they have been in
place for five years. I know that an amendment has been tabled on that
issue. The review is a key feature of the Government’s drive to
reduce regulation. What is essential today to protect the universal
postal service may not be essential in five years’ time. We do
not believe that regulation should be made for the sake of it, nor do
we believe that it should be set in stone. That theme has run through
our debates.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I now turn to
the questions that the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has
asked about schedule 6. The objective of the schedule is to ensure that
there is a clear framework under which Ofcom must operate when imposing
regulatory conditions on the postal sector, so that everyone affected
by the regulatory regime knows the rules and how they will be applied.
The schedule is modelled on similar provisions in the telecoms sector,
which is the sector in which Ofcom currently works. The schedule
fulfils the requirements of the EU postal directive, which sets limits
on regulation. The schedule sets defined limits on the regulatory
action that is available to Ofcom. Ofcom may only impose or modify a
regulatory condition if it is satisfied that the condition or
modification is objectively justifiable, does not discriminate unduly
against particular persons, and is proportionate and transparent. Those
tests must be met before Ofcom can
act.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000137">&#160;</a>

2 sets out Ofcom’s powers that may be contained in regulatory
conditions. This is the nuts and bolts of how Ofcom will do its job. It

                        <p>For
example, Ofcom may direct an operator to amend its prices to ensure
compliance with the condition on affordability. It gives the power to
impose an obligation with respect to a consent, an approval or a
recommendation. It also gives the power to confer a discretion, as well
as to impose different conditions for different cases and to revoke or
modify the condition. However, Ofcom may not use those powers to stop
or restrict a person’s entitlement to provide postal services.
It can only do that if there has been serious and repeated
contravention of regulatory requirements, so that power is dealt with
separately in schedule
7.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000139">&#160;</a>

is important in the new regime, especially because regulation is done
without licences. Paragraph 3 therefore sets out the

change and its reasons for making the proposal. It must then give at
least a month for anyone to make representations. The hon. Member for
Ochil and South Perthshire asked how long would be an acceptable period
to make representations. It would usually be between one and three
months, but he can come back to me if he does not find that answer
satisfactory. Ofcom has to say what it plans to do and why, and let
those affected have their say. Ofcom must then consider every
representation on the proposal and have regard to every international
obligation notified to it by the Secretary of State before it can take
action.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000140">&#160;</a>

to have oversight of Ofcom’s decisions, and for the European
Commission to be satisfied that the directive’s objectives are
met. The hon. Gentleman asked whether there would be any exceptional
circumstances. Urgent action might be needed on occasion to protect the
universal service obligation, or possibly for reasons of national

Committee. I have been going round describing myself as the political
commissar appointed to the Bill to keep an eye on my Liberal Democrat
colleague to make sure that he keeps the faith but, clearly, the
monitored Minister is keeping an eye on me. I had anticipated that
occasionally he might whisper in my ear to help me with some of the
more technical aspects, given the formidable team that I face but
although I have only been in the House for a mere five years, even I
know the constituency that the hon. Member for Ochil and South

the notification to the Secretary of State, which is part of the
argument about Ofcom being a creature of statute and thus accountable

as Members will take an interest and, being experienced, they can raise
issues of concern in respect of any action undertaken by Ofcom. The key
principle is that Ofcom notifies the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000147">&#160;</a>

decision in accordance with its ruling.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000162">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Importantly,
the clause sets out the time frame in which price control appeals must
be lodged and heard. Notice of appeal must be sent to Ofcom within two

                        <p>The
hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire asked whether I could
elaborate on that definition. It is in Ofcom’s interest to refer
any appeal under the clause as quickly as possible. Ofcom is subject to
the supervision of the courts, so any action that it took—if it
was seen by the relevant parties as somehow dithering
unduly—would be subject to judicial review. That definition
means that it can be supervised in that way, but I would hesitate to go
too far off piste. I venture that<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000164">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Competition Commission must also determine the appeal within four
months of receiving it, or within six months in exceptional
circumstances. That ensures that appeals are resolved as swiftly as is
reasonably practicable. We have made special provision for
Ofcom’s initial price control decision, to ensure that that
decision in particular is protected from any prolonged appeal. We have
done that because it is vital that the transition to the new regulatory
regime is as speedy and smooth as possible. In the case that an appeal
is lodged against the first price control decision, it is right that
the standard four months allowed under the Bill should apply, rather
than the six months allowed under exceptional circumstances. As with
decisions that are appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, the
decision stands pending the outcome of the appeal. Once the decision
has been made, Ofcom must give effect to it as soon as is reasonably
practicable—I have already covered the definition of
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000166">&#160;</a>

want to challenge the Competition Commission’s decision, they

                        <p class="tabbed">We
keep returning to the topic of “may” and
“must”. The amendment is simple; it would strengthen the
opportunities to use the regulation of the industry for the provision
of related social and environmental goals. Changing “may”
to “must” would guarantee that the Government and the
negotiator address the opportunities that exist for the postal industry
to support such generally accepted aims as promoting community cohesion
and reduction of the industry’s carbon
footprint.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000175">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
date, the Committee has been generally reluctant—in votes, if
not in debate—to provide either the Secretary of State or Ofcom
with extra powers in the Bill, so I realise that my specific amendment
might be contradicting our general stance. However, the amendment
leaves intact the obligation under subsection (3), whereby the
Secretary of State has to undertake a consultative process before any
guidance is given. We are satisfied that that removes the chances of
the Secretary of State’s guidance being in any manner arbitrary,
but we cannot accept, in 2010, with everything we know, that the
contribution of the postal industry to broader social and environmental
matters can be in any sense optional. Opportunities must be utilised
and the amendment gives effect to that
imperative.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000176">&#160;</a>

about the feelings of the Under-Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills. My point about how slowly he has taken the Bill
through Committee was meant in jest and not in any way meant to
question his abilities. The whole Committee has been impressed, if not
overwhelmed, by his grasp of the Bill. It is almost a Bill that he was
born to take through Committee: he spent his early life as a management
consultant working in postal services, and his knowledge of postal
service regimes from Argentina to Russia and beyond surpasses even that
of his own officials. Why he should decide to leave the room on the
basis of my badinage about the pace of the Committee is beyond me.

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause enables the Secretary of State to secure that Ofcom carries out
its functions in relation to postal services in a way that is
consistent—the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills has returned—with wider social and environmental
policy. Amendment 123 seeks to substitute
“may” with “must”, thus forcing the
Secretary of State to issue such guidance from time to
time.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is one in a long list of such amendments that aim to
strengthen—from the point of view of the hon. Member for Ochil
and South Perthshire and his Opposition colleagues—consumer
protection and the regulatory regime. From the Government’s
perspective, the amendment merely serves to force an action without due
consideration for whether that action has to be taken. The Government,
and indeed the previous Government when they introduced the 2009 Bill,
recognise the need for the provision of this power—the need for
guidance on social and environmental policy—but then and now the
view remains that it should be used only if there is a clear need for
that power to be used, and that is why we would like to maintain the
use of the word “may” rather than “must” in
the provision. It is obviously the case—members of the Committee
may want to draw attention to this point—that there is a similar
provision in section 43 of the Postal Services Act 2000. It is no
longer a duty but it is a discretionary power under the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000182">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By way of
background, the previous Government issued guidance to Postcomm under
such a provision—section 43—back in March 2001, but no
further guidance was thereafter issued. The guidance was issued to
Postcomm because it was a new regulator that had just been set up under
the Postal Services Act 2000. Having been established under that Act,
Postcomm was in its early days and was exercising its functions at the
start of a new licensing regime. In such circumstances, it was probably
only right that the Government issued guidance on wider
policy.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000183">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
should be noted that Ofcom is a well-established regulator. It was
established by the previous Government and is now regarded around the
world as one of the finest regulators in its field. I know from my own
experience of working with Ofcom as the Minister with responsibility
for communications that its understanding of wider social and
environmental issues is well established. I would go even further and
say that it is hard-wired into its operations. In my submission to the
hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire, circumstances now are quite
different.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
need to recognise that many of the policy issues that may be covered in
such guidance are now a more fully normal part of policy making than
they were at the time of the Postal Services Act 2000. Indeed, that may
be another tribute to some of the work of the previous Government. The
power to make guidance in more exceptional circumstances is still
necessary, but a duty to do so is no longer considered necessary or
appropriate in an environment where we all want to reduce the burden of
regulation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000185">&#160;</a>

that is part of the problem. The hon. Gentleman has been silent for the
past few sittings, having hit the ground running in the first few
sittings. I am glad that he is now back up and running, because we
value his contributions, including his passionate defence of post
office services on Second Reading and in other debates on the Bill. I
heard him refer sotto voce to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of

                           </strong> Yes. To deal briefly with the intervention about
the powers of Ofcom, the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and
Kirkintilloch East should be in no doubt that the Government are a
great admirer of Ofcom. Perhaps, outside the Committee, we can discuss
the difference between its policy-making and regulatory
roles.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
debate on the amendment relates to Ofcom’s role as a regulator,
which is what it is. At the same time, we want Ofcom to be lightly
regulated, in the sense of not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 693<a class="bkMark" name="Column693">&#160;</a>
                           </div>imposing too many inflexible duties on it, but instead giving it an
element of flexibility, which is certainly our direction of travel on
Ofcom’s powers as a telecoms regulator. It is right and proper
that we have kept faith with that direction of travel in the Bill and
have allowed Ofcom a degree of flexibility about when and where it
should appropriately exercise the powers it will be given by the Bill.
It is given such powers because it is a creature of statute, being
accountable to the Secretary of State and to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
fully recognise that there may be circumstances in which the Secretary
of State considers there is a need to issue guidance, and that is why
the Bill allows that, but the amendment adds no substance or value to
the Bill. Those are harsh words, and I am tempted to say that they are
not mine. The use of any power by Government should be based on a
practical need to satisfy a real purpose; it should not have to be used
just for the sake of issuing paperwork. On that basis, I hope that the
hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire will accept that the clause
as it stands is fit for purpose and that he will withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000200">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I am grateful to
the Minister for those words, but although they were very entertaining,
I am not convinced. Amendment 123 would make only a slight adjustment
to clause 59, but it would significantly strengthen opportunities to
use the regulation of the industry for the provision of related social
and environmental goals. Replacing “may” with
“must” would oblige Ofcom to regulate in a manner that
will contribute towards attaining the social or environmental policies
laid out in the guidance from the Secretary of
State.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment would guarantee that the Government and companies with an
interest in buying Royal Mail address opportunities for the postal
industry to advance such generally accepted aims as promoting community
cohesion or reducing the industry’s carbon footprint. It would
not remove the obligation laid out in subsection (3)
directing the Secretary of State to undertake a consultative process
before any guidance is given. That would helpfully prevent the guidance
from being arbitrary in any way, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ochil
and South Perthshire has accurately pointed out. The amendment is not
unreasonable. The passage of the Bill must not result in the
contribution that the postal industry makes to broader social and
environmental matters becoming
optional.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000202">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I understand
that Royal Mail is currently having great success in pursuing social
and environmental goals, which must be welcomed. The most recent Royal
Mail corporate social responsibility report outlined some of those
successes and I want to put them on record: it achieved the target for
50% of electricity to come from renewable sources; it raised
£1.8 million in charitable donations in the past
year; and 43,000 of its employees regularly donate to good causes
through the payroll system. Royal Mail currently works in partnership
with organisations that can make a difference at local level. In recent
years strategic partnerships have been built with Barnardo’s and
Children in Need, and it is engaged with businesses in the community.

                        <p class="tabbed">Royal
Mail has also made significant progress towards its environmental
goals, and its achievements are laudable. Absolute greenhouse gas
emissions have been reduced by 12% since 2004-05, transport-related
gases have fallen by 9.8% and building-related greenhouse gases have
fallen by
16.3%.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000205">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Many
companies operating in the private sector have corporate social
responsibility standards and aims. That is not just a choice for large
corporations such as BT, but an integral part of business strategy. As
the concept is already an accepted principle in the market, I see no
objection to including an obligation in the Bill for the Secretary of
State, in conjunction with Ofcom, to ensure that a privatised Royal
Mail continues to contribute to achieving social and environmental
goals.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000206">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is about how we view the relationship between corporate
companies and social and environmental concerns. Should they be obliged
to act as a responsible corporate citizen, or if they see fit, should
they feel free to choose not to do so? The contrast is stark, and I
know where I stand on the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000207">&#160;</a>

an age in which policy is geared towards supporting a big society, such
an amendment should receive support from all Government Members.
Striving for social responsibility within a free market should be a
priority, not a secondary option. For those reasons, I respectfully
urge the Minister and Government Members to embrace the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000208">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I shall be as brief as possible. I am sure that
the Minister will enjoy responding. He may not remember that back in
2005 we featured in the same radio programme, when we were being
trailed for a day on what it was like to be new MP. I asked who else
was being trailed, and was of course told. That was our last
encounter.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000233">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause spells out for any prospective purchaser of Royal Mail the
appropriate protocol for using the Queen’s head on postage
stamps. It may be obvious to us, but some private sector operators who
are interested in purchasing Royal Mail, particularly if their
headquarters are abroad, may not be aware of the courtesy. The clause
spells out in no uncertain terms in subsections (2) and (3) that any
direction issued by the Secretary of State must make it absolutely
clear that permission must be sought from Her Majesty the Queen to use
her image on stamps. That requirement will ensure that there is no
unintended disrespect on the part of special edition stamp designers
that might otherwise result in inappropriate size or position of the
image.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000234">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
subsection (1) the Secretary of State may give that direction. Will the
Minister clarify whether “may” is used because the
Secretary of State has discretion about whether to use the power to
give a direction? Will such a direction be necessary only if a
privatised Royal Mail intended to use Her Majesty’s image on its
stamps, and how will such an organisation know if that were so? Are we
to understand that a privatised Royal Mail would not necessarily put
Her Majesty’s image on its stamps? Is that
conceivable?<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000235">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Some
commentators have noted that Royal Mail is a prestigious and trusted
household brand name. After the short-lived and hastily abandoned
Consignia episode, prospective purchasers would do well to consider
using the name “Royal Mail” and the image of Her Majesty.
Constitutionally, it would not be appropriate to consult Her Majesty on
that possibility, but I wonder how she would feel if after so many
years and in the run-up to her diamond jubilee, her image disappeared
from our stamps. That would break a long and historic
link.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000236">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Many
hon. Members collected stamps when they were younger, and will have
experienced the excitement of older relatives proudly showing them old
stamps with the head of previous monarchs, perhaps going back to the
famous penny black bearing the head of Queen Victoria, whose reign saw
so many initiatives to establish public services, and legislation to
improve the lives of all, particularly those living in the rapidly
expanding industrial towns. I dare say that Prince William may have
thoughts about the matter. The date of the forthcoming royal
wedding—it has obviously been designed to give the Liberal
Democrats an extra bank holiday to campaign for the AV
referendum—will predate any sell-off of Royal Mail which, as the
hon. Member for Witham suggested, will no doubt feature the happy
couple on a special commemorative stamp with the image of Her Majesty,
Prince William’s grandmother, at the top.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000237">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What would the
public think about losing Her Majesty’s image on our stamps. The
value of stamps tucked away in purses and wallets might increase
overnight, but I suspect that many people do not want to see the end of
that historic tradition. Will the Minister enlighten us on the
circumstances in which the Secretary of State would give a direction to
a universal provider, and is it envisaged that a privatised provider of
a universal service might choose not to use the monarch’s image
on stamps in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000238">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I want to make a few quick points
that are slightly different from those made by the hon. Lady. Clause 60
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000239">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
Secretary of State may give a direction to a universal service provider
in relation to United Kingdom postage stamps bearing the image of Her
Majesty that the provider proposes to
issue.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000905">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Is
it conceivable that we could have a situation in which some stamps bear
the image of Her Majesty and some do not? In an earlier debate, I
mentioned FastPost in New Zealand, which is an alternative post office
system that issues its own stamps. In the parlance of the Bill, it
would not be a universal service provider, but it could be delivering a
service throughout the United Kingdom. We may have parallel systems in
which some stamps bear the image of Her Majesty and some do
not.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000240">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At the
moment, each nation of the United Kingdom has its own definitive stamp
and an ordinary postage stamp that bears the symbols of the nation as
well as the image of Her Majesty. Will the Minister assure us that that
will continue and that we will not have one-size-fits-all stamps
throughout the United Kingdom, thus ending a great tradition of which
many stamp collectors are
fond?<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000241">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
the United Kingdom is famous throughout the stamp collecting world for
being the only country that does not have its name on the stamp; it has
only the image of the Queen. If that were to disappear, or if we were
to have two or more different sets of stamps—one with the image
of the monarch and one without, and one with the name of the country
and one without—it would undermine our great postage stamp
tradition. Such matters may be minor in the great scheme of things in
the privatisation of the Royal Mail, but I would none the less be
interested to hear what the Minister has to say about
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000242">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to have the chance to respond to the
comments made by the hon. Members for Llanelli and for Angus. I begin
by welcoming the hon. Member for Llanelli; it is a great opportunity to
be reunited with her after five years. Of course, I am fond of Llanelli
because it is the birthplace of Michael Howard, my former boss and one
of the great leaders of the Conservative party, now safely ensconced in
the other place. If Llanelli can produce two such political Titans as
Michael Howard and the hon. Lady it must be a very special place, and I
hope that one day I might be part of a party that goes to Llanelli to
unveil statues, both to Mr Howard and to the hon. Lady.

                           </div>certainly—being unfair. The hon. Member for Llanelli gave an
almost poetic homage to the monarchy and Her Majesty the Queen, with
which I completely agreed. The other day, I read that our current Prime
Minister had camped out for the royal wedding when he was a teenager.
Frankly, after the hon. Lady’s intervention, I would not be
surprised to see her camping out for the wedding, or indeed sitting in
the front row in Westminster abbey, courtesy of a personal invitation
from Her Majesty. It really was a superbly royalist speech with which I
completely concurred.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000244">&#160;</a>

is a well-established process for ensuring that the sovereign approves
of postage stamps bearing her image, and I am apparently allowed to
reveal—I find it surprising that I am—that Royal Mail is
already in discussions with the palace on stamps for the jubilee and to
celebrate the coming royal wedding. That special relationship between
Royal Mail and the royal family has been in place for more than 40
years and will undoubtedly endure. In fact, it is a voluntary
arrangement. There is nothing in statute that requires the
sovereign’s head to be on a stamp, and there is nothing in
statute that requires Royal Mail to consult the royal family. The
arrangement is entirely
voluntary.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000258">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause actually supports the sentiments of monarchists in the
Opposition and those who support the royal family. We want safeguards
in place in the unlikely event that the voluntary arrangement breaks
down, which is why clause 60 appears in the Bill. It gives a power of
direction to the Secretary of State to require a universal service
provider not to issue postage stamps that bear Her Majesty’s
image without prior royal approval of the design. The direction may
also contain provision in relation to the subject matter of stamp
designs and the approval process. The clause
states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A

licence conditions that it determines are not

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Bill should be amended to remove this exemption, as it heightens
concerns that consumers’ interests will not be given sufficient
consideration by postal operators. Indeed, I find it extraordinary that
an exemption is being made in respect of consumer protection
conditions. I am sure that the Minister will be familiar with European
legislation on the matter. Under article 19 of EU Directive 2008/6/EC,
member states should ensure that transparent, simple and inexpensive
procedures are made available by all postal service providers for
dealing with postal service user complaints. In the UK, that is covered
by the Postal Services (Consumer Complaints Handling Standards)
Regulations 2008 and the Postal Services Regulated Providers (Redress
Scheme) Order 2008.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000270">&#160;</a>

expected the Government to ensure similar protection for the consumer
to that which is currently available and that, at the very least, they
would need to comply with the EU directive. We are therefore surprised
to find that although everything else is supposed to reflect current
practice, consumer protection conditions have been singled out not to
enjoy any of that protection. I should be grateful if the Minister
would tell us the reason for this specific exemption. The
Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills seemed to
acknowledge earlier the importance of consumer protection conditions,
so it is particularly odd that those conditions are not going to be
quasi-copied or reflected in the new
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000271">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her remarks.
They give me an opportunity to set her mind at rest and to make it
absolutely clear that we take the issue of consumer protection
extremely seriously. The Bill will actually extend consumer protection
into areas where hitherto it may not have been.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000272">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schedule 9,
as the hon. Lady indicated, makes transitional provisions in relation
to the regulatory part of the Bill. The objective of the schedule is to
ensure a smooth transition between the current and the new regime to
provide as much certainty to the market as possible and to enable Ofcom
to carry out certain functions during the transitional period between
Royal Assent and when Ofcom takes full responsibility for postal
regulation on the appointed day. We expect the transitional period to
last approximately three months. As such, schedule 9 enables Ofcom to
start work on developing a new regulatory regime as soon as possible
following Royal Assent.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000273">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During the
transitional period, Postcomm will continue to be responsible for
regulating the sector. However, from Royal Assent, Ofcom will be able
to exercise some of its powers under the new regime in advance of the
substantive provisions in part 3 coming into force. Those powers will
allow Ofcom to work during the transitional period on the forthcoming
regulatory regime, with a view to making an order of designation, or
imposing conditions as soon as is practical after the rest of part 3
comes into force. So far, none of that is really controversial. It is
plain common sense to allow Ofcom to get on with preparing for its new
role.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000274">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">During the
transitional period, Ofcom must determine the regulatory initial
conditions that will come into force on the appointed day. They will
apply until they are modified, if at all, to all postal operators once
part 3 comes fully into force and we move from a licensing regime to a
general authorisation regime. Those initial conditions will apply to
postal operators who have, or would need to have, a licence under the
current regime and would include, for example, price control and access
provisions. Importantly, as is clear from the Bill, initial conditions
must have substantially the same effect as current licence conditions,
except when it appears unnecessary for Ofcom to maintain those
conditions. As such, initial conditions can apply only to those who had
licences under the old regime, or who would have required
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
brings me to the amendments that the hon. Lady has tabled because,
quite laudably, she wants to ensure that consumers are adequately
protected during the transitional regime. However, perversely, I would
argue that the amendments could have, to a certain extent, the opposite
effect. They would ensure that consumer protection conditions are
included as initial conditions. However, the fact that under the Bill
they are not included under initial conditions does not mean that
consumers are unprotected. In terms of consumer protection, the current
licence regime requires that licence operators have a complaint
handling system in place and that they are members of an approved
redress scheme. That protection stems from the Consumers, Estate Agents
and Redress Act 2007, which was passed by the previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The first
thing to note is that the initial conditions ensure that the current
licence conditions are captured and maintained beyond the transition,
so at present,

			Column number: 701<a class="bkMark" name="Column701">&#160;</a>
                           </div>operators, such as couriers, who do not currently need to hold a
licence, are actually excluded from having consumer protection
provisions in place. During the transitional period between Royal
Assent and the appointed day when Ofcom assumes regulatory
responsibility, the regulatory regime, including consumer protection,
will remain the same. As I have already said, during the transitional
period Ofcom will determine the initial conditions that will come into
force on the appointed
day.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000277">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is good reason why consumer protection conditions are excluded from the
initial conditions. Initial conditions are used to replicate existing
licence conditions. They cannot be used to introduce new regulations. I
will try to set out briefly why this matters for consumer protection
conditions. The European postal services directive requires all postal
operators, not just those who would have been captured under the old
licence regime, to have a simple complaints handling system. Because
initial conditions have to be substantially the same as existing
licence conditions, it would not be possible to extend this requirement
to all postal operators using initial conditions. So, instead of using
initial conditions, Ofcom will use its powers in part 3 to impose the
consumer protection conditions in clauses 49 and 50, which were debated
this morning, to implement this requirement. These conditions will be
applied from the day Ofcom takes over regulatory
responsibility.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000278">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I hope that
reassures the hon. Lady and other hon. Members that there will not be a
gap in consumer protection. Furthermore, the Bill will ensure broader
consumer protections than the amendment would have provided. I am sure
that the Committee would welcome that outcome. The amendments would
have another potential impact: Ofcom would have to replicate every
single existing licence condition as an initial condition, whether it
thought that necessary or not. The Committee has already spent a great
deal of time debating “may”, “must” and
“will” and I do not intend to spend any more time on that
issue. In this case, it is clearly totally inappropriate to force Ofcom
to impose initial conditions on operators that it considers to be
unnecessary.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000279">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me give
an example. Royal Mail’s current licence has a condition that
relates to competition investigations. This will not be necessary in
future because Ofcom has concurrent competition powers. It would be
regulation for regulation’s sake and would serve no purpose
other than to maintain unnecessary regulation. Given what I have said
about the consumer protection conditions in the Consumers, Estate
Agents and Redress Act 2007, in clauses 49 and 50 and in the EU postal
services directive, to which the hon. Lady referred, I hope she will be
reassured that there is a strong consumer protection regime in the Bill
and that consumer protection will now extend to all operators that
provide postal or postal-like services. That is surely something that
all hon. Members can welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000280">&#160;</a>

amendment seeks to change the review period, which begins on the day
that the provisions in this part come into force, from five years to
three years. Hon. Members will be very anxious to know how the
regulator is progressing in its dealings with the privatised Royal
Mail, because the situation will be very different. There will have
been a handover from Postcomm to Ofcom. The service will be provided by
a privatised Royal Mail, which may give rise to a different dynamic
because the privatised Royal Mail may be more inclined to maximise
profit, meaning that there could be additional pressure on the
regulator. There will be a new regulatory regime, as set out in part 3
of the Bill. There are also likely to be continuing changes in the
marketplace, changes in the overall use of mail services by consumers,
and changes in respect of the aspirations of competitors in the
market.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000305">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The Hooper
report clearly described, in some detail, the complexities of
regulation. There have been difficulties in the past and his thorough
analysis weighed up two sides of the question; on one hand, sufficient
regulation must be ensured, and on the other, one must not
over-regulate. Without going through all of that analysis, I simply
emphasise the importance that he laid on the regulatory regime, as well
as the further comment in his 2010 report about the progress made to
date:<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000306">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Postcomm
has worked hard to develop a new forward work programme and has
recently completed consulting on a new regulatory framework. During
this time a better and more constructive relationship between Postcomm
and Royal Mail has emerged—although there still remain
fundamental disagreements between them about the right regulatory
future.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000909">&#160;</a>

                        <p>So clearly, although
work has started there is a lot to do, and Ofcom will be undertaking
that work in the run-up to a possible sell-off and privatisation of

years seems a long time not to have any idea of how that regulatory
framework is working out in practice, which is why we would like the
report to come back for scrutiny after three years. That would give us
a much better idea of exactly what has happened, which would be helpful
to all concerned, whether it is for those who are planning future
business, the regulator, or elected Members who want to know how the
whole system is working.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000308">&#160;</a>

                           <strong> </strong>I am pleased to see the Under-Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and Skills maintaining his helping hand.
The reason it took me a while to rise—approximately two or three
seconds—was that I wanted to check whether any hon. Members
looked as though they wanted to contribute to the debate. It would
surprise me, given the forceful nature of the contribution by the hon.
Member for Llanelli, if other people did not rise to their feet in
support of her arguments. She rightly reviewed the significant changes
that may happen as we move towards the new regime, and she put forward
a forceful case suggesting that the review should take place sooner
rather than later, or, to sum up the contrast between her position and
that of the Government, within three years as opposed to
five.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000309">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let me first
make some positive points about clause 65, which I hope the
hon. Lady will welcome. The clause is in line with our commitment to
better regulation. It aims to strengthen the monitoring and scrutiny of
regulations that place a burden on business, and bear down on
regulatory costs. It requires the Secretary of State to conduct a
review as soon as reasonably practicable once five years have expired
since part 3 came into force—I will come on to the distinction
between five years and three years in a moment. In layman’s
language, that will be when the Bill is enacted, some point in the
middle of next year.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Secretary
of State must set out the conclusions of the review in a report laid
before Parliament. That report should set out the objectives of the
regulatory system, and assess the extent to which those objectives have
been achieved. It should also assess whether those objectives remain
appropriate, and whether they could be achieved with a less burdensome
regulatory system.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000311">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Lady’s amendment seeks to reduce the timetable for the review
from five years to three. I do not agree with her arguments because in
order to review whether the regulatory system established by part 3 has
successfully delivered its objectives, a sensible period of time must
have elapsed before such an assessment is made. Three years is too
short a time frame to allow an assessment of any real value.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000312">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When the hon.
Lady outlined some of the issues to be tackled during that period, she
almost strengthened the Government’s argument. Ofcom would need
to gather evidence and consult in advance of making any regulatory
decisions. Such decisions will not normally come into force
immediately, so as to give the regulatory parties time to adjust.
Furthermore, it could take years before the impact of the regulatory
decisions is demonstrated in the markets, and a period of three years
would not 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 704<a class="bkMark" name="Column704">&#160;</a>
                           </div>allow the regime time to be used fully. Extending the time frame to five
years will ensure that a sufficient period has passed in order to
evaluate properly the effectiveness of part 3. I therefore hope that
hon. Members will resist the amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000313">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not convinced by the Minister. I think that
hon. Members will want to know what is happening and to see a report;
they will want some indication from Ofcom, and it would be helpful if
we could see how the situation is bedding down after three years. From
what Hooper has said, we already know that things have changed between
2008 and 2010. The market is developing quickly, which I am sure the
Minister knows from his other responsibilities. The pressures will be
changing and this regulatory regime will have a baptism of fire. There
will be a lot of pressure and many different interests that might
challenge some of the tenets of the legislation. I feel strongly that
there should be a report after three years and that we need an
indication of how things are progressing. A clear picture should be put
in front of us. I will therefore press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000314">&#160;</a>

66, which opens part 4 of the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman will allow
me, I shall just set the context of the clause and the ones that
follow.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000339">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Part 4 puts in
place a special administration regime—a “postal
administration”—that is designed to ensure the
maintenance of the universal postal service. It is obviously prudent to
ensure that appropriate provisions are in place to deal with the
unlikely—in our view—eventuality of a universal service
provider getting into financial difficulty and being at risk of
entering into insolvency proceedings. The provisions in part 4 are,
therefore, very much reserve provisions. We need them because it is
sensible that the Government plan for any scenario, no matter how
remote. There are precedents for such regimes in other sectors, most
notably in the water and energy sectors. Each regime has a specific
objective that the administrator has to achieve. As set out in clause
67, on which we will have an extensive debate, the broad objective of a
postal administration is to secure the provision of the universal
postal service to the standard set out in the universal postal service
order made under clause
29.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000340">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
clauses in this part cover four distinct areas. Clauses 66 to 71 set
out the fundamentals of the postal administration regime, and deal with
postal administration orders, postal administrators, the powers of the
court and, importantly, setting the objective of a postal
administration, which is to secure the provision of the universal
postal service and to ensure that there is no longer a need for a
postal administration. Clauses 72 to 76 are designed to prevent postal
administration being frustrated by action taken to wind up the company,
voluntary wind-up, ordinary administration or the enforcement of
security.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000341">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clauses
77 to 79 allow the Secretary of State to give financial support to
companies in a postal administration in the form of grants, loans or
guarantees and, where appropriate, to indemnify the postal
administrator. Clauses 80 and 81 give the Secretary of State
powers to make modifications to the regulatory regime while a postal
administration order is in force, including modifications to deal with
funding the costs of a postal administration. Clauses 82 to 86 contain
a number of supplementary provisions, one of which enables part 4 to be
applied to partnerships, and another that deals with its application to
Northern
Ireland.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000342">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
66 is the opening clause of part 4. It defines the postal
administration order as an order, made by the court in relation to a
universal service provider, that directs that a postal administrator be
appointed to manage the universal service provider’s affairs,
business and property. Subsection (3) makes it clear that the postal
administrator must manage the company, exercise their powers and
perform their duties to achieve the objectives of the postal
administration as set out in clause 67.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000343">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The purpose
of the postal administration is to ensure the provision of the
universal postal service in the UK. Clause 66(4) makes it clear that if
the universal service provider were to be a foreign company, the postal
administration would only apply to the company’s affairs,
businesses and property in the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000344">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Once
an order is made, the administrator is under a duty to publish his
appointment and send a notice to creditors. Those matters are dealt
with in the detailed rules under section 411 of the Insolvency Act
1986. Obviously, I have a detailed knowledge of section, but I am not
sure that I want to detain the Committee with the ins and outs of that.
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman

                           </strong> The amendments are tabled in my name and that of my
hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli. Clause 67 defines the objective of
a postal administration, and amendment 125 would mean that the rescue
of the company as a going concern was a free-standing objective of the
postal administration, rather than a means of securing the other
objectives—that is, the provision of the universal postal
service. It would mean that it would no longer be necessary for the
postal administration order to remain in
force.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are beginning to look at some of the blackest sides of matters in these
and future amendments. I hope that the Minister agrees, however, that
it is our duty to look at the worst-case scenario and to make sure that
the Bill prepares the country for anything that might happen one of
these dark days. None of us wanted the clause to have any operative
impact, but I think that my hon. Friends and I would say the same about
much of the Bill. The amendment makes the rescue of the company as a
going concern an objective of the Bill from the postal services point
of view. That would provide an extra safeguard on those in an
administrative position, and it could also strengthen a universal
service provision in such a
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
126 relates to clause 67(1)(b) and is a consequential amendment that
provides that, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
the objective of the postal administration contained in paragraph (b)
would be achieved by making the relevant
transfers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
128 calls for the removal of subsection (2) and is,
therefore, a consequential amendment to amendments 125 and 126. If the
rescue of the company as a going concern becomes an objective of the

                           </div>administration under clause 67(1), and the only means of securing the
continuation of the postal administration is by making the relevant
transfers under clause 67(1)(b), subsection (2) becomes superfluous. I

it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000357">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the
amendments. In 90 minutes the Committee has got through 16 clauses and
five schedules. At that pace we could have considered the entire Bill
in three sittings, although I make no comment on the relative speed. I
gather that things are getting interesting outside the Committee Room;
we have had visitors in the Public Gallery of the Chamber, although
somehow no one has found their way to this scintillating Committee to
register their interest in what we are
debating.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000360">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
welcome the hon. Gentleman’s comments on the importance of these
provisions. I think he put it very well; members on both sides of the
Committee clearly share the view that we would not want to see any of
these provisions used in the future, but that it is prudent and right
to have them. Further, as he also said, if it is prudent and right to
put in place provisions to deal with such eventualities, it is also
prudent and right to scrutinise those provisions to ensure that they
are as effective as possible. In that sense, but only in that sense, I
welcome the amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000361">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Part 4 puts
in place a special administration regime—a postal
administration—that is designed to ensure the maintenance of the
universal postal service where there is a risk of a universal service
provider entering into insolvency proceedings. We are confident that
the provisions in parts 1, 2 and 3 will secure the future of Royal Mail
and will ensure the maintenance of the universal postal service, and
that there should be no need for a postal administration. However, as I
have remarked, we believe it is prudent to ensure that appropriate
provisions are in place.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Precedents
exist for such regimes, most notably in the water and energy sectors.
If Royal Mail was in danger of entering insolvency proceedings in the
future and a postal administration was necessary, what matters and is
really important to all users of the mail service in the UK economy is
securing the universal postal service. This is where I part company
with the hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire. It is not
necessarily about preserving Royal Mail as a corporate
entity.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is
clearly reflected in the objective of a postal administration as set
out in clause 67. The objective is to ensure that the universal postal
service is secure, and that there is no longer a need for postal
administration. The means by which that can be achieved are set out in
subsection (2). Those means are either the rescue of the company as a
going concern or relevant
transfers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000364">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
effect of amendments 125, 126 and 128 is to move the rescue of the
universal service provider as a going concern from a means to achieve
the objective of postal administration to an objective simply in its
own right. I fully accept that the postal administrator should be
permitted to achieve the objective of the postal administration by
seeking to rescue the company as a going concern. The rescue of the
existing company may well be best designed to ensure seamless
continuation of its business. I do not believe, however, that a going
concern rescue should be an objective in itself. Suppose that we reach
a situation—I remind the hon. Gentleman that we agree that it is
almost impossible to imagine ourselves in such a situation, but we are
in the era of prudence—when Royal Mail as the universal service
provider is in administration, I repeat that our policies are designed
to avoid precisely such a situation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000365">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Despite all
that, the Government certainly believe that the overriding objective of
the administration has to be the securing of the universal postal
service that our constituents rely on, not simply the rescue of the
company. We believe, however, that there should be a preference for the
objective of the postal administration to be achieved through the
rescue of the company as a going concern, rather than through relevant
transfers. I hope the hon. Gentleman is reassured by that.
That is why we have written into subsection (5) that transfers can only
be used if the rescue of the company is not “practicable”
or would not achieve the objective, or if the transfers can achieve a
better result for creditors and members—shareholders—than
could be achieved
otherwise.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That
is the right order of preference. The postal administrator’s
hand should not be tied by making the rescue of the company an
objective. A rescue might not be practicable—it might not be in
the best interest of the users of the universal postal
service—and the administrator should have other means available.
I therefore ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendments and for
the clause to stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000367">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I listened carefully to the Minister, but I am not
convinced that our amendment 125 would create a particular problem for
the postal administration operation. Our amendment would strengthen and
preserve the universal service provision, so I shall press amendment
125 to a vote—amendments 126 and 128 are

127 has relevance to amendments 125 and 128, which we have just
discussed; its purpose is to make the protection of the interests and
entitlements of employees of the company subject to the postal
administration order an objective of the postal administration. It is
self-explanatory. We want the rights of employees recognised in that
way. Ordinarily, in administration, employees would rank as preferred
creditors in respect of many employment-related debts and then only to
the extent of £800 save in respect of accrued holiday
entitlement. Protection of the employees’ interests should be an
objective of the
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000408">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
would protect employees’ interests in the event of a postal

subsection (2)(c). It would impose a requirement that the
representatives of the employees of the company are given notice of any
application for a postal administration order. On its own, the
amendment would not create additional rights beyond being given notice
at the same time as other potential categories of creditors. In any
administration, the employees’ interests and entitlements are at
risk. There is no logical reason why their representatives should not
be given notice of the application for a postal administration order,
and I am sure that the Minister will see things that way,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000412">&#160;</a>

purpose is to give the court hearing an application for an
administration order the power to call for evidence to show that,
consistent with amendment 127 to clause 67, the interests
and entitlements of employees are safeguarded. If the objectives of the
administration are to include the protection of employees’
interests, the court hearing the application for an order should have
power before making the order to call for evidence on how the
employees’ rights are to be safeguarded. That is particularly so
because the protections afforded by TUPE are relaxed in the event of
insolvency and/or

thrust of our arguments is to empower and safeguard the rights and

order should make provision for the safeguarding of the interests and

we have attempted to empower the work force in many different ways.
Amendment 139 would empower the work force by ensuring that they
support the transfer at the end of what would be, as we discussed in
our previous exchange, a very difficult period for the employees, for
the business and, possibly, for users throughout the Untied
Kingdom.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000422">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
140 is self-explanatory. It would ensure that when the court has made a
postal administration order and the Secretary of State wishes to modify
a postal transfer scheme, representatives of the employees are
consulted. The employees’ interests and entitlements are likely
to be affected by any modification to a transfer scheme, so their
representatives should be
informed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000423">&#160;</a>

4(3)(a) of schedule 11 requires the consent of the old company and the
new company to modifications to any transfer scheme. Amendment 141
would add an additional requirement for the consent of the
employees’ representatives, as the employees’ interests
will also be
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000424">&#160;</a>

142 continues in that mould. Paragraph 4(3)(b) of schedule
11 requires the consent of the old company to a
transfer covered by TUPE. The amendment would add an additional
requirement for the consent of representatives of the employees of the
old company, whose interests will be affected.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000425">&#160;</a>

would call for the Secretary of State to ensure that he has regard to
the employees of the old company in the approval or modification of a
postal transfer scheme. That is consistent with the current drafting,
which provides for the Secretary of State to have regard to the
interests of persons
affected.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000426">&#160;</a>

144 would reaffirm the need for the Secretary of State, before
approving or modifying a postal transfer scheme, to consult not only
with Ofcom, but with employees’ representatives, as their
interests, too, will be affected. The amendment, therefore, continues
in the mould of the previous amendments in the
group.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000427">&#160;</a>

146 makes it clear that paragraph 11 of schedule 11, which modifies
rights on termination of entitlements under a transfer scheme, does not
apply to the transfer of rights and liabilities in relation to
employees. Those rights and liabilities are covered by TUPE, as
detailed in paragraphs 19 and
20.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000428">&#160;</a>

147 asks for TUPE rights to apply to a transfer not only under, but in
connection with, employees’ contract of employment. The effect
of the amendment is to make paragraph 19 consistent with
TUPE.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000429">&#160;</a>

amendment 148 calls for employees of the new company, who were
employees of the old company at the time of a postal transfer scheme,
to be entitled to the same pension benefits in respect of their
employment with the new company as they were as employees of the old
company. That would mean that no material detriment of pension
provision
developed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000430">&#160;</a>

19 and 20 of schedule 11 to the Bill make provision for TUPE to apply
to protect employees in the event of the making of a postal transfer
scheme. However, TUPE is notorious for not making adequate protection
for future service pension provision. This amendment seeks to remedy
that defect by requiring a new employer to provide the same pension
benefits as applied before the transfer and to ensure that a
transferred employee suffers no material detriment in pension
provision, as I have said. This is a fair and just amendment and I hope
it receives the Minister’s

encompassing theme, to which I will return in a moment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000433">&#160;</a>

                           </div>that the universal postal service can be secured and that the service
can continue to benefit all users and the UK economy. Were we ever to
reach such a position that a postal administration is needed—I
yet again reiterate that the provisions in other parts of the Bill will
prevent that—the primary objective of the administrator has to
be to secure the universal postal service. I am not saying that merely
for effect; I am reminding members of the Committee that the framework
of the special administration regime is—it was so impressive
that the hon. Gentleman spoke to each amendment and that each amendment
had its own specific purpose—to put the protection of
employees’ interests on a par with the administrator’s
primary objective to secure the universal postal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
read-across from the previous group of amendments, where the hon.
Gentleman sought to put the securing of the company on a par with
securing the universal postal service. From his perspective, he makes
perfectly valid arguments that the security of employees’
interests should be on a par with the universal postal service. Given
that I have made those remarks, it should come as no surprise to hon.
Members that I will resist the amendments, because it is my intention
to secure the framework of this part of the Bill, which states that the
special postal administration regime is there to secure the universal
postal service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When the hon.
Gentleman spoke to each of his amendments I considered each one and
wanted to respond point by point. Amendment 127 seeks to make the fact
that the protection of employees’ interests should be on a par
with the postal administrator’s primary objective to secure the
universal postal service explicit in the objective of the special
postal administration. Amendment 129 seeks to prevent any relevant
transfers unless employees are protected. Obviously, one recognises
that employees of a universal service provider that is in postal
administration will be going through a period of uncertainty and
difficulty. That was acknowledged when the hon. Gentleman introduced
the amendments. I certainly would not dissent from that. However, I
challenge the hon. Gentleman to show that employees in such a situation
should receive unique protection over and above employees in another
administration. We have a special administration regime to protect the
universal postal service. The hon. Gentleman needs to show why
employees of a universal service provider should be given particularly
unique treatment when going through the special administration process
as opposed to a normal administration. I do not mean that to sound
negative.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000436">&#160;</a>

Committee that the Bill is very good for employees. It is worth my
finally paying tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills because many measures in the Bill that are good
for employees are down to his own endeavours. Not only will the Bill
enable Royal Mail to secure its future through an injection of private
capital, which will help sustain jobs, but it will give employees a
real stake in the business through an employee share scheme with at
least 10% of the shares. Also, it will secure the £8 billion
pension deficit and therefore secure the pensions of current Royal Mail
employees. There are protections for employees if there are relevant
transfers under a postal administration. The protections are set out in
paragraphs 19 and 20 of schedule 11. They ensure that TUPE will apply
to transfers of staff and that their period of

130 sought to add the unions to the list of persons who should be
formally notified when an application has been made for a postal
administration order. The intention of subsection (2) of clause 68 is
to ensure that the key persons who may wish to make representations to
court are given formal notice of the application. It is not the
intention of that subsection to list all the people who may have an
interest in an application for a postal administration order. The list
of persons included in the clause are those who have already appointed
an administrative receiver or who are entitled to appoint an
administrative receiver who, as floating charge holders, are entitled
to appoint an administrator. It is not intended to be an exhaustive
list of interested stakeholders. That approach is consistent with
normal administration. I do not see any compelling reason to move away
from normal practice to include a specific clause to ensure that the
unions are
notified.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000438">&#160;</a>

cannot say that that would be my intention, as I think I made clear.
Technically, persons who have to be notified have a specific interest
in the administration—they are creditors or have a floating
charge and so on. It is not for me to tell a company what might be good
or not good practice. One would expect a well run company such as Royal
Mail to have good relations with its unions and for the unions to be
made well aware of what is going on, subject to any necessity for an
emergency
application.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000440">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
131 and 133 also go beyond the requirements of a normal administration
order and other special administration regimes, such as the one brought
in by the previous Government for the Energy Act 2004. Although I have
made it clear that we want to ensure that Royal Mail’s employees
can share in the company’s future success, and we are
implementing a package of measures to enable that success, we do not
see any reason why a special case should be made in primary legislation
for the court to hear the unions’ evidence when there is no
obligation on the court to hear evidence from others, and there is no
similar obligation in other special administration
regimes.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000441">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With
regard to amendment 131, let me point out that not including a call for
evidence relating to employees’ interests and entitlements in
the Bill would not exclude employees’ representatives or others
from giving evidence to the court, because it is within the
court’s remit to ask them to give evidence or for them to apply
to the court to give evidence and seek the court’s permission to
do so. They would obviously need to justify to the court why they
needed to give evidence, and this opportunity is allowed under normal
administration rules, and was included in the energy administration
rules made under section 411 of the Insolvency Act 1986. However, I
pledge not to detain the Committee with the finer

                           </div>points. When we draft the rules for a postal administration, we intend
to follow current best practice and include such
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000442">&#160;</a>

now turn to amendment 134 to clause 70. Subsection (3)
provides protection for creditors, and subject to the
interests of the creditors, the members—the
shareholders—of the company in postal administration. The postal
administrator is required to perform his or her duties in a way that
best protects the interests of those two groups so far as it is
consistent with securing the universal postal service. That creates the
proper balance between protecting the interests of the creditors and
shareholders and ensuring that the objective of the postal
administration is
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000443">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
134 would add an additional requirement on the administrator to protect
employees’ interests and entitlements. Effectively, it would put
employees on the same level as creditors and shareholders. Under our
proposals, Royal Mail’s employees will be shareholders in the
company and clause 70(3) already provides them with protection in
respect of their shareholding. However, to impose an additional duty to
protect the interests of employees above and beyond their interests as
shareholders would be inconsistent with normal administration practice,
and no such provisions have been included in any other special
administration regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000444">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not see
any compelling reason why a specific additional protection should be
given to employees in this way. As I have already said, I fully
recognise the concerns that would arise if the company was put in
special administration, but I am not convinced that there is a case to
make an exception to existing administration practice for employees of
a universal postal service
provider.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000445">&#160;</a>

138 would require the postal administrator’s statement on how he
or she intends to achieve the objective of post administration. The
amendment would require that statement to include how the postal
administrator intended to protect employees. As I have already
explained, it is not appropriate for the protection of
employees’ interests to be included in the objective of the
postal administration, so it follows that I do not consider that this
amendment should be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000446">&#160;</a>

will take amendments 139 to 144 together, although the hon. Gentleman
took each one separately. They seek to give employees a pivotal role in
deciding whether relevant transfers can go forward or be modified. As I
have already explained, part 4 is based on the presumption that Royal
Mail should be rescued as a going concern before a transfer is
considered. It is not right that relevant transfers can be potentially
blocked by employees if the administrator considers that relevant
transfers are the best way in which to secure the universal postal
service. That runs counter to the purpose of a special administration
regime. Such a role for employees is not included in any other special
administration regime.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000447">&#160;</a>

because Ofcom is the regulator of the Royal Mail. Therefore, Ofcom

services in terms of where the special administration sat in that. It
is more of a consultation of a technical nature. As I said earlier, no
such provision for consultation with employees exists in any other
special administration regime. We remain unconvinced that an exception

146, 147 and 148, while seeking to protect employees’ interests

relevant transfers. As we discussed under clause 9, the transfer of
pensions from one employer to another is not part of the TUPE process.
We can see no case for including pension benefits in this process when
it is not normal practice to do so. The pensions of those transferring
should be dealt with in the normal way. This may be through the Pension

                           </strong> I have listened carefully to what the Minister
said. I should like to refer to one or two—five or six—of
the amendments. My hon. Friends and I think that the amendments can
also strengthen the universal service provision through the extra
involvement of the work force or the work force representatives at
different places in this process. We think that potentially works with
amendment 129 and I will want to press that to a vote. Amendment 130
simply asks that the employees of the company be given notice of any
application for a postal administration order. The Minister said that
he did not think there was a case for it. We think that there is and we
would like to press that to a vote
too.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000453">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
131 asks for the court to have the power to call for evidence as it
thinks appropriate to ensure that the interests and entitlements of
employees of the company have been safeguarded. Again, we should like

			Column number: 717<a class="bkMark" name="Column717">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to press that amendment to a vote. Amendment 134 also relates to the
interests and entitlements of the employees. It is consistent with
other amendments that we have tabled and we should like to press that
to a vote too. Amendment 144 goes back to the point that I made when I
intervened on the Minister and relates to the need to consult with the
employees’ representatives. I fully understand the concept of
consultation with Ofcom, and my hon. Friends and I support the the
inclusion of the<strong> </strong>employees’ representatives in that
ongoing consultation process. In his response, the Minister said that
the consultation with Ofcom would be “of a technical
nature.” I am sure that the employees’ representatives
can cope with such a technical consultation process. I will press
amendment 144 to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000454">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 148 calls for there to be no detriment in pension provisions
on the transfer from the old to the new company. I will press it to a
Division as well. I am happy to withdraw the remaining amendments, on
the basis that we can vote on the six that I have
mentioned.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000455">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Obviously, I am disappointed that amendment 130 did
not meet with the Government’s approval, but can I take the
Minister back to the discussion that we had earlier on this afternoon,
where the words “reasonably practicable” appeared in
another part of the Bill? Could the Minister give some outline, in this
area, on what he considers to be “reasonably
practicable”—whether it is days or
weeks?<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000509">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Clause 68 sets out the process for the Secretary
of State or Ofcom to apply to a court for a postal administration
order. If a universal service provider is in financial difficulty then
there may be other interested parties, such as creditors who hold
floating charges over the company’s assets, who may have
appointed or been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver, or
may be entitled to appoint an administrator. Clause 68(2) requires the
Secretary of State or Ofcom to give notice as soon as reasonably
practicable to those persons if an application has been made for a
postal administration order. As a result, those persons will have time
to prepare, if they wish to do so, representations to the court when it
considers the Secretary of State’s or Ofcom’s
application.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000510">&#160;</a>

it would be possibly quite impractical to set a specific time period

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
69 sets up the powers of the court on receiving an application from
either the Secretary of State or Ofcom for a postal administration
order. The clause, as drafted, mirrors the position in a special
administration under the Energy Act 2004, which was passed by the
previous
Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000544">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for setting out the purposes of his
amendment. It seems inappropriate for the amendment to require the
Secretary of State to satisfy the court that a postal administration
order would be likely to be successful before it can issue one. It
would be for the court to decide, in the broadest sense, whether there
was a case for postal administration. In particular, the court would
have to assess whether the company was insolvent or whether it would
otherwise have been just and equitable to have wound it up. However, in
circumstances where the continued existence of an important national
service was at stake and where important decisions might have to be
taken as to what, if any, regulatory measures are necessary in order to
preserve that service, it would not be appropriate—it might even
be impossible—for the court to assess whether the objective of
the postal administration was likely to be
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000545">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
deciding whether to seek a postal administration, the Secretary of
State would have considered factors such as the likely impact of the
insolvency of the universal service provider on users of the service
and on the economic interests of the country. That is not the same as
in an ordinary administration, where the court may need to be satisfied
that administration is likely to succeed in order to prevent a company
going into administration where that would not, in fact, be in the
interests of the
creditors.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000546">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally,
it is worth bearing in mind that, given the obligations imposed by the
postal services directive, in reality there could be no question of the
objective of the postal administration failing to be met. The Secretary
of State and the postal administrator, each using their respective
powers, would need to ensure that a universal service continued to be
provided, whether by a rescue or, failing that, by a transfer scheme.
For those reasons, I am resisting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000547">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I hear what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but if
that is the amendment’s purpose, it is not quite the same thing.
If he wants the postal administrator to inform creditors about the
purpose of the postal administration, it could be done by sending them
a letter. In a normal administration, the administrator of a company
must perform his functions in the interests of the company’s
creditors as a whole, which is why there is a creditors’
meeting. In this, a special administration, the purpose is to secure
the universal postal service. So, while the postal administrator in
this regime has to exercise powers and perform duties in a way that
protects creditors and shareholders of a company, they only do so as
far as that is consistent with the statutory objective. In any case,
the adjudicator has to send a statement of his proposals to the
creditors, and obviously, that would reiterate the point that the
administration’s objective is to secure the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000586">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If Royal
Mail, as the universal service provider, entered special
administration, the imperative would rightly be on securing the
universal postal service—I do not know how many times I will say
that here. The postal administrator would work with Ofcom and the
Secretary of State, who would have powers to modify the regulatory
regime—which is why, with reference to the previous debate,
there should be a consultation with Ofcom—as well as having
powers to approve relevant transfers, where appropriate, and to support
the universal service provider financially to agree how best to secure
the universal postal service. Creditors would be protected as far as
possible, but they would not be the primary focus of a postal
administrator. There would, therefore, be no need for a requirement to
hold a creditors’ meeting, nor would it be appropriate for the
creditors to vote on the administrator’s proposals. As that
policy is consistent with those in other special administrations,
including the one in the previous Government’s Energy Act 2004,
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000587">&#160;</a>

listened to the Minister’s response, but there is much to be
gained from a creditors’ meeting. I have a range of views on
insolvency, which I will not bother the Committee with now, but a
dearth of information is provided to creditors, and there is a lot that
the administrator could do with creditors by calling such a meeting to
outline their aims and objectives and to state how they must comply
with the legislation. I want to press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000592">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Amendment 145 attempts to add fairness to the
modification of regulatory conditions in a postal transfer scheme. We
hope that the amendment will ensure that any such modifications are in
the interests of fair competition, and do not place the old company at

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 136
relates to clause 80. It seeks to ensure that should a privatised Royal
Mail go bankrupt, the Secretary of State is not tempted to act, or
permitted to act, in an arbitrary manner when assessing the regulatory
conditions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000663">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first point is to ensure that the Secretary of State considers
regulatory conditions, not just from the perspective of the individual
firm but from that of the postal market as a whole. In a recovery
period for a bankrupt firm, it will be necessary to ensure that new
imbalances in competition are not introduced as a result of unintended
consequences. As the Minister and I have pointed out, we have not yet
experienced a bankrupt Royal Mail, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 725<a class="bkMark" name="Column725">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and we hope that that never happens to any such service provider. It is,
therefore, speculative to suggest what actions may be considered, but
it is worth our while to debate it. We must insert a safeguard that
ensures that the Secretary of State considers the impact on all postal
operators and on the market as a whole.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000664">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The second
point gives an element of accountability to the process by obliging the
Secretary of State to make statements once a course of action is being
prepared. Amendment 136 would require the Secretary of State, before
giving effect to any modification or revoking any regulation, to have
considered the issue of fair competition and issued a statement to that
end. That would provide some opportunity to question, influence and
engage with the Secretary of State before an action is undertaken that
could have a major impact on the future of the industry.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000665">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That is a
theme on which we have tried repeatedly to engage the Secretary of
State throughout the debates. I am glad to say that the amendment
continues our attempts to introduce much more debate and reporting back
to Parliament from page 1 of the Bill onwards. I hope that the
Government see the good sense of the amendment, given that we are
debating what to do in the worst possible circumstances that the
industry, the company, the employees and the country might
face.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000666">&#160;</a>

                        <p>and
issue a statement that he considers that the modification or revocation
is in the interests of fair competition. Amendment 145 seeks to ensure

was subject<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000671">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I want to
reassure the hon. Gentleman that safeguards are built into the
procedure in relation to the power to modify regulatory conditions in
clause 80(7), because by virtue of clause 80(12) the Secretary of State
will be under a duty to exercise the power in a way that is objective,
transparent and proportionate and does not give rise to undue
discrimination. Those safeguards ensure that any interference is
necessary and proportionate.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000673">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In addition,
any decision by the Secretary of State under clause 80(7) or paragraph
8 of schedule 11 would have to be compatible with the European
convention on human rights—which I know has an immense amount of
support in Committee—and with principles of general
administrative law. That will ensure that the Secretary of State,
before modifying or revoking regulatory conditions, would have to take
account of all relevant factors including the need for fair
competition.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000674">&#160;</a>

also point out, however, that if we were ever to find ourselves in a
special administration scenario, foremost in the Secretary of
State’s mind—and, I hope, in the minds of all Committee

would also, of course, be our legal obligation under the postal

refer the Committee to subsection (2) under which the Secretary of

the company to which a postal administration order applies. Is that a
blank cheque? Is it a blank cheque that could be seen as encouraging
the failure of a privately owned business? Why do the Secretary of
State or the Treasury have no responsibility in the Bill to report
these grants or loans to Parliament? Finally, will he address this last
point on Report and bring forward a Government amendment compelling
either the Secretary of State or the Treasury to make this information
known to Parliament, preferably for debate—I would settle for
his ensuring that the information is “popped” into the

why a statement does not need to be laid in Parliament for any loan or
grant given to the company or any indemnity given to a postal
administration. A statement is required for any guarantee under clause
79. The requirement for a statement on any guarantee given is to
satisfy and comply with the current public expenditure rules in
relation to the giving of guarantees by Government to create
transparency, because guarantees would create future contingent
liabilities. That is why that is in clause
79.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000686">&#160;</a>

statement of such guarantees, but although I let the Minister off the

same question in relation to subsection (7), especially as
it covers the paying out of a guarantee. It creates the opportunity for
the Secretary of State to wait until after the end of the financial
year in which the guarantee has been paid before making his report to
Parliament. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why that is so, and why the
statement will not be forthcoming within, say, 28 days or 120 days?

constitute part of the report, because that is not particularly

                           </strong> As the hon. Gentleman has pointed out, I said in
my previous answer that I anticipated he would draw attention to the
fact that the guarantee has to be reported to Parliament, but not the
loan as set out 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 728<a class="bkMark" name="Column728">&#160;</a>
                           </div>under clause 77. The loan is not required to be reported under public
spending rules, but the guarantee is because it creates contingent
future liabilities. In any event, I reassured the hon. Gentleman that,
under clause 77, the loan would appear in the Department’s
annual reports and accounts and that any Minister is free to report to
Parliament about a
loan.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000695">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked again about the words “as soon as
practicable”. We have covered that issue before, and my views
have not changed. It is obviously important to maintain flexibility
when getting the relevant information together to make a statement
before Parliament. Under the Bill, the Secretary of State will be under
a greater burden than the previous regimes, because he would not
necessarily be subject to a court order and judicial review. He would
be subject to Mr Speaker, who we know takes the rights of Parliament
extremely seriously and is keener than ever to invite Ministers to
address
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000696">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
for being impractical after the end of the first financial year,
clearly a guarantee is a guarantee. Parliament would be aware of the
nature of that guarantee. It is important that, having given the
guarantee, which is effectively a draw-down facility under the postal
administration order, Royal Mail, or the provider under the postal
administration order, is free to draw down that guarantee throughout
the financial year. In some ways, it would be misleading and almost
unhelpful if every time the universal service provider under the postal
administration order called on the guarantee during the financial year,
the Secretary of State reported to Parliament—particularly if,
two months later, the provider drew down on the guarantee again. It is
much simpler to have the report on the financial year, so that when the
financial year is concluded—given that that is when accounts are
prepared—it is simpler for the Secretary of State to come to
Parliament to explain what has happened during that financial
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000697">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I seek a little clarification from the Minister, if
he does not mind. I trust that he is not saying that there would be no

                           </strong> I am certainly not saying that. I am saying that,
given that Parliament would know the nature of the overall guarantee,
it would be simpler for the Secretary of State to report at the end of
each financial year, so that Parliament knew during that financial year
what element of the guarantee had or had not been used by the universal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000699">&#160;</a>

remarks. In the Bill, it is not clear that the value of the guarantee
that has been drawn down—or the value of the guarantee and the
percentage drawn down—will constitute part of the report. I take
it from what the Minister has just said that the value will definitely
be there in the report in pounds, shillings and

                           </strong> No. I just wanted to see whether you wanted to add
anything, Mr Hood; one never knows. What I want to say is that these
amendments are minor and technical, and only serve to provide legal
clarity to the clear policy intentions of the clause. I hope that hon.
Members found my note to the Committee—it may have been the note
from the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills,
my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton—useful
in explaining the purpose of the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000708">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have already stated, the provisions in part 4 of the Bill are very
much reserve provisions. It is our hope and expectation that they will
never be used. It is, however, sensible for the Government to prepare
for future scenarios, even though we consider them remote. If a special
administration scenario were ever to materialise, it would be crucial
to ensure that—if required—swift and decisive regulatory
action can be taken to bring an end to the administration and secure
the ongoing provision of the universal postal service. Clause 80
provides for that. It enables the Secretary of State to modify the
universal postal service order made by Ofcom under proposed section 29
to amend proposed section 30, which refers to the minimum requirements,
and to revoke or modify any regulatory conditions that the Secretary of
State considers appropriate for, or in connection with, achieving the
objective of the postal administration. Before modifying the universal
postal service order or modifying and revoking regulatory conditions,
the Secretary of State must consult Ofcom and other interested parties
as appropriate. Any order to amend proposed section 30 is
subject to the restrictions contained within the European directive,
which provide an absolute backstop in terms of minimum
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000709">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
clause 80, further safeguards are provided in the form of parliamentary
scrutiny. The order must be subject to approval after being
made—it must be laid before Parliament after being
made—and ceases to have effect unless it is approved by a
resolution of each House within 28 days. The Government amendments make
it clear that the Secretary of State may not exercise his power to
modify the universal postal service order or amend proposed section 30
at any time before the postal administration order has ceased to be in
force. This makes it absolutely clear that the powers can be exercised
only in a scenario where the universal service provider is in danger of
entering insolvency proceedings and thus the universal service itself
is under
threat.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000710">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Secretary of State’s power to revoke or modify any regulatory
condition is similarly constrained in that it can be used only for, or
in connection with, achieving the objective of the postal
administration. This formulation, as opposed to the timing limitation
placed on the power to modify the universal postal services order or
amend proposed section 30, is important. Without it, it would
potentially mean that the provisions contained in clause 81
could not be used to secure any necessary funding for the postal
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000711">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will conclude by restating that the Government’s overriding
objective for the clause, for part 4 and indeed for the whole Bill is
to secure the future of the universal postal service. Members of the
Committee must be bored with my saying that. The special administration
regime is the final layer of protection. We do not expect to have to
use the powers, but a reasonable Government must be realistic and plan
for all scenarios.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000712">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> When I wrote to the hon. Gentleman and other
colleagues on 26 November 2010, I tried to set out clearly why the
amendments were required. I am disappointed that he feels that they are
unnecessary. I made it clear that it has become apparent that minor
technical amendments are needed to ensure the policy intention of
clause 80. He has asked why we have not amended subsection (7). He is
really asking why the amendments do not sunset the power to modify or
revoke regulatory conditions as they do with the other two powers, but
he thought he could confuse me. It is our firm intention that all the
Secretary of State’s powers in the clause are not open-ended.
The clause without the amendments, when read in connection with other
associated clauses in part 4, created circularity that would in effect
render the clause largely meaningless. The amendments solve this by
removing the references

                        <p>from
the powers to modify the universal postal service order and the power
to amend proposed section 30. The amendments now provide that the

                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the issue of circularity did not apply to subsection (7), which
concerns the power to modify or revoke regulatory conditions.
Furthermore, it is important that the reference

                           </strong> I rise to speak in support of amendment
135 and to continue a theme that I have developed throughout the
Committee, which is the protection of the universal service obligation.
As the Government are intent on privatisation, it is only right that
hon. Members do all we can to ensure the best outcome for employees
and, importantly, for consumers. The amendment would guarantee that, if
the universal service provider is subject to administration, the
Secretary of State must ensure that the universal service obligation is
provided at the level set out in clause
30.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000729">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
complete privatisation of Royal Mail brings forward an issue that we
have not been obliged to consider in previous proposals. In Committee,
I have made no secret that I am entirely opposed to that privatisation,
which may make me an old-fashioned socialist, but so be it. The full
privatisation means that Royal Mail could be declared bankrupt, which
concerns me greatly. I say that in the knowledge that the Government
have been kind enough to investors to pre-empt such an occurrence by
allowing the Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury, to
grant loans to achieve administration and, therefore, protect
investors. Although that may be good news for potential investors, I
doubt whether the taxpaying public are as happy about it. I am sure
that they are not enthusiastic at the prospect of public money being
pumped into a potentially failing private company. The Government
clearly accept the principle of underwriting a private venture with
public money. It was, after all, the same system that led to vast
public subsidies for rail companies. Recent events in the banking
industry have also led to taxpayers having to foot the bill for
irresponsible financial practices. It is safe to assume that the public
lack the stomach to embark on a course of action that could lead to
more of the
same.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000730">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
the event that Royal Mail’s new private owners find themselves
in a dire situation and a postal administration order is made, its
consumers should not receive a diluted universal service. I firmly
believe that the amendment would prevent that from happening. The
public would not expect a diluted service. If the Government are
required to underwrite a private business venture, the public should be
guaranteed the universal service for which the Government have
legislated and which the provider is contracted to
provide.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000731">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have, time and again in this Committee, rejected the argument that the
universal service obligation can be reduced by the Secretary of State
under any circumstances, and the circumstances under discussion are no
different. In fact, in the case of bankruptcy, it is even more
paramount that the universal service obligation is protected from any
interference. If administration occurs—of course, we hope that
it does not—it is reasonable to expect that it will be due to
irresponsible or faulty management decisions. It would not, therefore,
be fair to reduce a service that is relied on by so many due to events
that are far from their
control.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000732">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Although
postal services come in for criticism from time to time, many of our
constituents have come to rely on them. That ethos should continue
regardless of

of the Secretary of State to circumvent the settled view of Parliament
on the minimum universal service obligation requirements. It is often
said that two heads are better than one, so I wonder whether the
Ministers could put their heads together and consider a concession by
accepting the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000733">&#160;</a>

of State would need the ability to make swift and decisive changes to
protect the universal service. Furthermore, it is only right that the
Secretary of State has the ability to make any and all changes
necessary to protect the universal service. Perversely,
amendment 135 would restrict the Secretary of State’s
ability to protect the service, because it would restrict his ability
to make changes. Were he to decide that it was necessary to amend the
minimum requirements in order to secure the universal service and end
the administration, he could not do so in such a way that reduced those

or(b) the access point

will be brief. The Bill intends to provide post operators with the
power to detain packets and impose a surcharge when there has been
underpayment or no payment of the postage required. There are
circumstances when the underpayment is not the fault of the sender, but
is due to incorrect pricing procedures by the postal operator or the
point of access. The Bill, therefore, should be amended to specify that
an item may not be detained and no surcharge may be imposed when it can
be identified that the packet was incorrectly priced by the postal
operator or access provider. It is only reasonable to recognise that
there can be fault on either side, and if that incorrect advice has
been given to the consumer, then the consumer should not be penalised.
It is for that reason that we have tabled the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000771">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> The issue of surcharging is difficult. To have a
sustainable universal service, and indeed sustainable postal services
more generally, Royal Mail and other postal operators need to be able
to cover their costs. If an item of post has entered the system with
either no postage or insufficient postage, then before delivering that
item, the postal operator should be able to get the postage that should
have been paid, which is only reasonable. If that were not the case,
the whole system would start to unravel.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000772">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">New section
104A, which paragraph 35 of schedule 12 inserts into the
Postal Services Act 2000, clarifies the legal position. It allows
postal operators to detain post and packets, if there has been
insufficient postage paid, and to impose a surcharge. Once the correct
postage and any surcharge has been paid, the operator may no longer
detain the item. The new section also gives an oversight role to Ofcom
in respect of the extent of the surcharge and the period of time for
detention. The amendment seeks to prevent detention or surcharging in
two specific cases: if the postal operator itself prices the postage
incorrectly, and if the provider of an access point does so. I have
some sympathy with the idea behind that. If customers have paid the
postage that they were told in good faith should be paid, it does not
seem fair that the recipient should have to pay the extra postage or
surcharge.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000773">&#160;</a>
                        </p> 
                        <p class="tabbed">The
problem with the amendment is that it is difficult to see how it will
work in practice. I do not believe, therefore, that it offers a
solution. The fact is that there is no way to identify whether it is
the person posting, the postal operator or the Post Office that has
priced and revised the postage. Unless and until there is, I can see no
way to support the amendment, because it would not and cannot achieve
what it seeks to do. We need some joint work between postal operators,
the Post Office and consumer and user groups to understand how
widespread the problem is. My hon. Friend the Minister with
responsibility for consumer and postal affairs tells me that he has not
had any correspondence on the issue. However, that is not to say that
that is not an issue. <em>[</em>
                           <em>Interruption.</em>
                           <em>]</em> That may
well be because the people who are writing to him about the issue do
not realise that they have to put a stamp on the envelope. I understand
from Post Office Ltd that it received 300 complaints on that matter
between April and July 2010. To put that in context—it

                           </div>was a typical quarter year—it had more than
100 million label or stamp transactions across its counters
during that same period.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000774">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
the joint work that I referred to earlier finds that that is a serious
problem, those parties should then start trying to find a workable
solution between them that protects consumers, does not undermine the
universal service and does not impose huge burdens on those operating
in the postal services market. It may be, for instance, that the Post
Office needs to emphasise to staff the importance of ensuring that
customers are advised of the correct cost of postage. Legislation is
not the answer, so I invite the hon. Lady to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000775">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
47 clarifies that what is meant is the arrangements that have been
made, rather than arrangements that a new company might make—in
other words, the arrangements that are already in place, before the new
company starts making arrangements, so the danger of their being
watered down is much
less.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000807">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments seek to ensure that the work of the BPMA can go on following
the passage of the Bill, and that the heritage cared for by the
curators of the museum can be protected. The protection needs to be
strengthened, because the Bill moves us away from a situation in which
there is only one company, Royal Mail, that is owned by the Government
and that is clearly responsible for supporting and safeguarding our
postal heritage, to a situation in which there will be at least two
companies with different ownership models. There will also be the
potential for a privatised Royal Mail company to be taken over, perhaps
by foreign postal administrations or other companies with no intrinsic
interest in supporting Britain’s postal
heritage.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000808">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendments would strengthen the protection that the Bill gives the
archive and help to ensure that the present position is preserved. That
is why they matter. The BPMA is the leading resource for British postal
heritage. It cares for the visual, physical and written records of more
than 400 years, including stamps, poster design, photography, staff
records and vehicles. The BPMA is the custodian of two internationally
significant collections, namely the Royal Mail archive and the
collection of the former National Postal Museum.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000809">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The Royal
Mail archive contains records of the Post Office and Royal Mail from
the 17th century to the present day. It is designated as an outstanding
collection by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. It is a
public record equivalent in status to the material held at the National
Archives in Kew. Given the key role played by the UK in the development
of the post and the postage stamp, the collection is of world
importance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000810">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
museum collection includes some of Britain’s most iconic objects
and spans more than 400 years of postal history, innovation and
service. The objects range from the large, such as pillar boxes,
vehicles and sorting machines, to the small, such as hand stamps,
medals and badges. Alongside the items of historical note, there are
everyday things that illuminate the day-to-day work of a service that
has grown to become part of everyone’s
lives.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000811">&#160;</a>

the museum and archive collections form a unique record of a national
institution and offer a fascinating perspective on the history of
British society, design and industry. I am sure that the Committee will

would mean that the companies in the new postal market must at least

preservation and availability to everyone. The intention of this latter
duty to “have regard to” postal heritage is on a par with
similar requirements in the Bill relating to providing the universal
service and maintaining the post office network, because the collection
is of immense importance and
significance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000815">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Because I am so interested in the hon.
Lady’s proposition, I am keen to discuss amendments
46 and 47. She quite rightly said that I am hoping to arrange, if
members of the Committee want to join me, a visit to the BPMA in the
new year. I am particularly fortunate to have the excellent supporting
services of the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, who has this afternoon
shown his skill, dexterity and deep knowledge of and acquaintance with
the fine minutiae of the Bill. I am particularly pleased, because he is
the Minister with responsibility for museums, and he may well wish to
help me out during this debate and support my
response.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000816">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
46 and 47 and new clause 6 encompass the activities of the BPMA. It is
a charitable trust, which was developed by Royal Mail to manage the
heritage of Royal Mail, Parcelforce and the Post Office. In particular,
it acts as a place of deposit for the Royal Mail’s archives and
as a custodian of its museum collection. The archive and the museum
collection, while brought together in the BPMA, are distinctly
different. The archive contains material considered to be public
records, and there is, therefore, a legal requirement placed on Royal
Mail by the Public Records Act 1958 to permanently preserve selected
records. On the museum, Royal Mail voluntarily contributes to the
preservation of the collection in recognition of the company’s
heritage. There are, however, no legal requirements for it to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000817">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
46 and 47 concern the provision relating to public records in the Bill.
I will discuss those first and will then move on to new clause 6. The
Government have included the provisions in paragraphs 82 to 84 of
schedule 12 to ensure that the necessary consequential amendments are
made to schedule 1 of the Public Records Act 1958 to delete references
that will be made redundant by the Bill, and insert new references to
Royal Mail or the post office company as defined in clauses 2 and 6 of
the Bill. That will ensure that the companies’ records continue
to be classified as public records, where appropriate. Paragraph 84
also enables the Government to ensure that a Royal Mail company
continues to have responsibility for the preservation and maintenance
of its archives, which I agree are of historical importance—the
hon. Lady made something of that—even after a Royal Mail company
is no longer part of the public sector.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000818">&#160;</a>

                        </h4>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
emphasise that the provisions are consequential amendments, and that
there is no intention to redesign the policy on the keeping of public
records set out in the 1958 Act. Section 3 of the 1958 Act requires the
person responsible for the records to make arrangements to select
records, under the guidance of the National Archives, for permanent
preservation and safekeeping. Section 5 of the 1958 Act also requires
that arrangements be made to allow members of the public to inspect and
obtain copies of public records that are held. The 1958 Act is not
prescriptive about exactly how the records should be held or about the
public access arrangements. That harks back to the register that Ofcom
will have to keep, which has been mentioned. The body that looks after
all that, the BPMA, was set up by Royal Mail in 2004 to maintain the
company’s current and past public records. I understand that the
service it provides is considered to be over and above the requirements
in the 1958 Act. That is why we have included a provision that requires
the company to consult the National Archives before any significant
changes can be made to the current arrangements. It is implicit that in
conducting such a consultation Royal Mail should take into account what
National Archives tells
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000819">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not, therefore, consider amendment 46 to be necessary. It might be
that the intention behind it is to ensure that existing arrangements
for the archive are maintained, but I do not believe that that is
appropriate, not because I want to see change but because I see no
reason why a privatised Royal Mail should be subject to more stringent
requirements than those set out for public bodies in the 1958 Act. That
would make no sense. What is important is that the archive is preserved
and maintained and that the public have access to it, in both cases to
at least the standard specified by the 1958 Act, and the provisions
will ensure
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000820">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
47 changes the tense in paragraph 83(1) of schedule 12, but not the
sense. The schedule refers to arrangements that a Royal Mail company
“has” made, and it is clear that that means the
arrangements that a relevant company has put in place—in this
instance, those made through the BPMA. Changing “it has
made” to “that have been made” does not affect
beneficially or detrimentally the intention of the
clause.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000821">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Turing
to the museum collection and new clause 6, I agree that the collection
held by the BPMA is important, but there should not be a statutory
requirement on companies in the new postal market to have regard to the
museum “as a social obligation.” I assume that the new
clause is meant to cover Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd, rather than
other companies in the sector—for example, TNT or UK Mail. I see
no reason why such companies should have an obligation towards a
collection that has nothing to do with their history. I can find no
precedent in legislation for a statutory duty of that kind in relation
to any other privatisation of public companies or organisations. Even
as a publicly owned company, there are currently no statutory duties on
Royal Mail in relation to the museum collection but, despite that, it
already, as a company that operates on a commercial basis, pays due
regard to the maintenance of the museum. It was instrumental in setting
up the BPMA as a charitable trust to maintain and preserve the
collection. Royal Mail continues to recognise the importance of its
heritage,

Mail brand and all the history that comes with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000822">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
fully expect Royal Mail, once it is privatised, to continue its
approach, noting how much importance and value is in the Royal Mail
brand. Post Office Ltd will obviously continue to have an interest in
the museum collection, as some of the artefacts and material apply to
its business, but there is no advantage in dividing the collection into
separate post office network and Royal Mail collections. I expect Post
Office Ltd to work with Royal Mail, so that the heritage of their
previous and continued association is not lost. We may wish to continue
this debate when we visit the BPMA—I hope hon. Members will join
me and the hon. Lady—no doubt with light refreshment. Prior to
that meeting and that discussion, I hope that the hon. Lady will
withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000823">&#160;</a>

although my colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton is
resisting it for perfectly valid reasons, the debate has enabled us to

closely with partner museums? The Blists Hill museum at Ironbridge
gorge has a whole display set up in one of the recreated streets in
partnership with the BPMA, which shows what the postal service has done
over the past 200 or so years. It is very important in the cultural
sector to understand that the BPMA also works with partner museums and
together they generate interest in our
heritage.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000825">&#160;</a>

Consumer and Postal Affairs and Minister with responsibility for

therefore understand the importance of co-operation between museums,
which we are keen to encourage. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
highlighting that partnership working. I visited the BT
archive two or three years ago, which showed me the importance of
keeping an archive intact. The Association of Business Historians does
a very good job in helping businesses to keep their archives. Another
business archive that I have visited is HSBC’s private business
archive, which is kept in immaculate condition. Basically the reason
why I rose to speak was to invite myself on the trip with the hon. Lady
and my hon. Friend. I would love to see this collection. I will do all
that I can for so long as I remain the Minister with responsibility for
museums to help either the hon. Lady or my hon. Friend secure that
important

                           </strong> I did say that it was the civil partner of the
queen who was somewhat confused, and had picked up the script from a
dwarf in Snow White. The ugly sisters sidled up to the young,
“royal male” Prince Charming and were looking down on him
and smothering his face in their false bosoms saying, “We run a
high street chain called ‘Ugly Fashion’, and we could
offer you a very good price for using our shops as access points. Yes,
of course, customers would have to drive into the multi-storey car park
and pay an extortionate fee, drag themselves across the town and pay a
few pounds’ worth of parking fine if they do not get back in

as the clock chimes and the Bill is passed, the public will see the
fine Post Office coach turn back into a pumpkin. They will see the fine
steeds pulling the coach played by supporters of the Government rat on
their fine words about preserving post offices and scuttle away back
into the sewers. No glass slipper is left. It has been given to
PayPoint by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the right
hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr Duncan Smith). There
is no reason for the young, “royal male” Prince Charming
to seek out Cinderella, the Post Office. There are just thousands of
ordinary people throughout the land searching in vain for their local
post offices that were snatched from them by the ugly sister
enterprises. As for the fairy godmother Minister, he disappears in a
puff of smoke before the angry mob can accuse him of destroying their
post offices. There is no happy ending. On that note, there is a need
to listen to the public before the Bill goes through and destroys our
post office

                           </strong> On a point of order, Mr Hood. I want to take this
opportunity to thank you and your co-Chairs Mr Amess and Miss Begg for
the way in which you have chaired our proceedings. That has enabled us
to make fantastic progress and to ensure that the Bill has been
properly scrutinised in good order. I am sure you agree that we should
thank the Committee Clerks, the doorkeepers and the police, who have
given us such professional support even when we fired them up this
afternoon.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000886">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We must also
thank the Hansard Reporters, who have somehow managed to record our
deliberations. I am not quite sure what they will make of the hon.
Member for Llanelli’s final speech, but we are all looking
forward to reading it. I am not sure whether they have my pronunciation
of “Posstcomm” or “Postcomm” quite right,
or our different pronunciation of “schedule” and
“schedule,” Mr
Hood.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000887">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
want to thank all the officials who have helped me in preparing the
Bill, and who have helped me and the Under-Secretary of State for
Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend the Member for
Wantage, to take the Bill through Committee. I particularly want to
thank my hon. Friends for their fantastic contributions to our debates.
Never have so many people shouted “no” so loudly in the
right places. I also want to thank Opposition Members; a special place
goes to the hon. Members for Llanelli, for Ochil and South Perthshire
and for Angus. I am sorry that we were unable to debate new clause 5;
perhaps the hon. Member for Angus will delight us with that on
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000888">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
ranged over a number of topics, and the hon. Member for Cumbernauld,
Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East and I have had some interesting
exchanges over  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 744<a class="bkMark" name="Column744">&#160;</a>
                           </div>Deutsche Post. Indeed, I have tried to ensure that we had a geographical
tour, with Argentina, Chile, Thailand, Mexico, Australia and New
Zealand entering our debates. We have also had exchanges on Santa
Claus, Christmas cakes, the perils of Cross Hands roundabout and my
good friend the sorting machine called Sue. I have tried to christen
some of our amendments; we have had “War and Peace”, the
Gordian knot, Red Bull, our own Sebastian Vettel—who was
detained in airports once or twice along the way—and the
Francois Greeff amendments. I am tempted to take the Committee on
another world tour and mention Taiwan in particular, but perhaps I
should not. I will save it for Report. I hope that, having given the
Bill a good going over, we can report back to the House and get other
hon. Members to join our
deliberations.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000889">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Further to that point of order, Mr
Hood. I should like to thank everybody who has been helpful, including
the representatives of all parties on the Committee, who have been good
humoured. Thank you to the officials, who extended a courteous
invitation to us, the Opposition, to contact them, and to our Chairs,
particularly Mr Amess, who took the lion’s share of the
chairing, as well as Miss Begg and you, Mr Hood, for your patience and
indulgence. I thank the <em>Hansard</em> writers for putting up with all
manner of scribbled notes. I should particularly like to thank some of
the people with whom we have had helpful discussions, including the
Communication Workers Union, Consumer Focus, the BPMA, the National
Federation of Pensioners and the National Federation of
SubPostmasters.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000890">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
have had a full discussion and we have indicated along the way that we
may wish to return to certain areas on Report and pursue them on the
Floor of the House. We think that there are some unresolved issues,
particularly in relation to privatisation, the universal service
obligation, the lack of definition of access points, and the need for
stronger parliamentary scrutiny and involvement in future proceedings.
On that note, I thank you once again, Mr Hood, for your help and
support and draw my arguments to a
close.<a class="bkMark" name="10120953000891">&#160;</a>
