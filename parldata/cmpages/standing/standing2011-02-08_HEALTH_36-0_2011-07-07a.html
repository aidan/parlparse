                  </strong> Indeed I am winding up the debate, Mr Gale, and I
do not intend to detain the Committee too long. I have just one or two
points and will seek to keep my remarks relevant to clause
55.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000019">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One point
that we debated this morning—the hon. Member for Pontypridd made
a big deal about it—was about the private sector being involved
in providing 5% of the health care in the NHS under the
previous Government. The hon. Gentleman might like to know that the
2004 NHS improvement plan stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“by
2008, independent sector providers will provide up to
15%”—<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000581">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
think that that is three times 5%, if my mathematics is
right—<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“of
procedures on behalf of the
NHS.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000582">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
rather undermines the argument that the hon. Gentleman made this
morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This,
too, might be of interest, particularly to the hon. Member for
Leicester West, because she may well have written it. In 2006, Patricia
Hewitt
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“I
am not going to lay down from Richmond House how many hospitals, how
many beds, how many staff of each grade and each qualification, what
kind or how many different providers there should
be.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000583">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
suggests that Patricia Hewitt, too, was not fixated by the
figure.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000024">&#160;</a>

                  </span> The Minister refers to something
that I said this morning. I take it that he would not contest the fact
that, whatever the projections—whatever was written on a piece
of paper somewhere—the reality, as David Bennett, whom I quoted
this morning, stated, is that private sector involvement accounts for
only about 5% of NHS spend at the moment, in
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000025">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> What I would not do is make the
dogmatic assertions that the hon. Gentleman made this morning and the
argument that he made in general about the 5% figure. It has been
contradicted even by the improvement plan published by the Labour
Government, and that contradiction has been reinforced by a subsequent
Labour Secretary of State at the Department of
Health.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
shall move on to another point that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He
was wondering about and questioning exactly how Monitor’s
powers, duties and functions had been changed. It is obvious to
Government Members that they have been changed fundamentally as a
result of the listening exercise and the Future Forum’s
recommendations. Although the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and
hon. Friends want to be in denial on that point, we have had
considerable third party endorsement from organisations that have
responded to the listening exercise and the Future
Forum’s recommendations; they also seem to think that what we
have accepted from those recommendations significantly changes the core
functions of Monitor as they were proposed
initially.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
help the hon. Member for Pontypridd, may I tell him this? Probably the
most important thing is that Monitor’s main duty will be to
protect and promote the interests of people who use health care
services. It will seek to achieve that not by promoting competition,
but by promoting the economic, efficient and effective provision of
health care services that maintain or improve quality for patients.
That is the crucial issue—improving quality for patients and
enhancing and improving outcomes. That is ultimately the most important
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000028">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Commissioners are part of the jigsaw and the
equation. They will obviously have a crucial role in improving the
quality of care, promoting equality of care and improving and enhancing
outcomes, but they will not be doing it on their own; many other
aspects of the NHS will be working to that end. The core principle of
these modernisation plans is to put patients at the centre of care, to
involve them, give them choice and drive up improvements in quality of
care, with the knock-on effect of improving and enhancing
outcomes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000033">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
competition role will be clearly limited  to addressing
anti-competitive behaviour. The hon.  Member for Pontypridd
made what I consider to be the bizarre point—from their
reaction, my hon. Friends seemed totally baffled—that there was
no difference between promoting competition and anti-competitive
responsibilities, as if they were one and the same thing. I have to
tell him that they are fundamentally different. In a moment, I shall
explain why.

               <p class="tabbed">Monitor
will now have new duties to enable the integration of health care
across health care services and between health care and other services,
including social care services—something that we debated at
considerable length on Tuesday. There will be a new duty on Monitor to
involve those who use health care services and other members of the
public in its work, and to ensure that it takes appropriate clinical
advice in carrying out its functions—another matter that we have
discussed at length on previous amendments. It will be explicit on
Monitor that it should not exercise functions in order to increase or
decrease the market share of any type of provider, whether public or
private. Monitor will not, as originally proposed, have the power to
allow one provider access to another provider’s
facilities.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000035">&#160;</a>

not, for example, choose to disapply a particular set of licence
conditions in a certain group of providers to make it easier for them
to enter the market. Similarly, when considering with the NHS
commissioning board how services should be specified and bundled for
the purposes of the national tariff, Monitor will not be able to take
account of whether specifying the services in a particular way would
encourage competition per se.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000040">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One question
started with the hon. Member for Pontypridd and opened up for the right
hon. Member for Rother Valley: where are the amendments to put the
principles and rules about co-operation and choice on to a stronger
statutory footing? We do not need amendments 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 336<a class="bkMark" name="Column336">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to the Bill to give the Co-operation and Competition Panel and the
Principles and Rules for Co-operation and Competition more bite. The
CCP will no longer report to the Department of
Health, which can choose whether to accept the panel’s
recommendations. The fact that the rules will in future be set and
enforced by an independent body will in itself put them on to a
stronger footing.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We would
expect the rules and principles to be embedded in the system by way of
regulations, guidance and licence conditions under the Bill. The
current rules would apply, including principle 7, which the right hon.
Gentleman referred to. The aim is to provide as much continuity to the
NHS as possible. We will ensure that the status of principle 7 is
clarified when the principles are next updated. In anticipation of the
right hon. Gentleman’s asking when that might be, I should say
that we expect that to follow Royal Assent.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On the
question of whether the CCP but not the Office of Fair Trading should
continue to approve mergers, including foundation trusts, I am sure
that we all agree that complex decisions on mergers should be taken by
those with particular expertise. The current system is extremely
cumbersome, with a very low threshold as to foundation trusts needing
to seek CCP reviews. That disadvantages foundation trusts
vis-à-vis the private sector, which I do not think the right
hon. Gentleman would wish to continue.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In the new
system, the OFT will review mergers but with a far higher threshold,
meaning a streamlined process for foundation trusts. However, the OFT
would always seek Monitor’s advice before making a decision on
foundation trust mergers. Therefore, the expertise of the OFT on
mergers will be combined with Monitor’s sector-specific
knowledge.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000047">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
two key issues I raised earlier, which the Minister failed to address,
were about competition and how much has changed. If there is confusion
among the Opposition and the public about whether competition will
apply more under the Bill, the Minister has to bear a degree of blame
because he has repeatedly added to that confusion. I will simply pick
out two small quotations from his previous contributions. On 15 March,
he said, patronising us as
ever:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“May
I just explain this first? As NHS providers develop and begin to
compete actively with other NHS providers and with private and
voluntary providers, UK and EU competition laws will increasingly
become applicable.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report,

718.]<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000584">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>We
understood that, but on many other occasions he has said, “The
Bill does not extend the application of EU competition law.”
Again with respect to my hon. and learned Friends, that is a lawyerly
point that does not disapply what he first said—that because
there are more providers in the market, competition will apply
more.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister went on to try to answer the  questions about how much
of the Bill has changed; again, if we are confused, it is with a degree
of legitimacy. Paragraph 5.27 of the Government’s
response to the NHS Future Forum, which addresses the extent of
Monitor’s powers, states
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000062">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“these
changes preserve the core tenet of the Health and Social Care Bill:
that properly regulated competition… has the potential to
improve the efficiency… of public
services”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000585">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
core tenet of the Bill is using competition to improve public services.
Why are Ministers and Government Members so coy about fessing up to
that being what you believe? Not you, of course, Mr Gale. The
Government believe that competition writ large across the Bill has the
capacity always to improve the provision of services. We suggest that
health care is different from utilities and other sectors, so extra
constraints are
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000063">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
his response a moment ago, the Minister chose to try to explain, as he
put it, the difference between promoting competition and preventing,
restricting or distorting competition, which I still contend are one
and the same; all that I said about the Competition Act 1998 shows that
to be so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000064">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A moment ago,
the Minister said that, under the provisions, Monitor could no longer
“choose to disapply a particular set of licence conditions in a
certain group of providers to make it easier for
them to enter the market.” Monitor would never have been allowed
to do that, because it would be anti-competitive to shift the terms of
engagement and to unlevel the playing field.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If Monitor
were actively to disallow conditions to allow private providers to
enter the market, it would be an anti-competitive act in the eyes of
any competition lawyer. I contend, therefore, that the Minister has
placed another straw man before us. It is not an adequate description
of the
change.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000066">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> But in a previous question Dr Bennett was asked
whether the OFT should have a role in assessing mergers, and he said
that that was an interesting question. Up to now, the Co-operation and
Competition Panel has been the principal body that looked at mergers.
That is what it has done over the past year or so since it was created.
It has looked at six, and it is still looking at them. In future, it
will be the OFT—not even Monitor—that does so, which in
itself is interesting. If we have a sector-specific regulator with the
same powers as the OFT, why is the OFT looking at the issue? Why do we
not simply let the OFT regulate the health care sector? It does not
make any sense.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000069">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Gale. Mindful of your ruling, I will
ask a series of specific questions about the schedule and I will not
seek to rehearse the argument that we have just had. Schedule 8
establishes the rules and regulations governing how Monitor will be
made up and set up, and the arrangements for remuneration and staff. It
is an important schedule given the significance of Monitor, which, as
we have said, is the key point in the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000100">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The first
three paragraphs relate to the establishment of the board, and we
welcome them. It is a shame that the Government did not recognise that
such a board with a proper constitution ought to be extended right
across the legislation and applied at an earlier juncture to the
commissioning consortia or the commissioning groups, because this is an
excellent description of how a board should work. The schedule provides
for non-executive directors, chairmen and proper rules and procedures
to govern the activities of the board. We are delighted to see that the
Government have moved on from thinking that such arrangements ought to
apply only to Monitor and are applying them to all the other
commissioning groups. We congratulate them on doing so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000101">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 6
relates to the non-executives: the Government have properly decided
that they should be part of the board of Monitor. The provision relates
particularly to payment to non-executive members. Will the Minister
provide some illustration of the cost of the non-executive members of
the board, and the sort of individuals that the board will look for to
fill those posts, given the fact that the nature of Monitor’s
role is changing even as we speak, and that there is a shift from
having to worry only about competition law to having to worry, now,
about the clinical efficacy or otherwise of services, and the extent to
which greater application of competition law might interfere with
patient interest through derailing integration?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000102">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 7
deals with staff. Amusingly, it states that the Secretary of State must
be consulted before any agreements are reached between Monitor and
staff about their levels of pay. That is interesting, given the points
about micro-management. Will all Monitor’s staff members have
their salaries run past the Secretary of State
annually?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000103">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">More
important, what about the amendments on NHS pay, conditions, pay scales
and agreements that we tabled previously? Will the Secretary of State
be bound to have regard to existing NHS pay scales when allowing

               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 9
is about Committees. It states that committees of Monitor can have
members who are members of Monitor—staff members of Monitor or,
I presume, non-executives or executives of Monitor—and
non-staff, non-executive members of Monitor. I wonder whether the model
that we should be thinking of, to understand how that might work, is
the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. There are
technical appraisal and various other committees with members and
non-members, to provide clinical and other expertise that does not sit
within that special health authority. Is that the model that is being
considered?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000105">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Is
the model changing, in the Government’s view, given that
Monitor’s responsibility will be extended to cover considering
clinical matters, such as whether competition will impinge on valuable
integration? How many such Committees does the Minister envisage
Monitor will require, and what cost will they incur? Given that there
may now be more of them, can we expect the cost of Monitor to be
increased in the fabled revised impact

somewhere in the Department of Health there is a document called
“Design of Monitor” just as there was one on the design
of the National Commissioning Board, which, apparently, we are not
allowed to see, but which confirms, as my hon. Friend said, that
3,500 people are to be employed by the NCB—stripped
out of the 8,000 currently employed in a similar role, I presume, in
strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. That raises a
further question: what happens to the other 4,500 people? Will they be
made redundant at the end of the process? We do not know that; nor do

concept, especially given the Government’s views about
profligacy and the need to be prudent in all borrowing. It would not be
illegitimate to ask of a Government who are so keen on making sure they
are prudent with borrowing in the

number of
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000116">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">First,
schedule 8 makes various provisions about Monitor, including on its
membership, procedures, borrowing and accounts. The hon. Member for
Pontypridd asked a number of questions about that and when I have given
an overview of the schedule, I will address them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000117">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The schedule
details the membership and appointment of the chair, chief executive
and other members of Monitor, including making provision about the
suspension of non-executives or the chair from office. The provisions
would ensure fair treatment in such cases. Paragraph 6 requires Monitor
to pay non-executive members such remuneration and allowances as the
Secretary of State decides. It also enables Monitor to arrange
pensions, allowances and gratuities for non-executive or former
non-executive members. The Secretary of State would have to approve any
such
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000118">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
7 enables Monitor to employ staff on such pay and terms and conditions
as it decides. However, before making such decisions Monitor would have
to secure the approval of the Secretary of State to its policies on
those matters. This provision would enable Monitor to secure the staff
it needs; and the Secretary of State to ensure that the general
remuneration, allowances and terms and conditions that Monitor offered
its staff were appropriate.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000119">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph 8
makes provision in relation to anyone who is appointed as chair of
Monitor and who is already covered by a public
sector pension scheme under section 1 of the Superannuation Act 1972.
The Minister for the Civil Service would be able to determine whether
that person’s service as chair of Monitor would count as years
of service for the purposes of that pension scheme. The provision in
this paragraph would address the possibility of someone with an
existing public sector pension entitlement being deterred from applying
for or taking the position of Monitor’s chair because the
pension arrangements would be disadvantageous compared with other
employment
options.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000120">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
9 gives Monitor the power to appoint committees and sub-committees and
to pay remuneration and allowances to committee members who are not
members or employees of Monitor. Paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 make
provision about how Monitor will exercise its functions, including that
it must, and can, act effectively, efficiently and economically.
Paragraph 10 allows Monitor to regulate its own procedure. Those
various provisions will ensure that Monitor can make effective
arrangements to discharge its functions and duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000121">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am going to answer the hon. Gentleman’s
question. If he would like to intervene after that, I shall be more
than happy to let him do so. Paragraph 13 creates a contingency
provision that could be used to address any short-term cash flow
problems that Monitor might encounter. Paragraph 14 allows Monitor to
obtain and compile information to take informed decisions on exercising
its functions. That could include commissioning or support for
research. Paragraph 15 gives Monitor the power to do anything it needs
to do in order to exercise its functions. Those provisions will enable
Monitor to discharge its functions
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
17 concerns the accounts of NHS foundation trusts. It requires Monitor
to prepare annual accounts that consolidate the annual accounts of all
foundation trusts. The paragraph also enables the Secretary
of State to direct Monitor to prepare a set of interim
accounts consolidating the interim accounts of all foundation trusts.
Paragraph 18 requires Monitor to prepare its own annual accounts in a
form with the content and using methods and principles directed by the
Secretary of State with the Treasury’s approval. That provision
will ensure that Monitor’s accounts meet appropriate standards
and are in line with those for other non-departmental public
bodies.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Paragraph
21 ensures proper accountability by Monitor. It provides that Monitor
must publish an annual report on how it has exercised it functions,
particularly on how it has promoted economy, efficiency and
effectiveness in the use of its resources. Monitor will need to lay a
copy before Parliament and send a copy to the Secretary of State. The
paragraph also provides that Monitor must furnish the Secretary of
State with further information if he requires it. Paragraph 22 requires
Monitor to respond to any recommendations about the exercise of its
functions made by parliamentary Committees, as the right hon. Member
for Rother Valley mentioned. Those are sensible provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000126">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I would like
to respond to a number of points before concluding. I will do so in no
particular order. First, the hon. Member for East Lothian asked if
Monitor would be covered by freedom of information law. The
straightforward answer is
yes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Pontypridd raised a number of issues that I will go
through now. One question was about borrowing money. He asked how much
money Monitor will be allowed to borrow and in what circumstances.
Monitor will only be able to borrow temporarily by overdraft. That is
to be done only with the specific consent of the Secretary of State,
including regarding the amount to be borrowed. As the hon. Gentleman
will know, Monitor can already do that. We are not talking about a new
proposal to give Monitor permission to gain access to funding if it
needs to by overdraft; it can already do so under the existing
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Gentleman also raised a number of issues about pay. As he will
appreciate from our detailed discussion of the matter in the earlier
phases of the Committee, the Secretary of State will approve the policy
for pay and remuneration, but not each individual’s pay and
remuneration. That clearly would be nonsense. I suspect he knew that
when he asked the question, because it is quite clear that the
Secretary of State will need to do so.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000129">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Easington asked specifically about Monitor. If it is helpful
I can give him some idea of the process regarding non-executive
members. The appointments will be competitive; this also relates to a
point that was raised about equal opportunities in employment. The
answer is, of course, yes, because we will naturally abide by existing
employment law and plans, where there is no discrimination on race,
gender and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000140">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">With
non-executive board members, it will be a competitive, open recruitment
exercise, where the Appointments Commission will administer and ensure
that the appointment process follows guidelines from the Office of the
Commissioner for Public Appointments. It applies not only to
non-executive members of the board, but to everyone, when I say that
people who take up employment at whatever level within
Monitor—this is what will be looked for—should be
suitable candidates for the positions. They should be of the highest
calibre to be able to contribute positively to the operation of the
organisation and the fulfilling of its functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000141">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is a
generalised answer, but it is no different from the way that people are
employed in other professions. It is crucial that one has relevant,
top-quality people with the expertise and experience to fulfil their
organisation’s

helpful. There is one question that has not been answered, and one that
has not been answered fully. I welcomed the Minister’s support
for equal opportunity legislation as it relates to employment law, but
I actually asked whether he would go further and promote diversity by
encouraging applications for membership of the board from groups that
are often excluded. I also asked whether, given that the committees do
not have to be approved by the Secretary of State, there will be a
limit on how much Monitor can spend on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000149">&#160;</a>

first point by saying that equalities duties will apply. On the second
question about how much money Monitor can spend on the committees, the
answer, off the top of my
head—<em>[</em>
                  <em>Interruption.</em>
                  <em>]</em> I will be careful. The
answer is that Monitor wants to provide an effective and efficient
service at a cost-effective price without cutting corners. There will
therefore not be a ceiling per se, but we would expect Monitor
to have the taxpayer’s interests at heart and to ensure that it
does not spend excessively to fulfil the functions that it wants
to accomplish. As such, it would be inappropriate for
me—apart from giving a broad overview of the principles that I
would expect Monitor to embrace—to start trying to micro-manage
down to the last detail how Monitor will organise that aspect of its
committee system. The primary rule must be efficiency and effectiveness
in carrying out its duties with due consideration of the interests of
the taxpayer in getting value for money. I urge my hon. Friends and
Opposition Members to agree to the
schedule.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000150">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I thank the Minister for his attempts to answer
lots of our questions, but he raised as many as he answered—let
me run through a few of them. I asked a specific question about the pay
of Monitor staff. Given that it will be the Secretary of State, not
David Bennett, who is ultimately responsible for agreeing the terms and
conditions of the staff in Monitor—I mean collectively and not
individually—would he have to pay due regard to the existing
terms and conditions and payment scales of NHS workers, or even those
in the civil service? The Minister said that the Will Hutton inquiry
would be looking at pay scales and trying to set a metric on a maximum
of 20 times the pay of the lowest-paid worker within an organisation.
We will have a sector-specific economic regulator that employs a lot of
people regulating the NHS, so the pay differential between the NHS and
Monitor is as relevant as that between the individuals working within
Monitor, many of whom I imagine will be paid much more than people
within the NHS, especially its lowest-paid workers. That is why I ask
whether the Secretary of State will need to look at the NHS pay scale
when he approves
Monitor’s.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000151">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
second point was about cost. The Minister gave us an interesting update
on the cost of Monitor. Previously he told us that it would be between
£40 million and £130 million, but we now learn that it is
going to be between £50 million and £80 million, which
again gives rise to several points. Even if it is the lowest
amount—  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 346<a class="bkMark" name="Column346">&#160;</a>
                  </div>£50 million—it is still two and a half times
Monitor’s current costs. If the figure is £80 million,
that is four times the present cost. That is a lot of money.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000152">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If the
Government are to be believed, they have changed the provisions of the
Bill so that Monitor’s responsibilities are increased to mean
that it takes account of quality, clinical and medical considerations,
impact and integration. However, as David Bennett said in his evidence,
Monitor does not have the staffing for those new duties, so it beggars
belief that the Government have increased its responsibilities and yet
reduced its costs from £130 million to £80
million.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000153">&#160;</a>

made a big meal of this last time round and history is beginning to
repeat itself. As he well knows—the hon. Member for Leicester
West certainly knows this—the figure we used last time was a
range. The £130 million figure was at the top of the range and
was based on other sectoral regulators. We have been able to refine our
figures since then and we have come up with a much lower range. I would
have thought that Opposition Members would have welcomed the fact that
the figure at the top of the new range is significantly lower than the
previous top
figure.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000154">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me clarify another thing. Although I answered the question about the
Secretary of State and his involvement in pay, let me provide further
clarification for the hon. Gentleman. The Secretary of State’s
decisions on pay will, of course, be informed by both NHS and civil
service pay
scales.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000155">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This is a really important point. The Minister
is trying to give the impression that we are not creating a vast new
bureaucracy. Estimates of Monitor’s cost under the previous
Government are put at about £21 million a year. Now, even taking
the Minister’s very lowest revised estimate, it will cost 10
times more. Moreover, we are dealing with an unknown quantity. We do
not know how many lawyers Monitor will have to engage for consultancy
if, as we suspect, European competition law applies, so the higher
limit might well be correct.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000157">&#160;</a>

OFT will be involved and we have no idea what the ultimate cost of this
huge reorganisation will be. The Minister says that Labour Members
ought to be encouraged that the cost has gone down to a mere £80

               <p class="tabbed">The key
reason why we are not encouraged is that the new figures are further
evidence that the Minister is making it up as he goes along. We have
now heard from Wallace and Gromit that the cost last
time—between 
<div class="columnNumber">

out of thin air, because it was predicated on the cost of other

point, but I am slightly concerned that the paragraph might imply that
Monitor will not have to give evidence in person to the House or to
Committees of both Houses. Perhaps it implies that it will have to
respond only in writing.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000163">&#160;</a>

struck me as an over-sensitive person. I said at the time that the
paragraph was so self-evident that the question did not warrant a
response, but if he feels aggrieved, I shall correct that now. The
paragraph means exactly what it says. Monitor will need to reply in
writing to any recommendation made by a Committee of either House. I
would have thought that that was
self-evident.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000164">&#160;</a>

appreciate that at this time of the afternoon the hon. Gentleman wants
to go for a cheap laugh. At the moment, as I am sure he
knows—and as the right hon. Member for Rother Valley knows, as a
distinguished former Chair of the Health Committee—if the Select
Committee produces a report that recommends a number of things, that
report goes to the Department of Health, and the Department will then
respond to it in writing, usually within three months, unless the time
period has changed. I cannot see any particular difference here. Given

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
helpfully told us that the Government are looking at the NICE model for
how the proliferating committees of Monitor could be organised, as we
suspected. That also gives rise to a few questions, so I have a number
of recommendations for the Government. Again, what does he anticipate
that the costs will be? NICE committees tend to be extensively
populated with real experts—leaders in their clinical
disciplines. They are standing committees that meet on an ad-hoc basis,
and they are very costly. I suggest that he needs to consider the costs
carefully.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000168">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Secondly—this
is a recommendation—the Minister is
considering NICE as a model, and of course, NICE has lay members on its
committees. It has, in effect, members of the public, expert patients,
serving on those committees and providing the patient perspective. If
Monitor is now to consider clinical issues, the Minister may need at
some point to amend the legislation to reflect the fact that it might
be desirable to have, in addition to non-execs, lay members, or perhaps
that can be captured in the
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000169">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
NICE has, in order to ensure once more that it is accountable to the
public, given that it makes decisions about the availability of
medicines—at some level, Monitor will also be engaged in that
type of discussion—a citizens panel. It meets annually—in
fact, I think it might even meet twice a year. It is very extensive
and, I would imagine, very expensive. The Minister might also want to
consider that in the next iteration of the

of the questions that arose in the debate are based on a fundamental
misconception of the Government’s policy—that we are
promoting competition for its own sake. That is not the case, as the

the interests of people who use health services, it will not be the
role of Monitor to promote it. I hope that that clarifies the basic
premise within the context of the

               </p>
               <p>However,
we propose removing the reference to Monitor achieving
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000191">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>We
agree with the Future Forum that competition is a means, not an
end—a means of improving quality of care and increasing choice
for patients. We acknowledge that the language of “promoting
competition” has been misconstrued and has not communicated
fully the Government’s intention that competition should be
pursued only in the interests of patients, never as an end in
itself.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000192">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Under
amendment 148, Monitor’s amended duty will focus instead on the
outcomes that we expect Monitor to secure: economy, efficiency and
effectiveness in the provision of services. Monitor’s licensing
and pricing functions and its roles addressing anti-competitive
behaviour and supporting commissioners in securing continuity of
services would be to that end. Monitor’s amended duty would also
make it clear absolutely that efficiency improvements must not be at
the expense of
quality.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000193">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
removal of the words “promoting competition” from
Monitor’s main duty creates a need for the Bill to set out in
other terms what Monitor’s competition role will be. It would
not be sensible to leave the position ambiguous, so amendment 149
introduces a duty for Monitor to act with a view to preventing
anti-competitive behaviour where it is against the interests of NHS
service users. Anti-competitive practices, such as restricting the
supply of services to existing providers, might, for example, deny
patients the choice of receiving treatment in their own
home.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000194">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
151 is consequential on the reformulation of Monitor’s main
duty. Clause 56(3)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000195">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor

of…services”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000594">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Amendment
148 will make that part of Monitor’s main duty, so subsection
(3) will no longer be needed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000196">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Opposition
amendment 40 also seeks to remove “promoting competition”
from Monitor’s main duties. The common ground between us is
broader than that, because amendment 40 also seeks to create a duty for
Monitor to
promote<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000197">&#160;</a>
               </p>

and integration within health services in
England”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000595">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
Government fully support the principle of that amendment. We will not
break up or hinder integrated care; we will extend and improve it. But
to achieve that, we need to look across the system as a whole. We need
to establish the appropriate role for each of the main players in
developing integration and collaboration. The drive for more integrated
services must come from
commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000198">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Future Forum’s “Choice and Competition” report
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000199">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“If
commissioners want to commission integrated care they will only succeed
in doing this by creating a new market in integrated care services and
stopping the current commissioning of episodic services from different
NHS
organisations.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000596">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>That
is not to say that Monitor does not have a role in the NHS’s
development of integrated services, far from it, but the role is to
support and enable the commissioning of integrated services. It is not
for Monitor to decide which services should be integrated, nor to
promote integration at all costs, irrespective of what works for
patients. That is why Government amendment 149 requires Monitor to act
with a view to enabling integration of health care services where it
would improve quality of care, access for patients or
efficiency.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000200">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
want to draw the Committee’s attention to one particular point
on the Government’s proposed integration duty on Monitor in
amendment 149. The amendment relates not only to integration across
health care services, but to integration between health care and other
relevant services, including social care services. It might help the
right hon. Member for Rother Valley, given his question on Tuesday, if
I say now that those services could include pharmaceutical services and
dentistry.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000201">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
40 does not cover integration between health care and other services,
but I hope Opposition Members agree that it is an important aspect of
what we are trying to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000202">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
amendment 40 refers to collaboration, which is not provided for by the
Government amendments. We have, however, separately proposed a further
requirement for Monitor to have regard to the importance of providers
co-operating with one another. We are due to debate that amendment,
Government amendment 156, when we reach clause
58.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000203">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the light of my comments, I hope Opposition Members will agree that
Government amendments 148 and 149 and the Government amendment on
co-operation between providers, which we will discuss when we reach
clause 58, reflect the principle of amendment 40. On that basis, I ask
Opposition Members not to press their amendment but to support
amendments 148 and 149 and the minor and consequential amendment
151.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000204">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
removal of “promoting competition” from Monitor’s
main duty needs to be reflected in other places in the Bill. As a
result, we have both Government and Opposition amendments to clauses 67
and 101, and a Government amendment to clause 100. The difference
between the Government and the Opposition amendments is what should
replace the references to promoting competition.

                  </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that question,
because throughout our deliberations on the Bill she has made plain her
deep concern about, and interest in, reducing inequalities in health
care. The evidence comes from a range of sources. First, it comes from
practical experience of what is going on in the health service from
those who work in the health service, the PCTs, the SHAs and the
providers, where they seek to reduce inequalities and to improve and
enhance patient care. On top of that, a range of academic studies are
carried out by people who have a particular interest in the subject, to
monitor what is going on and to ascertain not only where improvements
have been made but how, they believe, such improvements should be
achieved.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000208">&#160;</a>

assessment in the same way as we did last time. Given that the hon.
Lady has raised that point, however, I will make sure that her views
are fed in. As to whether it is possible to publish the bibliography, I

evidence on inequalities applies to the effects of competition on
quality; again, the evidence comes from what is happening on the ground
in the NHS, and policy making from a range of organisations and
individuals who are particularly concerned about, and interested in,
this important area. From the introduction of choice-based competition

                  </strong> I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for that
very good intervention. It highlights the fact that research is
important in driving the debate forward and finding new solutions to
problems. However, one must not lose sight of the fact that what is
happening on the ground and what is being delivered is just as
important, if not more so. That is what most directly affect patients.
Both sides of the equation are important, but what is happening and how
the improvements are reflected in the care of patients is crucial. If
that is not happening  in some parts of the country or with
some providers, they must learn from the experience of places that are
improving health outcomes, reducing inequalities and increasing the
quality of care, so that the all the NHS in England can
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I return to
the amendments. Government amendments 158, 159 and 161
replace references in clause 67, 100 and 101 to preventing or promoting
competition, with formulations reflecting our view that Monitor could
still have a role in addressing anti-competitive and potentially
anti-competitive behaviour that acts against patients’
interests. Opposition amendments 43 and 45 remove the references in
clauses 67 and 101 to either preventing or promoting
competition, but they replace those references with requirements to
ensure and promote “collaboration or
integration”.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Opposition
amendment 44 to clause 67 also removes the provision that the Secretary
of State’s regulations on procurement by commissioners could
cover competitive tendering. That provision should not be removed. We
have rules governing competitive tendering to ensure that it achieves
value and that patients’ interests are protected. We will need
such protections in future, as Professor Ham noted when giving
evidence:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000220">&#160;</a>

               </p>

concluded that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000221">&#160;</a>

develop a mainstream of integrated

               </p>
               <p>Our
view is therefore that it would be inappropriate to create, as
amendment 45 would do, an explicit power for Monitor to require
providers to do or not to do certain things to promote collaboration or
integration. At best, it would create uncertainty about where the onus
lay for driving integration, and at worst it would create confusing
requirements for providers, with contracts requiring one thing and
licence conditions another.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There has
been much discussion, including by the Committee in March and by Future
Forum, about whether, and if so how, competition and integration sit
side by side. The Government have always been clear that they are not
mutually exclusive. Future Forum took the same view, stating:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
have also heard many people saying that competition and integration are
opposing forces. We believe this is a false dichotomy. Integrated care
is vital, and competition can and should be used by commissioners as a
powerful tool to drive this for
patients.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000601">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
referred earlier to the fact that to achieve a focus on integration of
health care services, we need to look across the system. We do not
think that the Secretary of State’s regulations on procurement
practice are the  best mechanism for getting commissioners to
develop integrated services. That is why the Government tabled
amendments 73, 74 and 117, which we debated earlier, that create new
and strengthened duties on integration directly on commissioners.
Hence, we think it unnecessary to make explicit provision for the
clause 67 regulations to be able to cover integration and
collaboration.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
therefore ask Opposition Members to withdraw amendments 43, 44 and 45
and to support Government amendments 158, 159 and 161. I also ask them
to support Government amendment 189, which is a
consequential, minor amendment that ensures consistency by noting that
the definition of “anti-competitive behaviour” to be
applied in these clauses is the same as that set out in the amendments
to Monitor’s main role and duties.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000225">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The group of
amendments we are discussing includes Government amendments 150 and
152, both of which raise very important issues. Government
amendment 150 relates to patient and public involvement. The
NHS Future Forum has set out an ambition for achieving genuine patient
and public involvement at all levels of the system. We share that
ambition, and the purpose  of the amendment is to strengthen
those requirements in relation to Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000226">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members will be aware, there are a number of requirements set out in
the Bill for Monitor to consult a range of organisations and persons on
the proposals. Those would include, for example, consulting each
relevant licence holder, the NHS commissioning board, clinical
commissioning groups, the Care Quality Commission and HealthWatch
England on modifications to standard licence conditions; and clinical
commissioning groups, licence holders and others it thinks appropriate
on the national tariff.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000227">&#160;</a>
               </p> 
               <div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 354<a class="bkMark" name="Column354">&#160;</a>
               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">We have also
put in place, through clause 178(4), arrangements with HealthWatch
England for it to provide Monitor with information and advice about the
views of patients and the public, and about the views of local
healthwatch organisations. That is an important provision, in that
HealthWatch England can advise Monitor independently of both the
Department and the CQC, and Monitor must respond in writing to
HealthWatch England on its
advice.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000228">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
as the NHS Future Forum said, involvement of patients and the public
needs to go further than that. The Government want to ensure that
patient and public involvement is embedded at every level of the health
care system. We want patients and the public to be involved in the
development of proposals and in the wider work of Monitor, not just in
responding to one-off consultation exercises. We want the dialogue
between Monitor and patients and the public to be ongoing and
meaningful. That is why we are proposing to make  this clearer
in the Bill by placing, in amendment 150, a specific duty on
Monitor and strengthening its responsibilities in that
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000229">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We recognise
the importance of the relationship between HealthWatch England and
Monitor, and do not want to change that. However, we feel that this
specific duty is needed for Monitor to be truly able to take account of
the views of patients and the public in its
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000230">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
amendment 152 responds to another of the four key themes adopted by the
NHS Future Forum: clinical advice and leadership. The Committee has
already debated our proposals for strengthening clinical advice and
leadership in relation to commissioning. However, as the Government
noted in their response to the Future Forum’s report, Monitor
will also need advice from  a range of appropriate
professionals. Government amendment 152 would place a new duty on
Monitor to obtain appropriate clinical advice in the discharge of its
functions. That duty would be consistent with those  on the NHS
commissioning board and on clinical commissioning groups. In exercising
the duty, Monitor would be required to seek advice on clinical matters
from a range of relevant health care professionals as appropriate. That
could range from, for example, advice from expert medical committees or
the Royal Colleges to develop the tariff, or an individual clinician on
a specific disease or condition-related issue. I therefore commend
amendment 152 to the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000231">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will briefly mention Government amendments 154, 155, 191 and new clause
5. They are technical amendments, consequential on the changes proposed
in the other amendments in this group, which provide necessary
definitions and tidy up the drafting of this part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000232">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s listening exercise highlighted that there was
misapprehension about the role that Monitor would have under our
modernisation plans. The Future Forum recommended greater clarity about
Monitor’s role. That is why we need clause 56 in the Bill. The
clause sets out the main duties of Monitor. It provides that, in
exercising its functions, Monitor must do so in a way consistent with
the performance by the Secretary of State of his duty to promote a
comprehensive health service. For clarity, the clause specifies that
Monitor’s role is in relation to the provision of services.
Where a provider of services buys goods in order to deliver
services—for example, prostheses to be used in hip 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 355<a class="bkMark" name="Column355">&#160;</a>
                  </div>replacements—Monitor’s role would only be in relation to
the service. It would not be required to do anything in relation to the
supply of goods to the provider of that
service.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000233">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On
Monitor’s duties, the Government amendments propose that
Monitor’s main duty would be to protect and promote the
interests of NHS users. Monitor would achieve that by using its
functions—including licensing and pricing—to promote
economic, efficient and effective provision of NHS services. It would
work alongside other organisations to secure sustained and improved
quality of care. It would have the statutory powers needed to address
anti-competitive and potentially anti-competitive practices that could
act against the interests of NHS users. Last, but by no means least, it
would also work with commissioners to promote integration of health
care services and between health and health-related or social care
services, where that was in the best interests of patients. That is a
clear role for Monitor, in line with the recommendations of the Future
Forum.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000234">&#160;</a>

with an apology, in advance of what will be a relevant but long speech.
As the Minister rightly said, this matter goes to the heart of what has
happened over the past few months—the unprecedented pause and
“listening exercise”. Like the Minister, I would like to
proceed thematically, covering the Government’s core claim that
they have fundamentally changed Monitor from last time round.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000239">&#160;</a>

will not be surprised that I do not agree with that. In fact, I agree
with my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd that this is a series of
smoke and mirrors. By going through each set of amendments, which
supposedly change promoting competition to anti-competition and
supposedly promote integration and patient and public involvement, and
by addressing the clause stand part debate, I hope to show why 
the amendments do not fundamentally change the Government’s true

Government have not answered is what Monitor is for. Why do we need
Monitor? I suggest that this is a policy in search of a problem. It is
not about identifying an issue and then establishing the best way to
tackle it, but about changing the NHS and remodelling it. I will not go
through this again, Mr Gale. You were lucky to miss out on my very long
speech on why health is different from gas, electricity and the
railways—that is, not just because it is a different type of
good, but because it is more complex, there are far more varied
providers and there are asymmetries of information.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000246">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why do we
need an economic regulator? There are two possible answers. The
Government’s answer would be that they need Monitor to protect
the NHS from the full force of competition law. But it is the
Government’s own Bill that guarantees the full force of
competition law on the NHS. We have never said that these 12
clauses change what competition law is out in the wider economy, but
they enshrine it in primary legislation on the NHS for the first
time.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000247">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Southport said, the NHS in this country and health services
across Europe have tended to be protected from the force of competition
law that is applied in other areas, because they are not seen as
undertakings. Hospitals are seen not as undertakings, but as social
bodies because they have social aims and objectives. The Bill and the
Government’s policy make it more likely that providers, and
possibly also commissioners, will be counted as economic
undertakings.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000248">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
example is getting rid of the private patient cap so that hospitals can
generate and make money. That is likely to mean that they will no
longer be counted as social bodies and entities, but as economic
undertakings because they are specifically going out to make money. On
15 March, the Minister, who was recorded by the fabulous <em>Hansard,
</em>said
that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000249">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“in
a future where the majority of providers are likely to be classed as
undertakings for the purposes of EU competition law, that law and the
protections it offers against anti-competitive behaviour will
apply.”—[<em>Official Report, Health and Social Care

I am interested that the hon. Lady asks why we need Monitor. It was a
Labour Government who created Monitor in the first place. As she was a
special adviser to that Government at the time, she can probably
explain why Monitor was
created.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000251">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Monitor currently regulates foundation trusts; it
is not an economic regulator. It ensures that the trusts are
financially viable and that they have the right governance bodies and
structures in place. Its functions are totally different from those of
an economic regulator. Perhaps we can have another discussion in a
different forum about that. The Government are setting up something to
protect themselves from their own policy.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000252">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
reason why the Government might set up Monitor is that they need some
other body with all these powers to drive competition into parts of the
NHS because they believe that it cannot reform itself. There are many
different opinions about the role of competition and choice. As I have
said in this Committee before, I support competition where there is
evidence that it improves care for patients and value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000253">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Why can
clinical commissioning groups not decide where competition may or may
not improve quality, value for money and efficiency? If the Government
want that, why are they setting up this huge complicated body? They are
doing it not for the reasons that they are now claiming, but because
they believe that the NHS cannot reform itself. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Pontypridd said, there are Government Members who believe
that competition is the way to drive changes in public
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000254">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However,
a full market is not the way to do that. There are real consequences of
competition that have to be managed. For example, when care is shifted
out of hospitals, it has to be managed and it must be done following
clear standards—we call them targets—to make sure that
people do not suffer. If Government Members do not want such duties
managed and they want a full market, which is what many of them do
want, why not have the courage to argue for that? Instead, they are
tying themselves in knots trying to pretend that they are not doing
something when they really
are.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000255">&#160;</a>

completely

                     </span>
                  </strong> No. In other countries, such as Spain, cases have
gone to the courts to see whether competition law should apply, and it
was decided that it should not. We decided that we would have a body
that could look 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 358<a class="bkMark" name="Column358">&#160;</a>
                  </div>at such issues. However, Monitor is being set up in a context where it
will be forced to act because of the Government’s legislation. I
believe that amendment 148 would not fundamentally change
Monitor’s role or the context in which it works.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000257">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Government
amendments 149, 158, 159, 161 and 189—I think I have got those
right—would, as the Minister said, purport to remove parts
relating to promoting competition, instead substituting that
“anti-competitive behaviour” would be prevented. New
clause 5 attempts to define anti-competitive
behaviour:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Anti-competitive
behaviour” means behaviour which would (or would be likely to)
prevent, restrict or distort competition and a reference to preventing
anti-competitive behaviour includes a reference to eliminating or
reducing the effects (or potential effects) of the
behaviour.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000606">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
put it mildly, I am not convinced that there is a huge difference
between promoting competition and preventing anti-competitive
behaviour. I am aware that we have discussed this matter before, but I
want to pick up on one phrase that the Secretary of State used in
evidence to the Committee, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Pontypridd has also mentioned. The Secretary of State said that we were
moving from an “ex ante intervention” to an “ex
post examination”. At that point, I wished that I had listened
to my mother all those years ago and studied Latin—as opposed to
attempting German, not being very good at it, then giving it
up—because I would have known what he meant.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000259">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Essentially,
as hon. Members know, he meant a change from “before the
event” to “after the event”. However, what does
“after the event” mean now? It may mean moving from
looking out there, thinking, “We’re going to promote
competition in advance”, to doing so after the event—but
after what event? We have our services as they are now. Many services
will be set up that could easily, under this legislation, be considered
anti-competitive—for example, if one hospital serves people in
an entire city, such as my own.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000260">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In future,
many hospitals will look to develop vertical integration, which is a
terrible piece of policy jargon. A hospital could have a lot of
diabetes patients turning up in A and E having a severe episode, if
that is the right phrase. The hospital might decide, “To deliver
the best quality care for our diabetes patients, we want to run some
community nurses who help patients manage their conditions better by
helping them to take their drugs properly, encouraging them not to eat
TUC birthday cakes and advising them to take
exercise.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hospital
might then decide, “Well, we should also run some diabetes
testing in the pharmacy”—I do not know whether you have
had such a test, Mr Gale, but after pricking your finger, they can tell
whether you have diabetes. I am trying to describe this in a way that
makes it real. The hospital, therefore, has decided,
“We’re going to provide all those services in a certain
area.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000262">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">However, a
pharmacy—Lloyd’s Pharmacy, for
example —could then say, “Hang on a minute. We
don’t want you coming in here, sweeping up all the diabetes
testing for the whole of Leicester”, or a private company that
runs GP appointments might say, “We don’t want you
running our diabetes nurses”. They would challenge what was
happening.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000263">&#160;</a>

that be an example of something anti-competitive? The problem is that
the Government will not provide such examples, and they will not tell

are some lawyers on this Committee. We are debating whether the Bill
changes everything; my hunch is that if it is as big as it is, with
that many clauses introducing competition, it will. If the Minister has
not asked for independent legal advice, he is being remiss in his
duties. We need to see and understand that advice, including what the
difference is between anti-competitive and competitive
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000268">&#160;</a>

extent to which competition law may well apply. Further to the point
that she just made, does she agree that it would be fundamentally
remiss of the Government not to have sought legal advice in order to
understand—I will take the example that she used—whether
a vertically integrated set of services between hospitals and primary
care might be viewed under competition law as collusive or cartel
behaviour—which would, therefore, be
anti-competitive?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000269">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. As we
discussed in the previous Committee, it is interesting that many
concerned providers are taking legal advice about what the Bill might
mean. I again ask the Minister to clarify once and for all whether
legal advice has been taken on the impact of the Bill on how
competition law is applied within the NHS. More specifically, is it
likely that both providers and commissioners will be more likely to be
considered as economic undertakings? Has he asked for that
advice?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000270">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
move on to Government amendment 149, which states that Monitor must act
with a view to enabling health services to be provided in an integrated
way and to enable health services to be integrated with social care
services. During the previous Committee, Opposition amendment 481 would
have required Monitor to  enable collaboration and integration
between health and social care. The Government voted against it. Our 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 360<a class="bkMark" name="Column360">&#160;</a>
                  </div>new amendments 40, 43, 44 and 45 would again seek to guarantee that
Monitor promotes collaboration both within health
services and between health and social care. I should state for the
record that we do not agree with Monitor and how it is being set up. We
will vote against it, but if it does go through, this is our way of
trying to ensure that integration really
happens.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000271">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the Minister said, Opposition amendments 43 and 44 would amend clause
67, which addresses procurement. What the Minister said about that was
interesting. Clause 67 will give the Secretary of State the power to
issue regulations to impose any requirement on how the NHS
commissioning board and clinical commissioning groups procure services.
That is a huge power. But the Minister said that procurement is not the
way to promote integration, which amazes me. If he argues that it is
possible to promote both competition and integration, why would a body
procuring services not want to promote integration? I find that
astonishing.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000272">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister is right that members of the Future Forum and other consultees
say that integration and competition are not necessarily always
mutually exclusive, but that is not to say that there are not tricky
balances and trade-offs. It is not simple and straightforward to decide
whether, as in my example of diabetes care, something represents
integration, because others, possibly including the new head of
Monitor, might see it as monopolistic and anti-competitive. The
Government need to recognise that such issues are not simple and
straightforward.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000273">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
move on to Government amendment 150, which addresses patient and public
involvement. It is important that I read out the amendment, because the
Minister made a big thing of how patient and public involvement is now
at Monitor’s
heart:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Monitor
must secure that people who use health care services, and other members
of the public, are involved to an appropriate
degree”—<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000610">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>I
have underlined those words, because that is where the emphasis
is—<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“in
decisions that Monitor makes about the exercise of its functions (other
than decisions it makes about the exercise of its functions in a
particular
case).”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000611">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
amendment really says that it is up to Monitor to decide whether it is
appropriate to involve patients and the public. Although Monitor will
involve patients and the public in the exercise of its general
functions, it will not involve them in specific cases, such as where a
hospital or any other service might be behaving
anti-competitively.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Patients and
the public want to be involved in decisions about services that affect
them, but that is not what the amendment says; it says that they will
be involved only with discussions on Monitor’s functions. Many
Members who have issues with hospital units, if not whole hospitals,
community services or other services in their constituencies, will find
that the issues end up being considered by Monitor without patients and
the public having a say. That is a great
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000277">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  </strong> Indeed, it is a very woolly phrase. I am not
convinced. I think this is a sop and a way to put a provision in the
legislation without actually involving patients and the public in any
significant decisions. That is why I am concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As my hon.
Friend the Member for Pontypridd mentioned, there are wider concerns
about the accountability of Monitor itself. Amendment 488 to the
original Bill provided that Monitor’s board should meet in
public and hold public annual meetings, especially as it is spending up
to £130 million of taxpayers’ money a year. The Minister
has apparently revised that figure down to £80 million, but it
remains to be seen whether that is accurate. It is worrying that we are
still unclear about how a body with such
power—Monitor—will be held to account, particularly if it
is to make such important decisions about services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Does
that mean that Monitor will have to include clinicians only in
decisions about exercising its general functions, or will it involve
them in specific cases? When Monitor looks and says, “This
hospital or service is behaving anti-competitively,” will it
involve clinicians in that individual decision, or will they simply be
broadly involved on the board? That is an important question.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000287">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Finally, I
want to make a broader comment on Monitor’s general duties as
part of the clause stand part debate. A big concern that people have
voiced is about Monitor’s role in designating services. I
remember very long conversations about that in the first Committee
proceedings, when the Minister made some interesting comments about
which services would or would not be designated. The
Opposition’s concern was that the process was wholly opaque. It
should not be up to what appears to be an unaccountable body to make
decisions about which services will and will not fail. In paragraph
5.45 of their response to the NHS Future Forum report, the Government
say:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000288">&#160;</a>

spinning about ending bail-outs, but if they do so, lots of hospitals

               <p>We
have no information about these trusts. The information is extremely
important, because one of Monitor’s key functions is designating
which services must continue to provide care for patients and the

               <p class="tabbed">I conclude by
asking the Minister a series of questions about the so-called failure
regime. He says that he will present his proposals on the failure
regime in time for Report, or at least that any amendments will be
tabled by then. Will the failure regime be ready for Report stage,
which I assume will be in September? Will it include the failure of
whole NHS trusts? Will it include how to deal with the failure of
individual district hospitals which are part of those trusts? Will it
include how to deal with the failure of individual units or individual
wards? What criteria will be used to come up with a solution? Who will
be involved in setting those criteria? Will there be independent
verification of the criteria? Crucially, who will administer the
failure regime? Will that Monitor do that? These are all difficult
questions. They need to be answered.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000300">&#160;</a>

they will keep their jobs. They are not getting the GPs and the other

the work undertaken during the exercise to pause, listen and reflect
and the report of Future Forum, it seemed on the surface that
substantial changes had been made. I thought that perhaps the many
hours we had spent in Committee had not been completely wasted.
Although the Government would not accept a single Opposition amendment
or make a single concession during the course of the original Committee
stage, perhaps they had had a chance to reflect on some of the 
<div class="columnNumber">

comment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000314">&#160;</a>

Bill—more than 80 clauses— is devoted to competition. The
Bill changes the architecture of the NHS; in itself, it exposes the NHS
to European competition law. In truth, as the chief executive of
Monitor said in evidence, echoed by others, we do not know the precise
implications. We do not know the effect of the private sector
organisations that are going to use the mechanism and may feel
aggrieved, having been heavily lobbied and advised of a potentially
lucrative market. They are not philanthropic; their purpose is to make
profit for shareholders. Our concern is that this element of the

crucial.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000316">&#160;</a>

was booed by that audience, but Opposition Members are not full of
confidence that the Secretary of State is sincere and genuine about
wishing to address our concerns. There is a body of similar opinion,
not only among the trade unions, which Government Members sometimes
dismiss, but among eminent specialists, not least Professor Sir Roger
Boyle. He has had a chance to study the Government’s proposed
changesarising from the Future Forum report, and he feels the changes
are completely unjustified. Sadly, he has indicated that in protest he
will stand down as heart tsar, which is an important

the face of it, it is a positive change that I am sure everyone would
support, but having thought about it and scrutinised it a little more
closely, I believe the new duty is sufficiently vague as to prompt this
question: if we remove Monitor’s function of driving
competition, what is Monitor actually for?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000321">&#160;</a>

to change with David Bennett at the helm of that vast new

reference to health inequalities, raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Oldham East and Saddleworth, or the NHS constitution, which
protects the 18-week target. There are major inconsistencies, as well
as duplication and overlapping of duties with, for example, the Care

is very similar to the new duties for Monitor, so why create a quango
that will cost—at the lower end of the Minister’s
estimates—£240 million over the five-year life of a
Parliament? Bearing in mind that the Government have cut funding for
public health observatories by 30% this year and 30% again next year,
that is a huge sum. The observatories are vital organisations that we
desperately need to tackle health inequalities and to make the health
and well-being boards function effectively by assessing a properly
compiled evidence base on which to plan health interventions. To spend
huge sums on a monolithic creation when there are questions about

               <p>I presume that that

competition and preventing anti-competitive behaviour? That is not pure
sophistry; it is an important question. According to the amendment,
Monitor must also exercise its functions with a view to enabling NHS
health care services to be provided in an integrated way where that
would improve quality or reduce inequalities of access or outcomes; a
similar duty applies to the integration of health with social care. The
difference between the general duties set out in the clause to prevent
anti-competitive behaviour and to promote integration needs to be
clarified. We need further explanation from the Minister. The wording
and context seem to imply that preventing anti-competitive behaviour is
somehow more proactive, because that can be enforced, whereas
integration needs only to be enabled, but even then it must be
justified against tests of quality and
inequalities.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000332">&#160;</a>

enterprise found it extremely difficult under existing competition

successful—it has cut waiting lists tremendously compared with
the previous NHS provider—having a body that was able to prevent

recall if it was the hon. Member for Stafford or one of his colleagues,
but questions were raised about the number of private patients or the
role of the private sector. I took the trouble to look up the
information, and I found that in 2003-04 the private sector treated
less than 1%—0.7%—of NHS patients and in 2009-10, which
is the last year for which figures are available, the figure had risen
to only 2.14%. The number of patients treated is therefore not a huge

capacity—for example, for cataract and hip and knee replacement
surgery. I am long enough in the tooth to remember very long waiting
lists, when it was not uncommon for people to wait more than 12 or
sometimes 18 months or longer for such operations. Capacity did not
exist in the NHS despite our best efforts to go overseas. I worked in a
hospital for some years and served on the management board of one in
the north-east. We made strenuous efforts to recruit from countries
that had surplus staff, particularly of skilled nursing staff. As a
short-term measure, we recruited quite a number of staff in South
Africa and the Philippines because it took several years for medics to
come through the training schools and nurses to come through nursing

to consult, but that the CCG, or whatever body is involved, is not
obliged to take the advice. A similar issue arises with regard to

implications for our treasured national health service, the way it
operates, its architecture and because of the consequences of exposing
it to the icy blast of competition law.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000351">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Again, I come
back to my original question: w hat is the point of Monitor? What is
its raison d’être? Why do we need to invest so much time
and effort on creating this monolith when there are other mechanisms
that we can use? If we are to believe the Minister that the duties are
being scaled down massively, how much money will

                  </strong> Some interesting points have been made and I did not
altogether disagree with the last sentence of the hon. Member for
Leicester West, but I feel that we are making slightly heavy weather of
this. The poor old Minister was accused of being in favour of properly
regulated competition; I am not sure whether he should have been in
favour of improperly regulated competition or non-regulated
competition. I understand that the Labour party is largely in favour of
regulated competition of some kind and the difference is probably worth
discussing, but it was not discussed in those terms. The argument was
put across in a very black and white
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000353">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">May
I explain very quickly how I see it, how I think the Bill presented its
dangers and how I think those have been remedied? There is a real
threat of not having a sector-specific regulator. The hon. Member for
Leicester West was slightly disingenuous in saying that there was not a
real reason for the Labour party to set up a competition and
collaboration panel. The downside of not having a sector-specific
regulator is that clinical services will be exposed to the same sort of
regime as non-clinical services are. There are the Official Journal of
the European Communities rules and there is the right of appeal to the
Office of Fair Trading. The contracting process will be complex and
laborious; it will squeeze out small local and innovative suppliers; it
will be subject to constant legal threat from the big firms, which know
how to operate in this environment; it will not secure best value for
the NHS; and the main thrust in terms of commissioning would simply be,
as it is now, a case of acute hospitals complying with the rules rather
than securing best
value.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is why the BMA says in response to the latest
changes:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000355">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“We
believe the measures to narrow Monitor’s powers over
anti-competitive behaviour (Clauses 56 &amp; 67) are acceptable. In
areas where it has been agreed that choice and competition are
appropriate, there need to be rules to prevent anti-competitive
behaviour. These are currently exercised by the Office of Fair Trading
(OFT) and we believe it is more appropriate for those powers to be
exercised by an exclusive health
regulator.”<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000636">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>The
BMA then goes on to endorse the dilution of Monitor’s role.
There is a quite clear perception there that if there are to be
multiple providers—nobody has said that there will not
be—and if there is to be any sort of regulation, it is best done
by a specific health regulator. That is why there is a case for having
either Monitor or the Co-operation and Competition Panel, but having
something rather than nothing. We can discuss whether we want to have a
Co-operation and Competition Panel that stands alone or whether we want
it to be incorporated into Monitor, and we can discuss how big Monitor
should be. The point about having a sector-specific regulator was well
made, however, not by me but by the BMA. That is how it sees the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000356">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The Bill has travelled a fair way from its
beginnings, and I think it was originally envisaged—the Minister
may wish to state otherwise—that this regulator would deal with
price. Effectively, however, Monitor is now gradually morphing itself
into the sort of thing that the Co-operation and Competition Panel was
going to be. I think we need a sector regulator, and if people think
differently, they can argue with the BMA if they want to.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
real threat that many of us saw in the original legislation was that
commissioners who were sensibly trying to commission services in an
integrated fashion might, it seemed, be trumped by an appeal to an
organisation, Monitor, which had a simple mandate to promote
competition. Many people saw that as disruptive. We know that sometimes
competition can be disruptive, and we know equally that it can be
beneficial. I, like the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth,
would look at the evidence, and there is evidence to support different
views. In certain contexts, competition may be appropriate and improve
services; in other contexts it may not. I have explained the two
threats. The Government have endeavoured to address both the threat of
not having a sector regulator and the threat of having one that
interferes with patterns of behaviour of the commissioners.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000359">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When I look
at amendment 40, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Leicester
West, I sympathise with the sentiment. She is basically making the
point that the Future Forum has made, that I have made and that many
other people have made: we need to be mindful of the integration of
services. We are getting a bit obsessed, however, with what we think
Monitor may end up being. We are giving the impression that this beast
will be running the NHS. However big and well funded it is, Monitor
will not be running the NHS; its role, fundamentally, is that of a
regulator. It is not going to structure the life of the NHS, because
most NHS activity will take place seamlessly and will go right past it.
Monitor will not be troubled, in the same way as the Co-operation and
Competition Panel are not troubled night and day by every decision of
every PCT.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000360">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
role is analogous to a referee. It is an appeal mechanism; it is a
licenser; it polices how the licences are applied; and it applies
rules. The best referees are the ones that we do not see much in the
game. My initial concern when I read the legislation was that when we
were asking the referee to promote competition, we were asking it to do
a lot more than simply to be a referee. It was as though the referee
should encourage the team not only to obey the offside rule but to play
like Barcelona rather than Stoke—or Stoke rather than Barcelona,
if the Committee would prefer it that
way.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000361">&#160;</a>

I would like to take up the analogy of the football pitch. Monitor is
the referee, but it is obvious that, before the referee gets on the
pitch, the Government, by including the provisions of Enterprise Act
2002 and the Competition Act 1998, have lopsided the pitch considerably
and taken away several players from the opposing
team.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000368">&#160;</a>

what I and the Future Forum would require them to do, which is to have
Monitor collaborate properly, having taken into account the right
considerations such as integration. I fundamentally do not want Monitor
promoting anything. I want it to do its job, in terms of licensing and,
as it were, refereeing the system. I have no evidence to think it has
any degree of competence in playing a strategic leadership role in the

thought: there was some discussion about the twin pillars of

Minister said they were not necessarily antithetical or opposed. That
is true: they are not necessarily opposed, but in certain contexts they
can be. That means that in most real-time situations, which are
affected by our deliberations, a balance has to be struck for the sake
of the local health economy, but who should strike it? I think the
commissioners should do it—and not only that they should but
that they will, as long as they do not have a competition authority
over them, with a job to promote competition as opposed to apply
appropriate rules. If the local commissioners get it wrong, it is not
just Monitor they have to answer to. There are also the health and
well-being boards in their own areas.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000378">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Thank you, Mr Gale. I appreciate that members
of the Committee, especially the Opposition, might have tested your
patience at times, so I shall try my best to keep in order.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000382">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">However, I am
finding the process of having to talk about isolated amendments, but
not about how Monitor is shaped under the Bill and what it will do,
quite frustrating. Under the original Bill, the purpose of Monitor was
at least clear: it was to promote competition. We now have amendments
that would change positive statements simply into double negative
statements. We will be able to discuss some amendments and clauses,
while some we cannot discuss until the Bill is debated

am finding it difficult to scrutinise the clause
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000383">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Hopefully,
the hon. Member for Southport will return soon; he is possibly in need
of more comfort than other members of the Committee. I held out some
hope when he said that he would give us an example of what was
different in this Bill. I do not know about other members of the
Committee, but I spent the lunch break digesting not just my lunch, but
the analogy that the hon. Gentleman offered. Perhaps I can regurgitate
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000384">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
analogy referred to the Spanish civil war. The hon. Gentleman spoke
about the fact that some people went out to fight Franco in the name of
socialism, but others went out to fight Franco not in the name of
socialism. I struggled with that, because it seemed that, if the
outcome and what happened on the ground was the same, why the motive?
Presumably, the motive equated to the changing of the terminology in
respect of promoting competition and not getting in the way of
anti-competition—not; I think I need to add a third negative. I
really did not find that analogy
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000385">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have a final appeal to the Minister. He will not be able to help me
with the hundreds of e-mails that I am now receiving about Rupert
Murdoch, but will he help me to respond to the many e-mails that I have
received from constituents in East Lothian asking about the
Government’s purpose for Monitor and expressing fears about it?
If he is about to offer me an example now, that will be most
helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000386">&#160;</a>

do; we have now ended up with the Government trying to respond to the
many organisations and networks throughout the UK that have expressed
concerns about the provisions—including the Arab spring that was
the Lib Dem conference. Although the hon. Member for Southport has
spent a great deal of time interpreting the approach of the Opposition,
we have not really had a clear definition of the Liberal Democrat

                  </strong> I want to address a narrow aspect of
Monitor’s functions, in relation to its role with social care.
The clause that we are debating is about Monitor’s general
duties, and I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about a
number of things that have happened recently.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000393">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the
Committee will remember, I raised social care and Monitor’s
duties on 15 March; it is reported in <em>Hansard, </em>starting at the
end of column 773. I questioned the Minister’s
intentions behind clause 53—now clause
57 —but I believe that Monitor’s general role is
also important. I said that there were huge concerns about what would
happen to Southern Cross, because its shares had dived from £600
before Christmas to £5 and it had unsustainable debts. I also
wanted to know the Government’s thoughts about designating some
social care services, if Monitor were to have a role in designating
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000394">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need to
grapple with the problem of what we do with failing social care
providers, and I made the point that it was wrong that if a social care
provider were to crash in the private sector, the
administrator’s duties would be primarily to the creditors and
not to the elderly—to the 31,000 vulnerable elderly who live in
Southern Cross homes.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000395">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I do not
think that I have mystic powers; it was clear to anyone that there
would be a problem with Southern Cross, and that problem is becoming
more pressing. Since our debate, at Prime Minister’s questions,
the Prime Minister gave this answer to a question on Southern Cross
from my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick
Smith):<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000396">&#160;</a>

Health Department, the Treasury and the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills are following this very closely. We are taking
powers in the Health and Social Care Bill to make sure that we regulate
these organisations properly. Local authorities have the necessary
powers to take over the running of care homes if required, so I believe
that we are planning for all contingencies in the correct
way.”—[<em>Official Report</em>, 29 June 2011; Vol. 530,

seems to have moved on since we last had it. The Minister might
remember that he stated that the social care powers
likely to be given to Monitor by the Government were much more narrowly
drawn than is now claimed by the Prime Minister and the Secretary of

said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000398">&#160;</a>

clause enables that phased approach. It does not provide that
Monitor’s functions will be extended to adult social care, only
that they could be. A joint review by the Department of Health and the
Department for Communities and Local Government is considering
proposals for a role for Monitor in regulating adult social care
services. We anticipate that any such role would be limited to
anti-competitive behaviour and/or provider
failure.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

statement to the House, yet we still do not really know what is in the
Department of Health’s mind. What will it do with Monitor? What
will Monitor’s role be in social care? Can the Minister explain

will Monitor’s competition functions apply in social care? Will
Monitor have functions to do with designated social care services? We

the Minister also help on the subject of the powers granted to GP
commissioning consortia if the Bill is enacted? Will the consortia then
be in control of the properties from which they operate? Could they, as
Southern Cross did, separate the operating company from the property
company? Might we find ourselves in a Southern Cross situation, with
the operating company in a sweetheart deal with the property company
and having to pay more and more rent, which would challenge the
financial viability of the GP commissioning

that extent, the NHS Future Forum has helpfully looked at precisely
that question. It agreed that the NHS was given greater reassurance by
that, because otherwise exactly the same competition law would be
applied by a competition authority that did not necessarily understand
and appreciate how the health service worked, which is what Monitor is
charged to do…In so far as Monitor will have licensing
responsibilities, it will be able to exercise ex ante licensing
provisions, the purpose of which is to support the NHS. As a
consequence, that will make less likely the intervention of any
competition provisions, which tend to fragment and distort what would

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 56
deals with Monitor and competition. Understandably, it has caused the
most controversy in our debates. The Government previously attempted to
drive through a clause that would have prioritised competition over
crucial concerns that many organisations expressed about the Bill, and
they seemed to ignore the concerns of hon. Members in Committee. I was
surprised to see the expressions on Government Members’
faces—they looked across to the Opposition in shock and horror
that we should be challenging them. The Bill has been a complete and
utter mess from start to finish in my respectful submission.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000416">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What is
Monitor for? I am confused. My right hon. Friend the Member for Rother
Valley rightly mentioned the Secretary of State’s remarks and ex
ante support for NHS licensing powers. My right hon. Friend said from a
sedentary position that Monitor is to protect the NHS from the
Government, which is probably right. What is the difference between
promoting competition and not being
anti-competitive?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000417">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
Monitor is to protect the NHS from the Government, that reminds me of a
story, which I hope you will allow me to relate, Mr Gale. During the
2001 election campaign, my predecessor, Lord Prescott, who was then the
right hon. John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister, was involved in an
unfortunate incident in Wales. I was an active member of the Labour
party at that time, and I remember that before the incident he had one
or two special security officers with him; after it, he had about two
dozen. A newspaper remarked—probably accurately—that 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 379<a class="bkMark" name="Column379">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the protection officers were not to protect the Deputy PM from the
public, but to protect the public from him. Is that
what Monitor is
about?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000418">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government have tabled an amendment that obliges Monitor to promote the
provision of services that are “economic, efficient and
effective” and that<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000419">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>The Opposition disagree
with the Government’s solution. Our amendment 40, however, would
alter the Bill to ensure that Monitor’s main focus would be to
promote “collaboration and integration”, which is what
the Future Forum has said it wants. Integration is vital for the NHS,
but where is it? It is a key concern of many long-term ill, who are by
far the largest users of the
NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000420">&#160;</a>

a contribution to our proceedings when the Bill was first in Committee,
I quoted from written evidence submitted by National Voices:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000421">&#160;</a>

               <p>That

apparent listening exercise, and the pretend U-turn, nothing has
changed. The demands and requirements of NHS service users remain the
same. I see no possible reason why all hon. Members would not support

seemed to suggest that there were fundamental changes. I suggest they

                  </strong> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that,
but sadly he is wrong on a number of points. The fundamental one was
that the difference I was pointing out was not about what Monitor does;
it was that the right hon. Member for Rother Valley seemed to suggest
that there were significant changes to the role or powers of Monitor
through these amendments, whereas the hon. Members for Kingston upon
Hull East and for Pontypridd were trying to suggest there were no
changes at all, or very little change, which is the direct
opposite.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000425">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friends can see that there are significant changes as a result of
our listening, during the listening process, and accepting the
recommendations made by the Future Forum; it suggested that we needed
to change, and we did. If the hon. Gentleman had been listening
carefully to my opening speech, he would  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 380<a class="bkMark" name="Column380">&#160;</a>
                  </div>vividly remember some fairly cogent extracts from comments made by the
Future Forum; in particular, welcoming the fact that we have listened
and accepted what it recommended to improve and strengthen the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000426">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will begin by answering two factual points on procedures that the hon.
Lady for Leicester West raised. One of them concerned the failure
regime and the fact that the Bill still has clauses dealing with
designation. The answer is that they will still be there, because we
will deal with them when the failure regime amendments are tabled and
the House is ready to debate them. She asked when that would be and, as
I said during the evidence session, we are not going to rush this
because it is extremely complex and we want to get it right. I know,
with some justification, that she would be the first to criticise us if
we rushed it just for some artificial time scale and got it wrong. I
told her we would bring forward the amendments either on Report or in
another place. We have been working extremely hard on this; work will
continue and I am confident that we will bring forward the amendments
in time for them to be debated on Report.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000427">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
raised a number of specific individual questions about the form, shape
and some of the operations of the failure regime. I will give answers
to two questions and then stop for reasons I will explain to her. One
of the things she asked was whether the regime will deal with the
failure of individual providers. The answer is yes. She then asked who
will administer the failure regime, to which the answer is Monitor. I
am not going to go into detail on the other questions because we are
still drawing up the amendments. Excited as she is to see our
proposals, she will have to wait, and I urge her to have patience,
until we table the amendments before
Report.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000428">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other factual issue, which the hon. Lady addressed in great detail last
time around, is about trusts that currently have difficulty seeking
foundation trust status. She asked me, for example, whether Sir David
Nicholson’s figure of about 20 was accurate, and I confirm that
it is. I also confirm that considerable work is being done with a
number of trusts, including those 20, to get them into a position to
seek foundation trust status. As she knows, that work is being done at
local level between strategic health authorities, providers and
officials,<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000429">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
also asked whether we would publish the list, but I fear that I have to
disappoint her. There is nothing to be gained from putting names into
the public domain. As I told her, the relevant bodies are working
extremely hard to help trusts successfully to seek foundation trust
status. The additional publicity that would come if we published the
names of the organisations would not be helpful, nor would it assist
the process. I hope that she accepts that as a reasonable way to
proceed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000430">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
will come back to the hon. Member for Leicester West, because she
raised a number of issues, but I now want to address two issues raised
by the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth. She asked whether
we will publish a bibliography with the impact assessment that will be
published when the Bill has completed its passage. I confirm that we
are prepared to publish a
bibliography.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000431">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also asked whether we will submit the impact assessment to
peer review. At this point we do not think peer review will be
necessary nor have much 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 381<a class="bkMark" name="Column381">&#160;</a>
                  </div>value. When the impact assessment is published, it will be looked at
closely by a range of people, particularly researchers and academic
institutions, who will form their own views on the evidence and the
comments, as they have on the Future Forum’s work. There are a
range of Government mechanisms to ensure that the impact assessment is
a robust document, and I urge the hon. Lady to wait for its
publication. I am sure she will not be disappointed by its
content.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000432">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
number of Members asked what is the point of Monitor and whether it is
too large, given its functions under the amended Bill. I do not think
that those Members are listening, because we have covered that issue in
great depth. We have explained the differences from our proposals
before the listening process. There have been considerable changes, as
shown by the difference in opinion between the right hon. Member for
Rother Valley, who in his interesting speech seemed to be making the
point that there were significant changes, and the hon. Member for
Pontypridd, aided and abetted by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull
East, who seemed to suggest that there were not.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000433">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor’s
competition role has been restricted, as we all know from the
Government amendments, but Members have overlooked the fact that
Monitor will perform a number of crucial functions. It will be price
setting, licensing providers and protecting the continuance of
services. Those are three crucial areas where Monitor is still needed,
and it has to be resourced to be able to carry out its
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000434">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for East Lothian asked for examples of how things will be
different. In my opening comments, I gave a list that showed how
Monitor’s role will be addressing anti-competitive behaviour and
will be different from its role in promoting competition. I do not want
to detain the Committee by going through it all in great detail, but I
will give her one example in passing. The most important thing is that
Monitor will not be able to exercise its functions with the aim of
promoting competition. I then went on to say that, for example, it
could not choose to disapply a particular set of licence conditions to
a certain group of providers in order to make it easier for them to
enter the market. That very clear-cut example answers the hon.
Lady’s points.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000435">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Can I just finish? I have found another example for
the hon. Lady, just to give her more to think about. She asked what
would be different about moving away from promoting competition, as
defined in the earlier part of the legislation. Commissioners can
commission integrated services without fearing that Monitor might break
them up in the spirit of promoting competition. Again, that is
important, given that we are trying to concentrate on improving and
enhancing an integration of services, because that is clearly in the
best interests of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000437">&#160;</a>

licence provisions to a 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 382<a class="bkMark" name="Column382">&#160;</a>
                  </div>set of providers in order to allow them to enter the market. Can he
point to where, in the earlier unamended Bill, there is a line that
previously allowed Monitor to do that? What has been removed that now
disallows Monitor from doing it? Which is the line in the
text?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000438">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is constantly
coming back to this point, for one very simple reason. The whole thing
was part and parcel of the whole ethos of the competition agenda in the
legislation to start with. We have now—quite clearly, on the
face of the Bill through our amendments—changed it so that it
will not be promoting competition, so that goes by the board. We then
have to focus on what Monitor is going to be doing in its role of price
setting, licensing and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000439">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If I can now
move to the hon. Member for Easington’s questions, he asked why
commissioners could not oversee competition. The straightforward answer
is because patients’ interests need to be safeguarded by
ensuring that commissioners do not collude with local providers to
exclude innovative services or restrict choice. That requires oversight
by Monitor, or an outside body rather than them. Their functions are to
devote their time to commissioning good quality care for their
patients. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000440">&#160;</a>

contributed to our debates and we are united in recognising the
importance of doing all we can to reduce and minimise inequalities
within health care. That is why we are putting the duty to seek to do
that in the Bill. If the hon. Gentleman looks at 101(1)(d), it requires
Monitor to have regard to the need to perform that role. Monitor must

NHS and the issues it faces. Rather reassuringly, because it is always
good when a third party agrees with what one is doing, the Nuffield

restrictions on competition from arising. Monitor will be able to set
licence conditions to enable integration in a way that benefits
patients and does not improperly restrict competition. As a result, the
need for a competition regulator to intervene and apply competition law
is less likely, therefore reducing the risk that competition law would
be applied in a way that fragmented services that had not been
integrated appropriately, and which restricted competition to the
detriment of patients.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000447">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Questions
were asked about who Monitor would account to. Monitor is, and will
remain, a non-departmental public body, accountable to Parliament
through the Secretary of State. It will be accountable to the public
through parliamentary scrutiny, including investigations by Select
Committees, I suspect most prominently by the Health Committee, I
assume by the Public Accounts Committee and, possibly the Public
Administration Committee. Parliament’s ability to assess and
question Monitor’s activities and behaviour regularly will
ensure its
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000448">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Leicester West talked about procurement regulations.
The Secretary of State already issues guidance to commissioners on
procurement best practice and law, and commissioners are expected to
comply with that. That was started by the previous Government through
their PCT procurement
guide.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000449">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady made some valid remarks about diabetes to illustrate her
point about integration. I assure her that commissioners will be
expected to promote integration when it benefits patients. They could
commission an integrated pathway for diabetes patients as long as it is
procured fairly and openly, and Monitor would be expected to enable
such integration. The Bill would not stop the provision of integrated
diabetes care; the driving force is what benefits the patient most and
best.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000450">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady asked about Monitor intervening on anti-competitive grounds.
It would have to be confident that the interests of patients were being
harmed, and it could be challenged by patients, commissioners or others
if they
disagreed.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000451">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady also talked about promoting competition versus tackling
anti-competitive behaviour. I think she used the immortal words,
“smoke” and “mirrors”, which the hon.
Member for Pontypridd introduced to our proceedings today. We
discovered this morning that instead of clearing the fog, the hon.
Gentlemen, albeit wittily, made it thicker, leaving many of my hon.
Friends and I baffled after his virtuoso
performance.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000452">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady keeps going on about the matter, and complaining about it,
but I would like to pray in aid of our side of the argument a number of
third party endorsements that I think command respect. For example,
Steve Field said:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000453">&#160;</a>

points made by the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury, if she
thinks that would be helpful.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000471">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The hon. Lady
raised a number of issues, but I will start with the fundamental one
about how the Government will bring social care within the ambit of the
legislation vis-à-vis Monitor. She quoted the Prime Minister,
the Secretary of State and me from an earlier debate. We are all in
agreement on the way forward. As a Government and individually, we have
always said that considerable work and further consultation is required
before making a full decision on the future role of Monitor as regards
social care, although in principle we believe that there is a role for
it to play.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000472">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We need,
however, to carry out further work. There is provision within the
legislation, as I said during our earlier debates, under clause 57,
which allows the Secretary of State powers via regulations to give
Monitor a role in adult social care to address potential
anti-competitive behaviour and/or provider failure. Because it is
hugely complex and we have to get it right, we want further work done
on it. We want more consultations. As the hon. Lady knows, my hon.
Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
will be publishing a White Paper on social care next year. This issue
will be included for discussion and consultation. I urge the hon.
Member for Islington South and Finsbury to take part in that
consultation at the appropriate time, to help move that important area
of work forward so that we can come up with the relevant and correct
means to link in Monitor in a beneficial way to help adult social
care.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000473">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury also raised the issue of
Southern Cross and how it disposed of its assets and homes. She asked
whether CCGs could do that with their property. I completely reassure
the hon. Lady that they will not be able to, because the CCGs are
groups of GP practices, which will not own or run the premises within
the CCG. That will remain the responsibility of GPs as providers. I
hope the hon. Lady has got that. The GPs will own or run the premises,
but, by grouping together, they are a CCG. The CCG does not own the
premises; the GPs do. They will not be able to dispose of the
properties in the way that Southern Cross
did.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000474">&#160;</a>

the quality of health care services provided for those
purposes,’.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">I shall be
extremely brief, as I know the Committee wants to make progress. The
Future Forum report made it clear that to deliver responsive care for
the changing needs of our population, a different approach to care and
treatment is needed, in particular to provide a better service for the
growing number of people with long-term health conditions. We have made
amendments elsewhere to address those concerns, for example by putting
a new duty on CCGs, and a strengthened duty on the NHS commissioning
board to promote integrated services for patients, both within the NHS
and between health, social care and other local services.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000542">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Monitor will
also be required to enable integrated services for patients, where this
would improve quality of care or reduce inequalities for patients or
improve efficiency. However, in addition, the amendment would place a
specific duty on Monitor to have regard to the desirability of
providers co-operating in the delivery of services across
organisational boundaries. For example, following a complex hip
replacement operation, a patient would transfer from secondary care to
receiving physiotherapy in primary care, or community-based aftercare
provided at home. Providers need to co-operate to ensure that patients
transfer from one service provider to another smoothly and without any
apparent break in treatment that would be detrimental to the patient.
The amendment supports that co-operation.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000543">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">One of the
practical differences that could be supported through the amendment
would be the use of tariffs along a care pathway, involving a number of
providers, rather than tariffs for individual episodes of care within a
provider. That will deliver better co-ordinated care for patients and
maximise their
recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000544">&#160;</a>

debated the clause, we discussed extensively an amendment tabled by my
Front-Bench colleagues, which said pretty much the same as the
Government’s amendment. It talked about the need to improve
collaboration and integration. It said that putting a clear requirement
on Monitor to have particular regard to the need to support integration
and collaboration—integration about which we have heard the
Minister talk—would help allay the fears that some have about
fragmentation. In response, the Minister used a phrase that became
extremely familiar during our 28—or was it

                     </span>
                  </strong> The clause deals with conflicts of interest. We did
not have an occasion last time to talk about conflicts of interest as
they relate to CCGs. That was a shame, as that is an area where we see
significant conflicts of interest. The conflicts of interests in
respect of Monitor are perhaps less significant than those that we
would have debated at some length, had we sufficient time to do so
during the re-committed Bill’s passage. It is a crying shame
that we have not had sufficient time to look at conflicts of interests
between clinicians who might be commissioning care from
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000551">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">When
the Government last amended the clause—there is no amendment to
it today—they wanted to emphasise the need for Chinese walls, as
the Minister put it, between the part of Monitor that will be
responsible in the so-called interim period for dealing with foundation
trusts, and the part that will be responsible for promoting
competition. That prompts a number of questions. First, given that the
Minister now seems to think that promoting competition is not really an
issue, is the Chinese wall analogy still applicable? I suggest that it
is, because I do not think that significant changes have 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 390<a class="bkMark" name="Column390">&#160;</a>
                  </div>been made concerning competition. It is absolutely pertinent, therefore,
for the Chinese walls to remain in place.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000552">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
interim period before all the FTs are up and running has now been
extended, so it is even more important that those Chinese walls are
maintained. The Minister has helpfully confirmed that about 20 trusts
are in difficulty of the sort that would currently prevent them from
attaining foundation trust status. That only adds to the
Opposition’s concerns about the huge weight that will be placed
on Monitor in the interim period. It will have to prepare for promoting
competition or preventing anti-competition; get all the trusts ready to
assume FT status; and oversee their transition to management elsewhere
in the NHS. Chinese walls are, therefore, still extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000553">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Mergers also
provide clear potential for conflicts of interest. The Co-operation and
Competition Panel has been responsible for assessing the importance and
impact of mergers between different parts of the publicly funded,
publicly owned NHS, and we assumed that Monitor would take a greater
role in that. We now know, however, that the OFT will effectively do
that, in collaboration and consultation with Monitor. After the
transition period, that will be the area with the most acute potential
for conflict of interest. In his remarks about this clause last time
around, the Minister highlighted two areas that might give rise to
conflicts of interest. One concerned Monitor’s main duty, which
he described as:<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000554">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“to protect and
promote the interests of people who use health care services by
promoting competition where appropriate, and through regulation where
necessary. Monitor must also promote the economic, efficient and
effective provision of NHS health care services and, among other
things, have regard to the need for commissioners to ensure fair
access.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official Report, Health and

               </p>
               <p>He went
on to say that the gap in fair access, or the potential conflict
between ensuring fair access on the one hand and promoting competition
or preventing anti-competition on the other, was the big issue. That
has not gone away. The clause, in precluding conflict of interest, is
relatively
weak.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000555">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
second area in which the clause is relatively weak, and on which we
would welcome greater clarity from the Minister, given his recognition
of the significant need for Chinese walls, is how such walls will work
when trusts fail. I will paraphrase, I hope accurately, the example
given by the Minister: if a trust is failing, and Monitor has a role in
engaging with that trust and putting in place the failure regime that
we now know will be changed somehow, Monitor must stop itself thinking
about its other role of overseeing and promoting competition, or
preventing anti-competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000556">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unamended,
the clause poses real questions. Given that we do not know how the
failure regime will work, but that there will be one, will that failure
regime still allow Monitor to disapply its principal function on
competition in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000557">&#160;</a>

			Column number: 391<a class="bkMark" name="Column391">&#160;</a>
                  </div>to the failure regime. The Minister highlighted this potential area on
17 March 2011, <em>Official Report,</em> column 806, and said that when
the failure regime is being looked at Monitor needs to disapply its
competition hat, which means that it must not judge whether a trust is
acting anti-competitively or failing properly to promote competition
when looking at why it is failing. We may need to return to the clause
at a later stage, and I urge the Minister to think about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000559">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
of course would like to be able to trust the Government on all of the
proposals, but had we had a chance to debate the clause relating to
conflicts of interest and consortia we would have asked the Minister
why the Government refused to accede to the Future Forum’s
recommendation to give HealthWatch a job  in identifying and
dealing with conflicts of interest in consortia. The Government have
not had a chance to tell us why they did not agree to that. Despite
them apparently being so keen on the Future Forum’s
recommendations, they chucked out recommendation 16. If he
would like to, will the Minister try to answer that? If not, will he
assure us that he will think carefully about conflicts of interest as
they apply to Monitor and perhaps return to the clause if it needs to
be changed on Report or at any other
time?<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000560">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The clause, as the hon. Member for Pontypridd has
alluded to, makes various provisions about how Monitor should handle
potential conflicts of interest in relation to its functions. Before
going into the detail, it may be helpful if I say something about where
such conflicts might arise. Clauses 56 and 58 create several general
duties on Monitor. As we have already discussed, its main duty is to
protect and promote the interests of people who use healthcare services
by promoting the economic, efficient and effective provision of such
services, and, among other things, to have regard to the need for
commissioners to ensure fair access to services for those who need
them. In many cases, those duties will be synergic, but, in theory at
least, there could be a scenario where the most economic, efficient and
effective provision did not deliver fair access. For example, that
could be because that access was limited to certain days, times or
locations. Hence, this clause creates a general duty on Monitor to make
arrangements for resolving any conflicts of interest between any of its
general duties. This provision makes it clear that, in cases where the
general duties conflicted, there would be no external authority to
which Monitor could or should turn to for
resolution.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000561">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(2) is about how Monitor would achieve its main role as regulator of
healthcare services alongside its continuing roles in relation to NHS
foundation trusts. Once Monitor has taken on the role of sectoral
regulator, its long-term function in relation to foundation trusts will
be that of registrar, keeping basic information and enacting changes on
the request of foundation trusts, as set out in chapter 5, part 2 of
the NHS Act 2006, as amended by part 4 of this Bill, which we will come
to later. That will include, in the short-term only, determining what
foundation trusts must include in their annual
reports.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000562">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">During
the transition, Monitor will also have functions in relation to
authorising new foundation trusts arising from the time-limited
intervention powers in clauses 112 and 113. The intervention
powers will allow Monitor to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 392<a class="bkMark" name="Column392">&#160;</a>
                  </div>appoint and remove board members of foundation trusts, as is now the
case, to allow time for the internal governance arrangements in
foundation trusts to become fully effective. Monitor will need Chinese
walls, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out during my speech the last time
round, in relation to its role as sector regulator and its specific
functions in relation to foundation
trusts.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000563">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
subsection (3) provides that, when carrying out its competition,
licensing and pricing functions, Monitor must ignore the functions that
would enable it to intervene in NHS foundation trusts for a limited
time period during the transition. That includes ignoring its power to
impose additional licence conditions in cases where it considers that
there is a significant risk of a foundation trust failing to meet its
principal purpose. Therefore, under the subsection, Monitor could not
take account of the fact that it was intervening in a foundation trust
when considering whether there had been a breach of competition law
involving the same foundation
trust.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000564">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Subsections
(4) to (7) cover conflicts between Monitor’s general duties
under clauses 56 and 58 that are significant in the ways specified in
those clauses. The provision also applies to any other conflicts of
interest that Monitor considers are of unusual importance. In all such
cases, Monitor must publish a statement setting out the nature of the
conflict, the manner in which Monitor has decided to resolve it and the
reasons for that decision. It is an important provision in relation to
transparency and public
accountability.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000565">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Taken
as a whole, the clause makes provision for real-life conflicts of
interest that Monitor might encounter in exercising its functions, and
it will ensure that Monitor is clear about how it should deal with
them. It will also ensure that there is transparency in cases where
there might be significant public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000566">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
respond to the comments of the hon. Gentleman, we have not seen the
failure regime yet because the Government amendments have not been
tabled. We will have to wait until they have been published for us to
debate them later in our proceedings. He asked whether, if in that
debate it becomes obvious and necessary to amend the Bill, we would be
willing to do so. I will not give a 100% categorical assurance that we
would amend the Bill, because that would be misconstrued, but
if,  in the debate on the failure regime, it becomes apparent
to the Government that this or any other part of the Bill needs to be
changed, I give him that
commitment.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000567">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Gentleman asked whether the Chinese walls were still necessary. I
hope, from what I have just said, that he will accept that I believe
that they are still necessary, which is why we have kept them. He also
said, and I want to reassure him on this, that getting trusts ready for
foundation trust status would place a huge weight on Monitor. I have to
tell him that that is a misunderstanding, because it is not
Monitor’s job to prepare trusts for FT status. That will be the
job of the NHS trust development authority, so the hon. Gentleman can
rest assured that it will not be a huge weight on Monitor, which will
be able to concentrate on the duties and functions given to it in the
Bill. I hope that I have convinced Opposition Members that the clause
should stand
part.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000568">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
157 concerns the wording of the Secretary of State’s powers to
direct Monitor as to the exercise of its functions. Clause 63 currently
provides that he can use these powers if Monitor fails to perform a
function. The Bill includes similar powers for the Secretary of State
to intervene in relation to the commissioning board. Under clause 19
the Secretary of State may give a direction if the board is failing or
has failed to discharge any of its functions. The wording in relation
to the NHS commissioning board makes it clearer that it is a function
of the board that is relevant. It also makes it clear that the
Secretary of State’s power covers 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 394<a class="bkMark" name="Column394">&#160;</a>
                  </div>a failing or failure to deliver any of the board’s functions. For
the avoidance of doubt, the amendment therefore proposes changing the
wording in relation to the Secretary of State’s power to direct
Monitor so that it specifically refers to
“Monitor’s” functions, and covers
“any” of those
functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11070759000575">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
225 relates to the provision in subsection (3) that the
Secretary of State cannot direct Monitor as to the exercise of its
functions in particular cases. The provision in subsection (3) means,
for example, that the Secretary of State could not intervene to require
that a particular licence condition be placed on a particular provider.
Another example would be that the Secretary of State could not
intervene to require Monitor to act or act in a particular way in
relation to a commissioner who had failed to comply with regulations
about procurement. There is also general provision in clause
295 about the exercise of the Secretary of State’s powers to
give directions. The amendment makes it clear that the provision in
clause 63(3) applies and, if there were doubt in any particular
circumstance, would over-ride the general provision in clause 295 about
the circumstances in which the Secretary of State could use the powers
of direction he would have from the
