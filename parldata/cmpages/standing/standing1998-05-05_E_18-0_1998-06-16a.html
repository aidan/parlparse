<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The point of order is one for you, although it is significant that The Paymaster General is not here to comment on it.
<P>
Today we are debating capital gains tax paid by those who dispose of large business assets, and the non-taxation of overseas trusts. The Paymaster General is a sponsor of the Bill and, as such, his name appears on it. In its tenth report, the Standards and Privileges Committee criticised the Paymaster General for his failure to register an interest in an overseas trust.
<P>
My point of order concerns whether it is acceptable for the Paymaster General to participate in a debate on matters in which he has a clear and continuing personal interest, both as a Treasury Minister and as a taxpayer. For example, would the Paymaster General be in breach of the rules of the House if he were to vote on, and or to speak to, a debate on overseas trusts without first registering or declaring his interest to this Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, Members of Parliament are responsible for their own behaviour. Indeed, it is not a matter for the Chair unless decisions have been taken that would in any way bar a Member of Parliament from participating in the Committee. I should also say that I find it hard to reconcile a complaint about the absence of a particular individual from Committee with the view that he should not take part in the debate.
<P>
We must be clear about the matter. The Chair works on the straightforward premise that Members of Parliament may participate in the debate provided that they are part of the Committee and that they behave in a manner that is acceptable to the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Fallon </B>(Sevenoaks): Further to that point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. There is a slight difference between Committee members in the generality, and Ministers who are sponsors of a Bill that they are supposed to defend in Committee. The Paymaster General answered questions on capital gains tax on 25 March, on 30 March and on 8 April. He should therefore be in attendance further to explain the Government's position.
<P>
The issue was raised on Thursday, when the Paymaster General discourteously failed to turn up to finish the speech that he had begun on Tuesday. He was subsequently discovered in the building, lolling on the Benches in the Chamber during the sitting of the House. Perhaps we could ensure that, if he cannot attend the Committee this morning, he could at least do so this afternoon.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The rules of the House, which are quite clear, do not make a distinction of the sort suggested by the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
We should now proceed with the work of the Committee.
<H4><center>Clause 120 </center></H4>
<H4><center>Freezing of indexation allowance for CGT </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 110, line 16, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) Except for the purposes of corporation tax paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 53(1) of that Act shall be replaced by the words `so as to give the gain or the loss for the purposes of this Act'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause highlights a nonsense. In order to prevent a shareholder who added to a shareholding between 17 March and 5 April from obtaining an extra year's tapering, the Government have had to introduce a new section, 2A9(a), to the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. That section will allow the enhanced pool to qualify for loss relief on indexation.
<P>
The amendment is brief and technical, and seeks to apply the rules equally to all types of assets. The allowance of indexation for gains only is a complication that could and should be taken out in the interests of simplification. As we move into an era of self-assessment, I believe that we should be seeking simplicity wherever possible. The amendment attempts to do just that.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Dawn Primarolo):</B> The amendment would allow for a gain on a disposal after 5 April 1998 by anyone other than a company to be turned into a loss by the deduction of indexation allowance. At present, indexation allowance can be deducted only to the extent that the gain is reduced to nil. A loss cannot be created by indexation allowance, nor can the amount of a loss be increased by it. Interestingly, because the amendment does not seek to amend the legislation which prevents that from occurring, it would produce the anomalous result that an unindexed gain could be turned into an indexed loss and an unindexed loss could not be increased.
<P>
More generally, the amendment attempts to reopen a debate that was started in 1994 by the then Financial Secretary, who I think is now the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, during discussions on the 1994 Finance Bill. The Conservative Government introduced a measure to prevent indexation allowance from creating or increasing losses. That proposal was accepted with a transitional relief for 1993-94 and 1994-95 for individuals and trusts. Frankly, I see no justification for returning to the issue at this stage because the allowance will only run to April 1998 and will progressively disappear from the CGT system as assets held at the time are sold. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment and agree not to reopen the debate that was concluded in 1994.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the Financial Secretary accept that the effect of new section 2A(9)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 is to enable loss from an indexation so far as enhanced pools are concerned?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have made it clear that the Government have no intention of reopening the 1994[Dawn Primarolo]
debate on indexation losses. I have adequately covered the hon. Gentleman's points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was an inadequate answer, but as the issues have been aired in the Committee and people outside the House will be able to read them, and in view of time constraints, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clauses 120 and 121 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 122 </center></H4>
<H4><center>New identification rules for CGT </center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): I beg to move amendment No. 168, in page 112, leave out lines 39 to 47.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 242, in page 112, line 40, leave out "thirty days", and insert "one day".
<P>
No. 244, in page 115, line 3, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(10) After section 3(6) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 there shall be added the following subsection 
<P>
"(6A) Where in any year of assessment a person has not utilised the exempt amount (or part thereof) he may make a claim requring that so much of the exempt amount as has not been utilised shall be carried forward and set off against his liability to capital gains tax in any of the next six years of assessment'.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The amendments seek to achieve the same end in yet another clause that contains an ill-thought out measure. This hastily instigated measure, which was announced retrospectively in the Budget statement of 17 March, brought down the guillotine on the use of bed and breakfasting that very day. The chief executive of the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which is one of the leading trade bodies that deals with investments in pooled funds, said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This reveals how often the Inland Revenue and the Government have no philosophical underpinning for tax changes but merely want to raise the tax take in the simplest way possible".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause shows that, once again, the Inland Revenue has little understanding of the nature of the problem if, indeed, it is a problem.
<P>
In a written answer to a question of mine, the Financial Secretary said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Capital Gains Tax yield from the provisions to counter bed and breakfasting of shares may be of the order of £50 million in the long term, but the short term yield is likely to be low and grow slowly. The number of people undertaking such transactions is highly uncertain but could be of the order of 100,000." [Official Report, 3 June 1998; Vol. 313, c. 195.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is much vagueness in that answer, which again emphasises the fact that the Revenue is not really aware of the extent of the problem if, as I said, it is a problem. If at least 100,000 people will probably use the facility of bed and breakfasting, they will not all be tax-avoiding fat cats, as the clause seems to suggest. The clause is misguided because it will encourage short-termism, which the Government for ever harp on about and which they want to deter in favour of long-term investment.
<P>
The proposal is misguided because it will disproportionately hit smaller investors rather than the fat cats, about whom we hear so much. This is yet another proposal that will restrict investor choice and lead to a less efficient use of capital and savings. It is another example of the tax tail wagging the investment dog.
<P>
It is perfectly legitimate for investors to use the CGT allowance, which currently stands at £6,800 a year, for tax relief. If it were not legitimate, the Government would have abolished it although that is not to say that they do not have a secret agenda to abolish it in the future. It has been the practise for many years to index up the allowance, which the Government did to £6,800. The relief is there to be used; it is not a tax evasion device.
<P>
People can take advantage of the allowance in various ways. Consider, for example, an investor with a fairly sizeable fund of £250,000. If he had invested in the UK stock market over the past 12 months he would typically have made a return on capital of about 20 per cent. it was a particularly good year last year and he would have made paper gains of £50,000. A higher rate taxpayer, having stripped out the allowance of £6,800, would face a tax bill of £17,200. The £6,800 CGT allowance is therefore a drop in the ocean and of little consequence to higher net worth investors, who will quickly use it up.
<P>
Now consider a smaller investor with £50,000, who would typically used pooled funds for his investment. Over the same period, he would have made a £10,000 paper gain and, after stripping out the allowance, he would have paid a capital gains tax bill of some £1,280. The amounts involved are far more significant to the smaller investor than to the larger investor smaller investors will be more harshly hit if they cannot use the bed-and-breakfasting facility to raise gains of £6,800. One unit trust house in the City said of the proposal:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For very wealthy investors the loss of the facility is an irritant".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is exactly my point.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"For modest investors it will be very painful".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all want to encourage smaller investors to take out successful investments the Government have gone on time and again about the need to encourage long-term investment and about the need for people to save for their retirement schemes, for later residential care costs and for anything else that may come up. If a small investors invested his savings in a top performing unit trust, he would, quite understandably, want to hold on to it. Under the bed-and-breakfasting scheme, he could sell sufficient investments to make a profit equivalent to his CGT allowance and buy back the following morning. That is bed and breakfasting; it allows the annual legitimate allowance of £6,800, or a large part of it, to be used without building up gains for the future. He will no longer be able to do that and will have to sell successful investments each year and become a short-term investor. The Government are forcing investors to sell successful investments or lose a legitimate tax relief.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is an irony here. When discussing previous clauses covering the initiation of taper relief and the ending of indexation, we asked what was wrong with an investor in a blue chip company such as Glaxo, a leading pharmaceutical company, wanting to sell that investment and take a decent profit after two years 11 months and 30 days. Under the changes in the Bill he will be clobbered with the full rate of capital gains tax, even if he re-invests that money in another blue chip company for example, Barclays or BP. If he does that three and half times during the full 10 years, he will have no capital gains tax relief. An investor may prudently maintain the momentum of his investments by switching from one blue chip company to another FTSE 100 company. Why is he less prudent than someone who buys Glaxo or BP on day one, holds the shares for the full 10 years and receives the benefit of taper relief, although that benefit is likely to be less attractively than the previous indexation benefits? In that case, the Government are encouraging long-term investment in the form of the one investment that the investor started with. By abolishing the bed-and-breakfasting relief, the Government are doing the reverse. They are forcing the investor to sell on a yearly basis a successful investment or face losing a legitimate tax relief. That is entirely inconsistent and contradictory.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does not the clause also contradict the Government's purported aim when they abolished repayment of dividend tax credits to pension funds? They said that the previous regime encouraged companies to pay dividends and, therefore, short-termism. Here, they are encouraging the opposite.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) makes a pertinent point. The clauses covering capital gains tax are highly self-contradictory. The Government are saying one thing about long-term investment, but the practical implication of what they are doing will encourage short-termism. That point was well made by my hon. Friend. The clauses will seriously affect investor behaviour and distort investor decisions. If the Financial Secretary is correct, that will affect more than 100,000 people.
<P>
Smaller savers especially use their annual allowance to mitigate the accruing of potential liability to tax, even if only by inflationary pressures. Now that the indexation facility has gone out of the window, inflationary pressures will be more considerable for investors. It is right that they should be able to use the relief, but they will no longer be able to do so if they cannot use the bed-and-breakfasting facility. There is a sneaking suspicion that the measure is a first step towards the eventual abolition of capital gains tax allowance.
<P>
The second amendment seeks to allow rollover of unused capital gains tax allowances for a six-year period. Ideally, I would like the bed-and-breakfasting facility to be retained, but I am hopeful that, if I am charming enough, the Financial Secretary will accept the amendment covering that with due courtesy. However, as a fallback and if we do not get on to a sound footing today, amendment No. 242 would give investors the same facility that is already available through the carry over of losses, although that is available for an indefinite period. If investors are no longer to have the bed-and-breakfasting facility, rather than lose their £6,800 CGT allowance which, hopefully, will increase in future years they should be allowed to roll the allowance forward to future years, to a time when it is convenient and prudent from an investment point of view for them to sell. In that way, they could use not just that year's CGT allowance, but the previous several years' unused allowances, up to six years. That is only reasonable. That would be of great benefit to investment in property.
<P>
At present, the CGT allowance is especially useful when dealing in equities and other pooled funds, where one can sell a clump of shares or units in a unit trust. It is not practicbl to sell off a wall of one's house or several bricks in a property. If investors were allowed to accumulate several years' unused CGT allowance, when they sold investment property they could set off several years' CGT allowances against the profit that they made.
<P>
That would have especially healthy implications for the rented market and we have already discussed the shortage of rented property. It would help with schemes such as the previous Government's rent-a-room scheme, which encouraged home owners to use rooms in their houses for cheap lettings to people in need of rented accommodation. Therefore, the clause could have serious implications for the provision of much-needed housing space: we may have to concrete over our countryside in order to provide the 4.4 million new homes that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions would have us believe we need.
<P>
I seriously recommend both amendments, but certainly recommend the second as a fallback if the first is not accepted. I fear that the clause is badly thought out. The Government should have the courage of their convictions; if they think that using a £6,800 CGT allowance is an abuse, they should abolish it. I hope that they do not do that, but that is the implication of the clause.
<P>
I am sure that it is not the Government's intention to discriminate against smaller investors, as these measures undoubtedly do, and I am sure that they will want to encourage the efficient use of capital. If the Government reject the amendments, I fear that to that long litany of fat-cat tax avoiders which has so far included aid workers, teachers working abroad, pensioners with small numbers of shares in their portfolios and disabled trust beneficiaries will be added small, prudent investors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): While moving the amendment, the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) touched on many arguments that I want briefly to skirt over because they are pertinent to amendment No. 242, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friends.
<P>
Bed-and-breakfasting is being portrayed by the Government as some sort of tax loophole. Perhaps its[Mr. Edward Davey]
name is somewhat unfortunate; it sounds like some sort of dodgy exercise by someone trying to make a quick buck, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is a legitimate tax planning mechanism. I do not understand how a device whereby individuals can use their annual CGT allowance could be described as anything but legitimate.
<P>
The device was originally introduced into the tax system to promote savings, to encourage share ownership and the growth of capital and to provide an incentive for savings and investment. As it was introduced deliberately, it would surely be sensible to encourage ways in which people can take most advantage of the allowance. It is a good feature of the tax system, not only because of the incentives that it provides, but because it promotes efficiency in tax planning. As we have heard many times, CGT is complex to administer and I fear that, as a result of the Bill, the complexities will increase exponentially. The CGT allowance and bed and breakfasting ensure that those complexities are reduced somewhat. I fear that the Bill will increase the costs of administering the CGT system for companies, individuals, tax practitioners and the Inland Revenue.
<P>
To consider tax theory for a moment, the tax system should be moving in the general direction of equal treatment of capital and income. A former Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, made an important step in that direction by making the marginal rates of tax on income and capital the same. That was an important and welcome development. We should consider making the income tax allowance and the CGT allowance the same. If we consider the tax system in that light, we begin to see why getting rid of bed and breakfasting is inappropriate and illegitimate. We should think of the CGT allowance as an annual allowance similar to the personal income tax allowance. We should ensure that savers and those who earn an income can take full advantage of those allowances.
<P>
Making the CGT allowance and the income tax allowance the same would have been much more consistent with the Government's approach to the development of the tax system. One approach could have been the reduction of the CGT allowance, but the best approach would have been to increase the income tax allowance. In the long term, that is the right method to take people further out of tax. It would produce a much more coherent tax system and would attempt to ensure that capital gains were taxed in the same way as income.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): May I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he has evaluated the cost of raising the income tax allowance to £6,800?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am more than happy to deal with that intervention as, in the next few weeks and months, my party will put on record the cost of our proposals for an increased income tax allowance. The increased income tax allowance is a fairer way of reducing the overall income tax burden for those on low pay than introducing an anomalous 10p or 20p tax rate.
<P>
The CGT annual allowance is important in removing anomalies and unfairnesses in the current tax system. An individual who makes a £12,000 capital gain in one year is liable to tax for £5,200 of that amount. Another saver, who manages to spread that £12,000 gain over two years, has no tax liability. When such small amounts of capital gain are involved, the tax system should enable both individuals to have no CGT liability and to spread their tax liabilities. That would be a fair way of assisting ordinary individuals saving small amounts. Getting rid of bed and breakfasting would penalise those people.
<P>
The abolition of bed and breakfasting is totally contrary to the Government's stated aim of promoting long-termism, as the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham outlined. The Government seem not to understand the impact of the change.
It will encourage savers to switch out of the equities that they hold and into other equities. They will do that rather than staying with shares to which they are attached and with which they want to stay, simply for tax purposes.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We could take the example of a Manchester United fan who wants to invest in his team and who has seen the shares rocket through the roof. He wants to ensure that his liability on those shares is kept to a minimum. If he is considering serious and sensible tax planning, he will, as a result of the proposed change, have to shift into shares in Tottenham Hotspur. That could be difficult for an individual and shows how ridiculous and short-termist the Government's approach is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> If the hon. Gentleman studied the stock market a little more closely, he would notice that Manchester United shares have more than halved in value. There would, therefore, be no gain to take, which slightly undermines his cause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am happy that the hon. Gentleman made that point. Obviously, he does not represent a constituency in Manchester. I am sure than hon. Members who do would want to ensure that people stuck with their shares because they would assume that they were a sensible investment over the long term.
<P>
The bizarre point about the proposal is that it is fairly easy to circumvent the Government's aim of taking away bed and breakfasting. The pages of the serious financial journals are already awash with ways in which people can get round the Government's intentions. It is easy for married people to get round them. I suggest that the Minister has a word with the Minister without Portfolio, because he could put a spin on the issue. The proposals are an incentive to marriage because people can reduce their tax liability by getting married. They can exchange shares with their spouses to reduce their tax bill.
<P>
That shows that anomalies that the Government are introducing by getting rid of bed and breakfasting. The financial press has made a series of other more complex proposals for circumventing the Government's intentions on, for example, future options on shares. An investor can buy back shares after the 30 days and ensure that his exposure is limited.

<P>

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> That is expensive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman says, that is expensive. Nevertheless, it shows the extra complexities that the Government are introducing into the capital markets.
<P>
It is bizarre that sophisticated savers with large share portfolios and good advice can get round the measure because there are loopholes; it will not affect them at all. Again, the Bill will attack the ordinary investor and the small saver. It will drag people into the capital gains tax net who should not be there in the first place. That is fundamentally wrong. The proposed tax measure wil hit the small saver and can be got round by the sophisticated saver. It therefore brings the whole tax system into disrepute, undermining people's confidence and the Government's intentions.
<P>
There are many reasons for the Committee to support the amendments and to reject the Government's proposal to get rid of bed and breakfasting.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Whittingdale </B>(Maldon and East Chelmsford): I should begin by declaring an interest. Like millions of people in this country, I am a small shareholder who will but hit by the measure to abolish bed and breakfasting.
<P>
I want to begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey), both of whom have made a powerful case in support of the amendment. I do not want to repeat what they said but to exphasise that Conservative Members believe capital gains tax to be a bad tax. The provision allowing small investors the opportunity to carry out bed and breakfasting of their shares to some extent mitigates the tax's worst effects, but abolishing that opportunity will only reinforce them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Leslie </B>(Shipley): Many Conservative Members have told the Committee that they dislike capital gains tax, but will the hon. Gentleman describe precisely his and his party's position on its abolition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Whittingdale:</B> My position has always been clear: I dislike capital gains tax and I hope that there will be an opportunity to abolish it. The previous Conservate Government always made it clear that they wanted capital gains tax to disappear in the long term. That cannot happen until resources allow, as there will always be other priorities, but our long-term preference is that capital gains tax should go.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said, the clause will hit not tax abusers seeking to avoid paying tax but ordinary taxpayers taking advantage of the opportunity to use their annual tax allowance, an option that has always existed in the legislation. Nor will the clause hit the fat cats, whom the Government claim to be trying to pursue: in the main, it will hit small investors.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham set out very clearly, the clause will encourage the very short-termism that the Government have said repeatedly that they are trying to prevent. It will fly in the face of the Government's aims, as set out elsewhere in the Bill. Small investors who would have been happy to hold a well-performing share will sell that share and invest in something else so as to take advantage of the tax allowance. Previously, they could have taken advantage of the allowance and realised some of the gain while still holding on to the same share.
<P>
I fail to see the logic behind the clause. I hope that the Government will listen to the arguments that have been advanced. I should prefer them to accept amendment No. 168, the first on the Order Paper. If they cannot do that, they should consider amendment No. 244, which would allow people to accumulate gains, roll over their exemptions and so choose when to take advantage of their allowances. That would mitigate the effect of the measure, and would also have some merit for property owners, who at present cannot take advantage of the exemption.
<P>
To conclude, I shall quote the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland, which has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We object to the attack on bed and breakfasting of shares. If it is Government policy to permit each individual an annual exemption for any realised gains the individual should be entitled to use it. We consider this attack on minimising capital gains tax liabilities to be petty, and of course there are plenty of ways around it."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will listen to those arguments and accept the amendments.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> As hon. Members have explained, amendment No. 168 would remove the identification rule to counter the bed and breakfasting of shares, and amendment No. 242 would reduce the identification period from 30 days to one day. The effects of the two amendments would be much the same.
<P>
Bed and breakfasting is the process by which a holding of shares is sold on one day and bought back shortly afterwards. It is motivated by the investor's desire to crystallise either a gain to use up the annual exempt amount for the year or losses on the shares, to set against gains on other assets. The new rules will restrict the practice, which is wholly tax driven. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor's statements in the House have made that, dare I say, it crystal clear. The objection to bed and breakfasting is that tax consequences are crystallised but the same shares continue to be owned by the same person.
<P>
As a caveat, I remind Committee members that the purpose of the capital gains tax reforms is to promote entrepreneurialism and to encourage and reward long-term investment. It is a fairer system which will, when fully operational, be simpler than the current provisions. It will therefore be evident to the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham that I am unable to accept amendment No. 168 because it would completely cut across my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's stated intentions.
<P>
Amendment No. 224, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, would render the clause almost wholly ineffective by reducing the identification period to one day. He will not be surprised, therefore, to hear me ask the Committee to reject it.
[Dawn Primarolo]
<P>
It is true that a one-day period would have caught most bed and breakfsting being practised up until the last Budget, but if such a rule were introduced now, it would simply move the goalposts for the future so that investors would buy back their shares, say, two days after selling them. Alternatively, investors could get around a one-day rule by selling at close on Friday and repurchasing when the markets opened for business on Monday. To be effective, the measure must provide for a reasonable period in which investors will be exposed to market risk. That is why we chose 30 days and why the Committee should reject the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham said that investors would be forced to sell and that the measure would thus encourage short-termism. The Government do not agree. If the investor retains shares in the first company for the longer period, the taper will reduce the gain chargeable on the eventual disposal, which is the whole point of these reforms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> May I just deal with the annual exempt amount? The hon. Gentleman went on to say that the annual exempt amount was a tax-free allowance and we were not allowing it to be used in every year. He knows as well as I do that the annual exempt amount reduces compliance costs by eliminating the need for computations by those realising smaller gains. Its purpose, however, is to offset real gains, not artifically created gains from bed and breakfasting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Financial Secretary is not really giving much evidence about why she cannot accept the amendments. If an investor held on to his investment for the full 10 years without making any difference, he would end up losing a capital gains tax allowance of, at current rates, £68,000. If he held on for 10 years, he would pay a higher tax rate of 24 per cent. on gains over those 10 years. Does the hon. Lady acknowledge that by using the annual CGT allowance, someone may legitimately avoid some tax altogether but would still have to pay a large tax bill, even with the full 10-year taper relief coming in? Does she agree that that is no compensation?
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have just explained to the hon. Gentleman that the annual exempt amount was not intended to provide a tax-free allowance where the same shares continue to be owned throughout. The taper and this means of calculating the gain are the way the Government want to move forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps I can just respond to the next amendment, and then the hon. Gentleman can come back.
<P>
Amendment No. 244 relates to the rolling up of the annual exempt amount. As the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham explained, it would allow the unused portion of any year's annual exempt amount to be carried forward to be set against any gains arising in the following six years of assessment. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that that would be a compliance nightmare. The amendment would undermine the purpose of an annual exempt amount, as would previous amendments. It is unacceptable for that reason.
<P>
The purpose of an annual exempt amount is to eliminate the need for people with small gains to compute their precise amount. For example, a person who sells a holding of shares of £6,000 some time in the present tax year will know that the gain on the sale must be less than £6,000. The annual exempt amount for the current year is £6,800. Assuming that the person has no other gains, he or she need go no further in quantifying the precise amount of the gain. That is an extremely significant compliance saving, and is an important part of the reason why only 150,000 people pay CGT. If the annual exempt amount were eliminated, millions of people, all with relatively small gains, would be sucked into the CGT system. I am sure that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham does not want that to happen.
<P>
The amendment would completely undermine that compliance benefit. If it were to be accepted, the person in my example would have to compute the gain on the sale even though no CGT would be immediately payable. He or she would have to do that in order to establish how much of the annual exempt amount remained available to carry forward to set against gains of subsequent years. Detailed computation would be necessary to establish a gain of £10 and to determine that £6,790 of this year's annual exempt amount was available to carry forward.
<P>
It is no answer to suggest that the way round the problem is to make the carry forward of the unused annual exempt amount subject to a claim, and that a person could basically choose whether or not he or she was affected. Such reasoning was used in an earlier debate. Everybody would calculate in practice, because anyone realising a gain in any year would wish to cover the possibility of needing the unused portion of the annual exempt amount in a later year. It is not practical to suggest the deferral of computation of previous years' gains until the unused exempt amount is needed in a later year. Quantifying a gain that arose six years previously might be difficult and would not fit with self assessment, which is often mentioned by Opposition Members and under which the liability for a year must be finalised soon after the year ends.
<P>
The amendment has the potential to make the CGT system affect millions of additional people who would have to carry out detailed computations. The Opposition would create a compliance nightmare for the very small investors that they claim to seek to assist. That cannot be sensible. The amendment is also unacceptable because of its technical deficiencies. It conflicts with the arguments of the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about simplicity and about helping those with small gains. The Committee and especially the hon. Gentleman will realise that.
<P>
The clauses tackle a major issue: the objection to bed and breakfasting is that tax consequences are crystallised, but the same shares continue to be owned by the same person. That does not apply to buying new shares with the proceeds, nor does it apply when one person sells the shares, and a different person, independently, buys shares in the same company. The Government's aim in making the new rules is to restrict a wholly tax-driven activity, triggering tax consequences while a person effectively continues to hold shares.

<B>Mr. Gibb rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was not going to speak on the clause, but I intervene to ask the hon. Lady if she accepts that, as a result of the measure, all that will happen is that people who would have bed and breakfasted their shares to utilise their annual allowance will now simply sell one share and buy another they will sell Shell and buy BP, for example. Is not this yet another Government attack on thrifty middle Britain, which nurtures its investment and diligently reads the money and personal finance pages of The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph? The Government will rue the day that they introduced the measure.
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Nobody has to do anything as a result of the measure. It will not force people to take action, it will prevent their undertaking a wholly tax-driven activity and a taper. The CGT reforms reward their investment in the long term.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton does himself an injustice because the prudent investor reads not only The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph but is an ardent reader of Accountancy Age, in which my hon. Friend writes regularly.
<P>
Before proceeding, I take the precautionary measure of declaring my interest; I am a director of a fund management firm that uses bed and breakfast as a legitimate device. I have also used the device personally for my own investments and would use it in future if it were still available, as I am a prudent, long-term investor rather than the short-term tax evader the Government will make me out to be if the clauses are enacted as drafted.
<P>
What the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said was charming nonsense. She did not counter the case for the amendments; simply to say that what we said was not true is not an adequate response to our argument.
<P>
I am inclined to press the amendments to a Division and to urge my hon. Friends to join me in voting for them. We are no longer prepared to accede to clauses 118 to 125 being steamrollered through, completely disrupting the calculation of capital gains tax and, indeed, its very nature. We are not prepared for the ending of indexation and its replacement by a pale shadow. The Government claim that it is a simplification, yet they have produced the most complicated system of capital gains tax in the western world, with new effective rates of taxation at every corner, and changes to pooling and stock dividend treatment which will be an investors' nightmare.
<P>
The implications of these clauses will need to be revisited in a couple of years' time because they will prove to be wholly unworkable, as every prudent professional is warning the Government, to little result. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, there are already ways of getting round bed and breakfast. Within hours of the Budget speech, prudent investors had come up with what has been dubbed "bed and PEPing" and "bed and spousing", which involves selling shares and buying them back through a PEP or a spouse. It is interesting that bed and PEPing and bed and spousing, or any combinatiion of the two, have not been stopped by the Government, who became aware rather late in the day that they would form a legitimate facility. The Government have not sought, in any amendments, to clamp down on those activities.
<P>
The Financial Secretary made the extraordinary claim that bed and breakfasting has to be abolished because it is a wholly tax-driven device. However, it is absurd and disingenuous to abolish bed and breakfasting because it is a wholly tax-driven device, given that so much else could be tarred with the same brush. ISAs and PEPs are wholly tax-driven devices. Investing in a pension scheme as an alternative form of saving is a wholly tax-driven device. Holding on to a business for 10 years to get the full benefit of taper relief with the abolition of retirement relief if that comes about through subsequent clauses will be a wholly tax-driven decision. The actions of this Government and the previous Government have been centred on wholly tax-driven devices. Bed and breakfasting is a legitimate use of an annual allowance. If the Government do not share that view, they should not make the annual allowance available.
<P>
The Financial Secretary had the temerity to say that bed and breakfasting will become a compliance nightmare, especially in relation to the smaller investor. The Bill is a compliance nightmare already for anybody who has to work out their own tax, be they a small investor or a larger investor. The only beneficiaries of the Bill will be found in the tax accountancy profession.
<P>
I see from the furrowing of your brow and the heaving of your bosom, Mrs. Dunwoody, that I need to press on. Tapering is no compensation for losing £68,000-worth of annual CGT relief on shares that are held for more than 10 years. The Financial Secretary was unwilling to accept the carry forward of gains. Is she implying that the Government intend in future to abolish the carry forward of losses? If we are merely putting in place a system that mirrors the one that already exists, why does that imply the creation of a compliance nightmare? Why is it acceptable to hold several shares over a 10-year period, but not the same share for that entire 10 years? Why is the second investor less prudent and less to be encouraged than the first? Do the Government intend to abolish CGT relief altogether? Does the Financial Secretary agree that the measures will hit the smaller investor disproportionately? I know the answers to those questions, and that is why I press the amendments.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I think that this is a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody, but please correct me if I am wrong. You know Exeter very well. I came in on the train this morning, and was inconvenienced by the fact that my train was one hour 10 minutes adrift. Does that mean that I am now precluded from speaking on clause 122?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. Like all Committee members, whether in good or bad voice, whether conveyed here by train, cow or donkey, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) may speak whenever he wishes, as long as he is in order. I have called clause 122, and if the hon. Gentleman wishes to speak, he may do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am extremely grateful to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I hope that I can collect my thoughts sufficiently well to say 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Luckily the Chair is not responsible for that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Unfortunately not, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I want to take this opportunity to go back to the amendment tabled by the Liberal Democrats 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman may collect his thoughts, preferably silently, but he may not go backwards. Even though he was not here, he may speak to the whole clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful for your guidance, Mrs. Dunwoody. What surprises so many of us about the clause and, perhaps, about some of the amendments that were discussed before my arrival is that it contains a thread that shows that, time and time again, those who are discriminated against in the Bill are those who are least able to pay tax and, in this instance, least able to cope without indexation relief.
<P>
We deprecate the sweeping away of indexation relief regardless of future inflation, as we deprecate the abolition of advance corporation tax and the fact that non-taxpayers will be unable to recover 10 per cent. of corporation tax paid, although the Paymaster General kindly said that he would reconsider that. The abolition of foreign earnings deductions hits the low tax payer and middle income individuals. A series of threads in the Bill intertwine for example, capital gains tax changes on interest in possession trusts. It is remarkable that, again, those who pay tax at the lower rate are most likely to be disadvantaged by the changes introduced by clause 122.
<P>
In order to redress the balance, and to try to formulate a comprehensive and realistic policy on taxation that does not discriminate against the lower tax payer, we believe that the sweeping away of indexation relief should be reconsidered by the Government. They should think again and produce realistic alternatives that do not discriminate against lower or middle income individuals.

No. 213, in page 131, line 6, leave out "2003-04" and insert "2007-08".
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We have already debated the complexity of the new CGT system, and no doubt to your great relief, Mrs. Dunwoody I do not intend to dwell further on it. We have also touched on the fact that the proposal is, overall, a tax-raising measure for the Government especially if inflation persists at a rate that is higher than the Government's target and we have discussed the fact that the entire system is riddled with perverse incentives and anomalies, which I want to discuss further because the problem is starkly illustrated by the clause.
<P>
It is unclear whether the Bill's anomalies are included in the Bill by mistake or by design. In any event, many outside observers commented adversely on the Government's failure to consult on the precise proposals. That is all the odder, in view of a story in this morning's Financial Times, which stated that since the election the Government have set up some 75 task forces. Business men have been drawn in to the Government consultation system but, sadly, their influence is entirely lacking in this part of the Bill. A clue to that effect is contained in the same story, which reveals that "the majority" of those business men
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"are from senior management and the top FTSE 100 companies."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government have yielded to the temptation simply to talk to a few big companies, which have aims and interests that often diverge from those of the smaller companies in our constituencies.
<P>
The problem is well illustrated by the whole saga of the abolition of retirement relief, which is dealt with in the clause. We know that thousands of people rely on that relief, which gives them complete relief for gains on selling their company up to £250,000, and 50 per cent. relief for gains from £250,000 to £1 million. People who have built up their own business and ploughed back the profits have contributed enormously to the country's economic well-being and provided much employment, but many of them have made inadequate provision for their retirement. They always regarded the eventual sale of their business as their pension. That was recognised by the Government on Budget day or at least in the Chancellor's speech and in the press releases that were issued.
<P>
Inland Revenue 17 a press release about the Budget pointed out that retirement relief would be phased out, and that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Many people in business will have been expected a measure of exemption from capital gains tax on their retirement during that time... Retirement relief will therefore not be fully withdrawn until the tax year 2003-04, by which time the benefits from taper relief will be substantially greater."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an incorrect statement. Taper relief will not provide greater tax relief than the abolition of retirement relief. It would be helpful if the Minister were to correct that inaccuracy.
<P>
The Government may not have understood the implications of their proposed legislation on Budget day, but that excuse no longer exists. Commentators outside the House and individuals who are affected have pointed out that phasing out retirement relief over five years puts many people at a disadvantage, as tapering relief will be phased in over 10 years.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Retirement relief will therefore have been abolished completely from 2003 to 2007, but tapering relief will not fully have been introduced. To take a simple example, the taxable gain until 1998-99 for someone who sells a business worth £250,000 will be zero under the existing retirement relief. The taxable gain will increase to £137,500 in 2003, before falling to £62,500 in 2007. That enormous hump is caused by the abolition of retirement relief taking effect before the benefits of tapering relief take effect, which is extremely distorting. It means that many people will bring their retirement forward or will be faced with the prospect of postponing it until the end of the 10-year period. It cannot be right that decisions about retirement are influenced by such tax considerations. Furthermore this is the essential point the abolition of retirement relief will be a heavier blow to owners of small businesses than any[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory]
benefit they may eventually obtain from tapering relief. In other words, the eventual 10 per cent. tax charge after 10 years will not compensate for the abolition of retirement relief. That is why the Inland Revenue press release is factually inaccurate. The Minister should take this opportunity to correct it.
<P>
My main point which relates to the core of the clause is that this penalty on smaller businesses shows the reality of new Labour priorities. The eventual 10 per cent. tax charge on business assets held for 10 years will bring huge benefits to those disposing of very large assets and will be worth much more than the abolition of retirement relief, which as I have described had a ceiling. But the new system is more onerous for smaller business men, and will never compensate for the abolition of retirement relief.
<P>
That has been pointed out consistently to the Treasury. The Chartered Institute of Taxation's submission stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there are anomalies which actually favour the better off. Currently someone selling a business realising a gain of £250,000, qualifying for maximum relief, will pay no tax, and will have an `additional' liability of £52,280 in 2003-4, whereas a taxpayer realising a gain of £2 million will achieve a tax saving of £110,000 if the disposal were delayed until 2003-4. We would be pleased to receive a justification for these changes in the context of the stated objectives."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not only the Chartered Institute of Taxation that needs such an explanation; the Committee does also. My hon. Friends and I are not the only members of the Committee who are aware of these points. Due to the good work by the Forum of Private Business, we know that all members of the Committee have been given specific examples of their constituents and others who will be badly affected by the changes. The forum has helpfully compiled a dossier of letters from people who do not mind their examples being quoted. A member in Lowestoft writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The vast majority of privately owned companies, are sold for a price which is not dissimilar to the net asset value of the company ... Therefore these `retained profits' have already been taxed once ie. a corporation tax charge will have been paid on all profits retained ... Retirement relief did to some extent alleviate a double tax charge".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a valid point, because retirement relief was not just a bonus; it prevented an element of double taxation.
<P>
Joyce's Florists in the constituency of the Paymaster General sadly, he is again absent from the Committee fully supports the campaign of the Forum of Private Business to have the matter corrected. If that is not enough, Mrs. I. Robinson of Robinson and Co. I believe that she is not a relation of the Paymaster General writes from Keynsham, which is also a Labour constituency, stating that she is severely disabled by polio, but nevertheless has managed to build up a significant business. She writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I have not been able to afford to put much money into pension schemes in the past ... Even these schemes have been raided by the government in their first budget which removed the tax advantages of investing in pension schemes by stealing the tax credits on the dividend income ... Under the new proposals I will lose all entitlement to retirement relief and by 2003 will only be deemed to have owned my business for six years and not ten, (what a ridiculous rule), so I will not even be eligible for the reduced rate of CGT of 10 per cent."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will quote only briefly from his individual cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Indeed. I am ever anxious to obey your injunctions, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I shall resist the temptation to quote even from the constituent of the hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Plaskitt), who is, I understand, a member of the Committee. I do so in the knowledge that he will wish to contribute to our debate and represent the interests of his constituents. I have many examples in my dossier of people in Opposition Members' constituencies who have written specifically to object to the clause. It is important to have a substantial debate on the matter and to give Opposition Members the opportunity to represent those interests and to reply to the valid points that have been registered.
<P>
The Government are introducing regressive taxation. We are used to new Labour having abandoned almost all of its ancient principles, but we believed that they had a vestigial attachment to at least the principle of progressive taxation that those who are very well off should pay more tax than those who are less well off. We have here an example of regressive taxation. Those who sell huge business assets will pay less tax than modest entrepreneurs who sell a small business. There are many examples of regressive taxation in the Bill. This morning, we were reminded of the treatment of overseas earnings. The Government leave in place a concession for the very rich, who can become non-tax residents, but remove the foreign earnings deduction, which hits overseas workers, including aid workers, who cannot avail themselves of that concession. That is a good example of the Government's new sense of social priorities benefiting the rich and hitting the less well-off. The abolition of dividend tax credits for non-taxpayers is another example that is fresh in our minds.
<P>
A pattern is beginning to emerge in which the Government, either accidentally we do not yet know whether this is a mistake or by design, are erecting a regressive tax system. That may be on orders from No. 10 Downing Street. Perhaps they want to benefit those donors of large sums to the Labour Party who have been prominent in the press. We await the Financial Secretary's response on the matter.
<P>
The Opposition are trying to correct the anomaly. Our amendments would extend the phasing out of retirement relief, so that businesses were no less well or badly off. The amendments would balance the phasing out of retirement relief with the phasing in of the new tapering benefit. We have made clear our position on the overall proess of capital gains tax. In the light of it, we regard the amendments as a second-best solution. They may not be arithmetically perfect, but they would correct an injustice. As it stands the clause is a fat cat benefit charter.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Are Opposition Membes aware that thoe who made a £250,000 gain prior to the Budget would have paid no capital gains tax, but will have to pay £25,000 in CGT post-Budget? Are they also aware that, when the new retirement rules are in place, the amount of CGT payable on gains of £10 million will be £1 million, where approximately £3.75 million would have been payable prior to the Budget? [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We really must not be joined by Members who are not Committee members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman supports my point entirely. The retirement relief that the Government are abolishing was targeted at smaller entrepreneurs and those disposing of smaller businesses, which is why it had a ceiling. That ceiling is being removed and replaced by a taper that will bring massive extra benefits to rich business men who dispose of huge business assets or companies.
<P>
The net effect will be a transfer of tax relief from the less well-off to the better-off. Is that the clause's deliberate intention, it is an extraordinary admission of the real political and special priorities of new Labour. However, there may be a charitable explanation. Given the other mistakes and anomalies that we have discovered in the Bill, perhaps the Government made a mistake and genuinely had not figured out the problem by Budget day.
<P>
We predict that the Government will be forced to table amenements either to this Bill or to future Finance Bills. This is a good opportunity for the Government to admit their mistake and to accept the principle, at least, of our amendments. Otherwise, a fat cat benefit charter will remain on the statute book. Such a charter may be the priority of the Labour leadership. We shall soon discover whether it is the priority of each and every member of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The Inland Revenue press release, which introduced the proposals, stated that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The phasing out of retirement relief is part of the Chancellor's wider proposals for reform of capital gains tax ... designed to encourage long-term investment, promote entrepreneurial activity and introduce a fairer tax system."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The truth is that the proposals will have precisely the opposite effect.
<P>
Currently, if an entrepreneur is aged 50 or over, or retires through ill health after owning the business for 10 years, the whole of any capital gain up to the first £250,000 is free of tax. Any gain of between £250,000 and £1 million would be subject to tax of half the rates.
<P>
The clause means that the exempt amount for a person retiring after April 1999 will be reduced to £200,000 and that the upper limit will be reduced to £800,000. Those amounts will be reduced in each of the following three years until 2003-04, when no retirement relief at all will be available to the retiring entrepreneur.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government claim that the clause will promote entrepreneurial activity, but the CBI belives that the measure will
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provide a clear incentive for entrepreneurs who would otherwise by contemplating retirement in 5 years' time to bring forward their retirement."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the only sensible advice that could be given to Mr. Roy Dixon of T. F. W. Dixon and Son in Bromsgrove, who wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). She took the trouble to bring it to my attention, and I commend her for that. It is a pity that Labour Members do not act on behalf of their constituents. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) said, we have seen letters from businesses in the constituencies of Labour Members who have not taken the trouble to bring their constituents worries to the attention of the Committee.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove has given me a copy of the letter from Mr. Dixon, in which he states that he and his wife, both in their mid-50s, built up a successful refractory engineering company in the town. It was a risky enterprise; they put all their effort and money into it, and their hard work and diligence made it a success.
<P>
Mr. Dixon believes that the clause discriminates against smaller companies. He writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We feel that we have endured the rigors of long hours, nil pension contributions ... risking all that we own; only to be told that to obtain similar allowances to those that existed under previous legislation, we either have to re-schedule retirement ... or incur increased taxation if we carry out our planned retirement earlier."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A key point is that that couple have invested all their spare cash and effort into their business. They have no spare money to build up a pension scheme.
<P>
Will the Financial Secretary explain how the clause will help companies such as T.F.W. Dixon and Son in Bromsgrove? Or is a refractory engineering business insufficiently Cool Britannia for new Labour, and so not worth helping?
<P>
Yesterday, I reread the 17 March Budget statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, paying special attention to the passage dealing with capital gains tax reform column 1101 of the Hansard for 17 March, if Labour Members want to read it again. The Chancellor spoke about the new tapering system, and concluded by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My message to business is: `When you are ready to start out, start up, start investing or start hiring, this Government are on your side.'" [Official Report, 17 March 1998; Vol. 308, c. 1101.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no mention there of capital gains tax reform, or of the abolition of retirement relief. Funny that: an important statement about capital gains tax reform omits mention of the reform's most important element, the abolition of retirement relief.
<P>
Perhaps, as the Law Society has noted, that is because the proposed abolition
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"goes against the stated intention of the Government to encourage small businesses."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am afraid that it is all new Labour hype, concealing the fact that the policy will achieve the exact opposite of what the Government pretend. According to figures from the Chartered Institute of Taxation, based on the figures in clause 138, a person retiring next year with a gain of £250,000 will pay £5,780 more tax as a result of the proposals. A person retiring in 2003-04 will pay £52,280 more.
<P>
A gain of £500,000 will cost an entrepreneur who retires at the end of the five-year phase-out period in 2003-04 £60,000 more than under the current regime. A gain of £1 million on the disposal of a business on retirement will cost £70,000 more in tax as a result of the clause. However here in the rub a gain of £1.5 million will cost £20,000 less in tax in the year 2003-04 and a gain of £2 million will cost £110,000 less. That is absurd given Labour's hype about helping smaller entrepreneurs. Again, however, the hype hides the[Mr. Nick Gibb]
precise opposite of the policy that the Government propose.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 110, 212, and 213 although principally amendment No. 212, which is the key amendment in the debate seek to extend the phase-out of retirement relief beyond the five years proposed in the clause to 10 years. We are trying to match as much as possible the phase-out of retirement relief to the introduction of tapering relief. Many outside commentators and Opposition Members find it absurd that the phasing out of retirement relief does not match the full 10-year taper. Amendment No. 212 would do that, and I urge the Government to accept it. There may be defects in it there are defects in amendment No. 110 but the Government could at least accept the principle that is set out in it so that the phasing out of retirement relief matches the introduction of tapering relief on capital gains. Having said that, the decision to phase out retirement relief is grossly unfair, and the way in which it has been implemented penalises smaller businesses, such as T.F.W. Dixon and Son Ltd. in Bromsgrove.
<P>
In conclusion, many small businesses represent the retirement plans the pensions of thousands of entrepreneurs. The measure will cut a large chunk off the value of those pension plans in much the same way as the Government's decision to abolish the repayment of dividend tax credits to pension funds confiscates £5 billion every year from the pension schemes of the rest of the population. This is an anti-retired person clause, just as this is an anti-age and anti-enterprise Government, as so many previous Labour Governments were.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. Ruffley. Sorry, Mr. Loughton.

<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I am wounded, but grateful.

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> How could you forget such a charming man, Mrs. Dunwoody?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I will not mention what I might have mentioned. I realise that I may have offended you in earlier references, Mrs. Dunwoody, and that you are merely taking your revenge.
<P>
It is worth starting by noting that just seven Labour Members were present during the opening speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells on the amendment that is rather less than half their strength. Yet, the clause will probably affect dozens of small businesses in the constituency of every member of the Committee. I doubt whether any member of the Committee has not received letters from constituents who will be severely affected by it. [Interruption.] If Labour Members are saying from sedentary positions that none of their constituents is concerned about the measure, that speaks volumes about how effective their constituents think they are in representing their interests in the Committee. It also speaks volumes about their ability to communicate with their constituents perhaps they have not even noticed the post that they have been sent.
<P>
<B>Dr. Lewis Moonie: </B>(Kirkcaldy): On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. I suspect that slurs on hon. Members' behaviour are not acceptable.

<P>

<B>Dr. Moonie:</B> I have received no such communication from my constituents. I see every piece of mail that comes from them. Will the hon. Gentleman now withdraw his remark, as it refers to me?
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> The Financial Secretary estimated in a written answer that approximately 10,000 people benefited from CGT retirement last year. I pointed out that, purely on statistical grounds, every member of the Committee would inevitably have constituents affected by the proposal. If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he has received no communication on the matter, I am prepared to withdraw my second allegation, but I persist with my first, which suggests that the hon. Gentleman's constituents do not think it worth writing to him. That is the implication of what he has said.
<P>
Let us get down to the nuts and bolts. The proposal to abolish retirement tax relief is a new tax. Until now, if a small business owner came to sell his business and had made a profit on it of no more than £250,000, he would not be liable for tax. When indeed, if the clause comes into effect, those business people will be subject to a new tax. That is yet another new tax to add to the many new taxes that we have already seen in the first 13 months of this Government.
<P>
In addition to claiming that at least 10,000 people used the benefit last year alone, the Financial Secretary estimated in another written answer that if the current retirement relief thresholds of £250,000 and £1 million applied in the year 2003-04, assuming unchanged tax-led behaviour, the cost of retirement relief would be around £200 million. That is a big benefit. This major measure will affect a great many people with serious amounts of money. I should have thought that on those calculations alone, the issue merits rather better attendance in Committee by Labour Members than we have seen so far.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, retirement relief rewards entrepeneurs who have worked hard to build up long-term businesses. It has also acted as an incentive for people to set up their own businesses. The proposed axing of retirement relief in favour of tapering relief will help richer business people rather than less-well-off small business men whose businesses are worth less than £500,000.
<P>
The Forum of Private Business, which was quoted earlier, says that almost 98 per cent. of businesses have net assets of less than £500,000 and that the owners of those businesses are likely to have gains of approximately £250,000 on retirement. That shows how many people will be drastically affected by the proposals and the figures behind them. Up to now, those business people woud have paid little or no tax on retirement, but when the measure comes into effect, they will have a tax bill of up to £55,000 or, at the very best, they will pay capital gains tax of 10 per cent. if they hold on to gain the advantage of the full 10 years of taper relief.
<P>
Business owners aged over 50 who have to retire between 2003 and 2008 will be hit doubly hard because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, although retirement relief will have disappeared, the new system of tapering will not fully have come in.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) obtained an Adjournment debate on the abolition of retirement relief on 8 May. He drew attention to his constituents, Roy and Jean Conway, who own Candlesticks Lodge restaurant in Ringwood. I gather that it is a successful restaurant, which is well worth a visit from Labour Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I have been there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Indeed, my Liberal Democrat colleague has been there. I am sure that he will vouchsafe what I say.
<P>
Mr. Conway is 60 and his wife Jean is 59. They have run the Candlesticks Lodge restaurant for 15 years, nursing it through two recessions. They were hoping to retire by 2003, at which stage their business will be likely to yield a profit of around £250,000. Until now, they would not have had to pay any capital gains tax on that. However, if they go ahead with their plan, which they have fostered for many years, they will face a tax bill of some £55,000. If their business were worth double that amount, and they could sell it for £2 million, the tax bill would not be as disproportionately large.
<P>
Mr. Conway was so incensed that he wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. He referred to the disastrous effects that the new rules would have on many small family businesses. He wrote that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the proposed changes are bound to cause severe damage to retirement plans."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The letter states that the proposed legislation pays no attention to businesses that involve
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"proprietors `living above the shop', such as restaurants, pubs, shops, farms, etc."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He is rightly dumbfounded by the proposed legislation and by what the Government will achieve.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Conway are, by all accounts, model investors. They have worked hard for many years to build up a successful long-term business. They have worked hard on that business for the past 15 years. They are not short-term speculators, and even exceed the 10-year criteria for the taper that the Government are introducing. They have provided a great deal of local employment, but they have invested in their business for their retirement. Their business is their pension plan. As they have reinvested so much into the business, they have not had ready cash to invest in a pension plan as well. At a stroke, the clause will plunder a sizeable part of the Conways' pension fund. When they sell the restaurant above which they have lived, they will try to buy another property. The Government are taking away the capital that they will need to buy an alternative home when they no longer own their present property.
<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Conway have three options, as no doubt the Financial Secretary will soon remind the Committee. They can take the hit on the nose and pay a large amount of tax. They can hang around for an extra five years beyond their original retirement plans, by the end of which they will still pay a 10 per cent. CGT rate on the gain on the property. That will mean a massive change in their lifestyle plans. Finally, they can dash for early retirement, which will also disrupt their long-term plans.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West secured an Adjournment debate on the matter, as I said. Curiously, the Paymaster General made an appearance in place of the Financial Secretary, who would usually be expected to reply on the subject. It is rather ironic that the Paymaster General pushed himself forward on a matter about which he has since been so shy in coming forward, as the Committee has seen. In replying to the very pertinent points made by my hon. Friend in relation to the Conways, he could not offer any relief. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"At the heart of the reform is the introduction of the new taper relief",
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The relief gives rise to much litigation".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is of no consequence to the Conways. He also said that there would now be no discrimination on age and no lifetime limits. That does not compensate the Conways and is not part of their plans. The Paymaster General said that the measures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provide a real incentive for all businesses to grow."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Here's the rub at the end of the debate, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are unashamedly in favour of those who can create big businesses". [Official Report, 8 May 1998; Vol. 311, c. 1006-07.]
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The 98 per cent. of business owners who own businesses that do not qualify as big businesses in the Paymaster General's terminology will suffer. That is because the Government, the Paymaster General and the Financial Secreary are interested only in big business, and not in the backbone of British business, which is small business. Small business involves entrepreneurs who have worked hard and long, not short-term speculators. The Government are saying that such people, who provide employment opportunities and are the key to future employment opportunities, do not matter. The Government are yet again concerned only with the voice of big business.
<P>
The clause and the amendments do not concern big business or fat cats. The sum of £500,000 could buy an index-linked pension of some £25,000 per annum, and £250,000 would buy one of £12,000 to £12,500 per annum. Those are not enormous amounts of money on which to retire, yet the withdrawal of retirement relief will eat substantially into the capital sums available for people to buy pension funds, annuities or whatever.
<P>
Typically, the people to benefit from retirement relief are the owners of small hotels, rest homes and manufacturing businesses. We heard earlier about the Conways, who own a restaurant, and my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton told us about the manufacturing business in Bromsgrove. Such businesses are especially capital intensive: they require[Mr. Loughton]
their owners to plough money back into them to help them through the tough times.
<P>
I do not know the details of their personal circumstances, but I am sure that, to keep their businesses going, the Conways and other similar business people have taken low pay through many years of poor conditions. The Federation of Small Businesses calculates that 63 per cent. or nearly two-thirds of Britain's self-employed have an annual income of below £12,000. Those small business men and women are not fat cats. They have worked hard and are already being hit by a raft of other Government measures: they bear the brunt of the extra regulation from Europe in the social chapter requirements, and they will suffer from the requirements of the minimum wage.
<P>
Any pension funds built up by small business men or women were raided last year when advance corporation tax was ended. Those people are of an age that means that they are likely to have children going to university, if they are lucky. Their children have been hit by the Government's disgraceful introduction of tuition fees, over which there was a Back Bench revolt last week. Last week, in addition, mortgage interest rates rose for the sixth time another bit of ammunition with which to clout small business men and women.
<P>
No wonder that a substantial number of Labour Back benchers have signed an early-day motion condemning this clause abolishing retirement relief.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are discussing not early-day motions but a specific amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I merely mentioned it in passing, Mrs. Dunwoody, and am grateful to be brought back to the straight and narrow.
<P>
I shall conclude by saying that the amendment proposes variations in what is, overall, a bad measure. I support amendment No. 110 in particular, which recognises that all the clause's proposals for abolishing retirement relief are a complete and utter shambles and should be done away with altogether.
<P>
Through the clause, the Government yet again show themselves to be the major fan of the nanny state. They want to coerce people in their choice of lifestyle and eating habits, and lots of other things, and they want to coerce people in regard to their retirement lifestyles as well. People will be forced to sell now unplanned, and at a time that may not be most advantageous for them so that they can keep their retirement plans intact.
<P>
The clause's specific proposals are a mess. As has been noted, the phasing-out of retirement relief is completely out of sync with the introduction of the taper relief. Retirement planning takes at least 10 years. The abolition of retirement relief will force responsible people who own businesses and plan for the long term to start all over again.
<P>
The clause penalises responsible business people: the amendment would reverse that. The Government are not keen on accepting amendments to the Bill, and I fear that they will reject this one. The result will be that prudent small business men and women, the backbone of enterprise in this country, will join those other groups of responsible citizens condemned and tarred by the Government as fat-cat tax avoiders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown </B>(Cotswold): The amendments that we have tabled on clause 138, which deal with capital gains retirement relief, show yet again that it is Conservative Members who are prepared to protect small business men and women over 50, who have worked hard all their lives and provided employment, entrepreneurial activity and investment, and have thereby benefited the country's economy. The Government, having introduced this iniquitous clause, clearly do not share that attitude.
<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Budget day press release" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the rules about repetition. I hope that we are not going to hear the same quotes again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> The quote has not, to my knowledge, been used in the debate, Mrs. Dunwoody. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Budget day press release indicated that retirement relief was no longer necessary for a system that taxes gains on businesses at only 10 per cent."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that that will be the Financial Secretary's response to the debate. However, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells has pointed out, the mischief of the clause lies in the fact that the tapering relief and the retirement relief cover two different periods. The retirement relief covers five years, while the tapering relief covers 10 years. People who retire in the middle years, with less than £500,000 will be disadvantaged. The Institute of Chartered Accountants makes that point. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the phasing out of retirement relief takes place far more rapidly than the tapering of the gains. Many people will be unfairly penalised where they dispose of businesses within the next five years. We strongly suggest that during that period a taxpayer should be able to opt to forgo taper relief and instead claim retirement relief at the current levels.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is precisely what our amendments would achieve.
<P>
The clause hits smaller business men who are over 50 and would normally be entitled to retirement relief. I remind the Committee that they have paid tax on the profits. If they are in a partnership they have paid income tax; if they are in an incorporated business they have paid corporation tax. They will, in effect, pay tax twice. That is extremely unfair.
<P>
Many such entrepeneurs have not taken out proper retirement provisions because they expected, encouraged over many years by Governments of both parties, to have built up a retirement fund through their business. They expected to sell the business to members of their family, or others for a realistic amount of money. They have not built up a pension fund. You and I, Mrs. Dunwoody, have worked hard in the House of Commons. If we achieve 20 years of service, we shall have accumulated an index-linked pension of about £25,000. A business worth £500,000 will finance the purchase of such a pension. The differential that our amendments seek to address relates precisely to the income that, had we been business men rather than Members of Parliament, we would have been able to accumulate if we had used a bit of entrepreneurial skill. Small businesses will be hit unless our amendment is accepted.
<P>
The clause contains a further mischief that has not yet been discussed. As the scheme starts in 1998, people selling in the middle of the taper period say, in 2003 will be deemed to have held that business only for five years. They will therefore get only five years worth of relief, although they may have held the business for 20 years. That is a further unfairness.
<P>
Figures have been given to show how larger businesses will benefit under the clause, whereas smaller businesses will be disadvantaged in the intervening tapering years. That is the nonsense of the clause, as drafted, which our amendments seek to put right. Somebody who sold a business for less than £500,000, which would buy less than the pension that hon. Members who have served 20 years can buy, would be disadvantaged to the tune of £52,000 during the intervening years, whereas someone who sold a business for £1 million would be advantaged to the tune of £110,000.
<P>
The clause as drafted is complete nonsense. It goes against all the principles of taxation that the rich should be asked to pay a little more and the poorer should be asked to pay a little less. The clause will achieve the opposite. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to justify fully why the clause, as it affects tapering relief and retirement relief, which do not interchange with each other, is drafted in this way.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The message to small business men is retire now before the provisions come into operation on 5 April 1999 or wait until the taper comes fully into operation in 2007. This taxation provision will be extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome for those who are expecting to retire in the interim. What are they supposed to do? Are they to stagger on, making unsatisfactory business decisions because they are getting older and less able to cope? Are they to stagger on, not allowing their dependants to succeed them in the business?
<P>
The Financial Secretary must give the Committee some answers. Some people will have planned their retirement at 65 in 2003 on the basis that they will be able to take a chunk out of their business. They will now have to hang on longer because they will not have sufficient money on which to retire and buy a decent pension. All entrepreneurs in this country have the right to work hard during their liftime and retire with a decent standard of living. They have been encouraged to do so by successive Governments, but this Government will prevent them from doing that.
<P>
Our amendments would introduce some fairness into the system. Although they may be technically deficient, I hope that the Financial Secretary will have sympathy with the principle behind them. If she does not, she should explain clearly to those entrepreneurs who will be disadvantaged why she is not prepared to accept them. Everyone will listen to her reply with great interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Shaun Woodward </B>(Witney): This has been an interesting debate. The amendments are important because they go beyond their purpose to the heart of whether the Government are seriously prepared to listen to sensible lobbying which, in this case, was carried out by many small private businesses up and down the country. That lobbying was extended not only to Conservative members of the Committee but to all members and, I suspect, most hon. Members in the House.
<P>
Everyone in this Room represents many businesses that will be affected. It is worthy of note that Labour members of the Committee have not spoken up for their small businesses although they will have received the same information as us. They have had an opportunity today to stand up and say that some serious and crucial points are being made about the nature of the clause. I appreciate that they would not say that the Goverment are completely wrong, but they could accept the principle raised by the amendments. It is neither here nor there whether they are technically deficient.
<P>
We will be waiting to see whether the Financial Secretary simply reads out a speech that she brought to the Committee or whether she thinks that there is merit in the arguments. [Interruption.] It is interesting that Labour Members now wish to undermine the arguments. Rather than making unhelpful interventions, perhaps they will rise to their feet and speak on behalf of the businesses that they represent. The truth is that the amendments would protect the small business man who feels threatened as a result of the clause; the small business man who has been an entrepreneur and who feels that the very spirit that drove him to invest is being undermined; the small business man and his or her partner who are worried about their future as a result of the clause. If nothing else, the amendments would do something to help those people to protect their pensions.
<P>
Many examples could be given, and many have already been given by Conservative Members of the Committee the Government could give the same examples of how their constituents will be hit by the proposals. One couple who wrote to me said that the Budget has seriously affected small business people, who, like themselves, have worked hard to build up a business with the prospect that, when they retired, it would give them a secure pension. The clause robs them of that security, and it will affect not a few people, as some other clauses have, but hundreds of thousands of people.
<P>
It will be a shame if, this morning, the Financial Secretary simply sits through the speeches of Conservative Members and takes no notice whatsoever of the representations that have been made. If people outside the House are to continue to respect the Committee, it would be worthy of the Financial Secretary to show that she has taken note of what has been said, and that she recognises the difficult situation in which the Government are placing business people.
<P>
By and large, we are talking about modest businesses making modest profits. Like other clauses in the Bill, this clause is dressed up in the grandiose language of wanting to stop tax avoidance by those who have a great deal of money, and of wanting to prevent rock and film stars from evading income tax. However, it will affect small business people, who have built up modest businesses with modest profits, but who were relying on[Mr. Shaun Woodward]
being able to turn those profits into some sort of security in their old age.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Such people built up savings with encouragement from previous Governments of both colours over many decades. It is unfair that they should now be penalised when they could have expected to retire with a sum free of CGT.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> My hon. Friend makes a very important point, the spirit of which I shall develop because it is not only that such people will be penalised; they will feel, quite rightly I hope that the Financial Secretary will deal with this point that they effectively made an undertaking with the Inland Revenue and with previous Governments, and that the Government are now driving a coach and horses through that undertaking.
<P>
The plans of those small business people will not be realised because of a change in the legislation. Their agreements were entered into on the basis that they would receive retirement relief, but now they find that they are locked into a deal that, retrospectively, the Chancellor has crippled. The irony is that the new system will favour those businesses that have large capital gains effectively, those that can walk away with a gain of more than £500,000 which does not include most of this country's businesses. Most small businesses will not realise gains on that scale their gains will be smaller but the proposal will have its biggest impact on them.
<P>
Opposition Members have no objection to the idea of people making profit, but the Government did when they were in Opposition. Until they formed a Government last year they singularly demonstrated an objection to the idea of profit.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the amendment's terms are precisely drawn and that this is not a clause stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am grateful for that reminder, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
When we come to the clause stand part debate, I am sure that Labour Members will give their reasons 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether we have a clause stand part debate depends on the length of our discussion on the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Woodward:</B> I am once again grateful for your reminder, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<P>
I hope that Labour Members will ensure that they speak on behalf of small businesses whether in relation to the amendments or in the clause stand part debate, if we have one. The proposals will hit small business men hard. If the Government believe that they will not, it is incumbent on the Financial Secretary to explain that. All the mathematics suggests that they will be severely hit by the way in which the new system of taper relief does not allow for indexation and, as I said earlier, because business men will not walk away with substantial gains.
<P>
What is the Financial Secretary's response to the problems that are faced by people who are planning to retire in the next few years. If the amendments are not accepted, those people will face pressing problems this unfair legislation means that they will lose out. Has she thought through the representations of the Forum of Private Business, which was mentioned earlier? Why did she, for example, decide not to accept its suggestion of bringing in a taper over seven years, which would taper to zero per cent. by the end of that period? Why will there be no backdating to the time at which the asset was created? The proposals favour new investment which we all want to encourage but it does nothing for those who have already made an investment, and they are the people who will be most severely hit.
<P>
It is interesting to note that many Labour Members signed the early-day motion, but unfortunately they have not spoken in this debate on behalf of their constituents. I hope that they were not prevented from speaking and that they have not decided that it is better to do what their pagers rather than their constituents tell them to do.
<P>
The clause will hit people's pension plans and it will discourage them from making investments. It hits at the heart of the entrepreneurial spirit, which this country needs for a successful business future. When the Financial Secretary responds to the debate sadly, contributions have come only from the Opposition Benches I hope that she takes into account the fact that we are speaking up for small businesses. Small business men want the Government to give a proper, decent and considered response and they should explain why the clause will penalise small businesses so harshly.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I apologise for being absent earlier. I have canvassed my colleagues and hope that I shall not stray into repetition.
<P>
I cannot understand the logic of the Government's proposal to remove the retirement relief faster than the taper is being introduced. That is inconsistent and difficult to justify on moral grounds and is an attack on small business owners. As my hon. Friends have emphasised, many people who run small businesses are not able to make contributions to pension funds. They may plan to do so and they may intend to do so, but the reality of runing a small business is that the demands on cash flow often make it impossible to do what owners would like to do or have planned to do. Many small business owners find themselves at the end of their business careers with inadequate pension provision and have relief on the relief provided to be able to take a lump sum out of their businesses on retirement to enable them to provide for themselves.
<P>
If such people had been able to make contributions to a personal pension fund during their self-employment, they would have discovered that generous tax relief is available when contributions are made and that a tax-free lump sum can be taken out of a pension fund on retirement. Many people who are faced with the possibility of disposing of a small business and taking the capital gain without the full benefit of the relief will not understand why there is disparity of treatment between those who can save and provide for their pensions through formal pension funds and those who do what might be considered more helpful for the dynamism of the economy and save for their retirement by investing in their businesses. That is at the heart of the unfairness felt by many small business owners.
<P>
I shall not go further because my hon. Friends made the points that needed to be made. The measure sends an unhelpful signal to the small business community. Many Labour Members will have received letters from their constituents and if they are not minded to contribute to the debate, I hope that some will feel minded to raise the issues during the debate on the small business agenda on the Floor of the House on Friday.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Perhaps it would be helpful if I told the Committee that I do not anticipate a stand part debate on the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fallon:</B> This has been one of the Committee's more important debates on a specific provision. I shall summarise the case for the amendment, not for you, Mrs. Dunwoody, or my hon. Friends, but for Labour Members who do not yet seem to understand or appreciate the precise gravity of the proposal. A business man or woman who previously qualified for retirement relief, having owned a business for 10 years or more, will gradually lose that relief over the next five years while it will take that business man or woman 10 years from 6 April to reach the maximum relief available under the new taper relief. That is the situation now confronting small businesses, family businesses, shopkeepers, restaurant owners and hoteliers up and down the country. Those are, as my hon. Friend said, the very backbone of British business. The most damaging effect of the clause will be felt by those over 50. For many of them their retirement fund will be their only source of income and that applies much more heavily to those running the smallest businesses. Such people can escape the penalties of the clause by selling their businesses this year. Does the Financial Secretary want a wave of small businesses to sell out before April next year? That is no way to encourage long-term investment by the small business sector.
<P>
Those who were already planning to retire in four of five years' time will now be forced to change their plans. Stuart Bird, a constituent of mine, wrote to me to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In my case at age 52 retirement at 57 seems out of the question ... This tax by stealth, is so deceptive and gives you no opportunity to plan ahead."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a voice from the small business sector commenting directly on the proposal.
<P>
The Government's wide-ranging consultation exercise set no parameters for the reform of capital gains tax, but the Government have announced legislation that has immediate effect. That effect will not be simplification; on the contrary, as my hon. Friends have said, it will be an immense complication. Secondly, it will not be neutral, it will raise revenue. Trading off indexation for tapers must produce losers. The Budget press release accompanying this clause was coy. It described the effect of the new provision as "broadly neutral". It gave a cost of £25 million in the year beginning 1999, and a yield of £25 million in the year beginning 2000. After that, there was silence. The new capital gains tax system is clearly intended to raise revenue rather than to save it. I shall be grateful if the Financial Secretary will at least confirm the figures for the third and fourth years.
<P>
The main effect of the proposal will be to discourage entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs who own businesses that increase in value by no more than £250,000 above the rate of inflation previously paid no capital gains tax. They will now pay capital gains tax of at least 10 per cent. The retirement relief will be phased out faster than the taper relief will be phased in.
 Labour Members do not have to accept my argument; the British Venture Capital Association stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The proposed period of taper is too long to act as a strong incentive to encourage investment in entrepreneurial businesses."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The British Chambers of Commerce stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the imposition of such a significant change at such notice to the tax regime would create a major inequity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Forum of Private Business wrote a letter to the Paymaster General, which was copied to the Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry and to the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Disability Rights, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the imposition of such a significant change at such notice to the tax regime would create a major inequity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The proposal will not encourage the entrepreneurs that the Government claim it will.
<P>
The saddest aspect of this debate has been the silence of Labour Members. I forecast at the beginning of these proceedings, many weeks ago, that we would witness the silence of the lambs this summer. The early day motion of a couple of days ago dealt directly with the phasing-out of the relief to which the amendment is addressed. Thirteen Labour Members signed the motion, saying that the phasing out of the relief would have a detrimental effect on small business owners. If that is the view of the Labour hon. Member for St. Albans (Mr. Pollard), why is it not the view of the Labour hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall), who sits silently on this Committee? If it is the view of the Labour hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara), why is it not the view of the Labour hon. Member for Hull, West and Hessle (Mr. Johnson), who also sits silently on this Committee? If it is the view of the Labour hon. Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Mr. Austin), why is it not the view of the Labour hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford), who sits silently in the Committee? It is the view of the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), who is concerned about the effect on small businesses, but the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunsdale (Miss Smith), who sits silently in the Committee, does not appear to be concerned for the small businesses and shopkeepers in her constituency. It is the concern of the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley), who was prepared to sign an early-day motion, but it is not the concern of his fellow Yorkshireman, the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), who has sat silently throughout the Committee's proceedings. I have made my point. [Hon. Members: "What about us?"] I assure those hon. Members who complain thay they have not so far been mentioned that we shall draw attention to their silence[Mr. Fallon]
on behalf of small businesses to their local newspapers, their local chambers of commerce amd their constituents who have written to us asking us to take up their cases through the excellent representations of the Forum of Private Business amd the Federation of Small Businesses.
<P>
In conclusion, the Paymaster General, who is again absent from the Committee has responded to a similar debate on the Floor of the House on 8 May, but is ashamed to present himself to the Committee because we are discussing capital gains tax suggested that the wider relief available under the taper relief and the more generous nature of that relief would solve the problem. Let me make it clear to the Financial Secretary that removal of some of the restrictions on the previous relief and the more generous nature of that relief are meaningless unless we properly realign withdrawal of the retirement relief with the introduction of the taper. This is what the amendment seeks to do and I commend it, not only to my hon. Friends but to Labour Members.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> At the outset of the debate, it is important to put it in context. First, as Opposition Members have said, the application of CGT in retirement relief is complex, narrow and capricious and does little to encourage long-term investment and business growth. The taper relief, in contrast, is much simpler; it will apply to everyone, be more wide ranging and certain in its application and, most important, will encourage all those who run businesses to invest for the long term and expand their businesses. That will benefit everyone.
<P>
To assist the Committee, I shall contrast retirement relief with the taper relief. Retirement relief is available only to the over-50s and those who retire on grounds of ill-health [Interruption.] Opposition Members always laugh when they do not like the answers to their questions and do not want to hear them. Our proceedings have been lengthy and I am now used to the tactic.
<P>
The taper relief does not depend on age and there is no lifetime limit. Many people missed out on retirement relief because that had to sell while their business continued. The definition of a business asset is wider for taper relief than for retirement relief. A shareholder with a substantial interest in the company will receive relief without having to be a full-time employee in the company. More people will have access to the new system than to the old system.
<P>
It is well known, as Opposition Members have said, that retirement relief is difficult for business persons to understand. They know it is open to a lot of litigation and is difficult to understand.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clifton-Brown:</B> Will the Financial Secretary comment on the value of taper relief, which is becoming worth less by the day? We have had new inflation figures this morning which show that inflation has risen yet again, so the taper relief will be worth less and less.
<P>
It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
