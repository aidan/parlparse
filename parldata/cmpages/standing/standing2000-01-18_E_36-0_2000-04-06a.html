<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Seconds out, final round. 
<H4><center>New clause 37</center></H4>
<H4><center>Standards</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the setting of standards to be complied with in relation to railway assets, railway vehicles or railway services.
<P>
(2) The regulations may provide—
<P>
(a) for standards to be set (and from time to time varied), or
<P>
(b) for compliance with standards to be monitored,
<P>
by persons specified in, or designated in accordance with, the regulations.
<P>
(3) The regulations may authorise the setting of standards which involve obtaining the approval of any person.
<P>
(4) The regulations may authorise the charging of fees in respect of—
<P>
(a) the monitoring of compliance with standards, or
<P>
(b) the seeking of approvals in connection with standards.
<P>
(5) The regulations may impose requirements to provide information on persons who—
<P>
(a) are required to comply with standards, or
<P>
(b) set, or monitor compliance with, standards,
<P>
and prohibit the giving of false information.
<P>
(6) The regulations may create criminal offences in respect of failures to comply with requirements imposed by the regulations punishable on summary conviction with fines not exceeding—
<P>
(a) level 5 on the standard scale, or
<P>
(b) such lower amount as may be prescribed.
<P>
(7) The regulations may make different provision for different cases and may (in particular) include provision—
<P>
(a) authorising conditional or unconditional dispensation from requirements imposed by the regulations which would otherwise apply, or
<P>
(b) requiring compliance with requirements so imposed which would not otherwise apply,
<P>
in particular cases or descriptions of case.
<P>
(8) The regulations may include such incidental, consequential, supplementary or transitional provisions or savings as the Secretary of State may consider appropriate, including (in particular) provision modifying any provision made by or under any other enactment.
<P>
(9) The regulations shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.'.—[Mr. Hill.]<P>

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Mr. Keith Hill):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 1030 and 1031.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The provisions are sought principally to allow transposition of a European Union directive on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network. The directive, which was agreed by the previous Administration, came into force in 1996 and should have been implemented last year. The new clause will allow for the transposition of a similar directive relating to the conventional rail network, which Transport Ministers are currently discussing in Brussels.
<P>
The new clause is necessary because the European Communities Act 1972, under which European Community legislation is usually incorporated into United Kingdom law, does not allow us to make regulations to ensure that the technical specifications issued under the directive can come into force as soon as they are published. That is a requirement of the directive, and the Commission has already started infraction proceedings against the UK for non-transposition. Subsection (2) of the new clause will allow reference to be made in implementing regulations to standards that are set by persons specified in the regulations. That will allow the regulations to refer to the technical specifications issued under the directive. The new clause will also give the Secretary of State a power to make further regulations to cover areas of the railway industry for which there are no current standards—for example, the insides of trains.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1030 and 1031 are consequential, and apply the new clause to Northern Ireland. That is necessary as Westminster is to retain powers to legislate in this respect for Northern Ireland, because implementation of EC directives is a UK duty.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Syms </B>(Poole): I know that we are talking about an obligation that we must carry out, but what is the cost and where does it fall? Do the fees for complying with or seeking approval for the standards fall on Railtrack or on the operating companies? It would be interesting to get a flavour of what is involved. If we have to conform to the same standards as Europe—and there might be great logic in that—how much will it cost and what is the time scale? Is compliance an aspiration, gradually to be realised as we upgrade bits of line, or is there an end date for introducing interoperability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks two simple questions. The answer to the question about costs is that the direct costs will fall on the industry. However, we can make no estimates because the standards are not yet fixed and we need to work out the details. I hope that that is satisfactory. As for the date for implementing the directive, that will be when the standards are set. I hope that that is satisfactory to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause read a Second time, and added to the Bill.
<H4><center>New clause 31</center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers to acquire and maintain property</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—The Authority may, in the furtherance of its purposes and functions, acquire, maintain or develop property which it considers may be required to implement its strategies.'.—[Mr. Quinn.<P>
</UL></FONT>]<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Lawrie Quinn </B>(Scarborough and Whitby): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
On this last morning of a very important journey in my life, I should like to speak briefly to new clause 31. As someone who has been involved in transport all his working life—both in this place and outside—I think that the Committee's work will have tremendous and beneficial consequences for this country's transportation systems.
<P>
Having put that on the record, I should like to commend new clause 31, which deals with what will happen in respect of the Strategic Rail Authority's ability to maintain or develop property in pursuance of its strategies. I seek clarification and a deeper understanding of the procedures and vision behind the policy. Many cynical people who looked at the set-up of Railtrack after privatisation asked a key question: was Railtrack a transport infrastructure company, or a land bank existing primarily for the purpose of property deals? In view of the residual property rights of the old British Rail Property Board, there was a clear remit to sell off the family silver. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary explain how the SRA will work in that respect, and clarify its powers to acquire and maintain property in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): I rise to welcome the new clause and to reflect on earlier debates in which similar issues were aired. On Tuesday, we ended up with a muddled position, which I hope that the Under-Secretary will clarify. Concerns were expressed about the running together of the Bill and the sales process, both in parallel and at odds with one another, and those concerns have not been resolved. I mentioned the Abbeyhill loop in Edinburgh, which is strategically important to the whole country and is presently up for sale. I hope that with this opportunity to revisit the issues, the Under-Secretary will clarify the outstanding problems.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) for moving the new clause. I should also like to express my gratitude to the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore), who invited me to comment further on our earlier exchanges about the sale of land. I hope to reassure him about that.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby for his warm remarks about the benefits to rail freight that the implementation of the Bill will confer. I have already paid tribute to my hon. Friend's commitment to the rail freight industry. It remains the case that no Member of this House is more committed to the interests of that industry than him. I say ``this House'' because a former—and, I am delighted to say, future—member of the other place, Lord Berkeley, is also renowned for his devotion to the rail freight industry. My hon. Friend asked specifically about Railtrack's commitment and vision. We look to Railtrack to meet its licence obligations, including meeting the reasonable needs of operators.
<P>
The new clause deals with the issue of railway land. I am grateful for this opportunity to amplify the Government's views on the subject, having reflected on the points raised by the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale when he proposed amendment No. 804, and on those raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby in respect of amendment No. 854.
<P>
The railway land issue requires a balance to be struck and involves some careful choices. This balancing act has become harder because our vision is of an expanding rail network, not a contracting one. We do not intend to repeat past mistakes and prejudice our transport policy for short-term gain, but halting all sales would mean sterilising and blighting land that could serve a different high-priority use, such as housing and regeneration. Vacant land leads to misuse, such as fly-tipping; it can also have a knock-on effect of making it harder to promote regeneration of adjacent land. Therefore, we cannot simply say that all railway development land should be put to one side. We have to reach decisions on a sensible basis, taking into account whether there is a realistic prospect of rail use in the foreseeable future. I assure the Committee that the SRA will not take a short-term view in reaching such a decision.
<P>
In earlier debates and today, the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale has mentioned several sites about which I hope to offer him some reassurance. Regarding the Abbeyhill loop in Edinburgh, in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang), British Rail proposes to offer the closed line for sale to Railtrack. In the case of Newhaven North quay, British Rail anticipates it being marketed for sale specifically for freight use. The future of the former goods yard at Tweedmouth has not yet been put out to consultation with the transport industry.
<P>
We look to Railtrack and the industry to identify and acquire sites for future rail use, but the current sales process is not inexorable: it can and will be halted where there is strong justification to do so. That applies to the current sales process by the BRB, as well as to the SRA. I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and my hon. Friends the Members for Scarborough and Whitby and for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape), who expressed concern about the momentum of the current BRB marketing process.
<P>
Turning to new clause 31, I can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby that, clause 186 will enable the SRA to acquire land which could be used by others for the purpose of railway development. Under clause 186, the SRA will be able to enter agreements or other arrangements for the purposes of securing the provision, improvement or development by others of the railway. Hitherto, we have discussed that clause in terms of financial assistance, such as the making of grants or loans. However, agreements and arrangements under clause 186(1) are not limited to financial assistance. They may include the SRA doing anything that facilitates the provision or development of railway services or railway assets, including network and station facilities. That includes a role in relation to land, if appropriate.
<P>
Clause 186 encapsulates the enabling role of the SRA, which will also have incidental powers under clause 197. The SRA cannot develop railway facilities itself, but it can make arrangements in relation to land that lead to its development by others, including acquisition and disposal. That requires a degree of certainty that there are or will be other parties to undertake the development. The SRA needs to judge the circumstances in each case.
<P>
I am satisfied that the combination of clause 186 and the ancillary power to acquire and dispose of land in clause 197 gives the SRA appropriate powers to step in and acquire strategic land. The new clause would go too far down the road of enabling the SRA to acquire and sit on land that had no foreseeable prospect of development by others. The balance in clause 186, with its concept of the authority being able to anything that it considers appropriate to secure action by others is the correct one.
<P>
In the light of that explanation and my repeated assurances, I hope that my hon. Friend will withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> The Under-Secretary has made a welcome announcement with regard to the Abbeyhill loop, but I want to press him on a couple of detailed points. Is sale to be offered exclusively to Railtrack, or is it simply to be encouraged to enter the current open market value competition? That would be a helpful piece of clarification. The announcements about Newhaven and Tweedmouth were welcome. Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that either his officials or the SRA will look at the strategic land holdings to identify anything similar that we have not debated in Committee and that might also need some protection?
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> On the last question, yes, British Rail and the SRA will adopt that positive attitude towards the disposal of their properties, although we all hope that it will not be necessary for individual sites to be identified in the House of Commons for such assurances to be offered and necessary inquiries to be undertaken. The hon. Gentleman asks whether the Abbeyhill loop will be offered for sale exclusively to Railtrack. The answer is yes. I hope that that provides sufficient reassurance for the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Quinn:</B> May I add my welcome to the good news that we have had about the Scottish borders this morning? I am from a railway family: my father was a train driver based in the Kingmoor shed in Carlisle; unfortunately, he is no longer with us. He fought passionately to preserve and to keep the Waverley line—it was his favourite route. If he is watching over us this morning, he will think the announcement a positive start to what I hope will be another important step in the railway renaissance of the Scottish borders and the north of England.
<P>
I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary takes the view he does. He said that he would not want the SRA and Railtrack to be put in the position of being able to acquire and sit on land. I think that everyone in the Committee wants our railway system to be a dynamic system that moves forward. That can be brought about only by good and effective management. As someone who has been on the receiving end of the frustrations of trying to manage the railway industry in his own small way, I welcome my hon. Friend's comments, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move to amendment No. 438, in page 129, line 27, leave out subsection (4).
<P>
Let me take this opportunity to indulge in what I fear may be my final tour of the horizon. Part V contains the familiar supplementary provisions that can be found at the end of most Bills and Acts. Clause 224, which we have already considered, deals with offences; it ensures that where an offence is committed by a company, with the consent or due to the negligence of an officer of that company, that officer, as well as the company itself, is considered to have committed the offence.
<P>
Clause 225, which we have also considered, relates to schedule 26, which sets out various pieces of legislation to be repealed under the provisions of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 226 is the standard commencement clause and clause 227 allows the Secretary of State and, where appropriate, the National Assembly for Wales, to make any necessary transitional provisions or savings in connection with the commencement of any provision in the Bill. Similarly, clause 228 allows the Secretary of State and, where appropriate, the National Assembly for Wales, to amend other legislation in consequence of the provisions of the Bill. Clause 229 sets out the arrangements for the payment of moneys under the Bill; clause 230 explains the territorial extent of the Bill; and, finally, clause 231 says that the Bill, when passed, will be known as the Transport Act 2000—and I very much look forward to that.
<P>
Amendment No. 438 would remove the need to give at least 12 months' notice before bringing into force the provisions relating to concessionary fares. We originally considered that time scale necessary to allow local authorities time to adjust their existing concessionary fares schemes to bring them into line with the statutory minimum half fare provided for in the Bill. However, the provisions of the Bill are well known to local authorities, and we are anxious to ensure that pensioners can take advantage of the new and, in most cases, more generous scheme as soon as possible. There will, of course, be a lead-in time before the new provisions come into effect, but a full 12 months seems rather over the top.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government new clause 34, Government new clause 36 and Government new schedule 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The operator licensing system plays a crucial role in maintaining high standards in the road haulage industry. The licensing by traffic commissioners of operators of goods vehicles ensures the safe and responsible use of such vehicles and fair competition between operators. In deciding whether to issue an operator's licence, a traffic commissioner must be satisfied that the applicant is fit to hold a licence, that he has proper maintenance facilities and sufficient finance to keep the vehicles roadworthy, that he has an operating centre suitable physically and environmentally for his vehicles, and that he has proper arrangements to ensure that the rules on drivers' hours are followed and that the vehicles are not overloaded.
<P>
Those who choose to operate heavy goods vehicles without an operator's licence escape those checks on professionalism, safety and environmental impact. Traffic commissioners are also enabled to use against illegal operators the sanctions that they employ against licensed operators who commit serious or persistent offences. Those sanctions include the revocation, suspension or curtailment of an operator's licence.
<P>
Illegal operators are a small minority in a largely responsible industry. As well as avoiding the other requirements of the licensing system, they often run vehicles in a dangerous condition. The Government are determined to take action against operators who choose to operate outside the licensing system. An impounding system would provide Vehicle Inspectorate examiners with powers to detain and impound illegally operated heavy goods vehicles at roadside checks.
<P>
In the previous session, Earl Attlee introduced a Bill in another place that would have introduced an impounding system. The Government supported that Bill but, unfortunately, it failed in the Commons. The Transport Bill should therefore be amended to allow for impounding provisions. The schedule provides for detailed regulations to be laid before Parliament setting out the practical procedures for an impounding scheme. We carried out a consultation exercise in 1998 that confirmed widespread support for such an impounding scheme, especially from the road haulage industry and the traffic commissioners. It is a commitment in our integrated transport White Paper and has the support of the Commission for Integrated Transport. There will be further consultations on the draft regulations.
<P>
At present, operators found to be operating without an operator's licence are secure in the knowledge that they can be fined only relatively small sums which, for many, do not cancel out the profits that they earn by cutting corners, so they cannot be prevented from continuing to run their businesses. The amendment would give magistrates and sheriffs the power to impose heavier fines for carrying goods without an operator's licence by raising the maximum penalty from level 4—currently a maximum of £2,500{**mrl;**}to level 5, currently up to £5,000. The possibility of a higher fine alone might not be a sufficiently serious deterrent to illegal operators. However, coupled with the impounding scheme, increasing the maximum fine level would send a fresh signal to offenders of the seriousness with which the Government take the offence.
<P>
The present legislation allows newly acquired vehicles within the maximum number authorised under an operator's licence to be used for up to a month without the traffic commissioner being notified and without a disc being displayed. That makes it difficult for the Vehicle Inspectorate to check at a roadside whether a vehicle is being operated without a valid operator's licence. We therefore propose that the existing provision should be abolished. The new computer system being developed for the traffic area network will allow for operators to provide immediate notification of vehicles included within the margin allowed on their licence. An effective means of dealing with illegal operators has been long awaited. The measures will prevent illegal operation and act as a powerful deterrent making all operators work within the goods vehicle operator system.
<P>
Finally, Committee members may be aware that the provisions, along with other issues, were part of a private Member's Bill introduced by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), who yesterday sent me a charming note beginning ``Dear Keith''. The hon. Lady went on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I note that amendments have been tabled to the Transport Bill in relation to the impounding of illegally operated H.G.V.s. Some weeks ago I introduced a Private Member's Bill which includes similar provisions . . . I am delighted that the Government has decided to adopt my proposals!<P>

The note concludes, ``Yours sincerely, Eleanor.''

<P>

<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): I am one of the sponsors of that private Member's Bill. Like my hon. Friend, I am delighted that the Under-Secretary listened to what we said and included the provisions of that Bill in the Transport Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his perspicacity in adding his name to the Road Traffic Bill, and I am grateful for his support. The Government are delighted to follow in the wake of the hon. Member for Epping Forest and I pay tribute to her foresight in introducing such a measure. With such support, who could resist our amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I draw hon. Members' attention to my interest in the Register of Members' Interests. My family business has a subsidiary with vehicles and an operator's licence.
<P>
I welcome the provisions Those who run vehicles without an operator's licence endanger people on the roads. We all welcome swift action taken against such people.
<P>
It is always a bit dangerous to ask a question to which one does not know the answer. However, we are setting up a computer system for UK-based companies, making it easy to access information on whether they have an up-to-date licence that is valid for a three-year period. What happens in the respect of foreign vehicles arriving at our ports? Will they have to provide documentation that proves that they are being operated under a proper system administered in their own countries? Such people are required to have a national and international licence. It is proper that British road hauliers are subject to a licence regime. How are we to ensure that foreign vehicles coming in are subject to equally high standards?
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Again, I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's support, which is all the more welcome as it comes from one with direct experience of the industry.
<P>
The proposed impounding provisions are intended to prevent vehicles from being operated without a UK operator's licence. Foreign vehicles operate under a wide variety of operating licensing systems in other European Union states. The inclusion of foreign vehicles falls outside the scope of the scheme proposed by the Department on which we consulted. We do not intend to change it at this stage, but we shall examine the possibility of doing so in future. However, we do not want to put the other impounding proposals at risk.
<P>
I might be able to give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance. Foreign vehicles entering this country are required to carry a Community authorisation licence as evidence that they comply with their own domestic operating licensing legislation. It is rare for foreign-registered goods vehicles in the UK not to have the correct authorisation. However, when that does occur, the driver can be prosecuted, and such cases are normally reported to the relevant authorities in the country of origin.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—In permitting goods vehicle operators to establish an operating centre under the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995, the Traffic Commissioner must be satisfied that the centre is available, suitable, and of sufficient capacity, and must take into account the suitability of the local public road network for the establishment of such a centre.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> One of the great joys of serving on this Committee is that, from time to time, one has an opportunity to write a letter to relatives. New clauses are coming up with which we shall, no doubt, deal relatively briefly. My great hope is that, before we finish doing so, I shall have cause to send home at least a postcard. I start with a golden opportunity in new clauses 9 and 19.
<P>
As I often say, one of the great joys of Committee is anticipating the Under-Secretary's response and pointing out why it will be insufficient. I predict that the Minister will shortly draw our attention to section 14 of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, which clearly states that a traffic commissioner who grants a licence must satisfy himself that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there will be adequate facilities or arrangements for maintaining in a fit and serviceable condition the vehicles proposed to be used under the licence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, section 14 says nothing about the siting of such facilities. The purpose of new clause 9 is to ensure that the yards or depots where bus and coach operators keep their vehicles are sited sensibly and safely. The traffic commissioner needs that additional power to enable him to refuse permission to bus operators who do not fulfil the conditions that have been laid down.
<P>
Sometimes, sites are used by other operators, such as freight lorry owners. A park can be so full—there are many examples of this—that the buses and coaches end up being parked on verges or nearby streets, which causes congestion and nuisance to residents. Sites or centres must be available, but they must also be suitable and of sufficient capacity. If yards are unsurfaced, mud is often deposited on nearby roads. Centres with concealed entrances might also be unsuitable. Unless sites are large enough to cope with all the vehicles that use them, the parking and congestion problems that I have described will arise. Some centres are sited in such a way that they become a serious nuisance to the surrounding area. They can be up narrow lanes in rural areas, or in former barns or even disused aerodromes. They can be found in the corners of large council housing estates, where children play on the pavements and verges. The road surfaces might not be suited to continual use by such heavy vehicles.
<P>
In new clause 9, we propose to give traffic commissioners additional powers so that they can deal with all those problems and ensure that the local public roads network can cope with the additional bus and coach traffic going to and from the centre. New clause 19 is similar, but deals with the separate issue of establishing yards and depots for heavy trucks and lorries. However, the arguments are the same, and I shall not repeat them.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has a real opportunity to make my wife happy, and I look forward to him doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am not sure of my response to the hon. Gentleman's plea to me to make his wife happy—that is scarcely my ministerial responsibility in this context. However, I dare say that we can pursue the matter elsewhere.
<P>
I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman in two other respects. Uniquely, he has failed on this occasion to anticipate my references to legislation and the details of the argument that I shall deploy as I yet again reject his representations. I shall certainly not refer to the 1981 Act, although I shall refer to other legislation. I must also tell the hon. Gentleman that this is not the golden opportunity for which he had hoped to write his postcard home. Given what I will say on this occasion, he will barely be able to dip his pen in the ink well. However, there might be better prospects later.
<P>
Those who wish to run bus or coach services must first obtain a public service vehicle operators licence from the relevant traffic commissioner. Under current legislation, however, the traffic commissioner has no powers to refuse to grant a licence on the basis of the adequacy or suitability of an operating centre. There is no requirement that the commissioner should approve such centres. New clause 9 would give him such powers.
<P>
I have noted the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but I am not convinced that there is a need to give traffic commissioners powers over public service vehicle operating centres. Under the current arrangements, the matter is largely one for local planning authorities, which have powers to refuse planning permission should they be convinced that the site of a proposed operating centre or access to it is unsuitable.
<P>
Local authorities are also responsible for traffic management matters on local roads and have wide powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to make traffic regulation orders to prohibit or restrict particular types of vehicle from using local roads on environmental grounds. They also have powers to impose vehicle restrictions to prevent vehicles over a certain length from using unsuitable roads, as well as powers to introduce controlled parking zones. Local authorities are directly accountable to their local communities and have the proper experience to deal with planning decisions and local transport matters. They are best placed to make decisions on these issues. Their current powers are sufficient to address any concerns about the impact on the local area of bus operating centres.
<P>
New clause 19 relates to the goods vehicle operator licensing system. At present, traffic commissioners have wide powers to decide whether an operating centre is suitable for use by the goods vehicles that an operator plans to use from a site. For example, he can decide whether the site is big enough, whether is has safe access and whether it is in an acceptable location in terms of the environment and the residents in the immediate vicinity. In considering those issues, traffic commissioners can take into account the effect of the proposed operating centre only to the point at which the centre or any private road from it joins the public highway. We doubt that there is a case for extending the scope of traffic commissioners' powers to assess the effect of operating centres, because they might not be sufficiently informed to form a judgment about the effect of additional vehicles on the local road network.
<P>
Local authorities have powers under the town and country planning legislation to take account, when determining applications for planning permission, of the wider problems that could be created by goods vehicles on the highway network. There are also powers under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, to which I have referred.
<P>
Finally, I am not aware of any general pressure to make the changes proposed in the new clauses. In general, any changes to the goods vehicle operator licensing system should be made only after a thorough review of the working of the existing system, in full consultation with all interested parties. The last such review resulted in the present legislation, the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995. I am not convinced that there is a sufficient case at this stage for seeking the specific change that is proposed, and I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the new clause.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the Under-Secretary is not aware of any pressure to persuade him to change the law on this issue, I can assure him that it will shortly reach him. Perhaps we shall then have am opportunity to consider the issue again.
<P>
The Under-Secretary was absolutely right, and I listened with increasing alarm and despondency as he spoke. I concluded that it was not worth even getting my pen out of my pocket, let alone dipping it into the ink well. Nevertheless, there will be opportunities to return to the issue when times are happier. For the time being, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Goods vehicles</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`It shall be incumbent on the driver of a goods vehicle using a weight restricted route to provide evidence on demand to any police officer or member of the Vehicle Inspectorate or Trading Standards Office that such a driver is using the route lawfully.'.—[Mr. Don Foster.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
All of us will be aware of the problems that are caused from time to time by inappropriate heavy vehicles travelling along roads that have had weight restrictions placed on them because of the difficulties that such lorries create. There is a problem with the current legislation when it comes to doing something about those who abuse such weight-restricted routes.
<P>
At the moment, before the police can prosecute, they have to follow the vehicle the entire length of the route to demonstrate that there is no intention to deliver a load legitimately. That creates a significant problem. The purpose of the new clause is to seek an additional strategy for the police, the Vehicle Inspectorate or trading standards officers, by requiring the driver to have a delivery note or some other evidence of legitimate business.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I fear that I shall once again have to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. The pen is still poised over the postcard, but not yet on it. I have listened carefully to his arguments, and I entirely agree that effective enforcement of weight restrictions is necessary to ensure high compliance by drivers of goods vehicles. The traffic orders that create restrictions can rarely ban all lorries. If they could, enforcement would be straightforward, but it is usually necessary to allow for deliveries and collections in an area; how otherwise would Lady Bath, for example, be able to receive a new washing machine? How would the removal van get there when the hon. Gentleman is forced to move out?
<P>
I agree that the need for exemptions makes for some difficulties. On the face of it, it is not easy to distinguish between lorries driving down a road on legitimate business and those simply taking a short cut, and some inconsiderate drivers will seek to take advantage of that. That is not the whole picture, however. If a lorry, having passed a sign indicating a weight restriction prohibition, is stopped by the police, the onus is on the driver to show that he was complying with the qualifying plate on the sign that allows access. A driver who was unable to give a satisfactory explanation to the police—for example, by producing a delivery note for premises in the prohibited area—would face the prospect of receiving a fixed penalty notice.
<P>
To demonstrate that we take amendments seriously, we consulted the Association of Chief Police Officers, which agreed that it would not make it any easier for police officers to enforce weight restrictions. In ACPO's view, the current powers have the equivalent effect, but it stressed the need for clear signing of weight restrictions. That is most important, and I ask local authorities to check that restrictions and alternative routes for through traffic are clearly signed. We encourage local authorities to provide for an exemption for loading, and not for access. The use of a loading exemption for delivering or collecting in the area, rather than an access exemption, which could include stopping off at the newsagents for a paper, makes it easier for lorry drivers to understand restrictions and for the police to enforce them.
<P>
The amendment also envisages powers being given to vehicle inspectors and trading standards officers, but they, of course, cannot stop vehicles, so could not take any action without the police being present. That being the case, it is questionable whether giving them powers to demand evidence for a traffic regulation offence is either appropriate or necessary.
<P>
I appreciate the intention behind the proposed clause to improve compliance with weight restrictions and thereby safeguard the communities that such restrictions are intended to protect. However, while I share the objective of better compliance, the amendment will not make enforcement any easier. Against that background, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw his new clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful for that helpful response. The Under-Secretary's consultation with ACPO has gleaned information of which a number of policemen of my acquaintance were not aware. They did not know that it was possible to demand a note and to then, they were not aware that it was possible to demand a note and use it as the basis for prosecution. I should be grateful if he could ask his right hon. Friend the Home Secretary about passing that information to the various police forces around the country. I understand from a number of sources that there is confusion about this. If it can be handled in existing legislation, I shall be delighted. I have no desire to add complications to Bills. I share the Minister's view about the importance of clear signage. I hope that he will also ensure that his strong message is passed on to the Local Government Association. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New Clause 18</center></H4>
<H4><center>Driver recruitment and training strategy</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—The Secretary of State shall make a report three weeks after this Act comes into force setting out a strategy for the recruitment and training of public service vehicle drivers.'.—[Mr. Syms.<P>
</UL></FONT>]
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time. I hope that the Government, having rejected the blandishments of the insurgents on my left, will support the new clause. If the objective of the Bill is to have more buses on our roads, we should all be concerned about the standard of drivers and their recruitment and training. I am sure that we can all agree about the aims of the new clause and deal with it speedily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government fully share the hon. Gentleman's objectives. We recognise the importance of modernised arrangements for bringing well trained bus and coach drivers into the industry and encouraging them to develop their skills during their driving career so. However, we do not believe that the clause is necessary.
<P>
As part of our drive for a more integrated approach to transport, we already have a strategy for improving recruitment and training of bus drivers. We believe that a well trained and well motivated work force with decent pay and conditions is essential to the realisation of that aim. We welcome the industry's commitment to raising the skills level of its work force, which was reflected in last year's buses daughter document ``From Workhorse to Thoroughbred''.
<P>
We want training in the bus industry to be developed in line with our broader policies for enhancing the country's skill base. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is responsible for the development of the national qualifications framework for transport. That process takes full account of employment needs, as the authority receives advice on the appropriateness of qualifications from sector advisory groups, which include employers, national training organisations and educationists. It will be kept under review to ensure that changing industry skill needs are met.
<P>
Driving standards clearly have a vital role in ensuring passenger safety and comfort, as well as helping road safety and environmentally friendly driving. We are determined to see more highly skilled drivers through training. To that end we propose to introduce a new statutory scheme to raise the standards of passenger carrying vehicle driver training. We shall be bringing forward proposals for a register of PCV driving instructors, together with a syllabus for those learning to drive PCVs. That syllabus will relate to the national occupational standards being developed under QCA stewardship. We intend to consult on the details of the scheme later this year. Before we legislate we hope to introduce a voluntary registration scheme for PCV driver trainers.
<P>
Ahead of that, we have substantially enhanced the theory test for learner bus drivers and introduced, at no extra cost to candidates, a nationwide same-day results service. New safety and environmental topics have been added. The total number of questions has been increased to 600, nearly triple the number when the test was introduced two years ago. Each question paper now has 35 questions. The marking arrangements for the practical test were improved. Candidates who commit more than 15 driving faults fail the test, allowing examiners to identify weaknesses across the range of competences.
<P>
I am aware that the bus industry has some concerns about the current arrangements for obtaining a PCV driving licence, which they feel unnecessarily lengthen the time it that it takes. On 22 March, I met Peter Hendy of the bus operating company First Group to discuss the recruitment and training of drivers in the capital. A further meeting will be held with the Driving Standards Agency on 13 April. A great deal is therefore being done to develop a training strategy. I hope that after those assurances about the Government's commitment to deliver highly skilled drivers, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause.

Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 20</center></H4>
<H4><center>Undertaking in regard to</center></H4>
operator's licence
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.­For section 26(1)(f) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 substitute—``(f) that any undertaking recorded in the licence whether given (or procured to be given) for any purpose in regard to an operator's licence has not been fulfilled''.'.—[Mr. Don Foster.<P>
</UL></FONT>]<P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time. Many members of the Committee will be assiduous students of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995, and will have noted that section 26(b) refers to whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the licence-holder has contravened any conditions attached to the licence.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That refers to opportunities for traffic commissioners to revoke an operator's licence for that reason. The same assiduous students will have noted that subsection (f) refers to whether
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any undertaking recorded in the licence has not been fulfilled.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a condition attached to the licence has been contravened, or if an undertaking recorded in the licence has not been fulfilled, it would be possible for the licence to be revoked.
<P>
It transpires that there is considerable confusion about the distinction between subsections (b) and (f) and the interpretation of subsection (f) in relation to the undertaking recorded. The question is whether the undertaking was genuine, or whether it was sought by the traffic commissioner but there was no clear evidence that it had been given. The new clause is clearly designed to probe the question, and we are keen to hear what the Minister has to say.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Again, it is not quite time to write that postcard home. It goes without saying that I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. At present, any undertaking given by the operator, or on behalf of the operator, to the traffic commissioner that is material to the granting of an application must be recorded on the licence. If those undertakings are breached, the traffic commissioner may take disciplinary action against the operator. That gives the traffic commissioner wide powers to control the use of operating centres, and I am not convinced that there is a case for extending the powers even to a limited extent.
<P>
The new clause is intended to allow traffic commissioners to take action whenever undertakings given by the operators are breached, but it is not clear—and the hon. Gentleman alluded to the problem—that the new clause achieves the desired effect because it still refers to the undertaking being ``recorded in the licence''. It does not allow for the recording on the licence of undertakings subsequent to the granting of the original application or a disciplinary public inquiry.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
More generally, the system of licensing operators of goods vehicles, which dates from the 1930s, has been reviewed regularly and the most recent review resulted in the present legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Is not the point about material change taking place—via a court hearing, for example—already covered in paragraph (f), which is why I have not sought to amend it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> My advice is that that is not the case, otherwise I would not have made my remarks. If there is anything further to say about it, no doubt inspiration will wing its way in my direction in the usual fashion.
<P>
As I said, the most recent review resulted in the present legislation—the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995. When it is reviewed again, it should be done thoroughly and comprehensively with full consultation of interested parties.
<P>
I undertake to write to the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) about the contents and purposes of paragraph (f). As I said, my advice is that it does not allow for the changes that the hon. Gentleman seeks. Having said that, I am not convinced that there is a case for making a small change to the operator licensing system by amending the Bill, so I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the motion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It is a cause for rejoicing that argument D is being used for the first time in Committee. What a pity that we are so far down our travels through the Bill that it is unlikely to crop up again. Argument D is: the hon. Member has identified a problem; he has proposed a solution, but the solution is not tough enough to deal with the problem; nevertheless, we shall do nothing whatever about it. It is an unconvincing argument, but there was a chink of light when the Under-Secretary acknowledged the need for a widescale review. That may amount to an assurance that the problem will be further examined and dealt with. With that chink of an assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) and several organisations—notably the Automobile Association —for their assiduous work on this subject.
<P>
The new clause addresses the concerns of many members of the Committee—and certainly of the public—about cowboy wheel clampers. I wish to put it on record, so that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough can read it, that time pressure means that I cannot do full justice to such an important issue. I note that it has now become a topical issue. I do not myself watch the wonderful programme ``Coronation Street'', but I am advised that Curly Watts has taken to wheel clamping his own vehicle every night to prevent it from being taken away—a reverse process to that in the new clause.
<P>
Many examples could be provided of cowboy wheel clampers, but I recognise, of course, the right of landowners to protect their property from abuse by illegal parking. There must be a straightforward way to deal with the problem and the new clause is about providing legitimate protection to landowners while protecting the public from cowboy clampers.
<P>
Examples of cowboy clampers are legion. Clampers in Harrogate used a public car park to dump the clamped vehicles towed away from somewhere else. Some emergency and paramedical vehicles have been clamped and a hearse with the body still in it was clamped outside a church. Clampers have made threats and imposed horrific demands on those unable to pay the money demanded of them. Sex was demanded of a young woman; another woman was told to hand over her gold tooth; and a mother was told to hand over her three-year-old daughter until she returned from the bank with the fee. Those are only a few of the examples drawn to my attention.
<P>
The Committee will be aware that private clamping is already outlawed in Scotland, but there are no regulations in England. A Court of Appeal judgment was, sadly, too vague to be of help. It stated that clamping was legal if there was an ``appropriate sign'' and a ``reasonable fee'', but that did not clarify matters. The only means of redress to a citizen in England lie in civil action, and legislative provisions would remove the need to rely on that. The Transport Bill provides a perfect opportunity.
<P>
I am not the only hon. Member who has sought to deal with this problem. I have already referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. It is a longstanding issue of concern. As a Home Office Minister back in 1992, the right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said that the Government were giving it ``urgent consideration'', and the Home Office produced a consultation paper, ``Wheelclamping on private land'', in February 1993, but no action followed. In 1994, the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), then in Opposition, proposed an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill identical to my new clause. A senior Labour Member has already recommended that the precise wording of the new clause be used. In 1996, by which time Labour were in government—[Hon. Members: ``No.'']

<B>Mr. Moore:</B> That was 1997.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you—we finished late last night and my mind is rather befuddled.
<P>
More significantly, when in Opposition, senior Labour Members advocated moves along such lines. Indeed, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Harrogate raised the matter. [Hon. Members: ``Highgate.''] Perhaps it was the hon. Member for high Hampstead and Harrogate or the hon. Member for High Harrogate.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I seem to recall political advice that states that one should stop digging if one is in a hole.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Holes in the road are the subject of the next new clause, Mr. Gale.
<P>
In short, many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have drawn attention to the matter and promised to take action, but so far, no such action has been taken, so I am proposing a way forward. I am aware that the White Paper on the private security industry suggested the use of statutory regulation. However, in their discussions of the White Paper, the Government seem to prefer the option of a private security industry authority. The 1998 White Paper ``A New Deal for Transport: Better for Everyone'' stated that responses to its consultation showed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>overwhelming support for the regulation of wheelclamping on private land.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is clear support for such a measure, which has been proposed by right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House. Why, therefore, can the Bill not deal with that via the mechanism of granting the powers proposed in the new clause, instead of a private security industry authority being introduced, which would be an unnecessarily complicated way of dealing with an urgent problem?
<P>
I look forward to a positive response from the Under-Secretary. I apologise for the confusion that I may have created among Committee members and representatives of the Official Report, who, I appreciate, will have some difficulty with my speech.
<P>
<B>Ms Rosie Winterton </B>(Doncaster, Central): I am upset that the hon. Member for Bath did not include me in all the hon. Members that he mentioned. Perhaps he thought that I represented another constituency.
<P>
The RAC and the Automobile Association have done a lot of work on this matter. Without doubt, the problem is serious, especially in my constituency, where those modern-day highway robbers prey on elderly people and women alone in their cars. Their tactics are horrendous: wheel clampers often park outside a chemist's shop in my constituency thereby luring people onto private land nearby; when people rush into the chemist's on a Sunday morning, often trying to get emergency prescriptions, the clampers clamp them and demand as much as £70 or £90 in cash for the release of their vehicles. They have no respect whatever for nurses, doctors or people with orange badges and they demand money from such people. Those are disreputable tactics which need to be tackled. Those are disreputable tactics which need to be tackled.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath mentioned the Home Office's work on attempting to cover the matter in private security industry legislation. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary consider working closely with the Home Office to find out whether anything else needs to be done, especially in relation to the landowner's responsibility?
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Individual wheel clampers may be covered by proposals relating to the private security authority. However, I am concerned about how to make sure that landowners take some responsibility for activities on their land that are deemed undesirable under any private security industry legislation. The Government as a whole are concerned about the matter, but we want to ensure that there is joined-up thinking. It may be difficult to chase up individual wheel clampers who are prosecuted, because they often have only a wheel clamp, a mobile telephone and little else. By contrast, the land is there and, clearly, is difficult to move.
<P>
Landowners often say that they have no responsibility for tactics used on their land, and argue that they get no money for the wheel clampers' activities. However, there is a suspicion that they sometimes do and we must examine carefully whether there is a need to regulate landowners as well as wheel clampers. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend will examine whether anything further needs to be tackled in liaison with the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> First, I thank the hon. Member for Bath for tabling the new clause.
<P>
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton) who has been hyperactive in tackling the matter. She is a ferocious campaigner against what she described as modern-day highwaymen, whose cry: is, ``Clamp and deliver''.
<P>
<B>Ms Winterton:</B> I do not know where my hon. Friend got that from. I used it in the House and it became quote of the day in The Times the following day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That demonstrates that great minds think alike.
<P>
I shall ensure that my hon. Friend's suggestions about landowners are conveyed to the Home Office, with which the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is working closely. Of course, we want to achieve the joined-up government that she mentioned. We hope that a step change will be a means of securing a solution to the problem. I believe that I have just quoted all the new Labour clichés.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members have clearly given a great deal of thought to how we might tackle problems associated with cowboy clampers. As the hon. Member for Bath knows, we have already given a commitment in our integrated transport White Paper to introduce regulation of wheel clamping as part of a package of statutory measures to regulate the private security industry as a whole.
<P>
As this is largely a Home Office matter, my colleagues at that Department are looking into how best to act. They will be introducing firm proposals to regulate the private security industry, including wheel clampers. Although I am sure that, in part, the aim of the proposed new clause is to ensure the probity of wheel clampers, that is not made explicit. We would go further, because there is a strong argument for excluding those with serious offences from having any right to operate as a wheel clamper or set up a wheel clamping company. The proposals set out in our White Paper on the regulation of the private security industry in England and Wales would tackle this point directly by a licensing system applied to individuals.
<P>
The other area in which we consider that the proposed new clause does not quite meet our needs is in creating a comprehensive set of standards for wheel clamping on private land. Rather than having regulations that impose standards from the top down, it would be more practical for the responsible majority of the car park operators to draw up a detailed code of practice themselves. I am glad to say that the British Parking Association is doing just that in advance of our legislation.
<P>
Our aim is to enable the regulatory authority for the private security industry to approve an existing code of practice for wheel clampers and to underpin it by, for instance, making adherence to it a condition of holding a licence to operate as a wheel clamper. We expect that the code of practice will cover the sort of behaviour mentioned, and that a breach of that code could lead to loss of licence. Continued operation after a licence had been withdrawn would mean that the operator was committing a criminal offence. We have it in mind to underpin the contents of the code with strong powers.
<P>
I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Bath and that he understands that these issues are already being carefully considered in the context of other legislation. The proposals will be published in the police and private security industry Bill. The Home Office has been granted advance drafting for the Bill, which was announced in the 1999 Queen's Speech. We intend to publish it before the summer recess and it will contain proposals to regulate wheel clamping. I hope that those reassurances, which constitute a firm statement of intent, the hon. Gentleman will be able to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I begin by saying to the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central that, had she not told me to stop digging my hole, I should have got round to her, because it is important to pay tribute to the work she has done. I congratulate her and I am sure that other members of the Committee will wish to do the same. She will recognise that other right hon. and hon. Members over the years have addressed the issue, and not solely to seek headlines in popular newspapers—although they have usually been successful in that too. Above all, people have tried to get on and do something about the problem. As I said earlier, there has been much talk about something being done. I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for all his comments, especially because we have, at long last, been given an indication of the time scale. To hear that the proposals will be published before the summer recess is good news to the many people who have campaigned on the issue for a long time. With that good news ringing in my ears, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will either accept this new clause or, at least, give some guidance to local authorities about the difficult issue involved. Many local authorities are currently considering options for tackling areas with poor air quality, especially in city centres. In most major urban areas, those problems stem largely, though not exclusively, from pollution from road transport. The Committee will be aware that under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 local authorities are under a duty to review and assess air quality in their locality. That process has to be completed by June this year. If national air quality objectives are unlikely to be met, they are required to declare air quality management areas by October this year, and to produce action plans to reduce pollution levels accordingly.
<P>
Existing legislation places a requirement on local authorities to take action where there is an indication of high levels of poor air quality, and their plans must be in place by October this year. The question is whether they have at their disposal the means to do anything about it. The new clause would beef up the powers of local authorities if the problem is identified in their area.
<P>
I am delighted that the Bill contains several measures designed to reduce air pollution. For example, part II local authorities power to agree environmental performance standards for buses as part of a quality partnership. However, there are two key problems for local councils and those are the enforcement powers for roadside emissions testing and for low-emission zones. To save the Committee's time, I shall illustrate only one of them. Under the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) Regulations 1997, a limited number of local authorities have been piloting roadside testing, using a fixed penalty scheme; however, it has proved difficult to operate because, currently, only the police can stop vehicles and the availability of police time is limited. The evidence is that the fixed penalty has not been adequate to cover enforcement costs in the way that the Government intended. There are similar problems in respect of the low-emission zones. Therefore the two major strategies that local authorities are likely to want to use in the plans that have to be ready by October this year are inadequate, not least because of problems with enforcement and the way in which that should be managed. Even so, there are already far-sighted authorities of all political persuasions—Nottingham, Westminster, Oxford, Camden, Bristol and others—looking at measures such as low-emission zones. They want to do something about the problem, but they are finding it difficult.
<P>
The new clause would enable the Secretary of State, through regulations, to introduce several changes to the procedures relating to the strategies for low emission zones and roadside emissions testing. That would be of enormous benefit to local authorities. The Under-Secretary might tell me that that will happen in due course, but what will local authorities do about it by October?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall deal fully with the new clause because it is important and I have an interest in the subject. I therefore fear that I shall have to speak at some length, but this is almost the last time that I shall address the Committee, so I hope that hon. Members will indulge me.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The new clause would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations in respect of low-emission zones to clarify several powers that are already available to local authorities. It would also give authorities powers to operate and enforce such zones. As I understand it, a low-emission zone would be one to which only the cleanest vehicles were permitted access. Each authority would be able to specify which categories of vehicle it wished to exclude.
<P>
I warmly support the principles behind the new clause. I support the idea of LEZs in principle, provided that they are targeted at the most polluting vehicles and do not have a disproportionate impact on business or disadvantaged groups. They could be an important tool, which many authorities would want to use as part of an integrated strategy to improve local air quality. I agree that it is important that local authorities have the necessary powers to designate and enforce LEZs.
<P>
However, the new clause is unnecessary for the following reasons. First, it would permit the Secretary of State to make regulations allowing authorities to take several steps in respect of air quality management. However, the Secretary of State already has wide-ranging powers to do so under section 87 of the Environment Act 1995, which allows regulations to be made
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>conferring powers or imposing duties on local authorities . . . with respect to the assessment or management of the quality of air.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State also has the power to issue guidance to local authorities under section 88 of that Act. Indeed, in March, my Department issued new guidance to local authorities in respect of their air quality management duties and responsibilities. Therefore, although I warmly support the principles behind the new clause, it duplicates powers that are, for the most part, already available to the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Will the Under-Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I propose to deal in some detail with the way in which the new clause duplicates existing powers.
<P>
Subsection (1)(a) would allow authorities to establish LEZs, but they already have such powers. Section 1 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 provides powers to enable a traffic authority to make traffic regulation orders for any of the purposes specified in sections 87(1)(a) to (c) of the Environment Act 1995, which relate to air quality. There is therefore no reason why a TRO could not be used to establish an LEZ.
<P>
Subsection (1) (b) would allow an authority to use various types of revenue to fund enforcement activities inside an LEZ. Once again, that is unnecessary. Schedule 11 contains provisions on the use of the proceeds of road-user charging and workplace parking levies. Paragraphs 7(2) to (4) specify that authorities can use the proceeds of such schemes for the purpose of directly or indirectly facilitating the achievement of policies in the authority's local transport plan.
<P>
Therefore, provided that enforcement activities inside an LEZ were consistent with the objectives of an authority's LTP, there would be nothing to prevent the authority from using the revenue raised from congestion charging and workplace parking levies to fund enforcement activities inside an LEZ.
<P>
Subsection (I)(c) would give special constables and traffic wardens new powers to stop vehicles for the purposes of emissions testing. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the new clause. Special constables already have such powers: section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 allows a constable in uniform, and, therefore, a uniformed special constable, to stop a person driving any vehicle or cycling on a road. Traffic wardens, however, have no such powers. In principle, I support the idea that it might be helpful for them to have such powers in limited circumstances—for example, where that would facilitate roadside emissions testing.
<P>
The Government have carefully considered the issue. We consulted the police representative organisations a little while ago on the possibility of further extending police powers to civilians. However, this is a sensitive policing issue, and we do not want to make a decision on it in the present context without resolving the wider policy aspects. We need to do more work, including conducting further consultation with police representative organisations and other interested parties. I hope that it will help the hon. Gentleman if I say that we undertake to reflect further on the issue and we hope to be able to resolve it shortly. In deciding how to take matters forward, we will take account of the views of all interested parties. Those include, of course, the police, as well as the Motorists Forum, which is due to make its own recommendations following its meeting on Tuesday of this week.
<P>
Subsection (1)(d) relates to local authorities' powers to carry out roadside emissions tests on smoky vehicles. The Committee might be aware that several local authorities have been piloting roadside emissions tests with some success since December 1997. They have been doing so under the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997/3058). The new clause would extend a version of that pilot scheme to all authorities. I agree that badly tuned vehicles give rise to local air quality problems, and that more should be done to tackle the issue. After all, all of us, whether as pedestrians, cyclists or motorists, suffer as a result of smoky vehicles belching out fumes. That is why we asked the Motorists Forum to consider how the current pilot scheme might be extended, and we await its recommendations with interest. We will, of course, consult widely on any extension of the scheme.
<P>
Finally, subsection (1)(e) would allow authorities to prohibit vehicles from entering LEZs and to penalise those that did. The police already have powers to enforce TROs and could therefore prevent non-„compliant vehicles from entering any LEZ. Local authorities already have powers to issue fixed penalty notices to parked vehicles, and those powers might help to enforce LEZs. However, as in the case of traffic wardens, the issue of extending stop powers to agencies other than the police is sensitive.
<P>
I therefore hope that the Committee will agree that, although the principles behind the new clause are to be warmly welcomed, it would be inappropriate to accept it, for the reasons that I have outlined. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Bath to withdraw it.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It was of enormous benefit to the Committee that the Under-Secretary spoke at length and in such a helpful way. Perhaps he would like to respond to a couple of small points.
<P>
The Under-Secretary told us that everything covered in subsection (1)(a) could be dealt with under a traffic regulation order. My understanding is that that is not entirely the case, but if it is, I am satisfied.
<P>
In his comments on subsection (l)(b), which relates in part to where the money will come from, the Under-Secretary drew our attention to schedule 11 and the ability of local authorities to use the proceeds of congestion charging and parking levies. If the hon. Gentleman is putting it on record that local authorities will be able to use the proceeds in that way, that is clearly helpful, but it is only a further clarification of schedule 11. There will be occasions on which the reduction of pollution through the measures in the new clause, will not lead to a significant reduction in congestion. The provision might address the problem of a few vehicles, but if the Under-Secretary is stating firmly that local authorities will, through schedule 11, be able to use those moneys, I am especially grateful. On subsection (1)(c), I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman intends to reflect on some of the details. That assurance is welcome.
<P>
On paragraph (d), although it is true, as the Under-Secretary said, that its purpose is to extend more widely the type of trials that are now taking place, it also addresses the matter of rectification. The Minister has not dealt with that. At present, if a vehicle fails the emissions test, no action need be taken to ensure that that failure is subsequently rectified. The only other check would come about if by chance the vehicle happened to go through another roadside check of the same kind.
<P>
Again on paragraph (d), can the Under-Secretary explain a little further his thoughts on the way in which such local authority schemes can operate without the large police presence that is currently needed in the interim period before the measures come into law? The hon. Gentleman will recall that I said earlier that there is concern about what will happen from October, the date at which local authorities generally will have to put measures in place. Many of them will discover that, without some relaxation in the use of police time, they will be in difficulty. I would welcome the Under-Secretary's comments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those further questions. I will endeavour to answer him as fully as possible, and where I am unable to do so, I shall write to him.
<P>
On paragraph (e), I confirm that congestion charging will be an appropriate source of funding for the implementation of those measures. Parking charges will also be a source of funding. We accept that rectification is important. It is currently under consideration by the Motorists Forum and we await eagerly its recommendations.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked for my thoughts on the implementation of the targets in the interim period before wider provision for enforcement is made, and on the fact that police enforcement might not always be available for reasons that we all understand. Local authorities do not deal with these issues solely by means of implementation of LEZs or emissions tests. A range of measures to improve air quality is available to local authorities. It includes improved public transport and better traffic management. Low emission zones are simply one tool in the armoury.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It would pull the debate out of proportion to conclude by creating the impression that LEZs in themselves were indispensable to improving air quality. There are plenty of other means of doing that. We expect local authorities to make all appropriate haste in implementing those measures immediately prior to October and beyond it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his further clarification of schedule 11 and the use of proceeds from congestion charging and the parking levy. He began by expressing enthusiasm for LEZs, saying that he was their great champion, but he ended on a downbeat note by suggesting that they were one tool in the armoury; the two statements do not fit easily together. He is right linguistically; nevertheless, LEZs are a most important tool. There is evidence that roadside testing and LEZs can make a major contribution to meeting the Government's targets. The Under Secretary need not take my word for that—his own Department research has produced the evidence. The Government's cleaner vehicles task force said positive things about the significant contribution that the two measures can make.
<P>
<B>Mr. Geraint Davies </B>(Croydon, Central): There is an assumption that all local authorities will use whatever powers they have to reduce emissions and pollution. What would the hon. Member for Bath do about authorities which test pollution and then encourage ever more car-borne retail into areas for economic reasons—thereby worsening the situation—despite their having powers to do something about the problem? Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary also will say something about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I slightly lost the hon. Gentleman there. The question of what is to be done about local authorities which fail to take action to produce their plans by October, even though they will know by June that they have air pollution black spots, is one that the Under-Secretary must answer. I hope that he will take tough action against councils that fail to meet their responsibilities under the 1995 Act, whether they be Liberal Democrat-led, Conservative-led, Labour-led or no overall control councils. This is an important issue. I merely say to him that LEZs and roadside testing are not just additional tools; they are two significant measures that can be adopted. Under the existing legislative framework and with the current degree of support, they will be rather difficult to introduce throughout the country, even though they would make a major contribution to pollution reduction.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Clarke </B>(Northampton, South): I do not want to complicate matters but it has suddenly dawned on me that most of the air pollution problems in Northampton come from the M1 motorway. In the context of the amendments, I wonder what powers our local authority would have as regards the M1 motorway. Would they include, the power to close it. ? The issue is not where the LEZ is located, but where the pollution comes from in the first place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Again, that is a question that the Under-Secretary must answer—[Interruption.] The Under-Secretary pokes at me in that provocative way of his, but the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Clarke) asked me whether I thought it appropriate for the Under-Secretary to respond, and my answer is that it is. I give way to the hon. Gentleman, so that he can respond to both his hon. Friends, who have expressed important points that deserve to be answered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Liberal Democrats pass the buck, as ever. This will be my final word on the matter. Local authorities already have powers to establish LEZs. My Department is working closely with other organisations including the National Society for Clean Air to assist local authorities to implement LEZs effectively.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Department is also working with the Cleaner Transport Forum, Westminster city council and others. I am sure that he would want to pay tribute to the work that they are doing to help him. However, if that is his answer to his two hon. Friends, they certainly will not be taking their pens out of their pockets. Nevertheless, there will be an opportunity for both hon. Gentlemen to move amendments on Report on these important issues.
<P>
The introduction of LEZs on our principal motorways and the resulting traffic jams will be fascinating. The fumes will be outweighed by the enforcement that can be levied in respect of polluting vehicles, provided that the Minister also adds a rectification clause. We look forward to those interesting debates on Report—It is clear from the sedentary nods of the hon. Member for Northampton, South that he intends to move an amendment then. That will give me an opportunity to discuss those points further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 1003.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Amendment No. 1002 is a technical repeal in consequence of the SRA having wide powers to fund franchised services. New clause 186 replaces section 29(1)(b) as the SRA's grant-making power. Amendment No. 1003 is a further consequential repeal of paragraph 15(7)(a) of the Competition Act 1998. That paragraph amended subsection 55(6) to insert references to subsection 55(5A), which was in turn inserted in section 55 by the Competition Act. In consequence of section 55(5A) being explicitly mentioned in the text of 55(6) by amendment No. 995 this provision is spent and may be repealed.
<P>
After that impressive explanation, I am sure that the Committee will be happy to hear no more from me.

Schedule 26, as amended, agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> It would be most remiss of us if we ended these proceedings without a few valedictory words.
<P>
It seems a very long time since our proceedings began, in the depths of winter. The recent cold snap certainly gave us a reminder of those times. Even though the sun that has been streaming through the windows all morning is no longer shining, I was reminded of Shakespeare's words and how the winter of our discontent was being made glorious summer by this sun. We are perhaps not quite there yet, but we are well on the way.
<P>
Since 18 January, we have spent 87 hours together in this Room. I would like to have been able to tell hon. Members how much paper the Committee has used during that time, especially as our Department has an interest in environmental matters, but we have not been able to produce a precise figure. All I can say is that we have some very tired photocopiers and that will fill some recycling bins over the next few days. It is a consolation to me that the housing Green Paper that our Department published earlier this week makes provision for saving some 20 million pieces of paper through reforms to housing benefit. That, at least, will compensate for the paper generated in this Committee.
<P>
On behalf of myself and my ministerial colleagues, I thank all members of the Committee for their contributions. We have had some extremely interesting and constructive debates and we have got to the heart of various issues and points of detail in the Bill. The purpose of Standing Committees is to examine Bills in detail, to scrutinise and to amend, and we have done that. As a result we have an improved Bill to take back to the Floor of the House.
<P>
I should like to thank a number of hon. Members individually—always an invidious task. It is appropriate to thank first the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms), who made a consistently courteous and constructive contribution to our proceedings. In his absence, I thank the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) who also made significant contributions. At times, as I looked at the Opposition Benches, I felt that I was attending a performance of Haydn's ``Farewell'' symphony, in the final movement of which each player comes to the end of his part and leaves. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) has stayed on, so that the hon. Member for Poole is not left alone at the bitter end.
<P>
I should like to thank the hon. Member for Bath for his unfailing optimism and for the many joyous moments of humour that he has given us. I shall pass rapidly over the relationship—sometimes extraordinarily close—between the hon. Member for Bath and my fellow Minister and hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), especially the involvement of the former's wife in these proceeding. The wife of Bath, if I can use another literary association, is perhaps not a subject that we should pursue further. I must tell the hon. Gentleman, who admitted to feeling the strain after the late proceedings last night, that he is only hon. Member whom I have accompanied down a hole in Bath. We referred to that earlier in our proceedings. Neither of us dug on that occasion.
<P>
I should like to give particular thanks to the Under-„Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Streatham, who has taken a quite disproportionate amount of the burden of moving and resisting amendments. He has brought his characteristic energy and enthusiasm to these proceedings and has enlivened them enormously. I am very grateful indeed to him.
<P>
I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), who is one of two members of the Committee who have been present on every occasion and during each moment of the proceedings—I shall come to the other in just a moment. Without the support of the Whips, it is always difficult to handle matters, and I am very grateful to him. I should also like to thank my parliamentary private secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Mr. Hope), and my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas), who have both given us great support. I thank all my hon. Friends for their support throughout the proceedings of the Bill; it has been much appreciated, as have the many constructive contributions that they have made to the debates—and their votes, which are always a welcome background to the proceedings.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I should like to thank the Committee Clerk, the editors of the Official Report and all the other Officers of the House for their usual excellent service. We have stretched their patience on several occasions and they have always risen to the challenge, as shown only too well in the Official Report.
<P>
We have lost during the course of our proceedings two Committee members. I should like to thank the Under-„Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) for his contributions before he was called away, not to higher things, but to the delights of the Utilities Bill and, more recently, to the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill. I understand that he is also a member of Standing Committee C, which is considering the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Bill. I mention all this simply to make the point that even though the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions has the largest number of Ministers of any Department, we do not have an easy time—there is much for us to do.
<P>
We also said goodbye to the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Portillo), who went on to greater things. It is difficult to see how they could be much greater, since he was dubbed field marshal while a member of this Committee. We were, however, delighted to welcome the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth) come in to replace him.
<P>
The Bill is important and it will make a major impact on transport, giving effect to many of the Government's key policies to achieve an integrated transport system. In future years, people not only in the House, but throughout the country, will appreciate the efforts we have made to tackle some of the most intractable transport problems and to lay the foundations for new initiatives that will help to improve the quality of transport options for many years ahead.
<P>
As we all know, we have looked at a wide range of modes of transport. My hon. Friend the Member for Streatham has given us tour d'horizons that have taken a view from the cockpit of a jumbo jet; looked at the world from the bus driver's seat, possibly on a tour bus in Bath; and seen trains pass from that famous signal box somewhere in the west midlands—I think in West Bromwich. About the only transport mode, curiously, that we have not covered is the one depicted in the picture that hangs over your head, Mr. Gale. That is of great significance to Members of the House of Commons who, when threatened by an overmighty Executive, fled by boat. It is ironic that the Committee has not had the opportunity to discuss maritime or water transport.
<P>
We have kept the Post Office fully occupied with letters home to mothers, wives and other family members; arguments A to C have been deployed, as was opening gambit D, some weeks ago. Therefore, putting it in the nicest possible way to the hon. Member for Bath, argument D that he put forward today would perhaps be better renamed ``argument E''. I will leave that for him to ponder another day. We also had great fun with the names of each other's constituencies.
<P>
The most memorable aspect of the Committee's deliberations has been the friendly atmosphere and the good-natured way in which we have handled some very complex and detailed discussions. That is, above all, essentially a reflection of your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. On the opening day of the proceeding, I quoted, misguidedly, from a BBC website which referred to your famed irascibility. I said then, in self defence, that I hoped that we would behave ourselves and not provoke you. I am not sure that we have behaved ourselves, but your extremely skilful, judicious and good-humoured chairmanship has ensured that the Committee has proceeded in an orderly and efficient way. Your light touch has made the many hours that we have spent in this Room not only bearable, but enjoyable. We owe you a great debt, not least because, although I have served on many committees, this is the first where the Chairman has sat in the Chair from the very first moment to the very last. That shows an extraordinary attention to the proceedings of the Committee and a sense of responsibility that we all appreciate enormously. On behalf of all members of the Committee, thank you very much indeed for your enormous contribution.
<P>
We have had one Chairman for the entire proceedings, but we have also had one or two other joyous events and it would be wrong to conclude without mentioning that this is the first Committee of which I have been a member that has had a wedding. I am only sorry that the wife of Poole has not come to enliven our proceedings, but again congratulate the hon. Member for Poole.
<P>
Mr. Gale, I wish you and all members of the Committee a long and happy retirement from its proceedings and I hope that we shall all find means of filling our time productively on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Syms:</B> I echo the Minister of State's words. The Committee has been good-humoured because you, Mr. Gale, have kept us in order, while allowing debate to flow and people to make interventions. It has been a better-informed Committee for that reason. Although the Bill still has some way to go, these proceedings have done the House great credit.
<P>
I thank the Clerk and his staff for the way in which they have dealt with sometimes illegible amendments tabled by the Opposition and made them into sense; and, of course, the editors of the Official Report, who have had to interpret sometimes garbled contributions from the Opposition Benches and have always made them sound excellent and well-presented.
<P>
We have seen a few changes in the Committee. The field marshal was promoted to be shadow Chancellor and we—particularly the hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward)—have missed his dancing metaphors from the early Committee stage. We were reinforced by my hon. Friend Member for Aldershot, whose concern about workplace parking for tanks was something that will stay with us. I apologise for my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex not being here today: he will be mortified not to be present at the end of our proceedings. I was impressed by the way in which he could whip European treaties out of his bicycle bag and quote them at length. I am sure that as time goes by he will be proved to have been absolutely right in his concerns.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray), whose membership of the Select Committee was so helpful to us, had the good sense to go to Singapore during the course of our proceedings and come back to share that experience with us. His contribution so pleased our Whips that he is now a member of the Committee examining Countryside and Rights of Way Bill, which is doing good work along the Corridor. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham made many contributions. He is an expert on all points north and his interaction with the hon. Member for Ettrick, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has been an education to all those of us who represent southern parts of the country.
<P>
Finally I thank you again, Mr. Gale, for the way in which you have conducted the Committee. We shall fondly remember the 87 hours that we have spent together. The Bill will no doubt be discussed for many more hours on the Floor of the House, but, as the first Committee with which I have dealt from the Front Bench, it has been an excellent experience—tremendously hard work, but very rewarding.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> We have heard ``tours of the horizon'', ``tours d'horizon'' and all sorts of pronunciations, but as the sun begins to set below the horizon it is appropriate to echo the sentiments of the Minister for Housing and Planning and the hon. Member for Poole. I should like to thank all the Officials who have served the Committee so well. I offer my personal thanks to the Committee Clerk, who has been extremely helpful to me and to my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.
<P>
I also pay tribute to the Official Reporters, whose patience we have tried on several occasions, not least when we confuse them with various pronunciations of constituencies—particularly that of the hon. Member for ``St. Reatham''. My hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale and I are distinguished for having the longest and the shortest constituency names in the Committee. I am delighted that most hon. Members have, at long last, learned how to refer to my hon. Friend's constituency correctly. We have spent 87 hours together in Committee, but we may need just a little longer because, in his good contribution a few moments ago, the hon. Member for Poole still got my hon. Friend's constituency wrong. Fortunately, Report and Third Reading are still to come, so there will be further opportunities to get it right.
<P>
I have enjoyed participating in Committee for two reasons. First, it has been good-natured, largely because of your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. Secondly, it has provided an opportunity to learn a great deal. All hon. Members have climbed a steep learning curve. In effect, we have not had to deal with just one Bill, but four different Bills put together. The Committee has provided us with the opportunity to hear the purple prose of Ministers, to congratulate the hon. Member for Poole on his marriage and to wonder why he was so keen to attend the Committee within a few hours of it taking place. We have had a brief opportunity to discuss the problems of open-top buses, and an even briefer opportunity to debate concerns about the Waverley line. We have also had the opportunity to invent some new shorthand, from A to E, which I hope will have been recorded clearly and will prove beneficial to all Committees in future.
<P>
Above all, we have had the benefit of your chairmanship, Mr. Gale. You will recall, perhaps not fondly, that at one point in our deliberations you told us that you might have access to—and I am trying to put it tactfully—a pair of golden balls. Most notably, we have constantly referred to your famed irascibility.
<P>
We were in the House of Commons quite late last night. After a late sitting, I sometimes have difficulty sleeping. Such was the case last night when, by pure chance, I happened to be reading the diaries of Evelyn Waugh. In 1946, a radio reporter interviewed him and, pointing out that he was famed for his irascibility, asked him to say something outrageous into the recorder, so he could use it in the radio programme. He was offered $100 to demonstrate it, but refused to do so. We have given you infinitely worse provocation than a measly $100. We have tried your patience in so many ways on so many occasions during the 87 hours that it is, frankly, a miracle that your famed irascibility has not been in evidence.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Don't push your luck.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I pay you enormous tribute, Mr. Gale, and look forward to serving under you again in future. Of course, our entire proceedings on the Bill are not yet finished: Report and Third Reading are yet to come. I look forward to encountering all members of the Committee again.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank hon. Members for their kind comments. I must set the record straight about one thing: the balls are crystal, not gold.
<P>
Through the Committee's various tours, we have experienced most forms of land and sea transport. I was mildly surprised and a little disappointed that we did not get to rickshaws and mules. No doubt, the ingenuity of members of the Committee will ensure that that omission is rectified on Report. The open-top bus has taken its tour, studiously avoiding the Salop, through the Borders to Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As the Minister of State pointed out—and it is the first time that it has happened in any Committee on which I have served—it is unusual for a member of the Committee to leave, albeit briefly, to get married. I wish the hon. Member for Poole well. I hope that he and Mrs. Syms will find some time to spend together, now that the labours of the Committee have ended. Another member of the Committee was promoted, if not to commander-in-chief, at least to Chief of the General Staff . The subalterns and other ranks will live to fight battles another day.
<P>
The Under-Secretary tried on the ermine of his colleague and found that it fitted quite well. He may have to wait a little, but I believe that he is now returning to his normal housing portfolio. That leaves me with the Minister of State, whom I am going to offer, after this morning's performance, the Brian Johnson award for uncontrollable laughter. If the ungrateful electorate of his constituency ever decide to dispense with his services, there is clearly another career waiting for him as the vicar of St. Reatham.
<P>
I wish to thank members of the Committee on both sides for their courtesy and good humour in conducting proceedings on this long Bill. There has been no shred of ill temper from start to finish, which is a credit to every member of the Committee and a demonstration of how the House of Commons can work at its best.
<P>
Finally, I join others in paying tribute to the Officers of the House of Commons who also work extremely long hours. Three doors have been kept secure with only two police or officers who have sat through our proceedings. I also commend the Hansard writers, who have coped well with what one BBC reporter famously called the ``pronounciation'' of ``Barth'', ``Bath'' and other variations on the theme. Most importantly, I thank the Clerk of the Committee, Steve Priestley, without whom my job would have been not just harder, but impossible. We are indeed grateful. Thanks to all.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
