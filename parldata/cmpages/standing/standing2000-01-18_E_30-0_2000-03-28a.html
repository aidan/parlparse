No. 860, in schedule 13, page 185, line 40, leave out sub-paragraph (5).

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 812 and 815 and 839 to 841.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I propose briefly to explain the purpose of the amendments and to respond in due course to the debate on the Opposition amendments. I hope that that will be for the convenience of the Committee.

<P>
We made it clear early on that although railways legislation is reserved to Westminster, the devolved Administrations have a particular and legitimate right to be involved in influencing the Strategic Rail Authority's development of railway policy. We made a commitment very early that one board member of the SRA should take particular account of Welsh concerns and one of Scottish. We have now been asked to make those commitments clear on the face of the Bill and that is what the amendments achieve. They also make technical changes to improve the drafting as regards the appointments of the chairman. Amendment No. 815 makes it an obligation for the SRA to consult with the Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales before it formulates its strategies and as part of keeping those strategies under review.

<P>
The Secretary of State will remain the person who makes the appointments to the board of the SRA, but one member will need to be appointed after consultation with the National Assembly for Wales and one after consultation with Scottish Ministers. Appointments to the board are of individuals and a broad range of experience and expertise is needed, as well as the need to take account of specific interests such as the concerns of Wales and Scotland. The Secretary of State is in the best place to appoint a balanced board taking account of its needs if he appoints all the people. Then, the individual strengths can most simply be balanced.

<P>
On the consultation by the SRA with the Scottish Ministers and the National Assembly for Wales, we expect that the SRA will need to consult with a wide range of bodies before formulating its strategies, including local authorities, industry and other interest groups. It would not be practical, nor is it necessary, to specify those groups on the face of the Bill. Should it prove necessary to direct the SRA on whom to consult, that could be achieved through the Secretary of State's directions and guidance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Bernard Jenkin </B>(North Essex): The first thing to say, Mr. Gale, apart from ``Good morning'' is that the Government amendments are more evidence, if it was needed, that the Government are increasingly making up the Bill as they go along. It is no surprise that the devolution provisions are a bit of a mess because the forms of devolution in Scotland and Wales are different. Primary legislation is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, while in Wales, a Crown body has devolved power over secondary legislation and has no primary legislative role. Devolution in Scotland represents devolution of the legislative function of Parliament alongside executive authority, whereas in Wales a Crown body has taken upon itself secondary legislative functions.

<P>
The Government are caught in the inequity between the treatment of Wales and Scotland. In the Railways Bill, which was introduced on Second Reading and scrutinised by the Select Committee, these matters were dealt with in clause 27 and Scotland got a good look in but Wales had none at all. I imagine that the Government have been subject to lobbying and ribbing as a result.

<P>
As we shall find later, the issues in which the Government are now embroiled in regard to the devolved bodies open up a can of worms. They beg the question whether the original Scotland Bill or the Government of Wales Bill foresaw a delegated relationship for members of the Scottish Executive and Ministers in the Welsh Assembly and envisaged that they should have a subservient relationship to Ministers at Westminster.

<P>
The burden of my comments will relate to our amendments and those tabled by the Government, with which the Minister dealt somewhat briefly, considering that the Government have tabled a large number of amendments to clause 177.

<P>
Amendment No. 856 is primarily concerned with fixing the number of members of the SRA. We have reached a crucial point in the Bill at which we can tell whether the body is intended to be a dynamic and independent force for good or a plaything of Ministers. As we proceed, we shall see that the authority has every potential to become the latter. Our amendment No. 856 deletes subsection (1), which sets out the constitution of the authority. Government amendment No. 805 would change that. Clause 177(2) starts with ``But''. It is interesting that legislation has changed to the extent that a subsection can now start with ``But''. I draw it to the Committee's attention: we are really moving with the times.-[
Interruption.] I think that it is more Shakespearean than Welsh. Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>But the Secretary of State may by order alter either or both of the numbers for the time being specified in subsection (1); and an order under this subsection shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State may by order alter the number of members of the SRA more or less at the stroke of a pen.

<P>
Amendment No. 857 is designed to tidy up the appointment procedure. It would be sensible for Ministers to have in mind who should chair the SRA before appointing the rest of its members. Amendment No. 857 is designed to do that.

<P>
Amendment No. 858 ensures that the chairman has some tenure. As it stands, Ministers may appoint and then remove members of the Strategic Rail Authority with impunity. We propose that a chair chosen by the Minister should be given a term of three years to provide some security so that the interests of the industry as a whole can be represented to the Government without fear or favour during that period of office.

<P>
Amendment No. 860 is a linked amendment that alters schedule 13. It removes sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 2. I am a little confused about the relationship between schedule 13 and clause 177. I fail to see why some of the measures concerning the appointment of the chair of the authority and tenure of office are dealt with in clause 177 when sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 2 in schedule 13 deals with the same subject. These matters should all be dealt with either in clause 177 or in schedule 13. Sub-paragraph (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When a member-<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) is appointed to chair the Authority or to act as deputy to the member appointed to chair it, or

<P>
(b) ceases to hold office as such,
<P>
the Secretary of State may vary the terms of the member's appointment as a member of the Authority so as to alter the date of cessation of membership.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Therefore, whatever we put in clause 177 it is overridden by schedule 13 and the Secretary of State should not have so much discretionary power over members of the authority.

<P>
That concludes my discussion of the amendments. Our main purpose is to provide clarity, but I hope that the Under-Secretary will explain a little further the true relationship between Ministers of the Crown at Westminster and the Scottish and Welsh devolved Administrations because that blurs responsibilities, though I welcome the intention that representatives from all parts of the United Kingdom should be members of the SRA.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Smith </B>(Vale of Glamorgan): I support the Government amendments on these important matters, especially Government amendment No. 805. It is clear from the comments of the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) that neither he nor the Conservative party have come to terms with devolution, nor does he understand it. The proposals are a first-class example of Westminster working closely with Edinburgh and Cardiff to produce a sensible make-up for the SRA. The Bill has from start to finish shown devolution in action and real partnership between Wales, Scotland and Westminster through a number of amendments that have been made along the way.

<P>
I cannot speak for Scotland, but because of the neglect of the transport infrastructure in the past two decades, Wales has specific transport needs and particular problems with railways. It is important that the SRA will be able to deliver on some of those. One of the legacies of the previous Government was a decline in basic services throughout Wales and the lack of an all-Wales railway franchise.
<P>
10.45 a.m.

<P>
It takes some doing, but despite all the alleged investment in the railways, the travelling time by rail from Paddington to Cardiff increased by 20 minutes between 1979 and 1997, from approximately 1 hour 45 minutes to two hours. I stress those times because I want the Committee to realise how close Cardiff is to London-though not so close as it was. Had we had proper investment, it would be much closer. There has been no electrification or adequate upgrading of signalling on those lines and there is no rail freight terminal, although that is about to come.

<P>
The secret was to provide a formula that allowed Wales to put forward its needs. I am glad to say that there is now a bid for an all-Wales franchise for intra-Wales services from Prism Rail and I hope that the Government are looking carefully at that. Of equal-and, at times perhaps, more-importance in Wales are the cross-border rail links. It is crucial that there is an authority that can provide a strategic view for the whole of the United Kingdom, on which Wales must have a clear voice. Following discussion with the Welsh Assembly a solution has been found that will prove favourable to everyone. There were demands from some quarters for the Welsh Assembly to be able to nominate the person on to the Strategic Rail Authority, but that could have created a conflict of interest. A separate strategic rail authority for Wales was also proposed, but that would be jumping the gun slightly if there is no comprehensive or adequate rail network.

<P>
I am pleased to see proposals in the Bill that will go down well in Wales. However, it is disappointing and sad that the Conservative party still does not understand what devolution is about.

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Moore </B>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale): On the issues raised by the amendments tabled in my name and that of my hon. Friend, the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), the Minister's opening comments almost anticipated our argument. It was a variation on the ``This is a list argument and we cannot possibly tolerate that''. There are two particularly good reasons in the amendments that we have tabled for the Government to think again, or at least to give us a strong reassurance that the interests that we would promote are properly represented in the SRA.

<P>
The overwhelming principle underlying the Bill is the notion of improving the integration between different modes of transport throughout the United Kingdom. Earlier parts of the Bill dealt with local transport plans, buses and various other issues. Local authorities are at the sharp end of developing the integrated transport policy in a practical sense and many of the measures in parts II and III as well as IV of the Bill will go directly to the heart of that.

<P>
Therefore, it would not be a mistake or a downplaying of the role of the local authorities if they did not have strong representation on the Strategic Rail Authority. The Government have decided not to create a strategic transport authority. We do not necessarily support that decision, but the integrating aspects of the rail authority could be strengthened by bringing in local government representation.

<P>
Our second amendment is about the need to represent the interests of people with disabilites and older people. They are two distinct but important groups who, more than most, are dependent on public transport to make their way around the country or within their own local areas. The railway system is beginning to tackle many of the problems that they face, such as access to trains, frequency, comfort and so on, but there is still a long way to go. We have heard about the experience of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) on Connex trains and elsewhere. The way in which individuals with disabilities are treated on the rail system is, frankly, extremely shabby at times. In what we proudly call a civilised society, it should not be tolerated. We believe and hope that the Minister will take on board the need for those views and interests to be represented by the SRA. It would be an important signal to all those groups of the seriousness with which the Government and the rail authority take their concerns if the groups were members of this body.

<P>
On Scottish and Welsh representation, which is to be formally included under the Government amendments, I wholeheartedly endorse what the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. John Smith) said. I am slightly puzzled by the difference between amendments Nos. 806 and 807. Amendment No. 807 states:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In making an appointment  the Secretary of State shall also have regard to the desirability of appointing a person who is familiar with the special requirements and circumstances of Scotland, or of Wales.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It begs the question whether the Scottish Executive or the National Assembly might, after consultation, have suggested someone who was not familiar with those aspects. Will the Under-Secretary say in what circumstances he envisages that someone might be caught by the first amendment but the second amendment will still be necessary to ensure that the right person is on board? It seems slightly odd to me. It is an important matter to which we shall no doubt return on the clauses on Scottish and Welsh issues.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) has tabled amendments that deal with how the interaction between the Scottish Executive, the SRA and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will work on grounds of accountability, so I will not deal with those matters now. I hope that we shall have a useful debate on that in due course.

<P>
Finally, on the Conservative amendments, it is an interesting notion of bringing clarity to the Bill, which is what the hon. Member for North Essex always seeks to do, to talk of giving tenure to people who are appointed to the SRA. However, later Conservative amendments delete any prospect for compensation for members of the SRA. I am not sure whether that is clarity or muddled thinking, but perhaps the hon. Member for North Essex will clarify that later.

<P>
The SRA is a very important body. We have said before that it does not go far enough in tackling key integration issues, but we hope that the Government will show some willingness to improve it by enabling it to represent the important interests of local authorities, which will deliver integration on the ground, and the serious issues faced by those with disabilities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful for the broad welcome that all hon. Members who have spoken have given the Government's amendments. Let me deal with one or two specific questions raised before I turn to the substance of the amendments. The hon. Member for North Essex asked about the link between clause 177 and schedule 13. Clause 177 gives the headlines and <P>
schedule 13, as is common in legislation, gives the details. On the override, of course, the hon. Gentleman may table an appropriate amendment to schedule 13 in due course if that is a problem. If such an amendment were carried, there would have to be consequential amendments to the Bill, but that is a slightly unlikely development.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of the relationship between Scottish Ministers and the SRA. As the hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Mr. Moore) pointed out, we shall have the opportunity to debate those matters in more detail when we reach clause 183 and the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East and Musselburgh (Dr. Strang) that will allow us to explore in some detail the rolling out of the so-called McLeish settlement.

<P>
The hon. Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale was absolutely right in his intervention. I believe that we have quite a consensus in Committee in that we are hostile to the kitchen sink tendency. We generally refer to that as argument C, and I shall be deploying argument C in response to some of the questions that have been raised. I take his point about amendment No. 807 and I shall reflect on his question, which related to a hypothetic situation. On the whole, one is disinclined to comment on hypothetical situations, but if the hon. Gentleman requires further clarification, I shall certainly write to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): I am grateful to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for ``Streat Ham'' for giving way. Before he moves on from the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale, will he tell the Committee his understanding of the nature of the relationship between the SRA and local government, both in respect of individual councils and collectively through the Local Government Assocation? Will he further explain to the Committee whether he believes it is appropriate for the SRA to review formally and comment upon the local transport plans that are required in an earlier part of the Bill?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> To correct the hon. Gentleman, the preferred pronunciation of my constituency is now ``St. Reatham''. We are trying to go a little up-market. The relationship between local government and the SRA in respect of local transport plans is important. I am not trying to evade the matter, but we shall return to it in some detail on later clauses, when I expect to deliver a detailed response. Essentially it is a matter for guidance and directions by the Secretary of State to the SRA. The current guidance and directions of the franchising director include a detailed list of bodies with which consultation is expected to be carried out, and we would certainly expect similar guidance to be issued to the SRA.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am most grateful to the hon. Member for ``St. Reatham''. He says that he expects us to return to the debate in later clauses. Will he point me to those clauses? If he can reassure me that he will deal with the matter, I shall leave him to do so. While he gets his head round that request, when he returns to the relevant clause, will he also address the issue whether to date any of the local transport plans produced in the first year of operation have been so regarded by the shadow SRA or the franchising directorate. If he does not know the answer, perhaps in the intervening period he will research the matter and subsequently inform the Committee.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As ever, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who provides a verbal support system while necessary consultations are carried out. It is very generous of him and enables me to explain that we shall come to the relationship with local authorities and local transport plans when we discuss clauses 181 and 182. I knew that I had seen references along those lines in my speaking notes, but I did not recall the context.

<P>
On the other matter that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, the available time span will allow me to carry out the necessary research. In due course I hope to offer him a full, frank and fearless explanation of the Government's intentions.

<P>
Finally, in response to the debate, I express yet again my gratitude to my hon. Friend the member for Vale of Glamorgan for his support and his endorsement of the Bill as a good example of the partnership between central Government and the devolved authorities. I hope that we shall always be ready to accept reasonable amendments. I am sure that he shares my interest in the decision of the franchising directorate-to which he referred- that on 8 march announced the setting up of a feasibility study into the possibility of Wales rail franchises. It is an interesting proposal and we look forward to the results of the study.

<P>
Amendment No. 856, in the name of the hon. Member for North Essex, seeks to remove the power of the Secretary of State, with the consent of Parliament, to amend the number of members appointed to the board of the SRA. I agree that between eight and 15 members should be ideal for a board, which is why we have proposed those numbers. They should create a balance between having enough members to bring a range of experience and expertise without having so many that the body becomes unweildy and unable to make decisions.

<P>
Having said that, however, we may find that in the future the balance is not totally right. Additional expertise may be required or there may not be enough of the right candidates to establish a team of eight. In that case, it must be right for the Secretary of State to have the flexibility to amend the numbers. The amendment would remove flexibility that might be needed to make the board more effective. It was suggested that the board might become ``a plaything''. It could hardly be that: changes could not be made ``at the stroke of a pen'', to cite the hon member for North Essex, as the power is invoked by negative instrument. Hon. Members would have the chance to pray against any proposal that they considered inappropriate.

<P>
I have some sympathy for the logic behind amendment No. 857, which is also in the name of the hon. Member for North Essex. I agree that the chairman needs to be the first person appointed to the board so that he can be consulted on other appointments, but the Bill already achieves that for all except initial appointments. Clause 178(2) requires the Secretary of State to consult the member appointed to the chair before appointing the other members of the board. To meet that requirement, he must, by implication, have appointed the chairman first.

<P>
The Bill makes specific provision in respect of first appointments. By virtue of schedule 25(1), the post of chairman of the SRA will be offered to the current chairman of the British Railways Board, Sir Alastair Morton. Other members of the British Railways Board will be offered membership of the SRA.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 858 and 859 would require that initial appointments should always be for a period of three years. That is the minimum term generally recommended by the Commissioner for Public Appointments and accepted by Ministers. In her ``Guidance on Appointments to Public Bodies'', however, the Commissioner acknowledges that special circumstances may require a shorter term of appointment. The amendments would not allow Ministers discretion to deal with such special circumstances in the case of the SRA. I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will accept that it is not appropriate to curtail the usual discretion in this way. In some cases such a rigid rule might lead to the loss of a valuable candidate who could not promise the full three years.

<P>
I have a lot of sympathy for the sentiment behind amendment No. 717, even if I consider it undesirable in practice. The board will need a broad range of experience from members and the Bill already requires that the Secretary of State has regard to their experience of, and capacity in, matters relevant to the functions of the authority. In addition, we propose to recognise the unique circumstances of Scotland and Wales. In a board of only eight to 15 members, there are enough statutory requirements on the Secretary of State. He will need to look for the very best people with the most relevant and balanced experience.

<P>
To be effective, members must all work towards the overall purposes of the authority, not merely represent different groups. That will ensure that effective and balanced direction can be given to the authority. Of course, local transport is one important perspective and I can assure members of the Committee that that will be considered, but there are others, and it is vital not to fetter the Secretary of State too much from the start. As far as possible we are seeking to avoid the authority becoming either a federal or corporatist body; we intend that it should be a body that can fulfil the objective of providing a national, strategic vision for the moving railway and its infrastructure and relationship with other transport modes.

<P>
Equally, I have much sympathy with the sentiment behind amendment No. 769, but the same principles apply. I can, however, repeat our commitment to having a passenger voice on the authority. The authority will have to consider the interests of all users, including disabled and older people. Clause 182 already puts on the authority the duty, when exercising its functions, to have regard to the interests of people who are disabled. The authority will also inherit the Rail Regulators code towards disabled people and will be the champion of the consumer. The Secretary of State will take these important considerations into account when choosing members, looking both at experience and expertise, but also at a balance of members.

<P>
Selection of candidates for public appointments within organisations sponsored by the DETR is made in accordance with Nolan principles and guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Appointments are therefore made on the basis of merit, although we are committed to making appointments from a broad range of backgrounds. We are concerned at the under-representation of women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities in senior public appointments and the Department has made it clear that it especially welcomes applications from them.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 861, in page 186, line 17, leave out sub-paragraph (3).

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: No. 916, in clause 190, page 108, line 3, leave out subsection (9).

<P>
No. 968, in schedule 22, page 233, line 20, leave out sub-paragraph (3).

<P>
No. 975, in clause 214, page 125, line 33, leave out subsection (4).

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> These are probing amendments and offer an opportunity to ask the Minister what compensation arrangements are envisaged for members of the Strategic Rail Authority.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> As we enter this important schedule, it may be convenient for the Committee, if I say a word about its purpose before dealing with the question raised by the hon. Member for North Essex. Clause 179 and Schedule 13 set out provisions relating to the appointment, tenure and remuneration of members and staff of the authority, certain procedural matters, and provide for the financing of the authority.

<P>
Part I of Schedule 13 makes standard non-departmental public body provision for the conditions of appointment for members and staff and part II makes standard provision for the funding of a NDPB. As for part III, it is worth noting the following with regard to funding and borrowing. The authority will mainly be funded by grant from the Secretary of State. It will be entitled to borrow money from the secretary of State and, temporarily, from other sources such as overdraft or bridging facility with the consent of the Secretary of State and the approval of the Treasury. Restrictions on borrowing are set out. This mix of powers will enable the authority to be a flexible, proactive body in the promotion and development of the railway.

<P>
The borrowing limit is set at £3 billion, or such other sum as the Secretary of State may, with the approval of the Treasury, specify by order made by statutory instrument. Provision is made as to the terms of any loans from the Secretary of State and the requirements for accounts and audit of Government loans are set out. The Secretary of State is allowed to guarantee sums borrowed by the authority and the procedures that must be followed to facilitate this are laid down.

<P>
With regard to the payment of surplus sums, Mr. Gale, the Secretary of State may require the payment to him of sums that are received by the authority, in particular those that are surplus. This will ensure that the authority cannot hold large surpluses that properly belong to the public purse.

<P>
Part III of the schedule enables the authority to give the Secretary of State assistance and advice about any matter in respect of which any of its functions is exercisable. Part IV sets out standard NDPB procedures to be adopted by the authority in respect of its business, committees and so on and the declaration of members' interests. The provisions on members' interests are based on those in the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998. I hope that this setting out of the broad objectives of schedule 13 has been helpful to the Committee.

<P>
The amendments would change the arrangements for possible payments for loss of office. They would prevent compensation being paid in special circumstances in the following cases: first, where a member of the SRA cease to hold office; secondly, where the office of franchising director is abolished on the setting up of the SRA; thirdly, where a member of a rail passengers' committee ceases to hold office on abolition of the committee; and finally, where a member of the British Railways Board ceases to hold office because of a reduction in the size of the board or its abolition. I realise that these are probing amendments, but they would, if effected, be unfair to the people involved. The Government are denying that this is an opportunity to set up any matter arising out of the termination of the relevant appointment.

<P>
These are standard provisions dealing with public appointments. The powers would be used only in special circumstances. For example, the last franchising director cannot be obliged to take the appointment of chief executive of the SRA that is to be offered by virtue of paragraph 1 of schedule 25. In the unlikely event that the franchising director elects to turn down that appointment, there must be discretion to pay compensation for loss of the predecessor office. The power may be used if boundary changes led to a change in the number and membership of rail passengers' committees.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Presumably, the franchising director has a contract of employment or at least a contract of some kind, and the Government cannot arbitrarily terminate that employment. Even this primary legislation does not override such a contract. Presumably, the Government already have an obligation in law to pay compensation, and I fail to see why the Secretary of State should take an additional power to pay more or less than he would be obliged to pay according to the existing contract of the franchising director.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I fully take the point that the hon. Gentleman is making but let me remind him that the powers in the schedule go wider than a single office, and embrace the possibility of compensation in other areas. For example, in the reference to rail passengers' committees, the terms of a contract would have to be met. These powers, therefore, are partly to anticipate such a possibility. I hope that that is a satisfactory explanation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am still somewhat confused because although the hon. Gentleman made a game attempt at answering the point I made, the Committee deserves a fully explanation. Amendment No. 861 reads
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If, when a person ceases to hold office as a member of the Authority, the Secretary of State determines that there are special circumstances which make it right that the person should receive compensation, the Authority shall pay such compensation as may be determined by the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
We have courts and contract law to determine whether there are special circumstances. There is a suspicion that someone less charitable than I might harbour the view that this is a way of paying people off to shut them up. The same applies to amendment No. 916 to clause 190, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. If compensation is due on termination of the franchising director's contract, let it be paid. Why does a special power need to be put in the Bill to enable that compensation to be paid?

<P>
I shall refer briefly to amendment No. 968, which amends schedule 22. That schedule amends the Railways Act 1993. The 1993 Act gave the power to the passengers' committees, which is a more responsible attitude. The employer, not the Secretary of State, should be responsible for determining compensation according to the circumstances and contractual obligations of the case.

<P>
Amendment No. 975 would remove subsection (4) of clause 214, which deals with the winding down and abolition of the board. As a legal entity, the board already has obligations under employment law to pay out any sums liable under contracts of employment. I fail to see why the Secretary of State requires the power to determine what compensation is payable. Will the Minister explain it more fully?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for probing into this important subject. I can now put us out of our collective misery.

<P>
I shall first explain what I should have explained earlier. The franchising director is, of course, a statutory office holder and does not have a contract. The same applies to members of the central rail users consultative committee, who are also office holders, not employers. If the passenger franchising director-an office holder, not an employer-takes a post with the SRA, he will suffer no loss on account of the loss of his office. If he refuses a job with the SRA, he is entitled to compensation. I repeat that the provisions are standard for public appointments and that the Secretary of State's powers will be used only in special circumstances and not to get rid of undesirables. In the light of my further explanation of the status of franchising directors and CRUCC members, I hope that the hon. Gentleman's anxieties have been assuaged.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman keeps talking about special circumstances, so can he provide us with an example? In what circumstances would the Secretary of State use his powers rather than allow the law to take effect?

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 922, in page 186, line 25, at end insert-

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 923.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The amendment is designed to make clear provision in the Bill for the powers of the SRA in relation to staff pensions. It is a standard provision, designed to remove any doubt about the existing wording of the Bill covering such arrangements.

<P>
The SRA will be able to use the principal civil service pension scheme as its staff scheme should it so elect. It will inherit from its predecessor bodies departmental staff, some of whom are already in the civil service scheme. Accordingly, the Minister for the Civil Service will need power to delegate the administration of PCPS arrangements to the SRA. Amendment No. 923 provides for that, and allows the authority to sub-delegate the administration of PCPS arrangements for its staff to an agent other than a Government Deparment, provided the Minister for the Civil Service gives his consent. That will provide the necessary statutory flexibility for the authority to make the most cost-effective arrangements in future.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The provision is an important addition to the Bill. Indeed, there would have been a significant lacuna, had there been no provision to allow the SRA to set up pension arrangements.

<P>
I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary would clarify one to two matters. First, does the Secretary of State intend to issue guidance to the SRA on what pension arrangements are provided for? Secondly, amendment No. 923 allows people to participate in the civil service pension scheme. It may be desirable for civil servants who join the scheme to elect to remain in the civil service scheme for convenience. However, does the Under-Secretary not agree that, in principle, it is desirable that employers should set up fully funded schemes?

<P>
Proper funded provision for pensions for SRA employees is in everyone's interest. Otherwise, the civil service scheme is dependent on a regular subvention from the taxpayer. We want to set up a sustainable pension scheme for SRA employees rather than one determined by public subsidy. Indeed, in many cases, pensions in the police service now cost as much as police wages.

<P>
It is for the board to decide whether to set up a final salary scheme or-I am sorry I have forgotten the other kind of pension scheme. However, can the board decide whether the scheme is a defined contribution scheme or a final salary scheme? A final salary scheme is needed to provide attractive terms for civil servants and retain staff, although the alternative is the cheaper option.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Again, I am most grateful the hon. Gentleman for asking important questions about the pension scheme, which I shall do my best to answer. He forgot the name of one of the schemes, but I never knew it in the first place.

<P>
I shall put the Government's approach in context before tackling the specific issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. The setting up of the SRA will not change any of the existing arangements for staff pensions. Staff will be able to remain in their existing pension schemes. The SRA will simply step into British Rail's shoes as designated employer of the relevant BR pension schemes, which will continue to be administered by independent trustees. They will also be admitted to the principal civil service pension scheme, so that existing civil servants do not need to transfer out. Nothing in the Bill overrides the statutory protection of pension rights for BR employees and pensioners provided by the Railways Act 1993. I served on that Committee; we fought long and hard for that protection in opposition and we certainly do not propose to dilute it now.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about guidance on pensions. That will be covered in general terms by the financial framework, which is addressed in later amendments, but the short answer to his questions is that there will be no specific guidance. With regard to fully funded schemes, also raised by the hon. Gentleman, the PCPS is a pay-as-you-go scheme. Payments are not made into a trust that builds up, but are paid out as necessary. This has always proved cost effective. Staff can elect to make further contributions. The SRA will have the freedom to select a staff pension scheme within the public secctor norms.

<P>
I hope that those answers will help to deal with some of the questions, which were in the hon. Gentleman's mind.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 923, in page 186, line 39, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) The Minister for the Civil Service may, to such extent and subject to such conditions as he thinks fit, delegate to the Authority the function of administering a scheme under section 1 of the Superannuation Act 1972, so far as relating to employees of the Authority.<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment provides us with an opportunity to explore the funding of the SRA, on which the Minister briefly touched in his introduction. It refers to the ability of the SRA to plan ahead on the basis of grants that may be given to the SRA in order to allow it to carry out its functions and suggests the following form of words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the amount of such grant to be determined for a period of not less than three years and to be notified to the Authority in sufficient time to enable it to have regard to the amount of grant so determined in formulating strategies in respect of that period in accordance with section 181.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Non-departmental public bodies tend to lead a hand-to-mouth existence. One of the dangers of reintroducing what is essentially state supervision to the financing of the railways is that, rather than planning for the long term, as the industry now does as part of the private sector, it will be looking increasingly to the short term for what it can get out of the Government. We are already beginning to see this in the utterances of the chairman of the shadow strategic railway authority, Sir Alastair Morton. He has said on many occasions that the Government will have to dig into their pockets to provide the sort of investment that the railway needs. He wants the security of long-term commitment from the Government and it is obvious from the way in which they now plan the public finances on a three-year rolling basis-as first introduced under the comprehensive spending review-to provide that, yet schedule 13(5) currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may make to the Authority grants of such amounts, on such terms, as he may determine.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
There is no provision for binding the Secretary of State into a long-term commitment to the SRA so that the SRA itself can make long-term plans based on that commitment. To that extent, the SRA will be like any other branch of the public sector. However, our ambition is that the SRA should be once removed from the public sector, and able to secure a more stable relationship with its money than is traditional in the public sector in order to be able to provide that stable framework for funding of the railway.

<P>
That is the basic of the amendment. I find it difficult to understand why the Minister might not be able to accept it-except for the fact that, as we have seen in four successive Budgets and the comprehensive spending review, any concession from the Treasury to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions may look like a concession at first sight, but often turns out not to be such a large concession on closer inspection. I believe that that will apply to the SRA's £3 billion borrowing limit. First, the £3 billion borrowing limit will not actually be £3 billion allocated by the Government for the SRA to spend. Secondly, even if £3 billion were allocated on that basis, under the arrangement as set out in paragraph 5 of the Treasury would be breathing down the necks of the board of the SRA, supervising how the money was to be spent.

<P>
Although it seems that the Treasury will give broad approval to the plans of the SRA by setting a high borrowing limit, as the Treasury may at any time re-determine what moneys shall be available to the SRA, it will take a very close interest in the SRA's plans. Schedule 13(5) provides that the SRA will have to go to the Treasury for every separate project. It could end up having to make a case to the Treasury for extra borrowing approval on every individual item. We do not consider that to be at all satisfactory.

<P>
The Government inherited from the previous Administration a funding regime for the railways that was stabilised by the franchising arrangement. The subsidy was applied through the franchises, contracted by the Government through the franchise agreements to the railway. For the first time in 50 years, the railway was able to plan ahead. The great danger of the Strategic Rail Authority is that it will take us back to the days of British Rail. It is no concidence that the SRA is the successor body to the old board of British Rail. It will take us back to the short-term planning and fixes that are dependent upon the whims of the Treasury at every move.

<P>
The amendment, therefore, provides the authority with the framework for providing the Government with a long-term strategy. As they committed funds, the Government would then have to provide funds on a long-term basis to the SRA. Otherwise, we shall return to nationalisation in all but the technical fact by the back door, and that would damage investment in the railway.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Once again, I thank the hon. Member for North Essex for probing me on these important funding issues. However, as on previous occasions, he rather spoils his case by over-egging the pudding. His suggestion that the Bill is a route to renationalisation by the back door exaggerates what is in the Government's mind more than a little.

<P>
Although I understand that the hon. Gentleman's concern about long-term funding, not for the first time in our exchanges is he sailing very close to the proposition that control by the Treasury over elements of public expenditure should be considerably weakened. He has the luxury of being in opposition, so he can make those points. That was not our experience during periods of Conservative rule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I shall give way on that point when I have completed my thought. I rather suspect that at some remote point in the future, when there may be a return to such rule, the hon. Gentleman, if he is still an hon. Member, will not advocate the abandonment of that Treasury role.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The Minister is wrong. When the industry was privatised we managed to persuade the Treasury that the railway subsidy should no longer be an annual subsidy, and that the obligations on the public purse should be contracted into the franchise agreements. For clarity's sake, the hon. Gentleman should withdraw his previous comment. We achieved a long-term programme subsidy to the railway for the benefit of the railway. The present Bill threatens to put is all back on a short-term lead, just like any other non-departmental public body or any other nationalised industry. That is what is at the heart of the amendment and what we fear the Bill is currently set to do.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I hope to persuade the hon. Gentleman that his fears are misplaced. It might be helpful if, before addressing the specificities of the hon. Gentleman's amendments, I talked a little about the Government's proposals for the future of SRA finance.

<P>
We shall come to clause 186 in due course, and we are dealing with part II to schedule 13 now. Under those provisions, the SRA will have a wide power to give grants, loans or guarantees and to enter into agreements to secure the provision, improvement or development of the railway. The authority will be funded by the Secretary of State. It will also be entitled to borrow money both from the Secretary of State and temporarily from other sources-for example, by overdraft or bridging facility-with the consent of the Secretary of State and the approval of the Treasury.

<P>
Current annual funding of the railways is some £1.5 billion: about £1 billion is spent by the franchising director and £500 million by the Department and the British Railways Board. Most of the £1.5 billion is spent on functions to be transferred to the SRA, in particular paying train operating companies to support passenger rail services provided under franchise agreements that the SRA will inherit.

<P>
The fine details of the SRA's financing structure are still being developed. We have to make sure that we get it right so that the SRA is set up with a financing structure that puts it in the best possible position to pursue its strategic objectives. We expect the main source of funding for the SRA to be a grant paid by the Secretary of State. To make sure that the SRA has sufficient flexibility, we shall introduce into the financing structure a number of innovative features.

<P>
First, the SRA will be able to retian income from penalties and reinvest it in the railway. That is a one-off exception to the normal Treasury rules on penalty income. Secondly, we believe that in its attempts to stimulate investment or project development, the SRA may come across cases in which market failure prevents what is needed from being achieved. We therefore propose to allow the SRA to borrow in accordance with the provisions in part II of schedule 13 so that it can become commercially involved in such cases, if necessary.

<P>
The provisions in schedule 13 include a borrowing limit of £3 billion, which is the limit set in current legislation for British Rail. We are not saying that the SRA will need to borrow £3 billion, or any other amount, but if the Bill does not provide the authority with the ability to borrow, we shall be cutting off that option for good.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Thirdly, we want the SRA to be well placed to lever in private finance. Private finance and project management skills will aid rail infrastructure enhancement. Such skills are curently provided mainly by Railtrack. The shadow SRA recently proposed the creation of special-purpose vehicles, with joint companies providing some of them. We believe that SPVs will have a role, albeit limited. An obvious early use of SPVs could be to provide station enhancements and other schemes that do not pose major difficulties of interface with the core network. That will complement Railtrack's role and expertise. It is not the back-door breakup of Railtrack, should that thought spring into the hon. Gentleman's mind.

<P>
The main vehicle for promoting increased rail infrastructure investment is the franchise director's franchise replacement programme. Progress made in negotiations on that programme will be taken into account in the 2000 spending review, the outcome of which will be announced in July. The review will set Government spending plans, including those for the SRA, up to 2004.

<P>
I hope that that overview of the SRA's financial structure will be helpful to the Committee, as we proceed to address the amendment before us, for which we see no need.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me give the reasons for rejecting the amendment before the hon. Gentleman intervenes. The SRA's three-year budgets will be set alongside three-year budgets for other DETR spending programmes in future public spending rounds. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the spending review is currently in progress and its outcome will be known in good time to feed into the SRA's first annual budget. The time horizon for the SRA will be considerably longer than three years. As the Committee is aware, we are planning to replace existing franchises with new ones that run for up to 20 years. Each franchise will include commitments by the SRA to pay subsidy or by the franchisee to make premium payments to the SRA over the whole life of the franchise. Each franchise deal will be signed off my Ministers, and as part of that signing off they will need to give the SRA appropriate assurances about funding to cover franchise commitments. That addresses the core of the hon. Gentleman's inquiries on the matter.

<P>
Replacement franchises will be for a longer term than we have experienced heretofore. That is no handicap to long term financial planning, as has already been shown by existing longer term franchises. The Government will meet the contractual arrangements. There need be no anxiety or dubiety about that: it is not new. As the hon. Gentleman said, the previous Conservative Government similarly arranged for the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising to be able to plan substantial commitments over the next 10 years.

<P>
However, I understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about the drawbacks of the annuality principle that governed public expenditure under our predecessors. I assure the Committee that the SRA will have the funding that it needs to pursue a long-term strategy for the railways. In the summer, we shall publish our 10-year plan for transport.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. We are finding our way to one or two answers to the questions we raised at the beginning of the debate on this part of the Bill: that is to say, how the Government would deliver the necessary investment that is likely to be set out in the Railtrack network management statement later this week.

<P>
The first conclusion that we must draw, however, from the Minister's comments is that £3 billion has not been committed. A borrowing limit of £3 billion has been set, but the Treasury has not committed a additional £3 billion. That is subject to negotiation with the Treasury and with the chairman of the SRA. Why has £3 billion put into the Bill? Why does it not read, ``the authority's borrowing limit shall be such sum as the Secretary of State may from time to time determine''? It has something to do with spin doctoring: that is why £3 billion was put into the Bill. When the ime comes, it will be interesting to see whether £3 billion is committed.

<P>
The Minister referred to income from penalties being retained by the industry. That provides an interesting incentive. Although the regulator remains a separate person and the penalties are not set by the SRA, the imposition of penalties is attractive to the regulator. It is attractive to the regulator that fines are applied to rail companies that may not be performing, but we have already seen axamples of the ineffectiveness of fines to improve performance.

<P>
The Minister said that the purpose of the SRA's finance is to do away with market failure. That is the politically correct way to describe a justification for a subsidy. I do not know what market failure is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> That is the hon. Gentleman's problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It means that the market does not do what the Minister wants. One could argue that when a business goes out of business, the market has succeeded. I do not want to get into a technical argument; it is one of the meaningless phrases about which we should be careful.

<P>
Most interestingly, the Minister started to describe how he imagined the SRA would lever in the private finance that we all now accept is the future for the railway industry. He mentioned the special purpose vehicles that have been mooted by the SRA. At the same time he made it clear-I should be grateful if he would say whether he was giving an assurance-that special purpose vehicles would not be used to increase the number of commercial entities on the main line railway. he said that they could be used for station enhancement. SPVs are a form of off-balance-sheet financing, rather like the public-private partnership on the tube, which is an attempt to lever in private finance without showing the liability on the public balance sheet. I understand that the SPVs mooted by the SRA are either the SRA, the franchise operators, the train operating companies or Railtrack levering in public finance against a stream of income.

<P>
The sad fact is that I read in my newspaper this morning that Railtrack share prices are meandering around the £7 level and its ability to provide its own finance has been severely undermined by the Government's antics in the past three years.

<P>
Is it intended that SPVs should be broadly peripheral to the financing of the railway's core business, or should they become the main way of financing railway enhancements? We read in the newspapers that the upgrade of the west coast main line is in difficulties. Is it expected that a time will come when signalling for that upgrade will be funded and operated by a SPV? The Under-Secretary mentioned the danger of increasing the complexity and interfaces on the railway. However, if the railway is already too fragmented, SPVs could fragment it further.

<P>
Will the Under-Secretary reassure us that SPVs are at the margin of the proposed financing and that the main burden of the SRA's funding will be applied through the train operating companies' franchises? That will provide them with the income against which to borrow for investments and pay the access charges to Railtrack against which Railtrack can increase its borrowings and financing to invest. Are the Government attempting to improve the structure of the railway that they inherited or is the SPV an innovation designed to change the nature of railway financing?

<P>
I welcome the general thrust of the Minister's comments. He said that he intends that three-year budgets should be the norm, reflecting new arrangements in the Government's own finances. Nevertheless, the drafting of the Bill, however conventional, leaves the SRA vulnerable to Treasury short-termism, which, as we all know is a public-sector disease. We remain anxious about that, but I accept that the Under-Secretary's intentions are entirely honourable.

<P>
Finally, what happens to the income from the franchises? The main line franchises in particular will become increasingly profitable. How profitable should they be allowed to become? Should they be on a wash-your-face basis with a subsidy at the beginning and payments to franchisers building up as their businesses grow? Or should they become major sources of income for the SRA? That major conceptual question was not addressed on privatisation, when we hoped to get an industry with a £2-billion-a-year deficit to break even.

<P>
It appears as if many parts of the railway will throw off large amounts of cash. Will the SRA be responsible for directing that cash or should the industry be allowed to invest it for the development of the railway? What will be the destination of the surpluses generated by the more profitable rail franchises?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The hon. Gentleman raised many points and I shall endeavour to deal with them in some detail, as this is an important opportunity to clarify the Government's purposes in relation to the funding of the SRA and the railway.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman condemned the Government for an apparent lack of commitment to the £3 billion barring limit in the Bill. However, amendment No. 863 would abolish that limit altogether, which hardly instils enormous confidence in the hard-pressed railway industry. I dare say that the amendment is a probing amendment. In any case, we shall deal with it in due course.

<P>
We inherited the £3 billion limit from the Railways Act 1993, and there is nothing sinister about the inclusion of such borrowing limits in railway legislation. Indeed, such inclusion is custom and practice, as the hon. Gentleman will discover if he examines earlier legislation, such as the Railways Act 1974. A defined borrowing limit has always appeared in such measures. There is nothing underhand, dangerous or sinister about the inclusion of such a figure in the Bill.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> And no commitment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> The Government are powerfully committed to investment in the renaissance of the railways, as I shall shortly spell out.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked for an assurance that special-purpose vehicles would operate as enhancements or, in his words, ``at the margin'' of the railway network. I am happy to give him an unqualified assurance that the main burden of the SRA's funding and investment policies will apply to the franchising system.

<P>
Briefly, SPVs may have a role in creating a bigger and better railway. They offer several advantages and, compared with the cost and quality of Railtrack's proposals, provide an alternative source of private funding and additional project management capacity. SPVs would be implemented through a framework of agreements between, for example, train operators, Railtrack, SPVs themselves and, potentially, the SRA. Railtrack would have a key role, especially in ensuring that the safe, efficient operation of the network was not threatened. The SPV would receive income from the train operators to recover its costs, including construction costs.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The word ``safety'' has just passed the Under-Secretary's lips. We have safety in mind when we talk about interfaces, and the question of the safety of the railways in relation to SPVs therefore arises. If the SPV is involved with a project concerning signalling, track or rolling stock, it must be bound into the railway's new structure. How will that be achieved?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am constantly awestruck by the hon. Gentleman's thirst for information. We are at a relatively early stage in the development of SPVs, and it is the SRA's role to work out detailed proposals on SPVs in due course. When it does, I am sure that we can address rail safety issues. We shall certainly have an opportunity to discuss safety in greater depth at a relatively early stage in our future proceedings. At the moment, however, if the hon. Gentleman forgives me, I shall deal with the remaining questions arising from his endless thirst for information.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the SRA's retention of franchise premium payments. The growing railway for which we are now planning will need extra funding, the precise amount of which is being considered in the current spending review. The review will be informed by the franchising directors, franchise replacement negotiations and the 10-year plan for transport that we will be publishing this summer. That is a matter for further discussion and negotiation and will form part of the future financing of the railway.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Railtrack network management statement that we are expecting shortly. The Government accepts that substantial sums will have to be invested in railway infrastructure to deliver the increased rail capacity and quality needed for the future. I do not define or accept at this stage any particular figure, but the amount will be illuminated by the view of the shadow SRA and the Rail Regulator on Railtrack's 2000 network management statement, which we expect to be published on 30 March. As I said, the Government will publish in the summer a 10-year plan for transport, which will set out indicative plans for expenditure on transport outcomes, the ways in which we expect private finance to be levered in and the types of project that can be delivered within the overall provision.

<P>
I shall not anticipate that plan or the current spending review, but I make it clear that, although the plan will give indications, it will not forecast the outcome of the negotiations on which the franchising director is now embarked to replace the existing passenger franchises. This is not the traditional command-and-control approach, but one that encourages the rail industry-operators in particular-to come up with its own ideas and proposals as to feasible growth in rail use and quality improvement. These will have to include detailed plans for investment and finance. Until the negotiations are more advanced, it will not help to speculate on what proposals and financing mechanisms will offer taxpayers best value for money. That is why the Bill provides the flexiblity for the SRA to use different mechanisms, but the choice will depend on value for money and the Bill provides clearly that the SRA and Ministers will be accountable to this House for the value and affordability of everything that is done.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Snape </B>(West Bromwich, East): I apologise for getting up at this late stage in the debate. I am not quite so swift as my hon. Friend the Minister when it comes to indicating a desire to speak. I have been drawn into the debate not least by the contribution from the hon. Member for North Essex. During these proceedings, the hon. Gentleman has been guilty occasionally of making it up as he goes along. That propensity is becoming rather frayed at the edges, particularly on the matters that we are discussing today.

<P>
The Committee is asked seriously to accept from the hon. Gentleman that Railtrack's share price has dived from £17 to its current £7 level largely as a result of speeches from the Deputy Prime Minister. Would that politicians were so powerful. If we had thought that we would have such an impact, we should all have come into politics much earlier. The hon. Gentleman expects the Committee to respect the fact that in a past life he was involved in a venture capital company, so presumably he wishes to impress us by his knowledge of such matters.

<P>
When one looks at the transport sector over the past few months, from Arriva to Vivendi-I cannot think of anything beginning with ``Z''-prices of all shares have fallen considerably. Is that also down to speeches by the Deputy Prime Minister? The British Airways share is where the problem is. I shall not labour the point too long in case that famed irascibility of yours is inflicted on us again, Mr. Gale, but it will not do. There have been some problems with the transport sector in general, largely due to the fascination of the stock exchange with dot.com shares recently and the collapse in what are regarded as more traditional shares as a result. However, that passion appears to be dying now. Again, I underline that I work for National Express. Its share price has fallen from £12.50 to under a fiver.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson </B>(Hexham): Perhaps you should resign.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that I should resign. Unlike the Conservative party, I cannot say that that collapse in the share price is due to the activities or lack of them of one person; it is due to a variety of factors. If we were all to resign from traditional companies quoted on the stock exchange because of the collapse in the share price, it would be like Wall Street in 1929 and we should all be jumping from tall buildings.

<P>
My hon. Friend, the Under-Secretary ought to return to franchising and the terms under which the current crop of franchises will be re-let. The hon. Member for North Essex talked about how much money is swilling around in the railway system. Although those were not his exact words, he implied that the rail franchises are enormously profitable for those fortunate enough to have them. Well, that is true up to a point. The early franchises, when the railway was first privatised, were considerably more generous than later ones-First Great Western, for example, is doing well and is likely to continue to do so. By and large, most railway franchises have what would be regarded in most industries as a pathetic return on their overall turnover. That is not helped by Mr. Tom Windsor's occasional pronouncements. I was listening to him last night at the Rail Forum presentation awards. He is an unlikely figure to don a leotard and bang his chest, but he appears to have done a considerable amount of that in recent months, which may well have had some impact on the share price of various train operating companies.

<P>
The current refranchising proposals appear to consist of him and Sir Alastair Morton at the SRA approaching existing franchise holders saying, ``Give us some ideas about your view of the future. We'll hawk those views round your competitors and then decide what is best for the taxpayer.''. I am not sure that that is the most sensible way to do things, but it may well lie behind some of the fall-off in the share prices of train operating companies in recent years.

<P>
The other point that I wish to bring to the attention of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is the question of special performance vehicles. As the hon. Member for North Essex rightly said, Members interested in these matters have expressed concern over the years about safety and the number of interfaces in the railway industry generally. Adding another will increase the fear felt in many quarters about safety and the need for collaboration. Will my hon. Friend assure the Committee that any involvement of SPVs in the train operating companies will be carefully watched to ensure that there are no fears of further diminution in safety in the rail industry?

<P>

<B>Mr. Owen Paterson (North Shropshire):</B> The hon. Gentleman disagrees with my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex. Would he like to quote the statements by the Deputy Prime Minister that would encourage him to buy Railtrack or train operating company shares?

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> That is a different argument, although it is a clever one. People do not rush out to buy shares on the basis of speeches by politicians, even those as exalted as my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, and neither do they sell them on that basis. My right hon. Friend, who rightly expressed many concerns about the operation of the railway industry since privatisation and before the election-and, to some degree, since- has made plain his determination to knock heads together.

<P>
Without returning to earlier debates-you have been tolerant of me so far this morning, Mr. Gale-the fact is that the railway industry welcomes the proposals in the Bill although they seek, as I do, clarification as the Government's intentions. The railway community thinks that it represents an improvement-albeit with the fears that I have expressed.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The hon. Gentleman rose to swat the gadfly, but it would be churlish of me not to thank him for his most useful contribution. He is a little sensitive about my comments on the Government's effect on the share price. He described what has happened to traditional stocks and dot.com stocks. I do not know whether he would describe the Deputy Prime Minister as a traditional or a dot.com stock, but he looks pretty traditional, given his current performance. Of course, the dot.com Ministers' bubble will burst sooner or later.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman commented on the fact that some of the regulator's statements may have affected the share price and I am satisfied with that limited endorsement of what I have been saying in the debates on schedule 13. Some things would have been better left unsaid. A more constructive approach is needed than that which is evident in today's newspaper articles on the regulator's attitude to Railtrack and the west coast main line project.

<P>
I hope that the SRA will consider what can be achieved in the most positive way. I am sure that that is the intention of Sir Alastair Morton and his team and that they will not try to score points off companies for past underperformance or failings, many of which have been or are being rectified, although the effects of past mistakes will live with the industry for some time. If the SRA project is to work, it must be positive and forward looking, not point-scoring or retrospective.

<P>
I welcome what the hon. Gentleman says about special purpose vehicles because I thought that the Under-Secretary gave me a fulsome assurance, which he then diluted by referring to the projects in which SPVs might be involved. We must carefully consider the fact that we want Railtrack's projects to be delivered as competitively and efficiently as possible and that we want to measure its performance against that of other project managers and infrastructure providers. Our policy document, ``The Railway Renaissance: Stage 2'', includes proposals on how to achieve those aims.

<P>
Those aims will not be achieved by involving completely new infrastructure providers in main lines, track, signalling or the rest of the railway infrastructure. That would increase the complexity of the railway, which is one of the main safety concerns. It would also neglect the opportunity provided by the strength of the cash-flow and balance sheets that exist in the railway. We are not dealing with a state-owned industry that needs to drag in public finance through an artificial off-balance-sheet mechanism, such as the public-private partnership, the success of which we doubt. The businesses are already in the private sector. We must determine how to give them the right incentives and environment in which to perform.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that the amount of work that needs to be done on Britain's railway infrastructure-let us put aside who is responsible for that-means that cash must come from any possible source? Does he agree that relying on the talks with Railtrack will not lead to the railway renaissance about which he spoke and that perhaps involving other companies and their cash will mean that infrastructure is updated sooner rather than later?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It behoves us all to be open-minded about how to get finance into the railway. At the same time, the Railtrack balance sheet presents one of the biggest opportunities for the railway renaissance and it is that balance sheet that is supporting twice the level of infrastructure investment that the railway enjoyed when it was in the public sector. If the balance sheets of all the railway companies can be enhanced by the most effective use of public subsidy, that is the way to lever in the most finance.

<P>
The concerns I am expressing about SPVs are not necessarily closing my mind to the opportunities that may emerge from them. However, we must be aware of the downside and I hope that the Government do not feel the need to bypass Railtrack to score the political point that is lurking under the surface of some of the more partisan comments made by Labour Members.

<P>
Finally, on franchises, the Minister has this in the right order. The re-negotiation of the franchises has to come first. It is the issue that is now holding up the development of the industry because no one can plan anything until the franchise re-negotiations have been settled. This morning, Railtrack gave one of the reasons for the uncertainty about the west coast main line upgrade as being that the companies running the services on the west coast main line may not be there after the franchise negotiations are completed. It is difficult to plan, therefore, for long-term infrastructure until the franchises are in place.

<P>
One other matter on which I would be grateful if the Minister would comment is the future of freight. There is now a big question mark as to how the continued growth of freight should be supported by the SRA. Freight was not provided with any mechanism for public subsidy in the original privatisation except indirectly-the train operating companies pay for the track access and so the subsidy reaches Railtrack in that way. However, freight benefits from the availability of the track funded by the train operating companies which are, in turn, supported by the subsidies. Does the Minister envisage that the Strategic Rail Authority will have some direct role in subsidising freight and should not that be settled as part of the access review for freight, since the rail freight industry is saying that £6.10 per tonne kilometre is steep compared with charges abroad? On the American railways, the equivalent is about £2.40 per tonne kilometre. If rail freight is stalling, partly because the industry is becoming congested with passenger traffic, which tends to take a higher priority in peoples' minds, how are we to re-start the rail freight renaissance? It was targeted to increase threefold in the 10 years from privatisation-a target that the Government themselves gleefully accepted on taking office.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will try to be brief in my responses. First, to the hon. Member for North Essex, I will begin with an apology. I seem to have missed ``The Railway Renaissance: Stage 2''. Looking around at the Committee, this seems to be a general experience. If the hon. Gentleman would like to circulate the document to the Committee. I am sure that it would be subject to intense fascination and possibly further exchanges.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> It is even worse than that. Many of us missed the Conservative Party's railway renaissance, stage one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> rose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> The railway renaissance stage one is what Ministers are talking about. There has not been any new rail policy since this Government were elected. They have carried on with our policies and this Bill is an attempt to claim the credit for them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I will not pursue the hon. Gentleman down that path-

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No, nor do I propose to pursue the hon. Member for North Essex down the path of the dot.com bubble.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> We had an interesting comment earlier from the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) about why the Railtrack share should have gone down. It is most interesting that a Minister should rubbish the efforts that the industry has made in the past few years. Would he say whether the industry has improved or not since privatisation? I will not rattle off the figures because we have all had briefings. There seems to have been an enormous investment and a huge increase in rail use-up to 25 per cent. Making these negative comments does not help the industry. Has it improved since privatisation or not?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It is interesting to hear the voice of the hon. Member for Salop North, from the far Back Benches. I can only presume that the hon. Gentleman's mind was in some reverie and he missed the valleys of North Shropshire because no words that issued from my mouth could be remotely interpreted as a condemnation of the record of investment in the railway industry. I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he goes back to sleep up there on the Back Benches.

<P>
Let me also reassure the hon. Member for North Essex, who raised the question, that there is nothing in the interest in SPVs to suggest that we are in the business of sidetracking Railtrack. In response to his questions about our attitude towards rail freight, clause 186 of the Bill gives the SRA a power to subsidise freight. Clearly, the Government intend that the SRA should have a continuing role in relationship to rail freight. This Government's record on rail freight, to say the least, stands comparison with that of the previous Administration.

<P>
As I said, freight grants are running at a historically high level. The previous Government paid out less than £5 million a year in the first half of the 1990s. In contrast, we have been paying out around £30 million a year since 1997. More significantly, Mr. Gale, the number of freight grant awards that we have made has risen steeply. In 19967 there were 16 awards worth £7 million. In 19978, this rose to 19 awards worth £15 million. This year, we have made 42 awards worth £49 million. Freight railway is safe in this Government's hands.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> No. The record speaks for itself. I turn now to the outstanding contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East. It was a forceful and wise speech if I may say so, Mr. Gale. The central thrust was that there should be no diminution in rail safety associated with SPVs and I assure him that rail safety will remain the paramount concern of both the Government and the Strategic Rail Authority.

<P>
I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his speech, which distinctly raised the level of our general discourse in the Committee. If I may say so, that signal box at Stockport will remain awaiting his return for many years to come.

<P>
<B>Mr. Snape:</B> Alas, it is due to be demolished this year.
<P>
12.30pm

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> In that case, I shall urge that the SRA make this a rescue operation and that it be declared a national monument to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister referred to sidetracking. I always enjoy the Committee's excursions, but we have been off down the Bluebell
line for the past half an hour. It would be mildly helpful to all concerned if we now returned to the amendment under discussion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> We have had a useful debate on the amendment and I am grateful for the attention that the Minister has given to it. I am bound to say that when he starts reeling off his freight grant figures-£15 million here, £40 million there-they are sums of money that dwarf the sums that individuals usually deal with, but they are peanuts compared with the billions that are needed for the revival of our railway. It belittles the Government when they lay claim to so much credibility from such tiny token sums. If there is to be a sustained revival in frieght on the railway, it will take more than the odd £40 million from the Under-Secretary and more than the odd headline in the odd newspaper to achieve that.

<P>
I do not propose to push the amendment to a vote. Our concern is that, for all the Government's warm words, they are bringing the industry back to a short-term interventionist outlook. That will damage the prospects for investment and it must remain a concern for the industry. I hope that we will continue to explore this shortcoming in the Bill as we proceed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Atkinson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 863, in page 187, leave out line 19.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 864, in page 187, line 20, leave out ``greater''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> We have had a fairly lengthy debate on the funding of the Strategic Rail Authority. This debate follows on from that but concentrates on the borrowing limits of the SRA. I open the debate with some alarm-alarm because the more that I hear, the more I believe that the SRA is nothing more than a highways agency with a few bells on it. The 10-year plan for the railways that we hard mentioned today will be much the same as the road plans, which, change every time there is a review of Government funding. That seems alarming for the future of the railways.

<P>
I compliment the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East on his diplomatic speech. He started by defending the Deputy Prime Minister, which he must do in his case. Then he went on, rightly, to criticise the interference by the Rail Regulator and the effect that it has had on Railtrack shares-he has been at it again, as we saw yesterday. Anything that damages the balance sheet of Railtrack is bad news for the railways as a whole and Ministers, regulators and officials should be careful what they say.

<P>
As far as I can see, the SRA has four methods of funding. The purpose of my probing amendment is to discover the balance between the different methods. First, it can receive grants from the Secretary of State. Secondly, it can have loans from the Secretary of State. Thirdly, it may borrow, which is what the amendment is about. Fourthly, it has its own income stream: premium payments for lines that are profitable. I wish to explore the relationship between those methods, particularly the figure of £3 billion.

<P>
The Minister says that it is a figure that is in existing legislation. Does that take into consideration the debt of £1 billion that the British Railways Board carries forward? Will the £3 billion be in addition to that, as I believe that the Strategic Rail Authority will have to accept responsibility for that debt? Will it be able to count on that figure? What will it do with this money? The money that it will receive from grants will presumably cover subsidy required for train operating companies and freight. Perhaps the Minister can explain the relationship between these different funding streams. I do not understand why the Secretary of State would need the power to grant loans to the SRA as opposed to borrowing requirements. It seems somewhat at variance if it is two different income streams.

<P>
The Under-Secretary talked about market failure and so I assume that some of this £3 billion would be used to deal with so-called market failure. How will the SRA fund the infrastructure improvements that are needed, such as the pinch points on the rail network, which would be hugely expensive to eliminate but must be eliminated if the rail service is to improve? That would not be an economic operation. Railtrack could not take on some of those areas. Will that be done through grant, loan or borrowing? I hope that he can clarify that. In his earlier intervention, the Under-Secretary talked about innovative financial schemes that are still being developed. We do not know what these schemes will be and what bearing they will have on this matter and on the funding of the SRA.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> With respect, the hon. Gentleman asked rather a lot of questions on the basis of a simple amendment that is designed to remove the £3 billion figure as the limit to the parties' power to borrow. The £1 billion debt ascribed to British Rail is included in the figure of £3 billion. That was his first question. He asked what the SRA would do with that £3 billion borrowing limit. The temptation is to say, borrow it if necessary. What else?

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> What for?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> For all the purposes that the SRA wishes to set out on the face of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman asked about loans. A certain amount of flexibility will be required on the part of the SRA. We expect grant to be its main source of funding, but if the market does not come up with finance on acceptable terms a case could be made for the Secretary of State to use his powers to make loans to the SRA.

<P>
The franchising director is negotiating the replacement of existing rail franchises. We are looking forward to deals that will generate more investment than the rail industry has seen for a century. It may be appropriate for the SRA to borrow to finance these deals. We are not saying that it will need to borrow £3 billion or any other amount, but if we do not provide the SRA with the ability to borrow in the Bill, we will cut off that option for good.

<P>
There is no magic about the £3 billion figure. There are no secret calculations to show that this is what the SRA will or may need. Quite simply, £3 billion is the existing borrowing limit for the British Railways Board, which is one of the bodies being wound up into the SRA. It seems sensible for that limit, which is not exercised but which remains on the statute book, to be carried forward into the SRA. In the light of those explanations, I call on the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I hit the buffers after about five yards with that one. We have had no answers from the Under-Secretary on the essential questions that we were asked. Of course, we understand why a borrowing figure is put into the schedule. Of course, the SRA has to be able to borrow money. The purpose of the question that the Under-Secretary simply did not answer was to discover how the authority was to fund itself and to find out the balance between grants, loans, borrowings and income. That has not been made clear this morning.

<P>
Will the Treasury reduce the grant to the train operating companies? If so, will it tell the rail companies that they can make it up by racking up the fare prices and producing more premium fares, or will it say that they can borrow the money? We need to know about that. Our concern this morning is to find out how far the sticky fingers of the Secretary of State will work their way into the railways' affairs. It is vital for the Committee and those following our proceedings to know about the relationships between these different funding streams. The Under-Secretary has not told us and I should be grateful for some clarification.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Let me turn the issue on its head and ask the hon. Gentleman what exactly is the information that he seeks about the relationship between these various sources of income that will become available to the SRA?

<P>
<B>Mr. Atkinson:</B> I want to know more about the financial structures that are still being developed. I want to know how the SRA will operate and the Under-Secretary has not told us. He lays out in schedule 13 the various funding sources that the SRA has but he does not tell us how it will fund, for example, the pinch points. How will it fund market failure? Will it be funded by grant, borrowing or loan or by income and higher contributions from the train operating companies through their premium payments? We want some light to be thrown into something that is extremely opaque at present.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Inspiration has winged its way to me. Let me make the general point that I have sought to make through the extremely lengthy exchanges this morning on the funding of the SRA. I feel that I am almost bashing my head against a brick wall in the sense that I do not know how else to explain what the SRA's funding arrangements and sources of funding will be. Let me reiterate the general proposition, which is that the main vehicle for voting increased rail investment will be the franchise director's franchise replacement programme. That will be the main way in which the railway renaissance to which we are all looking forward will be delivered.

<P>
The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question about how pinch points or market failure will be funded is that they will be funded in the appropriate fashion. We have described in considerable detail what those sources of funding might be. We are in the process of establishing the SRA and we will expect it to make those decisions in due course. It is not appropriate for us to anticipate those decisions in any further detail.

<P>
I am sorry that I have not been able to assist the hon. Gentleman with his detailed and inquisitorial questions. Nevertheless, I have responded in as full and as reasonable a fashion as a Minister can. I rest my case.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 865, in page 187, line 31, leave out

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`determine at the time of making the loan in question'.<P>

<P>
We need not linger long on this small amendment, even though it is extraordinary that the Government have so little idea about how the SRA will deliver network investment. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) talked about pinch points, which lie at the heart of increasing capacity on the railway. The Minister was unable to give us any information about how investments in pinch points will be funded, but that does not surprise me. One benefit of the SRA is that it will contain intelligent people who will think about the problems, rather than Ministers who are more preoccupied with tomorrow's headlines than with delivering the policy.

<P>
The amendment is to paragraph 7(2), which relates to the terms of Government loans. We propose that loans made by the Secretary of State should not be on call to the SRA but should be subject to a formal agreement so that the SRA knows that the loans will not be called in at short notice because the Treasury takes a dim view of one of its plans. Paragraph 7(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(2) Any loan made to the Authority by the Secretary of State shall be repaid to the Secretary of State at such times and by such methods, and interest on the loan shall be paid to him at such rates and at such times, as he may with the approval of the Treasury from time to time determine.<P>

The amendment would remove the words

</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>determine at the time of making the loan in question.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that the time when the loan to the SRA shall be repaid is determined when it is made. As we argued in our debate on amendment No. 862, if the SRA is to provide a stable framework for investment in the railway, it should have stable funding arrangements.

<P>
The Under-Secretary will no doubt say that the arrangements set out in the Bill are conventional and typical of those made for a non-departmental public body, but they destabilise the financial framework of the industry and we want to know what he thinks of the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The largest pinch point in the west midlands is the capacity problem at Birmingham New Street station, which gums up the railway system in the whole of the west midlands nad further afield. It is a practical problem that needs to be resolved. The proposal relates to loans; could loans through the SRA be applied to the problem in the west midlands? Will the Minister explain how the proposal will work in practice?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who asked about the capacity at New Street station. As a west midlander-I am pleased to see that that is not a libel-he will be interested to learn that the shadow SRA is currently carrying out a feasibility study in respect of Birmingham New Street. We expect the SRA to play a full part in resolving capacity problems there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> How?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> It will do so by means of its potential funding from various sources of revenue, which I described in extremely fine detail in our proceedings this morning. Ultimately it will be for the SRA to take those decisions in its own right. Why have a dog and bark yourself? It is absurd that hon. Gentlemens should expect detailed arrangements for the future-not the distant future-to be set out and agreed in Committee.

<P>
Aha! Help is at hand. Government funds will continue to be made available for value-for-money projects, but we will look to the private sector to seek investment opportunities and to pay its fair share. The Bill will allow the SRA to lever in the necessary investment. As ever, we are looking for a benign partnership between the private and the public sectors to resolve difficult infrastructure issues. It is the Government's chosen route on so many issues and, I am delighted to say, a recent report showed that it has produced extremely good returns to the public purse and to the public at large: for example, it has secured the largest hospital building programme that the country has ever seen, and the prospect of a massive £8 billion for London's underground system to create the modern metro system that the capital city and the nation deserve.

<P>
<B>Mr. Phil Woolas </B>(Oldham, East and Saddleworth): May I add to the list of successes the magnificent Manchester metro system?

<P>
<B>Chairman:</B> Order. No, not under this schedule.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hill:</B> We accept the spirit of my hon. Friend's intervention. He will be aware that, last week, it was announced that a massive £500 million will be levered into developing the Manchester metro.

<P>
I return to the amendment, which is a source of puzzlement. Loans by the Secretary of State under paragraph 7 will be advanced from the national loans fund. As the hon. Member for North Essex knows, it is not unusual for such loans to be repaid early, or at variable rates of interest. That is not new; it happened under previous Governments. The amendment would curtail flexibility that the Secretary of State needs, although he cannot act unreasonably. I happily confirm that the provision does not prevent the Secretary of State and the SRA from agreeing a fixed interest rate when the loan is made and the point at which the loan should be repaid. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is mystified. The amendment would simply require the Secretary of State to make loans at a variable or a fixed rate of interest. He should be required to determine how the loan will be repaid when he makes the loan, as is conventional. It is the difference between a term loan and an overdraft. I do not know whether the loans are intended to be an on-call overdraft facility or a long-term funding arrangement.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson) asked a reasonable question which the Minister has failed to answer. He might have said that the SRA might make a grant from its funds to improve the position at Birmingham New Street, make a soft loan to the infrastructure provider, or provide additional funding at the point of letting the franchise to the train operating company so that it could pay additional access charges. Why should I have to explain that to the Under-Secretary? I seem to have a better understanding of such matters than he does.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> My hon. Friend said that he agreed with my understanding of the Under-Secretary's words. It is my understanding that the Under-Secretary said that taxpayers' funds from the Treasury via the SRA would be lent to a private contractor working on Birmingham New Street. Is that my hon. Friend's interpretation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> It is reasonable to ask if SRA loans will be made to infrastructure providers, project managers or infrastructure funders. There is a case for providing soft loans. However, should the SRA pose as a quasi-bank or are there better ways of providing soft finance to large infrastructure projects?

<P>
The Under-Secretary has not answered the question about the stability of funding to which the SRA should be entitled. Paragraph 7(2) in schedule 13 is another example of how the Treasury will hold everything on a short leash within a short-term time frame. The Government may intend to provide a long-term, stable framework. However, in financial crises such discretionary items are the first things to be cut. Government spending is growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent, which represents a record increase in Government spending in real terms since the 1970s. As a result, we may be returning to the boom and bust cycle that the Chancellor so proudly claims that he has abolished.

<P>
Short-term arrangements are vulnerable when the Treasury is under pressure. Our amendment would provide the longer-term financial framework that the Government are reluctant to give. I do not wish to detain the Committee unduly and I do not believe that the Under-Secretary has anything more to say on the subject. Therefore, I hope that when such matters are discussed in another place, they are dwelt on at length and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<B>The Minister for Housing and Planning (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 813, in page 188, line 43, after ``audited'' insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 814.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The amendment is simple. As drafted, the Bill provides that the SRA's accounts shall be audited, but does not specify by whom. The amendment provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General-in other words, the National Audit Office-will conduct the audit of the authority's accounts. I hope that the Committee agrees that that clarification is sensible.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<B>Mr. Jenkin:</B> This amendment deals with paragraph 11(1) in schedule 13, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Treasury, give a direction to the Authority requiring it to pay to him an amount equal to the whole or such part as may be specified in the direction of any sum, or any sum of a description, so specified which is or has been received by the authority.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
That is a blanket power to claw back any amount of money from the SRA at any time without giving a reason. At the risk of sounding like a cracked record-[
Interruption.] I knew that I would excite the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East with that epithet. However, the provision militates against stable financing of the railway and prudent long-term planning.

<P>
Amendment No. 867 would add a rider to paragraph 11(2)-
