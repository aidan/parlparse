<B>Mr. Eric Pickles </B>(Brentwood and Ongar): As we finished the morning sitting, I had just started to make a few remarks. I shall not repeat them because I am sure that they are still fresh in everyone's memory. As we have got to know one another a little better, I am fully aware that there are some distinguished lawyers on the Labour Benches with expertise in these issues. I was rather hoping that notes would not be passed telling them not to contribute to the debate. We need their advice on these practical matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): It will cost us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend says that it will cost us, but under the new rules regarding the conduct of hon. Members, I should expect such information to be given free in a spirit of friendship.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is against trade union rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend may be right, but we are all friends and colleagues here now.
<P>
Our concern is that this measure is a double whammy, to coin a phrase. First, it will run a coach and horses through the legal system of the United Kingdom with regard to private agreements, and secondly, it will reduce the CSA to complete chaos. It has no particular expertise in this field, and it will be unable to cope. Legitimate criticism was levelled at the CSA for trying to find easy cases. It ignored people who were paying nothing, but chased those who paid something to get them to increase the amount. Under clause 2, there will be a great temptation for the CSA to do exactly the same with private agreements.
<P>
<B>Mr. Desmond Swayne </B>(New Forest, West): I fear that it will not be just the CSA that will be reduced to chaos. The presence of the CSA service will provide warring partners, prior to a divorce settlement, with incentives not to agree. That may reduce the court system to chaos, as more litigation will be required to deal with the original settlement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Perhaps it is an act of self delusion on my part, but I have come to regard myself as something of a silver-tongued orator. It is clear that administrative convenience is what matters most to the Government. If they find a means of ensuring that the great bureaucracy of new Labour will not be inconvenienced in any way, they tend to look at it more favourably. My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) is absolutely right about private agreements, but the CSA may save on paperclips, elastic bands, and so on. It is points such as that that we must learn to make with this new Administration.
<P>
Before the end of this morning's sitting, I was about to read from the White Paper, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We believe that these proposals will encourage parents, lawyers and the courts to come to child maintenance arrangements in the shadow of the CSA."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No doubt, the person who drafted that--be it a politician, the Prime Minister or an official--was recalling a happy childhood, sitting in a history lesson and thinking about the Tower of London casting a shadow over those who had committed treason. It is apposite that politicians on their way to see the king in Tudor times had to go past the Tower to get to Greenwich. If they stepped out of line, the law would clobber them. I suppose that that is what the Government mean by the expression
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the shadow of the CSA."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a bit like saying that all celebrations should be in the shadow of the millennium dome--I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride) has strong views about the dome. That is just as daft. The shadow of the millennium dome may be all right for the glitterati of new Labour, but it is not good for ordinary people, as the noble Lord Falconer contends.
<P>
A shadow is being cast over the English legal system with regard to people on benefit. Taxpayers have a legitimate interest to ensure that they are not paying for the obligations of others. The edict that has been proclaimed is that simple is modern, which equals good, whereas complex involves forces of conservatism, which equals bad.
<P>
Our amendments seek to achieve some justice. From listening to those colleagues who are distinguished lawyers, and from reading the evidence, it is clear that the existing system of court settlements takes the CSA's calculations into consideration. People have a clear idea of what individual maintenance should be. Concerns were expressed in the Select Committee that the process would swamp the system. I do not intend to read out the whole recommendation, but I shall summarise what was said in paragraphs 60 to 63 on page xxiv. The Committee said that it had severe reservations about the idea of unlimited access to the CSA and felt that, in some cases, there would be more than an element of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"rough justice, which may be necessary and appropriate for dealing with circumstances where the parent with care has had to resort to seeking benefit from the taxpayer."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We are concerned that the CSA formula may be invoked to overturn settlements agreed to in court. It would be preferable if settlements reached in court paid attention to the CSA formula from the outset."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree. Labour Members seem to forget that we, too, want a simplified system, but that system should be tempered with justice. The report mentions reconsidering those agreements within as short a time as a year. It then states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We recommend that further research be carried out into the extent to which the interests of the children concerned would be adversely affected by allowing parties to 'private' agreements to have recourse to the rough justice of the ... new formula".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have heard much from Baroness Hollis of Heigham. She gave evidence to the Select Committee, and hon. Members from both sides have competed with one another to quote her. However, she went a stage too far when she described recourse to the courts as a lottery. That might be a fashionable view, but it is not one that I hold. To justify that view, the right hon. Baroness cites the inconsistency of the justice system, saying that it is not always uniform. Again, we see new Labour's bias towards conformity and administrative convenience. It argues, "We do not have a nice pigeon hole for this, so it should not exist. Everything should run in straight lines. Let's apply the formula, because the formula is better." It may be better for administrative convenience, but it is not necessarily better for the individual.
<P>
It is only natural that the justice system should throw up inconsistencies, because people and circumstances are not uniform. A system devised to move various resources from one parent to another must not only be just; it must also be equitable. The amendment would ensure such equity. When seeking justice, it is obviously sensible to encourage parties to arrive at their own solutions. People will know that the shadow of the CSA is hanging over them and will become involved if they cannot reach agreement. When relationships break down, people have a number of responsibilities, the most important of which is the children. Surely, with the great panoply of resources available to them, the courts should be able to divide the assets in the best interests of the children. It is sensible that the process should allow the courts to take care of child maintenance.
<P>
The White Paper is clear about that. At page 55, paragraph 25, it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The courts would still be free, as now, to determine spousal maintenance, property and pension settlements".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The courts may take note of those three factors, but the fourth and most important missing element is the maintenance of the children. We have often quoted the words of Mr. Nicholas Mostyn QC. One phrase of his, cited at page 62, paragraph 8(2), has been quoted so often that we do not need to read it; it is already in our minds. He said that voluntary agreements are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a cornerstone of existing divorce law"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Do we really want to knock away a cornerstone? Clause 2 unamended would do precisely that. It makes more sense to allow people to reach a decision; the CSA should not be invoked unless agreement is impossible to achieve either voluntarily or through the courts.

<P>

<B>Miss Julie Kirkbride </B>(Bromsgrove): Sadly, I was at a Select Committee meeting this morning, and I missed the early part of the debate. I want to clarify whether we are trying to establish that the courts should be allowed to make child maintenance agreements if there is agreement between the parties? If so, what will happen if the parent with care subsequently starts drawing benefit? Would the CSA then have to investigate whether a reasonable child maintenance settlement had been made by the courts? How do we propose to deal with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I can tell my hon. Friend that that point was put to Mr. Pirrie from the solicitors family committee--
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The Solicitors Family Law Association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I knew that there was a benefit in a distinguished lawyer being a member of the Committee. I hope that that will not be the hon. Gentleman's only contribution. He should ignore his Whip and give us the benefit of his views.
<P>
Mr. Pirrie of the Solicitors Family Law Associations said that the parties should go into the process with their eyes open. If the circumstances mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove were to arise, something would have been wrong with the original settlement.
<P>
We missed my hon. Friend enormously this morning. I shall quickly summarise what we said then and how such circumstances might arise. The father may have accepted liability for school fees, which is covered by the Bill--the Government consider that a legitimate expense--or he may make a disbursement on mortgage liabilities on the former marital home, in which the child still lives. He may even make available a different proportion of his capital assets or his pension entitlement.
<P>
Today, I had lunch with a colleague who talked to me about her divorce. She was helping me with a drafting problem, so our meeting was not entirely fortuitous. She said that, under her settlement, it was agreed that the children of the marriage would retain private medical insurance, but that she would not. After 1,000 days of Labour's management of the national health service, many children might benefit from such additional protection.
<P>
It is such circumstances with which I wish to deal, because only under those circumstances would slight adjustments to child maintenance arrangements have to be made to allow all those other factors to be taken into consideration. However, if the parent with care drifted into drawing benefit, the original settlement would clearly need to be reviewed. I shall be more straightforward than the hon. Ladies sitting on the Government Benches, who say that that will happen in only a tiny minority of cases. We must be able to provide for such a minority. If it is obvious from the outset that the parent with care is on benefit, the CAS route is clearly the more sensible. Other calculations and changes will be singularly inappropriate.
<P>
As I was saying before my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove sought clarification, parties entering into negotiations will do so knowing about the CSA. They will know that they have to arrive at an agreement, and if they diverge from the CSA formula, they will have to explain why.
<P>
The Bill will allow carefully worked out settlements, with a delicate balance between property rights, pensions and insurance. However, all that could be pushed aside after only 14 months--12 months after their coming into being and two months' notice. The Select Committee received evidence from Mr. Peter Watson-Lee of the Law Society's family law Committee, which appears on page 103 of the report in response to question 240. He said that if a party can break the agreement after as little as 14 months, he
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "can go back and say, 'Now I am going to the CSA'. Again, that is going to drive a coach and horses through fair settlements because, obviously, if the maintenance is higher than the CSA ordered, the father, when one year is up, is going to go straight back and say, 'I am going back to the CSA.' There may be many cases where a father should be paying more than the CSA says and, again, there will be cases where there have been trade-offs and maybe it is the father who has got the children and the mother is paid a lesser sum so that she does not get maintenance, and within a year the father will be going back saying, 'Tear up that agreement, I am going to the CSA,'"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 We heard some of those arguments earlier, so there is no need to repeat them. The process will militate against private agreements, because people will say, "What is the point? Why should I make this disbursement with regard to mortgages, capital or pensions? If the trade-off will be based on a lesser sum than the CSA recommendation, I could be at risk in 14 months because the parent with care could turn round and say, 'I'm going back to the CSA.' All that disbursement would simply be thrown away and I would be in a worse situation." That is the problem that the amendments seek to overcome.
<P>
The amendments are about child maintenance and the sums involved under the formula, but we must recognise that the Bill does not contain a mechanism whereby we can ensure that the money goes directly to the child. It is fair to assume that many cases involve the minimum sum, and that parents may try to do a little better. We must remember that child maintenance may be a small part of a settlement. The disbursements between the parties who form a marriage are of assets.
<P>
In evidence to the Select Committee, Mr. James Pirrie said that the CSA tail was wagging the dog. He suggested that the much greater disbursements for children were agreed on under the various settlements, and that the CSA tail was merely a small part of the process. He suggested that there was a great problem with the tail but nothing wrong with the dog, and that several problems may occur. On page 97, in response to question 222 asked by the Committee chairman, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), Mr. Pirrie said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In summary, we say Parliament is looking to fix the CSA because it is broke. The divorce dog is not broke, it is alive and it does not want to be wagged by its tail. What we fear is that the White Paper reforms will fix it and they will fix it good and proper."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I take it that he meant that it will not be fixed in an especially pleasant way and that the system will not come off well.
<P>
A draft amendment proposed by Mr. Pirrie from the Solicitors Family Law Association appears on page 97 of the report. Its provisions are, essentially, replicated in new clause 8. Its purpose is to give the court, in exercising its powers to make spousal orders in a lump sum or by transfer of property orders, exclusive powers to make orders for maintenance of children where the parent with care is not in receipt of benefits. The amendment would not prevent the court from dismissing such orders and referring the matter back to the CSA. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove asked about that, and she could vote for the new clause with a clear conscience.
<P>
The amendment recognises that the Bill will extend the CSA's operation to all families, which is a new departure. The Solicitors Family Law Association's briefing, which all members of the Committee will have seen, states that specialist family law practices arrange for the court to regulate the payment of child maintenance. It suggests that imposing the CSA's jurisdiction on all separated families is a leap in the dark. We have all grasped that fact. The CSA does not have the experience of dealing with that amount of related complex cases, as we know from the volume of correspondence and from our surgeries.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I disagree with my hon. Friend. The CSA has tremendous experience of dealing with complicated cases. We seek to abandon that system, do away with all the complications that naturally reflect ordinary life, and impose a simplistic formula.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am obliged to my hon. Friend for making that point, but he was obviously in a combative mood because I do not believe it was entirely inconsistent with what I said. Nevertheless, I am grateful for those comments and agree with them. I am trying to make that point. The CSA will not be able to cope because the process will be "administratively complex", to use the telling phrase--it used to be "social justice" or "relief of poverty". It will cause complex problems and probably give Ministers nightmares, as it will mess up the system and make it look untidy. Something should be done about that.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend may not be able to give me the information I seek, but perhaps the Minister or the Under-Secretary will discuss the matter. As we all know, one reason for the CSA's failure has been the volume and burden of its work--the sheer numbers involved--perhaps exacerbated by its administrative complexity. Are any figures available showing what difference the proposal to make all families subject to the provision will make to the CSA's caseload?
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I have no doubt that, as we speak, the Minister is making a note of my hon. Friend's point. Ministers are rather good at figures, and I dare say that the Under-Secretary will be able to supply us with a figure, down to the last decimal point. The Select Committee recognised that the outcome will depend on how the system is phased in while the two systems are in operation, and on how cases are prioritised. I am worried that such cases will be prioritised, and that ultimately the Under-Secretary will stand at the Dispatch Box and claim to have saved money and that the provision is a great success. There will be a temptation to move the CSA to middle England, which will cause problems.
<P>
The Solicitors Family Law Association contends that there is no evidence to suggest that the court system operating under the Child Support Act 1991 has proved inappropriate. Families will continue to have to use the legal system to regulate issues of capital division and spousal support, as the White Paper recognises. According to the association, there will be two types of case involving payments to children--those of people who rely on welfare benefits, in which the system must balance the opposing interests of the parent and the taxpayer, and those in which the family provides the resources. The Bill proposes that the best means of dealing with the former, the benefit case, is by a formula that is sufficiently simple to enable the CSA to be effective.
<P>
According to the association, the Bill will result in unwarranted interference and may stand in the way of families finalising arrangements that best enable them to fund the two parts of the separating family. On divorce, the legal system crafts a package of measures that includes capital distribution and spousal maintenance. Payments for children form only a part of that complex mix.

<P>

<B>Mr. Desmond Browne </B>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> This is good news. We are about to have the benefit of the views a distinguished lawyer who operates in the field. It is a great pleasure to hand over to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that introduction. In fact, he is in error, but it is not the first time in this Committee.
<P>
This is an important and interesting issue, and partial quotations from the White Paper do not help the debate. The hon. Gentleman has obviously taken advice from practitioners in the field, presumably in England and Wales, and from the Organisation to which he has referred, judging by the notes from which he read. Does he have any evidence to suggest that parties make private agreements that result in better settlements for spousal maintenance and capital, but which deprive the children of maintenance? Do parties, as adults, discuss global agreements to carve up the money and give the children less? Does his evidence suggest that people at least agree between themselves that the non-resident parent will give money to the resident parent at the rate that the CSA would be likely to decide if it were to be involved? That is important. If present practice suggests that children are being deprived, because adults are carving up the money, such a provision is needed. However, if current practice suggests that people are having regard, in any event, to the CSA, they will continue to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am quite buoyed up by what the hon. Gentleman said. It suggests that the force of reason and argument has drifted across the Room. We shall see whether it affects how he votes. He argued that parents would carve up an agreement to reduce child maintenance and to reduce assets to the children. I have no experience of such matters, but I have carefully read the evidence and talked to those with experience, and such a case has never arisen. Common sense tells me that no parent would do that. New clause 8 is about trying to find a way in which the assets of a relationship or a former marriage can be distributed in the best interests of the child and, without it, children would be denied the opportunity of a disbursement in their favour.
<P>
New clause 7 was recommended by the Social Security Select Committee. Under the legislation, the court could impose a level of contribution different from that provided under the new formula only if it were in the interests of the child to do so. The new clause would take care of that problem and enhance clause 2. Amendment No. 61 would also achieve the outcome proposed in the new clauses, although in a less elegant form. It contains an important safeguard for when a non-resident parent tries to bully the parent with care into accepting a written maintenance deal so as to prevent the Government from saying that the CSA should be involved.
<P>
We have three concerns. First, the CSA will be swamped with cases as a result of the clause and it will not be able to cope. Secondly, private arrangements will not be reached as easy as they were in the past. The court system will not be able to cope with the greater volume of litigation. The third and most important point is that the amendments and new clauses would allow the courts to provide a disbursement of assets in the best interests of the child. Without the new clauses, especially new clause 8, we are afraid that the deal offered to children will be lessened.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George </B>(St. Ives): I shall deal with the amendments Nos. 87 and 88. I know that the Committee is keen to make progress, but the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) is right to dwell on such important matters. Our concerns about clause 2 are threefold. First, it will create unnecessary extra work for the CSA. Secondly, it could reward unco-operative parents. Thirdly, it is perverse in that it could unravel satisfactory arrangements that have previously been made, which could be detrimental to children.
<P>
Under existing provisions, parents who are prepared to co-operate can agree levels of child maintenance and have that agreement incorporated in a court order. That means that the courts govern their maintenance obligations, and that the CSA does not seek to interfere. Such arrangements have been used widely, and have taken many cases off the over-pressed CSA, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar has said. They enable parents to reach their own agreements to the benefit of all.
<P>
An example may help the Committee to appreciate the difficulties that the clause may cause. Two parents may agree that the non-resident parent will pay more for the children than the CSA would stipulate in return for the parent with care agreeing to a clean break and not seeking maintenance for himself or herself. That may be beneficial to the non-resident parent, who may prefer the fact that his payments are for the children and that his obligation will cease when the children finish full-time education. There would be a cut-off point in the maintenance payments and the arrangement would be satisfactory to both sides.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle):</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I shall finish explaining the scenario before gladly giving way. The parent with care may prefer such an order because it would make her more independent. Such matters as future cohabitation would not affect her maintenance payments.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Nothing in the Bill will prevent couples from reaching such agreements. As an added bonus, under the new system, the net income of the non-resident parent only will be means-tested, so the parent with care could find a new partner without it having any effect. That is another of the simplifications contained in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for providing that clarification, but the concern remains that giving one or other party the right to go to the CSA after 14 months means that such agreements may last only for that period. That makes them unrealistic, and prevents co-operating parents from reaching their own agreements. It will create further uncertainty and difficult circumstances.
<P>
The state should have an interest if payments agreed by the parents are below the level that would apply under the new CSA formula and the parent with care goes on benefit. Therefore, it is quite understandable that such an arrangement should be reviewed. Under those circumstances, the state would be justified in requiring the non-resident parent to increase payments to the formula level after the year has lapsed. The parent with care would, quite naturally, wish the CSA to review the matter.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, in paragraph 62 of its report, the Select Committee recommends that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the proposed right of access for 'private' non-benefit cases to the CSA after an agreement has been in force for a year should not be brought into force until the Child Support Agency has had time to demonstrate its effectiveness in handling the new formula."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is important. In paragraph 8.8 of his evidence on p. 62, Mr. Nicholas Mostyn states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I can confidently predict that it will lead to more cases not settling in their other aspects and the Court being called on to decide them (in many cases at the tax payers' expense through legal aid) when they would otherwise have settled."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on, perhaps hyperbolically, to say that that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"is an unwarranted example of statist nannying."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may get a cheer from members of some parties. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear!"] I do not want to milk the occasion, but at least I can provide an opportunity for an entertainment break.
<P>
Mr. Mostyn states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Government has offered no explanation whatever as to why it should be changed."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In paragraph 39 of its reply to the Select Committee report, the Government said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"This will ensure that parents, in reaching agreements on child maintenance, give due weight to the child support rates".
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a fair point, but does not overcome the problem of the payments to a child who is benefiting from a rate above the CSA's agreed formula rate being reviewed at any time under the clause.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Private arrangements must be agreed by both sides. The Bill has nothing to say about such arrangements, and the parties may continue to agree.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> It would take only one side to appeal to the CSA for such arrangements to be removed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. The Under-Secretary is trying to bully the Committee. It is obvious that, after 14 months, a party can go to the CSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The Under-Secretary may choose to dwell on the matter in her reply. When a satisfactory arrangement has been made in court, either side may, for whatever reason, wish the CSA to review the matter after only 14 months.
<P>
On amendment No. 88, the financial arrangements of married parents who are divorcing may need to be examined to include child maintenance, spousal maintenance, capital and property. If such people can agree matters, they can take advantage of the 1991 Act.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>3.34 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming--
<P>
<B>Mr. George:</B> I was drawing to a conclusion.
<P>
Two parents who agree matters can take advantage of the Child Support Act 1991, and get the court to make an order recording their settlement, including the level of child maintenance. That may only be done if the parties agree. If one parent is unco-operative, the court may have to hear the full financial details and adjudicate on all aspects of the case. However, it may not adjudicate on the level of child maintenance. That restricts the court's ability to deliver justice in all circumstances and, in particular, rewards unco-operative parents. If these matters are before the courts, it makes sense for it to deal with all aspects of a case.
<P>
I therefore urge Ministers to review the clause as, in its present form, it would result in the CSA sucking in additional work, which private agreements could adequately deal with.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> On such occasions, it is always helpful to draw on personal experience and not merely refer to Select Committee reports. I am afraid my experience in the family courts is rather old, dating from my undistinguished career at the Bar. [Hon. Members: "Oh".] No, it was most undistinguished, I fear. Indeed, it was even more undistinguished than my career here, which is saying quite a lot.
<P>
I was in family chambers 22 years ago. Some of the children with whom we dealt are probably grown-up now and have their own children, which makes me feel ancient. My family chambers were quite a good set, and were briefed by the royal family's solicitors. I should have stayed in those chambers, as I imagine they would have had a lot of work! Perhaps we should pass over that.
<P>
When I was in chambers, I was struck by the complexity of our family law system. Enormous care was taken with each case, and the system worked extremely well at that level. Having experienced family law at first hand, I am trying understand the Government's position. Baroness Hollis's comments reveal the logic of their case. She said that the court-based system is a lottery. One could paraphrase her and argue that indeed it is unpredictable. I do not like to use the word "lottery", which implies that decisions are based on chance. The family court system may be expensive and unpredictable, but it is not based on chance. It is unpredictable because people and family circumstances are unpredictable, and thus involve complex matters.
<P>
Therefore, I do not understand the argument that the CSA should move into the area covered by an unpredictable family-based court system so as to ensure more predictability. If that were to happen, we would surely be arguing that the tail works so well that, if it did wag the dog--in the words of Nicholas Mostyn or the Solicitors Family Law Association, I forget which--that would be an improvement. In fact, the truth is that the CSA--as the Committee accepts--does not work well, while the courts, which have a wealth of experience, do generally work well and effectively.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar described this as the "shadow of the Tower" debate. Incidentally, I did not understand his allusion to the fact that one had to pass by the Tower of London to get to the King's palace at Greenwich, because I thought that in Tudor times the King lived at Richmond. Perhaps I am wrong in that, but I shall move on because I do not want to be ruled out of order.
<P>
The argument seems to be that we want the courts to work in the shadow of the CSA, but I do not understand the logic behind that. On page 98 of the Select Committee's report, the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) questioned Mr. Pirrie, one of the witnesses. The hon. Gentleman's point seemed to be that he did not know what the solicitor representing the Solicitors Family Law Association was worried about, because people would fall in and out of the benefits system, so inevitably these matters would be influenced by the CSA.
<P>
Mr. Pirrie's reply, which was effective, was that if he is working with a couple who are on an income level at which they may receive benefits, he takes into account the fact that they may well fall within the CSA's ambit. He did not see that as a problem. However, in many other cases with which he deals there is no likelihood of one or both parties being reliant on benefit and therefore falling within the ambit of the CSA. Mr. Pirrie argued that the current system works far better because, broadly speaking the CSA gets on with the job of dealing with people who may otherwise be supported by the taxpayer. I thought that that was the original justification for the CSA.
<P>
As far as I can remember, all the lawyers who gave evidence to us on this issue said that it would be madness for the CSA to extend its work. We should pay them some attention; after all, why have a pre-legislative inquiry if we are not going to take account of what practitioners in the field tell us?
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): I am concerned about two points. First, I understood that when the Conservatives introduced the original legislation, it was their intention that everyone should make a fair contributioin, but things changed later on because of the stress that the CSA was under. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman seems to think that only those who are likely to be in receipt of income support should be considering a fair contribution to their children. I would be very concerned if there were a different system for those who can afford to avoid their responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I want to be fair to the hon. Lady, but I wish that she would listen to what I am saying.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I was listening.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> With respect, she could not have been listening because I am not arguing that a court-based system favours fathers and prevents them from paying adequately. The system does not work well in some cases, but, generally, in a court-based system both sides are represented by lawyers--professionals working in the real world--who ensure that both clients get a fair deal. The advantage of going through the courts is that clients are represented by lawyers, so they are not taken for a ride. Lawyers ensure that their interests are properly represented. This has nothing to do with favouring the father or the mother; nor is it about any of the other issues that we have been discussing. The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) constantly assumes that we are coming from one direction, or that we are trying to do someone down. We are not trying to do anyone down. We simply want a fair system that takes some account of family circumstances.
<P>
I cannot understand the Government's reasoning. The Under-Secretary admitted this morning that the CSA spends 90 per cent. of its time on assessment and only 10 per cent. on enforcement. It has become almost a clichæ to say that, whatever the Opposition's arguments, they should always remember that we cannot load more work on to the CSA, or take account of the income of the parent with care, because it is impossible for the CSA to cope with that extra load. If the CSA is totally overloaded and is not working too well, why is the Under-Secretary now proposing that it should take on more work? I do not understand her logic.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): I remind the hon. Gentleman of the visit made by the Social Security Committee to Falkirk when we raised the issue of work load. The staff reassured us that if the new formula is implemented, there will be no problem in dealing with an increased work load because the computation system will be so much simpler.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for intervening in the debate because she knows a lot about the subject. Her voting record on this matter is interesting. My recollection may be a bit hazy, but I think she may have voted the opposite of what she suggested. I do not blame her for that, because I do it all the time.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Humble:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> If she did not, I apologise. The hon. Lady has a particular point of view on the matter, which I hope she will share with the Committee. It is important to hear both sides of the argument.My main point is that if we simplify the system, it will presumably be possible for the CSA to take on more cases efficiently. However, the sort of cases that have hitherto been dealt with by the courts are often inherently far more complex than those that are dealt with by the CSA. In such cases, neither party is reliant on benefits; indeed, they may have a considerable income. Property, investment income or extraneous matters could be involved when one party wants a clean-break formula. I remember when I was in the family law chambers, to which I referred earlier, and the barrister with whom I was working was so efficient that because maintenance payments were subject to tax relief, he could ensure that his client sent two of his children to Eton without paying any money, or perhaps just £3 or £4 a year.
<P>
That is a rare case, but I cite it to show that we are dealing with complex matters. When trying to determine what is best for the child, the mother and father, all these matters must be taken into account. When we have a system that does that, and ensures that both parties are represented by professionals, why move to a brutal system of saying, "You will pay 15 per cent. of your income"? In many cases, that may not be the fair or right way of doing things; it does not seem fair to me. All the evidence that we heard in the Select Committee suggested that the CSA would find it difficult to cope with those cases, contrary to what the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) said.
<P>
I shall not labour the point, but I hope that the Minister will listen to our arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Laurence Robertson </B>(Tewkesbury): Without repeating what my hon. Friends have said, I want to express my concerns about the delays that might be caused by the changes. Many cases that are brought to the CSA might not otherwise be if there are adequate or even satisfactory maintenance orders. I am dealing with a case at present that proves my point.
<P>
A chap came to see me a few weeks ago. He separated from his wife in 1994 and immediately began to pay her direct, but it took three years before he was fully assessed, which was in 1997. He continued to pay, but believe it or not, in 1999, the CSA decided that a mistake had been made, so he was reassessed for part of the earlier period. He carried on paying. He paid before he was assessed, he paid after he was assessed and he paid when he was reassessed. Because of the reassessment, he ended up in arrears. I know that the system is complicated, which might have led to that result, but such delays cause problems. My office was told only this morning that a delay in assessment of six months is acceptable. I do not think that that is acceptable. It would be unacceptable if hon. Members replied to letters six months after receiving them. These delays have caused problems for my constituent.
<P>
If the CSA is to end up with a lot more cases, as was recognised in 1995 when it had been running for a while, the extra cases will cause more problems. It is strange that after 12, or perhaps 14 months, a case can arrive back at the CSA. My constituent has done his best to pay and he did so before he was assessed, but because of delays in the system, he has ended up in arrears. I am concerned that because of the construction of the clause, the CSA could end up with many more cases. The six-month delay, which we are told is acceptable, will lengthen. What will it become if the CSA takes on so many more cases?

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> New clause 8 is the most important amendment that we have discussed so far. The Bill, perhaps not intentionally, is nothing short of the nationalisation of child maintenance arrangements.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman point me to the place in the Bill that requires people to go to the CSA if they do not think it necessary?
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I shall answer the hon. Lady's point in the course of my remarks. I hope that if she feels that I have not done so when I am about to conclude, she will remind me of my undertaking. I was about to say that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) chastised the Committee for relying only on the findings of the Select Committee, rather than experience. I fear that my humble 10 years as a school master and then 10 years as a banker do not fit me with experience in these matters. I have to rely on the evidence that was given to the Select Committee.
<P>
On page xxiv of the report, Professor Gwynn Davis gives us a picture of the best of all possible worlds in paragraph 60 when he says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there would effectively be a two-tier system in operation, one tier which was effectively private and negotiated, (where it would be prudent to shadow the Agency child maintenance requirements to a degree just in case the private arrangement broke down ...) a second tier comprising benefit claimants where the CSA imposed a simple system of child maintenance payable in respect of those cases."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So there would be a two-tier system--one to deal with the people who are off benefit, and the other for people to make their own private arrangements. In essence, that is what the existing settlement is designed to promote. There is a system of private arrangements under which settlements are encouraged, and consent orders variable by the courts exist. By and large, that system works relatively well. The problem is that the other half--the second tier--is not working at all. It attempts to emulate the advantages of the first part of the system, which can take into account highly complex issues and thrash them out with a great deal of time and professional support.
<P>
The second tier attempted to emulate that, to give the same quality of justice through the operation of a highly complex formula. We are here now because that did not work. The administrative solution to deliver that fairness of settlement and quality of justice was simply inadequate for the problem that it faced. Because there is huge consensus behind the Bill, we have agreed that there has to be a much simpler second tier to the system. It must deliver a lower quality of fairness, a rougher kind of justice. Hon. Members will see that the paragraph took some crafting following the divisions and the argument that went before it. I will quote a well-crafted few lines from it.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have reservations about the wisdom of allowing unlimited access to the CSA formula in all cases since the qualities of simplicity and rough justice, which may be necessary and appropriate for dealing with circumstances where the parent with care has had to resort to seeking benefit from the taxpayer, may not cope adequately with more complicated circumstances in which a private arrangement has been reached and where the taxpayer's interests are not involved."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Nothing could sum up more explicitly the principle of eligibility that underlies the Bill. That paragraph makes it clear that there have to be two systems--one for those whose arrangements do not affect the taxpayer and the other for those that do.
<P>
The Bill as drafted allows the agency to tout for extra business in a most unfair and unnatural way. I shall tell the hon. Member for Colne Valley why. The agency stands between warring parties; if it satisfies one it upsets the other. The courts can take into account hugely complicated cases and arrive at a just decision balancing the interests of the parties. The agency cannot; it is armed with a simple formula which delivers, by everyone's understanding, a rough justice. Rough justice for one partner will be an advantage for the other. We shall completely undermine the first tier of our system as one partner realises that despite the arrangements, agreements and negotiations, he or she can and will get a better deal by falling upon the CSA, and acts on that knowledge.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman taking adequate account of the part of that paragraph that states that in reaching a decision, account shuold be taken of the CSA in the first place?
<P>
<H5>4 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Undoubtedly the courts will take account of the CSA rates. If someone had to fall back on the CSA arrangements, inevitably the CSA's formula would be used. But the hon. Lady must remember that the solution reached in negotiation prior to any court settlement, as well as the settlement itself, has to take account of complicated circumstances which, under the CSA system, would be dealt with only by a variation--a departure. So the CSA has the capability to address complexities but, as we have seen with the existing system, departures tend to take over and the Bill rightly seeks to constrain their use. So, although it is right and proper for the courts to pay attention to the CSA--which they undoubtedly will--by their nature they also pay attention to other matters to which the CSA will not and cannot pay attention, so as to deliver the higher quality of justice that they are rightly designed to promote and which the CSA cannot deal with simply through administrative necessity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> The hon. Gentleman has come to the nub of the issue. As he was a member of the Select Committee when the evidence was heard, may I direct him to page 98, question 224, and to Mr. Pirrie's answer to the Chairman's question, to which the hon. Member for Gainsborough referred.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If I am negotiating a settlement and I see that my opposite number, representing the wife (with the children) is going to drop onto benefits, I am not going to move away from the CSA figures, I would be crazy to because what happens if I agree a low figure and pay more capital and then lo and behold a year later she is on benefits and my client, the husband, is suing me because his maintenance has increased. it is a self-regulating system,"
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is not the purpose of these provisions to regulate the maintenance system so as to produce that effect in private agreements and court agreements? Other capital and maintenance arrangements can be made to deal with the complexities, otherwise the children will be left out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That solution produces a much more complex equation for the first tier of the system to deal with. For example, there must be compensating ways round the problem through capital settlements and so on. That would be most regrettable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> This is the nub of the argument. That expert on family law, in his evidence to the Select Committee, said that he, and no doubt others, are experienced in doing just that if they anticipate that people may fall into benefits. They have the skill to do so. The provision merely requires that the system should be self regulated so that the CSA formula can be taken into account from the outset in private arrangements and court arrangements. In that way, the children will be assured of at least the minimum.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman is carried away by the caveat that he introduced at the beginning, the force of which he seems not to have spotted. Where is the expectation that one party is likely to fall into benefits? Lawyers apply such a principle to a relatively select sample of their client base. The fact is that people who are likely to fall into benefits--which, let us face it, will be the majority of their case load--do not have such complex cases. I think that the existing system is preferable. My feeling about some hon. Members' criticisms is that they are based on nothing short of egalitarianism, which is now out of place in new Labour. Labour members do not like the fact that there will be two systems. They do not want a higher quality of justice to be available to those who can escape the second tier. The nature of the problem with which the CSA deals means that, if it is to deliver any justice, it will be the simple and rough sort.
<P>
Rough justice is better than no justice, but most people can obtain real justice. The Bill will impose a system of rough justice on the entire population, rather than only on those unfortunate enough to find themselves on benefit, who will have to avail themselves of the services of the CSA. As time goes by, more people will be calling on the agency's services. Today, the Committee heard of another motive for aggrieved partners--perhaps concerned rather selfishly with their own welfare rather than that of their children--to rely on the CSA as a means of prosecuting old grievances. I shall cite two examples of that.
<P>
A parent with care who enjoys a relatively high income must call upon the services of the CSA. There will be no cap, no measure of reasonableness about how much to expect of their former partner's income and no way in which to negotiate a fair settlement, because the CSA will impose a rigid formula that gives no consideration to the income of the parent with care. The other example, which will provide a singular temptation to make use of the CSA's services, is that, as we discussed last Thursday, there will be no ceiling on the absent parent's liabilities. The child will have been given a right to an unlimited proportion of the parents' income. That money will, of course, be paid to the parent with care, not to the child. The temptation will be for the parent with care to throw themselves on the CSA to gain access to an unlimited proportion of the income of the absent parent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for his generosity in giving way. My understanding of our earlier exchanges is that he accepted that the effect of the provisions would be self-regulation by the legal profession, which would no doubt be greatly complex and increase its work load--I am sure that it would not complain about that. The legal profession would regulate its practices and apply that formula across the board in private arrangements, which would feed into the courts. Therefore, how could anyone threaten the other partner by making an application to the CSA? All private and all court agreements will have to incorporate 15 per cent., 20 per cent. or 25 per cent.--or whatever percentage is appropriate--for the children. There will be no advantage or disadvantage to going to the CSA.

<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> I do not share that view; I refer the hon. Gentleman to the answer that I gave to his previous intervention. That simple formula will not apply across the entire client base. It will be applied across that proportion of the client base that might find themselves on benefit. In the negotiations that precede a divorce settlement, ordinary tests of fairness will give rise to a reasonable and equitable distribution of assets and income. That cannot be accommodated by the simplicity of the CSA formula. I do not share his confidence that the provision will have that pervasive effect. That may be believed, as it is believed by him, as a result of some of the evidence presented to the Select Committee, but Mr. Nicholas Mostyn's remarks are entirely antithetical to that view.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recall that the CSA was introduced because decisions made by the courts were not working, and the vast majority of people were unhappy? Why else was the CSA introduced? The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. Income support was not the reason; it was because the courts were not working.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> The impetus for introducing the CSA was the bill to the taxpayer for child maintenance for those who did not take proper responsibility for their children. That is what the CSA was designed to remedy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jacqui Lait </B>(Beckenham): Does my hon. Friend accept that part of the thinking behind the introduction of the CSA was that the courts took account in settlements of access to taxpayers' money? The courts were producing unfair settlements, and part of that unfairness was burdening the taxpayer.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> That is precisely the point. The CSA was created in an attempt to relieve the taxpayer. It has not been able to do so because of the complexity of the arrangements. That complexity is entirely a consequence of the quality of justice that it attempted to deliver, which it has since discovered was unreasonable. By common consent, we must simplify the formula, but, of necessity, that egalitarian move will deliver a lower quality of justice to everyone.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I begin by saying how much I agree with the powerful case put by my hon. Friends, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West. He got to the nub of the problem: in order to make the CSA more workable, we are being asked to make concessions on the fair application of the formula. None of us likes that. We shall all have aggrieved constituents because, under the new system, one or other of the parties will suffer--either the parent with care will have less money or the absent parent will have to pay more.
<P>
We accept the necessity for change; the CSA must be made more workable. However, the proposed provisions leave us somewhat confused. In seeking to make the CSA more workable, the Government want to include everybody, but many people do not need to be included. The Bill will increase the CSA's case load, which surely cannot be desirable, given that one of the agency's main problems has been a far larger and more complex case load than anticipated. The provisions will include those who would otherwise go to court. That will diminish the fairness of settlements for those who are pushed into using the system, even though they could have used a perfectly reasonable system that does not involve the taxpayer and which is already in place. The Government may come to regret the provision. The previous Conservative Government probably regretted their attempts to make matters fairer under the old system because it became so complicated as to be unworkable. We were constantly attempting to make the system fairer in order to make it more acceptable, but it did not work and even more people were upset.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The present Government are in the same predicament. They want to make the system fairer to all by avoiding two tiers--Labour Members typically go frantic about such systems operating in any state Organisation. However, if they were more rational, they could set aside their prejudices about two-tier systems and allow the one system that is working perfectly well to carry on--without bringing it into the state system, or nationalising it, as my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West said.
<P>
The day will come when the Government will regret their decision. We all know from newspapers and constituency surgeries that the more articulate the complainant, the more grief tends to be caused. The Government have no business forcing classes of people into the state system when there is no public involvement in the private system: it is all down to two private parties. The Government may rue the day on which the decision was made, but it is a matter for them.
<P>
We all know how much strain the CSA imposes on people who have been involved in acrimonious divorces or separations. Such people are often feeling the pinch in maintaining separate households; their finances do not stretch as far as they used to. Whatever judgments the CSA reaches, there is likely to be deep resentment on the part of at least one party. Because of the acrimony surrounding divorce and separation cases--and I can think of examples from my own case load--sometimes one party hates the other so much that they will do anything to cause an upset. The provision may give such people a stick with which to beat the other party. A person whose partner who has run off with, say, a best friend could do anything to cause grief in an attempt to get even for the emotional hurt or offence that has been suffered.
<P>
Clearly, the state has no interest in providing sticks with which to beat people. The interest of the state is in the new family unit--whatever it might be--settling down to some consistency and certainty through a financial deal, and in the two warring factions of mother and father at least agreeing to a truce. If an acceptable financial arrangement agreed by the courts can be unpicked by an appeal to the CSA 14 months later, where is the public interest? No taxpayers' money is involved. It is unnecessary to proceed in such a way.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> Paragraph 5 of page v of the Select Committee report refers to one of the original aims of the Child Support Agency: to secure adequate care for the child. Should not the welfare of the child be regarded as most important? However, the paragraph makes it clear that some court decisions amounted to pitifully low support.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I partly agree with the hon. Lady, but I do not reach the same conclusion. The CSA came into being because the courts had to deal with all cases and did not adequately provide for children. In families with only modest resources, the absent parent might say, "I will give you the equity in the house, love, but that's it. Don't bark at my door again. I don't want to see you. I have given you the money. I will take the kids out on a Saturday afternoon, but beyond that: get down to the Benefits Agency and sign on. The taxpayer will pick up the bill for you. That is what used to happen.  The hon. Lady is right about why we no longer have such a court system. There are huge disparities in people's income and wealth, and the gap is getting wider under her Government--but you will be upset, Sir David, if I carry on down that route.
<P>
Some families will fall within the CSA's ambit because they will be looking to the taxpayer for support in keeping a roof over their heads and a meal in their stomachs. When the taxpayer has an interest, it is perfectly fair to ensure that both parents make a contribution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I am now beginning to understand the mindset of the hon. Member for Colne Valley. She is under the misapprehension that when disputes are settled in court, maintenance for the child is inadequate. She does not realise that we have moved on from that mindset and that, where the taxpayer is involved, the courts are not. When complex financial circumstances obtain and the taxpayer is not involved, the court ensures that the child is adequately looked after.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend, in expressing his frustration at the inability of Government Members to understand our case, puts it well. He was led to his peroration by frustration, and he is exactly right. Separating family units of sufficient means--rich families, crudely--do not need support from the taxpayer, so it is unnecessary to involve the CSA in the arrangements. It is not the business of the state and it is a headache for those who have to deal with the CSA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> May I try to convince the hon. Lady as I did the hon. Member for New Forest, West--though he was unpersuaded? Presently, case law requires the courts to take CSA calculations into account. As I know from my own experience of solicitors and from the Select Committee report, lawyers who anticipate that parties might need to have recourse to the CSA reach private agreements encompassing that prospect. Does she not agree that that will happen in all cases involving children? First, in private arrangements, lawyers will want to protect themselves against claims of professional negligence; and, secondly, case law will require the courts to take CSA calculations into account in assessing maintenance for children. There will not be a flood of private cases to the CSA or from the courts to the CSA over bust arrangements. Agreements and decisions will be based on CSA calculations from the outset.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> There may not be great disagreement between the hon. Gentleman and myself. When the CSA started, some lawyers did not understand its impact and left some of my constituents in a parlous predicament. However, I am pleased to hear that there is now greater understanding of its operation. We are debating only a few cases from a small segment of society. There may be a fine line between the parent with care being better off with a CSA settlement or with a slightly more mixed marriage of the distribution of the financial assets under the courts? I agree that that is a difficult area, but the CSA legislation contains a raft of difficult areas where it is impossible to give the law a position that would be defensible in all circumstances.
<P>
In view of the acrimony that surrounds divorce cases, I fear that there will be an increasing number of cases where there is no public interest and no taxpayers' money but where the Bill will allow the CSA to come along and take an interest even when a perfectly adequate financial arrangement has been made. A court settlement may well be in place, but the parties may hate each other. What is the point in opening that up unnecessarily? That is where the hon. Gentleman and I differ. I am grateful that he says that the courts and the lawyers understand the legislation better now, as that is a good thing for all our constituents. There is not a big disagreement between us; I just happen to have a slightly dimmer view of human nature from the cases that I have seen.
<P>
One of the points that follows from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough concerns the complexity of what the courts may have agreed. It may not just be that the children have been given private health care, or private school fees or the things that better-off families can afford to improve their children's life styles. There may also be quite complicated cases where the absent parent has a great deal of capital but not a great deal of cash. He may be setting up a new business venture and may be quite happy to hand over the grade I listed mansion to the ex-wife to bring up the kids in but not want to give her a lot of money to do it. She may well earn enough money to keep them going in the mansion.
<P>
The taxpayer would not have an interest in such a case. The man would have to trust the ex-wife, once she has the lot, not to turn around and demand a bit of the income a few years down the line because the business is looking quite successful. There would have to be some provision to cover the possibility that she would turn to the state and ask to go on benefit while remaining in her grade I listed mansion. That would obviously not be fair. However, while there is a distribution of assets that suits all parties, especially the chidren, who have acres upon acres of ground to run around in and a lovely life until the reality of having to earn their own living hits them, I do not see why the state should hang a sword of Damocles over the absent parent. He should not be afraid to hand over the capital even though he may not make huge arrangements for regular maintenance because of the way that the law will operate.
<P>
I accept that there would have to be some way around that if the parent with care wanted to live on benefit, but there would be circumstances in which unusual distributions of capital that would be in the best interests of the children could be agreed to amicably. It is very complicated, but so is the CSA. The Government are wrong to insist that these things be unpicked.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> Surely my hon. Friend has had my experience, whereby one party comes to a constituency advice session and relates a set of circumstances that are entirely reasonable but which the CSA, even with its complex formula and its system of departures, cannot now accommodate nor could reasonably be expected to accommodate in any administrative system. It simply cannot deliver the quality of justice that other private arrangements can. The fear is that we are taking away that opportunity.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> My hon. Friend puts his case well. The court can come to an agreement that will be more sophisticated and potentially more in the interests of the children and, for that matter, of the separating couple, who may need different things at different times in their lives. Sometimes we need more capital than income and at other times the reverse would be helpful. That happens to divorcing couples too, especially if they are in business for themselves. The wife may well have a good steady job. The husband may well be happy to hand over the house, but he will not then want to be told by the CSA that 15 per cent. is 15 per cent. and that he must still hand over the money. That possibility will always be there in the background if the Government allow the rule to be put into the Bill.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Browne:</B> That is the nub of the argument. It will be there not in the background but in the foreground. Part of the complexity will already be resolved when people make these complicated financial arrangements. They will have to do it recognising that the children have to be paid 15, 20 or 25 per cent.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so clearly exasperated by what he feels is our unwillingness to see his point of view. I am concerned about those people who would not be in the mega rich category. The courts should take into account what the CSA formula would be and what it would do to each party's income and likely receipts. Because they are not in the super rich category they would not want to leave themselves exposed in any way when making any capital settlements to the children. I am glad that the courts are being more responsive in that respect. The hon. Gentleman is not taking into account the possible minority of very wealthy couples who are separating and who have enough assets--[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun sighs. I should have thought better of him than to show such class hatred. I thought that he came from the better end of the Labour party and that he believed in Tony Blair's new Labour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Swayne:</B> They are the worst.
<P>
<B>Miss Kirkbride:</B> I fear that my hon. Friend is right. I was trying to be more generous.
<P>
For some people this recourse will not be necessary. It might be in the best interests of those children to hand over that property and make a large capital settlement so that they can live in the house in which they have been brought up. It would undoubtedly be in the best interests of the parent with care, the wife, who may well have a steady and well-paid job. The Damocles sword of the potential for vexatious litigation by a return to the CSA is unnecessary in these cases. This is the point of balance recognised by the Opposition and the Government, but the Government are getting the balance wrong.
<P>
I was pleased to hear what the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun had to say about the courts' attitude and the knowledge of solicitors. He has more experience in this area than I do. I have certainly found that the initial advice that many of my constituents received from solicitors was catastrophic. They were encouraged to take over the debts of the marriage and to hand over property settlements with absolutely no reference to what the CSA would later tell them. I was so concerned about that that I raised the matter with the hon. Member for Hendon; I said how outrageous it was that my constituents had been treated in that way. He replied that although they might have had a terrible time and their lives might have been ruined by the fact that they had been encouraged to make an agreement that was not in their best interests, because they had not suffered financial loss they probably did not have a case.
<P>
We want to make progress. I shall conclude by saying that I hope that the behaviour of solicitors will come up in future amendments.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Just to set the scene, before I go through what is a long and complex group of amendments, some of which have slightly contradictory aims that I wish to explain--
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> They are not contradictory.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The hon. Gentleman must be patient and wait until I come to the specific amendments.
<P>
To set the scene, we have to remember why the CSA came into being in the first place because there has been a glow of nostalgia about pre-CSA days in some of the contributions by Opposition Members--I exonerate the hon. Member for Beckenham from that charge--especially the hon. Member for New Forest, West. That is to some extent understandable, but we should avoid the temptation to see the past in that way. The previous Government decided to move away from court-based arrangements in 1993, precisely because the system was a lottery and was failing to deliver adequate levels of maintenance to children. We also need to remember the experience of many parents with care in the 1980s, who saw the courts increasingly making clean-break settlements and assuming that income support should be the main source of support for children--a point about which the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) reminded her hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, West and a point that I would have made myself. The previous Government agreed with that analysis when they drafted the 1991 Act. There was all-party agreement that that was a problem, which is why the first attempt at creating the CSA arose. So let us not indulge in putting a rosy glow on what preceded the circumstances that we now seek to reform.
<P>
I wish also to deal with the point about case loads. Many, perhaps all, Opposition Members have made the point that the provisions in the clause will, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, reduce the CSA to chaos--I think that that was the phrase that he used. However, the 1991 Act envisaged an extension--which was abandoned in 1995--to its handling of private cases once the benefit cases had been dealt with. The original purpose of the Act that we seek to amend was to do what hon. Members have said that we should not do now.
<P>
In 1998, 8,136 cases were put before the courts--about 160 cases a week. I doubt that the provision in the clause will cause a huge breakdown in the CSA. Its current work load is 7,000 cases a week, approximately 350,000 new assessments a year. Not all those 8,136 cases would go to the CSA. It is fair to assume that some would retain their private arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Lait:</B> Does the Minister agree that whatever percentage of those 8,000 or so cases came to the CSA would be among the most complex, even under her simplified system? The reasoning behind the provision in the 1991 Act for court cases to come into the CSA was that that system was more complex and could deal with all the issues that my hon. Friends have raised about property, investment income and all the other complex financial arrangements that wealthy people tend to have.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I do not necessarily agree that all such cases will be the most complex. Private cases are merely those that do not have a benefit interest; some will be complex and some will be less complex. The hon. Lady should not therefore suggest that there will be a much higher level of complexity. I have come across many complex cases that are being dealt with by the CSA and the move towards simplicity is what many of us want.
<P>
The other reason why the clause is in its present form--to use the phrase of Baroness Hollis--is that it is not desirable to have large differences of principle between the two categories of cases. First, the CSA can never predict when a private case may move on to one of benefit. About 10 per cent. of the CSA's current case load, which totals about 1 million cases, are likely to move on or off benefit in a year. Non-resident parents would be faced with a fluctuating maintenance arrangement if they were moved on and off benefit. The present labour market means that they may be moved on and off benefit more frequently than they have been in the past. That will cause huge disruptions unless broadly similar settlements can be reached in the two sets of cases.
<P>
We are not imposing the jurisdiction of the CSA on all cases. As we stated in the White Paper, one of our aims is to make it available as a solution to all parents. We are not forcing parents who are making private arrangements to contact the CSA, but merely making the CSA solutions available to those who decide to use them after a set time. A period of one year and a two-month cooling-off period has been mentioned to allow lawyers and the two parties to make another private agreement, after which time the CSA solutions will be available to them. If agreements were made and continued with, it would be unlikely that either party would want to unpick them unless they were thought to be unfair.
<P>
It is up to the parties to ensure that they reach fair agreement at the beginning. If they know that they can use the CSA solutions 14 months later, that should focus their minds when making the arrangements to ensure that they reach a stable conclusion. No one will be forced into the ambit of the CSA unless one or other of those who made the arrangement in the first place feels that something is wrong with it.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 59 to 61, 71, 72, 87, 88, 97 and 98 all relate to the way in which applications under section 4 of the Child Support Act 1991 and other maintenance arrangements interact. The clause makes changes to the child support scheme, so that more separated parents can apply for child support. That will allow parents who have a court order for maintenance, made after the reforms are implemented and have been in place for a year, to apply for a child support calculation instead.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 60, 71, 87, 97 and 98 would prevent any parent who has a written maintenance agreement or a maintenance order from making an application to the CSA for child support calculations. That would reverse the effect of the clause and return the position to the current status quo. That was never intended in the original Act and we intend to make CSA calculations available. It would not be right to prevent parents who have such agreements from using the services of the agency. If the written agreement has broken down, what else can the parents do? How can that be fair to parents with care or to their children? We must remember that courts can make maintenance orders only when both parents consent.
<P>
The clause introduces a one-year waiting period for parents who have a new court order for child maintenance before either parent can apply for a child support calculation. New orders will be any court orders made after the reformed child support scheme has been introduced. That is why clause 2 does not have a huge work load implication.
<P>
The one-year waiting period is to ensure that those applying to the CSA have time fully to consider the practical effects on their lives of any order made by the court before taking any further decisions. Amendment No. 59 would reduce that waiting period to six months, which would allow one parent to apply to the CSA before the now order had had a chance to bed in and before both sides had become familiar with its practical effects. We decided that 12 months was a reasonable time to allow the new maintenance order to bed in--after all, the court can make new orders only when the parents consent. We believe that six months is too short.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 61 would impose a new requirement on the Secretary of State to decide applications from parents with care who think that a written maintenance agreement is improper because it was made under duress or following undue influence by virtue of amendment No. 60. I believe that amendment No. 61 is well-intentioned, but it would be extremely difficult to operate effectively. It would entail agency staff making very difficult and contentious judgments about whether the parent with care had been forced into making the agreement. We want a simple and straightforward child support scheme; such a scheme has no place for the difficult discretionary decisions proposed by the amendment.
<P>
It is right that parents who can make private arrangements for the maintenance of their children which do not require the support of the benefit system can continue to do so, and the Bill allows that. However, as several of my hon. Friends said, in drawing up such arrangements lawyers and the courts should have regard to the child support rates; that is the entire aim of this part of the Bill. Otherwise, difficulties would occur as parents with care moved on and off benefits and non-resident parents found themselves faced with different levels of maintenance assessment.
<P>
By giving either parent access to the CSA after a year if the existing arrangements break down, we will ensure that in future, private maintenance arrangements are set in the shadow of the child support system. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar was worried about that phrase, but there must be due regard to the system that the Bill will bring into being. We believe that that is a sensible compromise. It stops short of removing altogether the ability to set maintenance from the courts but at the same time it opens up the CSA's calculation and collection service where court-based payment arrangements have broken down.

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The hon. Lady is trying to claim that at the moment lawyers do not take sufficient cognisance of people who might move on to benefit. I can only quote Mr. Pirrie's words on page 98 of the Select Committee report
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"As the lawyers negotiate the settlement they look at whether this is going to become a benefits case. If I am negotiating a settlement and I see that my opposite number, representing the wife (with the children) is going to drop on to benefits, I am not going to move away from the CSA figures. I would be crazy to, because what happens is I agree a low figure and pay more capital and then lo and behold a year later she is on benefits and my client, the husband, suing me because his maintenance has increased."
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They already follow the CSA figures when they deal with clients who might fall on to benefits.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> We believe that they should follow the CSA rates when dealing with all cases.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Why?
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> Because 15 per cent., 20 per cent. and 25 per cent. of net income is the process that we are putting into place for children.
<P>
New clause 7 would extend the courts'jurisdiction to any child support case where the parent with care is not on income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance, as long as the court is considering spousal maintenance, a property or capital settlement. It would require the court, where it has jurisdiction, to base the order for child maintenance on the child support rates, departing from them only if it was in the child's interests.
<P>
New clause 8 is consequential on new clause 7 and would provide that non-resident parents discharge their responsibilities under the Act if they make payments under orders made in accordance with new clause 7. In effect, that would create a parallel jurisdiction, with parents unclear as to who would best arrange their affairs on separation. It would also give the court wider powers than the Bill proposes to depart from the normal child support rates, thus creating a two-tier system with one tier for the rich and one for the poor. That could also lead to difficulties when the parent with care moved on to benefits and the CSA applied the standard percentage rates to the non-resident parent.
<P>
We believe that the child support rates provide the right level of support for children. Other financial arrangements should be made in the light of those rates, and I do not understand what is wrong with that. The amendment would prevent the arrangements that we suggest, and I urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew George:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that response. However, I am not persuaded generally, and I believe that the Government should review the matter. I have proposed an arrangement under which the child maintenance support level would be considerably higher than it would be under the CSA formula. At a later stage, the non-resident parent could discuss the matter with the CSA. Anomalies in the clause remain, and Opposition Members have made some pertinent points that should be reviewed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pickles:</B> I am disappointed in the Under-Secretary's response. It is broadly agreed that lawyers should have access to CSA figures. That unites hon. Members of all parties, and is clear. She does not seem to have entirely understood what we are discussing. I would have been embarrassed to have written that the amendment would result in two systems, one for the rich and one for the poor, and I do not believe that, if I were the Under-Secretary, I would have read it out from my brief. That is a complete misunderstanding. We genuinely believe that the provision will damage the system and allow less money to be given to children, and that the Government are making a mistake. I should therefore like to press the amendment to a Division.
