Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):</b> On a
point of order, Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to be here this
morning on the last day before the Whitsun recess. Speaking for myself,
I need a haircut and a holiday, although not necessarily in that order.
My compliments to you, Mr. Hood, for stealing the hands of
time and correcting the clock. It will help us to a great
extent.</div><a name="08052265000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to update the Committee. I undertook to publish amendments
relating to residents and non-domiciles for a future debate. I said
that they would be laid as soon as they were available and that full
explanatory notes would be provided for each one. To provide the
maximum opportunity for scrutiny before the debate, I propose to table
each amendment formally when it has been prepared rather than release
all the amendments at the same time. They will then be published on Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs website to ensure that the widest
possible audience can be informed of their contents before they are
discussed in Committee. If the amendments are ready for release during
the Whitsun recess, I shall place them on HMRC website in draft, having
circulated them to the Committee, and then table them during the week
commencing 2 June when the House returns from the recess. I anticipate
that that will happen with the first such amendment, which is to
paragraphs 37 and 38 of schedule
7.</div><a name="08052265000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000207"></a>The

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule

of basic rate of income tax: transitional relief for gift aid
charities</div><a name="08052265000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
proposed, </i>That this schedule be the Nineteenth schedule to the
Bill.</div><a name="08052265000029"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000209"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> The schedule introduces a provision for HMRC to
make payments to charities in respect of donations that they receive
that are subject to the gift aid scheme. It is to be called the gift
aid supplement. The measure is intended to address the consequences of
the reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p. An
essential part of the symmetry of the arrangements of reliefs and
allowances against income tax is that, when the income tax rate goes
down, the value of the relief goes down. For my part, I certainly
regard it as an important principle that tax reliefs are given against
income tax, so when the rate reduces, the value of the relief will
reduce.</div><a name="08052265000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Increasingly,
however, we are debating the effect of reliefs, such as the impact on
pension savings when the value of the tax relief is reduced. I am sure
that other hon. Members who have a pension provision that they fund
themselves will have had the same experience as me, and have received a
letter from their pension provider telling them that because the income
tax rate has gone down, their contribution will have to increase to
maintain the benefit level.</div>
<a name="08052265000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the
difficulties for charities were identified when the reduction in the
basic rate of income tax was announced in the 2007 Budget, they are
particularly vulnerable to the loss of income arising from the
reduction. When that reduction was announced, it was also announced
that there would be a thorough review of the take-up of gift aid. The
implication&#151;what was probably in the mind of the Government at
that time&#151;was a recognition that charities would face a loss of
income. In a rational world, income tax-paying donors would give a
little more, because they were being taxed a little less, and thus
would compensate for the loss of the gift aid tax relief. In the real
world, however, people do not make those fine-tuned adjustments.
Certainly, when people are under pressure financially in other areas
they are unlikely to make that adjustment. The thorough review of
take-up was perhaps seen as a way of squaring the circle. If more
effective use could be made of the gift aid scheme so that more of the
money donated to charities was channelled through it, perhaps there was
a way to increase the amount of income on which gift aid relief was
claimed and thus compensate charities for the cut in the basic rate of
income tax.</div>
<a name="08052265000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
consultation paper was published last summer and the view of the
charitable sector is that there was not a great deal of meat in it. The
sector responded by making various proposals, some of which were quite
radical, about how the gift aid scheme might operate. None of those
proposals, unless the Minister tells us differently today, has been
taken up by the Government, who have no stated intention of doing so.
The proposals included, for example, introducing some form of automatic
refund gift aid contributions using an averaging process.</div>
<a name="08052265000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The announcement in the 2008
Budget of the measures in schedule 19 reflects the failure of the
process that was kicked off in the 2007 Budget, to try 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column355" />Column number: 355</div>to find another way of compensating charities by improving the uptake of
gift aid. It would be useful if the Financial Secretary made it clear
to the Committee whether it is still the Government&#146;s objective
in the long term to improve the take-up of gift aid in charitable
giving, and whether what we have before us is, in fact, the
Government&#146;s medium-term solution. The schedule introduces a
transitional relief, whereby charities will be compensated directly
from HMRC for the reduced gift aid rebate and thus they will be kept
whole, as it were, for a period of three years. That prompts the
question, what happens after three years? Is that relief simply
intended as a stop-gap measure? One or two cynics have remarked that
three years gets us safely to the other side of the next general
election. Is the period of three years related in a logical and
explainable way to a longer-term strategy to address the underlying
problem that has been created? Members of the Committee probably all
agree that the best way to do that is to increase the take-up of gift
aid so that charities no longer have to rely on the supplementary
rebate that compensates for the missing income. Some indication from
the Minister on the long-term thinking would be greatly
appreciated.</div><a name="08052265000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal in the Bill was welcomed by the charitable sector. If you were
told, Mr. Hood, that you would be deprived of X per cent. of
your income, you might worry about it for a year, but if you were then
told that somebody would give it back to you for three years, your
initial reaction would be one of gratitude. Perhaps only after two
years would you start to think about what would happen after the three
years. To some extent, this announcement has taken the pressure off the
search for a longer-term solution to improve the take-up of gift aid or
find another way of mending the hole in the fundraising of charitable
organisations. We should try collectively to ensure that we do not
allow this measure to distract attention from the underlying
issue.</div><a name="08052265000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a specific but important question on schedule 19. Paragraph 1(5)
will introduce condition D. There are four conditions on the receipt of
gift aid supplement. Condition D is that the claim by the charity is
allowed, which strikes the Opposition and most people in the charitable
sector as rather an odd condition. It implies a degree of discretion by
HMRC on whether to allow a claim by a charity. It is not a usual
provision for an entitlement written into law that the claim to the
entitlement is to be &#147;allowed&#148;, as if by some
discretionary
process.</div><a name="08052265000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not tabled an amendment to delete condition D because I would like
to hear from the Minister how it is to be interpreted. Perhaps there is
a technical reason for its inclusion, and the Minister can put on the
record an assurance that properly made claims for gift aid supplement
by charities will automatically be allowed, and that this is a mere
piece of bureaucratic gobbledegook, not a real test implying that
charities have to satisfy some additional conditionality that HMRC may
introduce at an official level. That is the key issue that I wish to
raise with regard to the schedule. If the Minister addresses it and the
more general question about the medium-term solution, I should be very
grateful.</div><a name="08052265000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052265000210"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I welcome the comments we
have just heard, which were sensible and helpful. Going slightly wider,
it seems that there is no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column356" />Column number: 356</div>overall rationale for how we work tax relief for charities. In effect,
we say that if a person is taxed at the standard rate we will refund
the tax to the charity, but if they are taxed at the higher rate, we
will refund it to the individual. That is something that we have got
used to, and it is not an unreasonable position in principle. However,
as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said, that system leads
to uncertainty when the standard rate moves down or up. I wonder if, in
the longer term, we should look at decoupling this and having a
standard deduction that does not necessarily alter as the standard rate
moves up and
down.</div><a name="08052265000164"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div>
<a name="08052265000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000211"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b><b class="B"> </b>Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that
that would lead to the decoupling of the concept that charitable giving
is something that an individual can do out of their gross income As I
made clear, I attach a lot of importance to the idea that certain
things, such as charitable giving and pension contributions, can be
done by an individual from their gross income, before the tax man has
his
share.</div><a name="08052265000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000212"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> That is an interesting point, but there is an
essential difference between pension contributions and charitable ones.
Pension contributions are, in effect, deferred income. If we, as
individuals, have more immediately available income because tax rates
go down, it is a rational and individual choice as to how much of that
we choose to put into our pension funds. Whether we do, or do not, we
are profiting directly. Charitable contributions are slightly
different. Topping up our charitable contributions requires a separate
decision. If we do not, do so the default position is that we profit
but the charity loses. In the case of pension funds, we profit either
way.</div><a name="08052265000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Basically, I
welcome the principle that we need to consider the issues more widely.
I am sure that the Financial Secretary will respond more fully to the
specific point made by the hon. Gentleman, but HMRC has to protect
itself against the possibility that the charity is unknowingly
submitting a claim that is not valid&#151;for instance, because the
person who made a contribution to the charity is not a standard rate
taxpayer.</div><a name="08052265000041"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000213"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> This has been a helpful, brief discussion. All
the proposals made during the consultation were considered and
discussed across government. I met a number of organisations that made
representations. The proposals are complex, requiring a full assessment
of any risks to the current system and the funds that flow to charities
through it. We are continuing to develop our thinking on gift aid, but
at present our priority is to protect the status of this popular tax
relief, rather than risk losing the benefits of the
system.</div><a name="08052265000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">We carried out
a full and open consultation. As one might expect in such a broad area,
views vary widely across the charitable sector. We responded to issues
on which there was consensus: transitional relief, the provision of
better guidance&#151;and there has been a lot of effort from HMRC to
offer a simpler approach, and tools to help charities drive up gift
aid. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe, the
consultation showed that opinions on higher-rate gift 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column357" />Column number: 357</div>aid varied widely, with some people believing that the relief should go
directly to the charity, and some people believing that basic rate
relief should also go to donors. There was a wide divergence of
opinions.</div><a name="08052265000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
transitional period is a three-year breathing space to allow charities
to adjust to the change in the basic rate tax without it affecting
their existing expenditure plans. During that period, charities can
drive up more gift aid income with support from the rest of the gift
aid package announced in the Budget. In addition, we will work with
donors and charities to develop an understanding of donor behaviour,
using that to inform further thinking about gift aid&#151;again, in
order to continue driving up the
take-up.</div><a name="08052265000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked specifically about
condition D, and posed a fair question. The transitional relief will be
due to a charity where only the underlying donation and claim meet the
requirement of the gift aid scheme&#151;it is an application.
Condition D in paragraph 1 ensures that transitional relief will not be
payable when the underlying claim is invalid. A claim for gift aid may
be invalid for a number of reasons&#151;for example, the claim form
may not contain the required information. HMRC cannot be expected to
pay the aid in those circumstances and it would be unsustainable to
make transitional relief payable, but not the underlying gift aid, in
such
circumstances</div><a name="08052265000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Without
the provision, if donor behaviour remained as it is today, it has been
estimated that losses for charities would be significant across the
whole sector, running to more than &#163;100 million next year. The
amount received by charities from the supplement will be proportionate
to their eligible gift aid claims. For every &#163;1 of gift aid that
is donated, charities will receive 3.2p in supplements, so the
charities will continue to receive 28.2p in total for every &#163;1
donated under gift
aid.</div><a name="08052265000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals in
the Budget were widely welcomed by the sector. I acknowledge that, for
some, there was a feeling of relief that they could have certainty
going forward. There is continuing dialogue with the sector, which was
as keen as we were to maintain the nature of gift aid. That formed the
basis of much our discussions, and I am sure that there will be a
continuing dialogue in the area.</div>
<a name="08052265000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000214"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I shall respond to the Minister&#146;s specific
comments on paragraph 1(5). I understand the thinking behind it, but I
ask her to consider the language. If she is seeking to say, in that
provision, that the underlying claim must be valid, that is already
taken care of, because condition A in paragraph 1(2) is that
a</div> <a name="08052265000154"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;gift aid donation is
made&#148;.</div> <a name="08052265000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to the
definitions in paragraph 7, a gift aid donation
means</div><a name="08052265000155"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a gift which is a
qualifying donation&#148;.</div><a name="08052265000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
she is telling us that the gift aid claim has to be properly made, we
understand that as
well.</div><a name="08052265000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
word &#147;allowed&#148; implies a degree of discretion. The
Minister, perhaps unintentionally, has not confirmed for the record
that a valid claim is automatically allowed and that there is no

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000217"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I have a brief question on clause 51. It appears
from the wording that the clause seeks to close an unintended loophole
against devious mischief that the Government, the Treasury or HMRC have
spotted. Would the Exchequer Secretary explain to the Committee what
has given rise to the clause? What mischief has occurred that requires
the provision to be introduced and, unusually, to be treated as if it
has always had effect?</div>
<a name="08052265000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000218"></a>The
Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Angela Eagle):</b> I am
happy to explain to the matter to the Committee. I would call it an
unintended kink, rather than mischief. I do not think that there is any
blame intended or that underhand behaviour has gone on that has led to
the clause. My brief refers to a &#147;minor deficiency&#148;, but
I think that quite a good way of putting it is that there is an
unintended kink in the community investment tax relief scheme
legislation that could prevent a bank from obtaining tax relief under
the scheme if it invested money with one of its own customers. The
Committee may not be aware that the scheme is intended to encourage
companies and individuals to invest in community development finance
institutions, which provide finance to enterprises in economically
disadvantaged communities, helping to reduce economic disparities
throughout the UK.</div><a name="08052265000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
tax relief is generous. It is worth up to 25 per cent. of the
investment spread over five years, so it is right that the rules
restrict relief to cases in which there is genuine investment of new
money in the community development finance institution. There is no
relief if the investment is returned to the investor, for obvious
reasons, or if it is funded from money that originally came from the
community development finance
institution.</div><a name="08052265000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
obvious funding source for a community development finance institution
is its own bank, and the most obvious home for any funds raised by such
an institution for the period between raising the funds and investing
them in the enterprises that it wishes to finance is the same bank.
However, under the current rules, bank deposits made by a community
development finance institution in the course of its ordinary banking
transactions may reduce or eliminate the value of any relief available
to the bank in respect of investments made under the scheme. That is
the kink. It is not an intended result, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column359" />Column number: 359</div>because it means that to secure funding from its bank under the
community investment tax relief scheme, a community development finance
institution must in effect sever its existing business relationship
with its bank and re-establish that business elsewhere. That was not
intended when the scheme was put together, nor is it sensible. The
change, which is entirely beneficial to community development finance
institutions and banks, will have a retrospective effect, because an
unintended wrinkle in the structures has created an
anomaly.</div><a name="08052265000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000219"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I thank the Exchequer Secretary for her lucid
explanation. I am sorry if I detected mischief and underhand behaviour
where there is none. I am glad that she does not see mischief and
underhand behaviour in every kink in the arrangements. I have some
experience of dealing with predecessors of hers who often were more
inclined to see mischief and underhand behaviour wherever kinks
occurred in the tax code. Was the introduction of the clause prompted
by an instance of relief being denied to an institution, or has the
issue merely been flagged up and is being pre-emptively
resolved?</div><a name="08052265000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000220"></a>Angela

in that discussion. We realised that the points that were made had
merit, which is why the clause has been included in this year&#146;s

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): Thank you,
Mr. Hood. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
once again.</div>
<a name="08052265000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 53
ensures that anti-avoidance legislation applies fairly where a
partnership carrying on the business of leasing plant or machinery
transfers that business to a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column360" />Column number: 360</div>single company. As such, we welcome it. It corrects schedule 10 of the
Finance Act 2006, which addressed a concern about how leasing
arrangements could be used as a tax-avoidance mechanism, incurring
losses in the early years and then transferring them so that there was
a permanent deferral of tax. The mechanism ensured that sellers would
face a charge, with relief being provided to the purchasers of the
leasing company. That worked well in a partnership-to-partnership
arrangement but, due to various technical reasons and definitions, it
did not work for a partnership-to- single company arrangement, as there
would be a charge to the departing partners but it would not deliver
relief to the successor company.</div>
<a name="08052265000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">During a
debate on the Finance Bill two years ago, a concern about the internal
restructuring of partnerships was raised in relation to paragraph 23 of
schedule 10. Whereas paragraph 13 of schedule 10 of the Finance Act
2006 contained an exemption from the regime for a group of companies,
there was no equivalent provision regarding a group of partnerships.
With a further two years&#146; experience following the 2006 Act, and
given that wrinkle regarding partnerships, will the Minister say
whether any concerns have arisen on that issue and whether any group of
partnerships involved in an internal restructuring has been caught,
perhaps inadvertently, within the regime although that was not the
original intention? Subject to that query, we have no other concerns
about the clause.</div>
<a name="08052265000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000223"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It was acknowledged in the pre-Budget report that
the schedule was having a detrimental effect on some transactions where
there is no risk of a tax loss. It is difficult to deal with such
transactions without opening up new opportunities for tax loss, and any
action that we take must be taken in close consultation with the
industry. We intend to do that, and we are looking closely at the
problem.</div> <a name="08052265000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked some thoughtful questions.
The legislation in schedule 10 dealing with partnerships is complex
because the partnership structures used by companies are complex, and
the schedule had to deal with those complexities. Where a business is
carried on by companies in partnership, the charge and relief are
allocated to the partner in proportion to their shares in the
partnership profits. That gives the right result as long as the
business continues to be carried on by a partnership, but not where a
business is transferred from a partnership to a single company. In that
situation, the selling partners are charged for tax, but there is no
mechanism for delivering relief to the successor company because it is
not a partner.</div><a name="08052265000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
generally, clause 53 makes minor amendments to the anti-avoidance
provisions introduced by schedule 10 of the 2006 Act. A minor defect
means that the schedule does not work fairly when the whole trade is
transferred by a partnership to a single company. The clause will
ensure that schedule 10 operates fairly, even in that unusual
situation. Furthermore, to ensure that no one can have been adversely
affected, the changes introduced by the clause will be deemed always to
have had effect. That degree of retrospectivity has been warmly
welcomed.</div> <a name="08052265000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

share the desire to get through some of the clauses as quickly as
possible, but I am grateful that we can turn to amendment No. 133. With
your permission, Mr. Hood, I will take this opportunity also
to make one or two remarks about clause 54 in general, as that would,
from my perspective, avoid the need for a full stand part
debate.</div> <a name="08052265000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The objective
of clause 54 is to ensure that credit for any foreign tax paid on trade
or professional earnings is no more than the UK income tax due on the
same earnings. That is not an unreasonable objective, but we query the
element of retrospectivity. However, I do not want to overstate that,
and we will debate retrospective legislation at greater length when we
discuss clause 55, which deals with a much more serious issue. The
element of retrospectivity as regards clause 54 relates to the fact
that subsection (4) applies to
the</div><a name="08052265000156"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;payment of foreign
tax on or after 6 April 2008, or...income received on or after
that date in respect of which foreign tax has been deducted at
source.&#148;</div>
<a name="08052265000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is retrospective
in nature. An individual might have invested in long-term,
income-generating assets, such as overseas properties, on the basis of
the existing tax position but then find that they fall within the new
regime very quickly&#151;after 6 April 2008&#151;and therefore get
a different tax treatment than that which they anticipated when they
made the investment. Amendment No. 133 proposes that we should instead
consider the date on which the relevant transaction was entered into.
If it was made after 12 March 2008, it should fall under the regime set
out in clause 54, but if not, the person should continue to benefit
from the existing provisions.</div>
<a name="08052265000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment was tabled, in a
slightly probing manner, for two reasons. First, and most importantly,
there is a danger of creating a parallel system with two different tax
regimes, the application of which would depend upon when the
transaction was entered into, and that would create unwelcome
complexity. Secondly, the Government argue that the changes confirm the
existing practice but set aside doubts that have been expressed about
how foreign tax credit is calculated following recent case law. I will
take the words in the explanatory notes at face value, but perhaps the
Minister could elaborate on the existing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column362" />Column number: 362</div>case law so that we can assess the level of those doubts, which can
sometimes be more substantial than the Government are prepared to
concede. I should like to test their position on that. We should tread
carefully where there is an element of retrospectivity in legislation,
and the onus is on the Government to justify the provisions that they
have made.</div><a name="08052265000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
objective of the clause is to ensure that relief for foreign tax is
given once and once only. There can be circumstances where the
equivalent does not apply. For example, a UK investor in an overseas
asset such as a US limited liability company might find that he was
liable to tax overseas but would not benefit from any kind of relief.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants has raised that point with the
Treasury, giving the example of a UK business that has an interest in a
US LLC. Under current law, no relief is available in the UK for tax
paid in the US unless the LLC&#146;s income is distributed,
notwithstanding that the UK shareholder of the LLC will be subject to
US tax on the LLC&#146;s income as it arises&#151;in other words,
irrespective of whether it is distributed. Has the Minister considered
that?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000225"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Before I call the Minister to respond, I
should point out that it would be convenient to have the stand part
debate at the same time as the debate on the
amendment.</div><a name="08052265000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000226"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> The ICA wrote to us with several detailed
requests for changes, but I do not want to be drawn into those as they
are outside the scope of the clause. However, I would be happy to write
to the hon. Gentleman with details of the consideration that is being
given to those proposals and circulate that correspondence to members
of the Committee.</div><a name="08052265000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause does not affect the entitlement to credit for any foreign tax
paid before 6 April 2008, so it does not have the retrospective effect
that the hon. Gentleman fears. It re-establishes a rule for foreign tax
credit that has always been the accepted method prior to recent case
law. I shall explain that in more detail in a moment. This is the
internationally accepted method for calculating credit relief, and
there has never been any basis for believing that the UK Government
should allow unrestricted foreign tax credit. In that context, there is
no justification for a change that would add substantial complexity and
uncertainty to the rule. That is what the amendment would do, although
I appreciate that it was tabled in a slightly probing
fashion.</div>
<a name="08052265000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have done nothing to encourage people to plan on the
assumption that high rates of foreign tax will be subsidised by the
Exchequer. We have always made it clear that the purpose of foreign tax
credit is to eliminate double taxation and not to go any further than
that. The clause merely restores that long-established view of how the
law on tax credits applies. The case that has been mentioned involved
Legal and General; it was a corporation tax case heard in 2006. The
corporation tax position was restored by legislation in 2005, and the
clause makes a parallel change for income tax. There is no
justification for delaying the implementation of the clause, as the
amendment proposes. That would introduce considerable complexity and
uncertainty whereby different rules would apply to different 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div>foreign tax payments. The amendment would mean that for assets or
contracts that fell outside the scope of the clause, foreign tax credit
would be unrestricted, putting at risk tax due from wholly UK-based
activities.</div>
<a name="08052265000166"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="08052265000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give
some background to the clause, since we will have, as you have
indicated, Mr. Hood, the main debate now. The effect of the
clause is to restore the way of calculating foreign tax credit that was
generally accepted before the recent case law. The rule that the clause
re-establishes is endorsed by the OECD and overwhelmingly used by those
countries that give foreign tax credit against foreign earnings. The
clause amends how the maximum credit for foreign tax is calculated,
when the foreign tax is paid on trade or professional income of an
individual. The purpose of the clause is to ensure that the credit that
we give for foreign tax is sufficient to eliminate double taxation,
which is a risk. It does not go any
further.</div><a name="08052265000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
particular, the clause prevents foreign tax credit being set against
income tax due on UK earnings. For example, if a musician earns income
from a performance abroad, he or she is likely to have to pay foreign
tax on those earnings. The foreign tax can be set against the UK tax
due in respect of the same earnings&#151;those attributable to the
foreign performance&#151;but should not be set against income tax due
on earnings from performances in the UK during the same tax year. The
clause enables the year&#146;s income to be subdivided, so that each
activity that gives rise to foreign income is ring-fenced from other
activity for the purpose of calculating credit due for foreign tax
paid. The clause also ensures a result that is fair to the taxpayer,
while placing a necessary constraint on credit for foreign tax to
prevent it from spilling over into other activity, including wholly
UK-based parts of the
trade.</div><a name="08052265000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would require separate identification of the foreign tax paid
by an individual in respect of contracts, arrangements, assets and so
on, entered into or acquired before 12 March&#151;Budget
day&#151;this year. That foreign tax would be given as a credit
against income tax no matter how much or how little UK tax arose out of
the contract or asset. That would mean that foreign tax would reduce UK
tax on other earnings unrelated to the foreign tax payment, including
wholly UK-based activity.</div>
<a name="08052265000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment adds complexity
and is unjustified. I appreciate that it was moved in a probing and
questioning way. Nobody should expect the Exchequer to subsidise rates
of foreign tax that exceed its own, or to allow foreign tax to reduce
income tax arising on UK earnings. That is a reasonable position, and I
hope that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire will accept it
and withdraw the amendment. If he does not, we will have to
resist.</div><a name="08052265000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000227"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> With respect to the Financial Secretary, there is
an element of retrospectivity here, in that transactions entered into
under one arrangement will be treated differently now, under the
provision. That is not the clearest or most obvious example of
retrospectivity&#151;we will come to one in a moment. None the less,
I recognise her argument. She referred to the Legal and General case of
2006, which she said had been dealt with as far as corporation tax was
concerned 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>in 2005. It appears that the Treasury was at least prescient in 2005. I
imagine that those were various stages of the
action.</div><a name="08052265000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000228"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It was exactly that. Clearly, Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs was aware of that, and the dispute
arose some time before. The law was fixed, and would have always been
so, because it was never intended to work as was
implied.</div><a name="08052265000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000229"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I am grateful for that. It raises a concern that we
will come back to in a
moment.</div><a name="08052265000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000230"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> Will my hon. Friend reflect on what the Financial
Secretary has just said? As I understand it, she said that a court case
was in progress with Legal and General, a pretty powerful organisation.
HMRC obviously realised that the law was defective because in 2005 the
Government amended the law to close the defect. If I understand her
correctly, the Government allowed the case to be pursued through the
courts at public expense, only to be defeated in a way in which they
knew they would be defeated. If they did not know that, they would not
have changed the law in 2005. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is a
perverse course of action for the Government to have
followed?</div><a name="08052265000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000231"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> I think two points have been raised. First, my hon.
Friend has raised the point about the interrelationship between
specific cases in case law and statutes. We will return to that point
in a moment. The Committee may want to reflect on the Padmore case of
1987, which provoked a change in the law. At least that change in
statute was without prejudice to judicial decisions being made in the
matter before the change in law was announced. It seems a rather
strange position to change the statute in the middle of a case. It goes
against certain aspects of the rule of
law.</div><a name="08052265000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another point
worth noting, which we will also come back to, is that it appears that
this matter was on the radar of HMRC and the Treasury in 2005. Given
the way in which these cases tend to work over several years, it was
probably on their radar in 2004, if not earlier. If that is the case,
why are we bringing in this legislation that has an element of
retrospectivity in
2008?</div><a name="08052265000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052265000232"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): Does
this exchange of views not sum up the concerns that my hon. Friend has
put forward about retrospection? If a statute is changed halfway
through a case, one can understand it if it is aimed to overcome
loopholes in future. In such an instance, it is all the more important
that there is no sense of retroactive intent for the very reasons that
my hon. Friend has set
out.</div><a name="08052265000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000233"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> There are concerns about retrospective legislation.
I do not take an absolutist line on the issue, but to minimise those
concerns it is at least reasonable to expect the Treasury to produce
legislation at the earliest opportunity. It is not reasonable to fail
to address an issue and to leave some ambiguity within the law for
three or four years, knowing that one can come back to it at a later
date.</div>

example because, to be fair, it talks about income received after 6
April 2008. My concern is that some transactions will have been entered
into before that time. A transaction could have been entered into
between the conclusion of the Legal and General case and 6 April on an
understanding that that case had set the law. The interested parties
would then find that the Government have come back and said that the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000236"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I say at the outset that we accept entirely the
need for the Government to legislate against tax avoidance. We
appreciate that the provision is designed to prevent tax avoidance by
United Kingdom taxpayers on income from foreign partnerships using Isle
of Man or Channel Islands partnerships. It is based on an
interpretation of the 1987 rule that was introduced following the
Padmore
case.</div><a name="08052265000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
support the Government&#146;s efforts to deal with tax avoidance, but
we still believe that, in principle, tax changes should apply
prospectively and not retrospectively as set out under the measure. It
has been the theme not only of some clauses this morning&#151;it has
been growing over the previous two Finance Bills, whereby the
Government are making a determined effort to use retrospectivity as a
tool for tax avoidance. While it was implemented in respect of a few
things to begin with, it now seems to be creeping in in a new way. We
are worried particularly by the effect of subsection (4), which will
treat the new provisions as &#147;always having had
effect&#148;.</div><a name="08052265000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a result of the change, established tax law that has been on the
statute book since 1970 has instantaneously 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column366" />Column number: 366</div>been rewritten. Rewriting of legislation in such a way does not meet the
legitimate expectation test. It sends out a damaging signal about the
stability of the UK tax system, whereby business transactions made
under one set of laws can then become subject to a different tax
outcome at a later date due to the retrospective change in the rules.
It is for that reason that the amendment would remove the
measure.</div> <a name="08052265000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although we
understand that the clause is directed primarily at transactions
involving Isle of Man or Channel Islands partnerships, the European
Union law principle of legitimate expectation needs to be respected.
Taxpayers are entitled to understand the implications of a transaction
that they enter into. Treating the provision as &#147;always having
had effect&#148; runs contrary to Parliament&#146;s intent over the
past 30 years, which is to lay down rules whereby the tax effect of
particular transactions can be changed or advance warning can be given
of a change in the tax treatment in clearly identified
circumstances.</div><a name="08052265000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the late 1980s, an approach was adopted to counter a legal decision
that had gone against the Revenue and which the Government wished to
reverse. Although the new law was stated to &#147;always having had
effect&#148;, it did not influence judicial decisions made before the
new law was announced. A more recent approach was the statement made by
the then Paymaster General to the effect that legislation would be
introduced and be effective from 2 December 2004 in relation to what
the Government consider to be unreasonable tax-avoidance schemes
involving employment
income.</div><a name="08052265000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following
that, in one of its report, the Treasury Committee said:</div>
<a name="08052265000157"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The Inland Revenue
should, without jeopardising their position, publish a paper setting
out their thinking on the principles which will guide the way they
implement&#148;</div><a name="08052265000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">the then
Paymaster General&#146;s announcement. Such a paper has never been
published, but we believe that the philosophy underlying retrospective
or retroactive legislation should now be examined in conjunction with
the current move to introduce principle-based legislation. If the
underlying purpose behind legislation or an area of tax law is
articulated clearly, a taxpayer who respects that purpose should have
certainty about the tax outcome of their particular transaction. If the
underlying policy is to be changed, then any change should have effect
only in relation to future transactions.</div>
<a name="08052265000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, the application of
the legitimate expectation test to this provision should be that any
amendment applies only from the date that the change was
announced&#151;Budget day 2008. In respect of periods before that
date, if HMRC believes that these interpretations are based on a wrong
view of the law, they should be challenged through the courts. We
believe an appropriate modus operandi should be agreed by the Treasury,
HMRC and the representative bodies and then published for the benefit
of all
taxpayers.</div><a name="08052265000167"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="08052265000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hope&#151;and the other amendments in this group have a similar
theme&#151;is that the Government will live up to some of their
promises, particularly in respect of the then Paymaster
General&#146;s announcement that we would get a paper of principles.
It would enable us to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div>understand this policy of retrospectivity, which commenced a few years
ago and is almost going full steam ahead without that paper. The
purpose of the amendment is to bring the matter to a head so that by
the time we get to Report the paper that was announced a few years ago
will have been published. We will then be able to judge the resultant
clauses that the Government want to introduce in this Bill against that
set of published
principles.</div><a name="08052265000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000237"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> Whereas on the previous clause we made our points
in a probing manner, we do so here with much greater force. I associate
myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall. The
retrospective nature of the clause is deeply troubling. We fully share
the Government&#146;s concern about the issue that it is trying to
address. There is a problem with the arrangements and it is perhaps
more than just a kink in the system, as the Economic Secretary put it.
Trading profits derived from UK land are being received tax free by UK
residents and domiciled individuals because of schemes involving the
establishment of offshore trusts, specifically in the Isle of
Man.</div> <a name="08052265000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The existing
legislation appears to deal with the issue where the UK residents or
domiciled individuals are partners in the relevant offshore funds, but
it does not seem to work where the partners are trusts and the UK
individuals are benefiting from the arrangement. There is not a problem
with trying to address that point, but there is a point of principle
here. The proposal essentially states that the amendments contained in
the clause are to be treated as always having had effect. Either the
law exists or it does not. It is troubling when the Government state
that the law in the past is something because that is what they say it
is now. That is essentially what subsection (4) states.</div>
<a name="08052265000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is partly an issue of
simple democracy. It raises issues about EU law and legitimate
expectations. I shall not pursue that point, but the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall is right to raise it. In part, it cuts to the
question of the certainty and stability of the UK tax system. For
investors, the idea that UK tax law is likely to be changed
retrospectively is unattractive, and the UK is, for various reasons,
acquiring a reputation for having an uncertain and unstable tax system,
which is bad for the UK
economy.</div><a name="08052265000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
clause is but one example, but it has attracted considerable attention.
Indeed, one leading tax expert described it as unprecedented. The
Minister smiles, but I would be grateful if she gave some examples. She
may seek to give the example of the 1987 case, but distinctions can be
drawn with that. The 1987 provision, with regard to section 62 of the
Finance Act 1987, seeks to reverse the Padmore case, to which we have
referred. It says that the measure is deemed to have an effect except
in relation to any judicial decision made before the amending
legislation was announced. That is an important carve-out. It benefited
not only Mr. Padmore, but a number of other individuals who
had entered into arrangements and waited for the conclusion of the
judicial proceedings relating to Mr. Padmore. In doing so,
they benefited from that
carve-out.</div><a name="08052265000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">None
the less, concerns were raised, and understandably so. I think that
there was a certain amount of nervousness from the relevant Minister at
the time&#151;Norman Lamont, now Lord Lamont&#151;but it may well
be worth pointing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div>out the comments made by the Labour spokesman about what was then clause
62. He
said:</div><a name="08052265000158"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Parliament
should oppose retrospective legislation, for a number of reasons. The
principal democratic reason is that people are perfectly entitled to do
whatever the law permits them to do and that it is wrong afterwards to
make it unlawful.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 15 July 1987;

it?</div><a name="08052265000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000239"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> The Minister anticipates what I am about to say.
That Labour spokesman was one Tony Blair. He did not always make the
right comments, but on that issue he made a fair point.
<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> I know that the words of Tony Blair do not hold
much sway with those in the modern Labour party. That is a pity for
them as well as the
country.</div><a name="08052265000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is the issue of timing, which we touched on in relation to the previous
clause. I do not think that anyone would dispute that the provision is
retrospective. It goes back at least to 1987, so that is 21 years. As I
said earlier, there is the issue of HMRC and the Treasury not
necessarily acting terribly quickly when becoming aware of the
arrangements. The explanatory notes refer to the &#147;new avoidance
scheme&#148;. This is not the first time in these proceedings that I
have had to query the explanatory notes, but I am not sure that the
expression &#147;new avoidance scheme&#148; is entirely justified.
How long have the Government, whether through HMRC or the Treasury,
been aware of the arrangements? There is certainly evidence that HMRC
has been aware of the arrangements for some years. That raises the
question that I asked earlier. It is incumbent on the Government to act
reasonably quickly. If they become aware of a scheme that they do not
like but they sit on their hands and do nothing about it, and then some
years later say, &#147;Okay, we will introduce retrospective
legislation,&#148; that raises real concerns, because again there is
a continued period of uncertainty. I would press the Government to move
quickly if they saw something wrong, rather than sit on it for a long
time and then seek to introduce retrospective
legislation.</div><a name="08052265000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000240"></a>Mr.
Hammond:</b> I listened with great interest to my hon. Friend.
He seems to imply that there is a concept of reasonable expectation.
Where the Government are known to be aware of a practice and do not
move to close it down, is it not the case that taxpayers have a
reasonable expectation that the Government have chosen to tolerate that
course of action, and plan
accordingly?</div><a name="08052265000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000241"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> My hon. Friend makes an important point. It comes
back to legitimate expectation. If the Government do not act on
something, perhaps they have taken the view that they will not pursue
it. That argument has become stronger in recent years, as the
Government now benefit from a disclosure regime. Schemes that result in
people making tax savings are disclosed to HMRC, which has the
opportunity to review the situation and introduce legislation. We have
seen some examples of that in this and previous
Bills.</div><a name="08052265000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be worth returning to the Rees rules, which we discussed on
Tuesday. My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham discussed them with the
Economic Secretary, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>and there was some disagreement over interpretation. However one looks
as those rules, this provision does not comply with them. The rules set
out three circumstances that apply with retrospective tax legislation.
If anti-avoidance provisions are to be legislated, there should be a
clear warning in the House of Commons, where feasible a draft law
should be published as soon as possible&#151;to give effect to the
proposal&#151;and the clause should be incorporated in the next
available Finance Bill. I would be grateful if the Financial Secretary
could enlighten us on the extent to which that process has been
followed with these provisions. I am not sure that it has. The hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall referred to the Padmore case and the
previous Paymaster General&#146;s warning about employment-related
schemes going back to December 2004. When was the warning given and did
legislation follow as soon as possible? The Government are not on
particularly strong
ground.</div><a name="08052265000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not acceptable that the Government permit something that they
consider unacceptable to exist for some years, and then seek to
introduce retrospective legislation to address it. That is what we see
here. The comments from the professional bodies are universally
critical. The Chartered Institute of Taxation described the
retrospective nature as &#147;extreme&#148; and
&#147;unjustified&#148;, the Law Society described it as
&#147;wrong in principle&#148;, and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales said that</div>
<a name="08052265000159"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it sends out a very damaging
signal about the stability of the UK tax system&#148;.</div>
<a name="08052265000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the light of that&#151;I
stress that we are talking about the retrospective element and not the
intention of the clause&#151;we are deeply concerned about the
proposals. Hence, we have tabled amendments, which are in line with the
intention of the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall in amendment No.
132. Looking at that, we have stated that the provision should have
effect only from 6 April 2008. On reflection, we have been unduly harsh
on the Government and it would be reasonable to say 12 March 2008,
which was the date of the Budget as opposed to the beginning of the
financial year, but given that the proposal has a retrospective effect
of 21 years, I am not sure that one month here or there will make much
difference. If the Minister wants to reassure us and say that she will
introduce proposals to change the retrospective nature of the measure
to date it back to 12 March 2008, I would happily withdraw the
amendment and accept that as a fair compromise. I am being extremely
reasonable&#151;</div><a name="08052265000131"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000243"></a>Mr.
Gauke:</b> As always, as the Financial Secretary generously
concedes. The proposal raises serious questions, however, about the way
in which retrospective legislation is increasingly being used and we
have deep concerns about
that.</div><a name="08052265000168"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000244"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for South-West
Hertfordshire, I am not merely troubled, I am very alarmed by the
proposal, particularly when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>reading the words of subsection (4) that the hon. Member for South-East
Cornwall rightly
highlighted,</div><a name="08052265000160"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;are treated
as always having had
effect.&#148;.</div><a name="08052265000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
about the retrospective effect of legislation is not merely an academic
one, it reflects the potentially arbitrary and strong powers of HMRC. I
suspect that later in our deliberations we will discuss precisely how
those powers will operate, given the historical distinction between the
powers of the Inland Revenue and those of Customs and Excise. It is of
great concern that this particular wording is being used. I suspect
that the Financial Secretary will tell us that this is a narrow case,
but it sets something of a precedent. There are plentiful opportunities
for the Government to examine anti-avoidance&#151;we have a Finance
Bill every year. All the time that I have been in Parliament, in
Finance Bills year on year an inordinate amount of anti-avoidance
provision has come into place, largely as a result of the fact that we
have seen more complex arrangements being put in place. There are some
broad philosophical issues about the arbitrary nature of the
state&#146;s power, but also some practical issues that other hon.
Members have brought into play, about what this means for the stability
of Britain as a place to do business, particularly for overseas
investors.
</div><a name="08052265000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000245"></a>Jane
Kennedy:</b> It is important to challenge the suggestion that
this is an attempt to introduce retrospection as a thin end of what
hon. Members might quite properly fear is a large wedge. That is not
our intention. I understand that the 1987 legislation had retrospection
that was unlimited and in effect went back to about 1945. This is a
specific case where there has been serious abuse of the tax
system.</div>
<a name="08052265000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052265000246"></a>Mr.
Field:</b> As I understand it, the legislation 21 years ago
made it absolutely clear that it was not in any way trying to unravel
arrangements that had been put into place before the Padmore case of
1987, where as the wording of the subsection to which I referred, about
the legislation being treated as always having had effect, should have
alarm bells ringing in all of us as parliamentarians. We all know the
tremendous power of the state and, in particular, the tax authority,
and the detrimental effect that that is likely to have on external
investment. I want to make the more general points only; I know that
the specific points have been made from the Opposition Front Bench by
my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire. I think that my
hon. Friend the Member for Gosport also wishes to address the issue,
but I hope that the Minister will give it serious thought. It is in the
nature of having a Finance Bill every year that it allows the
Government to make annual changes looking forward, but to have a
retrospective effect with such stark words as those set out in
subsection (4) should alarm us all.</div>
<a name="08052265000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052265000247"></a><b class="B">Peter
Viggers</b> (Gosport) (Con): There is a place for
retrospective legislation. One of the better known cases was when
someone intelligent discovered just after the second world war that the
activities of the London fire brigade had been non-statutory and
illegal. Parliament, in its wisdom, therefore decided to legitimise the
London fire brigade, failing which matters such as compensation would
have been extremely complicated. There is a case for retrospective
legislation, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column371" />Column number: 371</div>should be reserved for those extreme, obvious cases. For the Revenue to
use retrospective legislation to mop up bits of revenue law is simply
unacceptable. If the Revenue is confident that the law has always been
as it is now intended to be stated, surely it should challenge the case
through the courts. The explanatory notes say:
</div><a name="08052265000161"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This clause
will put it beyond doubt that the legislation has always had that
effect.&#148;</div><a name="08052265000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">and the right
way to challenge that is through the courts.</div>
<a name="08052265000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand it, the Revenue
has demonstrated that it was aware of the practice, and that the
statement </div><a name="08052265000162"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
legislation has always had that
effect&#148;</div><a name="08052265000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">is
disingenuous. The Law Society has briefed me that paragraph 1660 of
HMRC&#146;s international tax handbook shows that HMRC had known for
some time about the way that tax professionals have been interpreting
section 858 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005. It
also mentions that the original legislation to reverse the Padmore
case, from which this tax planning arrangement derives, was
controversial because it too was
retrospective.</div><a name="08052265000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The way
that HMRC operates provides for a tax-avoidance disclosure regime that
allows the case to be put to Revenue and for clearance to be obtained.
Given that the disclosure regime is available, there should be no need
for any retrospective legislation. The current drafting of the Bill
would give HMRC the right to turn a blind eye to a scheme and come back
retrospectively and decide that it is illegal. That is an important
point of principle, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will listen
to those arguments.</div>

case. The amendments would prevent clause 55 from being treated as
always having had effect. That would take away a fundamental purpose of
the clause, which is to put it beyond doubt that a wholly artificial
avoidance scheme, which I will explain in a minute, does not work and
never has done. As has been said, the avoidance scheme that the clause
closes down was designed to frustrate legislation passed by Parliament

<a name="08052265000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
satisfied that in these unusual circumstances, retrospective
clarification of the law is fair, proportionate and in the public
interest. That is the human rights test that we must apply.</div>
<a name="08052265000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be useful for me
briefly to give some background. In 1979, Mr. Padmore, a UK
resident, worked in the UK as a patent agent. He was also a member of a
Jersey partnership, which had been set up to receive some of the income
from Mr. Padmore&#146;s activities as a patent agent. In
line with the law as it was generally understood at the time, the
Inland Revenue sought to tax him on his share of the foreign
partnership&#146;s profits. In December 1986, the courts upheld his
claim that the tax treaty between Jersey and the UK meant that none of
the Jersey partnership&#146;s profits could be taxed in the UK, even
those belonging to UK resident partners.</div>
<a name="08052265000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The decision was a surprise,
not only to the Inland Revenue but to other tax authorities and most
tax advisers. It overturned the generally held view that unless
explicitly specified, tax treaties do not remove a country&#146;s
right to set
taxes.</div><a name="08052265000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It being
