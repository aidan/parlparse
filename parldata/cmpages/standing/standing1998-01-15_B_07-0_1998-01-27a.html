<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross </B>(East Londonderry): I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 8, line 24, leave out `in uniform'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 162, in clause 14, page 9, line 42, leave out `in uniform'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Amendment No. 173 is a simple, probing amendment, to inquire why it is necessary for police constables to be in uniform whenever they are carrying out their duties. There are many situations in Northern Ireland in which police officers are not in uniform, but they are still policemen, Presumably, in such cases, they could operate under other legislation. Why must a police officer be in uniform before he can take action, under the Bill, against a person who is in possession of intoxicating liquor?
<P>
Amendment No. 162 relates to clause 14, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A constable in uniform may arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspects is committing an offence under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That goes far beyond the concept of being in possession of, or consuming, alcohol. Clause 14 deals with the wide powers that will be given to a police constable in uniform, which seem not to apply to a police constable or a police officer out of uniform, or to a plain clothes officer. Given the speed with which events can move in Northern Ireland under the influence of paramilitary or terrorist organisations, there might be occasions when it would be reasonable for a police officer, who was not in uniform, to take action under this, or other, legislation.
<P>
In the cases to which amendment No. 173 refers, it is likely that there would be a crowd scene and the officers would need to be in uniform so that they could be clearly identified. However, in the circumstances to which amendment No. 162 would apply, there would not necessarily be a crowd of people who might be prepared to attack the officers who were present. Will the Minister explain to the Committee why police officers have to be in uniform before they can take action to arrest an individual who is breaking the law?
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland </B>(Mr. Tony Worthington): I understand that this is a genuine probing amendment. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) seeks to make it possible for any police officer, including those in plain clothes, to make an arrest under the Bill.
<P>
The Government appreciate the thought behind the amendment, but we shall ask the Committee to reject the amendment. The basic reason for that is that the citizen must know that the police officer is exercising his statutory function. That is especially important in the case of clause 12, which applies to circumstances in which drink is involved. It is possible that the situation could be misinterpreted when someone is trying to confiscate drink. There have been cases in which someone who was charged with assaulting a police officer has argued in defence that the officer was in plain clothes and therefore the person did not understand what was happening.
<P>
The Government believe that a police officer should be in uniform to identify himself or herself. The hon. Member for East Londonderry will appreciate that during a parade it is likely that there would be a significant number of uniformed officers present. The Bill reflects only those provisions that exist in all other Northern Ireland legislation. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I understand the Minister's point in relation to amendment No. 173, but amendment No. 162 refers to clause 14, which is not limited to the time when a procession is taking place. The Bill applies six hours before the proposed starting time of a procession. At that time plain clothes officers would be likely to be in the street keeping an eye on what was going on, and they might have to take action. I understand the Minister's remarks about amendment No. 173, but those relating to amendment No. 162 were not as strong. I hope that he will take on board my arguments, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 174, in page 8, line 25, after `consuming', insert `or has consumed'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 74, in page 8, line 26, leave out `may require that person'.
<P>
No. 75, in page 8, line 27, after `(a)', insert `may require that person'.
<P>
No. 76, in page 8, line 29, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(c) may confiscate anything in his possession which is, or which the constable reasonably believes to be, intoxicating liquor'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 77, in page 8, line 30, leave out `Subsection (1)' and insert `Subsections (1) and (3)'.
<P>
No. 175, in page 8, line 32, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`with a view to taking'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert `to take'.
<P>
No. 176, in page 8, leave out lines 34 to 37.
<P>
No. 156, in page 9, line 21, leave out `6' and insert `4'.
<P>
No. 177, in page 9, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Many amendments have been tabled to the clause, all of which concern the controlling of alcohol consumption, or those who are consuming it, before, during or possibly after a procession. Amendment No. 174 is needed because clause 12 gives a constable powers in relation to a person who ``is consuming'' intoxicating liquor. However, a person who has already consumed some, and is drunk and in a fighting mood, would not be covered by the clause. People who became drunk in a pub and emerged, highly intoxicated, on to the street, could escape the attentions of the police under the Bill. The Government need to consider that provision again, because otherwise it would be a defence for someone to say, ``I was not drinking in the street; I got drunk in the pub.'' He could claim that though he had a bottle of whiskey with him, it was bought for drinking at home, and that the officer had no right to require its surrender. That is a hole in the Bill.
<P>
I tabled amendment No. 175 because I am not sure that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``with a view to taking''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is the right way to word the provision. The Bill refers to people
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who have assembled with a view to taking part''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in a procession, but surely the simple phrase ``to take part'' is preferable. I see no need for stating that a relevant person is present ``with a view'' to taking part. Such a person might not be acceptable to the organisers of the procession. He might be a hanger-on who wanted to go down the street, and might be outwith the organisers' control. I am curious about whether the Minister is certain that the wording is the correct one to accomplish what I think are the Government's intentions.
<P>
Amendment No. 176 would delete from the clause subsection (2)(c), which states that subsection (1) applies to a person
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who--
<P>
(i) is otherwise present at, or is in the vicinity of, a place on the route or proposed route of a public procession; and
<P>
(ii) is in a public place, other than licensed premises.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>I am not sure whether those two elements really hang together. A person who was at the end of a procession, at the assembly point in a field or similar place, which would be a public space, but who had not taken part in the procession, might well be intoxicated without causing anyone any trouble. Although the organisers might take a dim view of folk drinking in the field on the Twelfth, Black Saturday or 17 March, it would be difficult to take action against those drinkers unless they were becoming violent.
<P>
There is a difficulty with the phrase ``in the vicinity of''. Someone may, having bought a six pack, be carrying it along the street on his way home, and someone else may have bought a couple of bottles of wine for a dinner party in the evening. Neither of them may have anything to do with the procession: they are simply going about their lawful business, yet they could be caught by the Bill. It is no good the Minister saying that they should have taken another route.
<P>
The Minister should have considered the wording more carefully so that the Bill allowed an individual to prove that he was there for an entirely different purpose and was not connected with the procession. Then we come to the term ``in a public place'', by which I understand any place to which the public may have access, pavement or otherwise. As I say, an individual could be in a field, ``a public place'', but it is not clear whether he is going to cause trouble as a result of drinking.
<P>
I have always made it clear that organisers of loyalist--and, I am sure, nationalist--processions, are opposed to drinking either on the route or in the field. Sometimes, however, common sense has to apply, and I am unsure whether someone walking in a field may be caught by this provision.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 is interesting. Six hours is a long period before the proposed starting time of the procession and I cannot see the purpose of applying a ban for such a long time. We have long had byelaws against drinking in the streets anyway, so existing law is adequate to deal with the situation. Will the Minister give us some idea of the thinking behind this provision?
<P>
A procession will usually start at about 2 pm, or perhaps noon. That would mean people being prohibited from being in the street with alcohol from 8 am. With a very late procession, that period could be as late as noon. I cannot see why the Government have concluded that a period of six hours is appropriate--that is far too long for me. It also places an additional burden on the police. I should think that a couple of hours before a procession starts would be more than sufficient. So, as I said, I would be grateful if the Minister could explain the thinking behind the provision. At present, it could annoy many folk because six hours before a procession is an entire afternoon. Many people are walking the streets on Saturday afternoons taking alcohol home with them.
<P>
I should also like to deal with another crazy situation that is created by another part of the clause. Subsection (5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A constable may dispose of anything surrendered to him under this section in such manner as he considers appropriate.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So could an officer confiscate six packs, a bottle of wine or a bottle of Black Bush and take them home with him, which is what the Bill states? Or would he pour it down the drain? Most police constables take the same general view of alcohol as I do. They would normally like to take it home with them. Given that, what restrictions will be placed on the police constable who seizes a six pack or other liquor from someone coming straight out of the pub? Can he take it to the police station and have a quiet beer with his friends over sandwiches at lunchtime and can he take seized whiskey home and enjoy a nightcap? The clause is open to abuse unless police regulations or other provisions in law prohibit an officer from taking possession of alcohol for his own use. However, under the clause, once an officer grabs alcohol, it is his--and what a temptation that would place before him.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
For example, a lady may be walking in the street with half a dozen bottles of quality wine that she has bought for a fancy dinner party that evening. A constable may come along and say, ``Sorry ma'am. It is six hours within a procession taking place and it is evident to me that you are about to start drinking in the street. You will get intoxicated and consequently throw stones and petrol bombs at the police. I am therefore seizing this wine.'' That police constable could then have the dinner party. That is not the Bill's intention. I am sure that the Chief Constable or any of his senior officers would not be happy with such behaviour by a constable. However, one hears so much about the police these days that anything is possible. I do not see why temptation should be put in their way.
<P>
Far be it from me to criticise the Royal Ulster Constabulary because many of my relations serve in the force. One of my favourite stories was told by my uncle, who said that his hope in life was to draw his pension for longer than he drew his pay. He is 92, so he is nearly there. He told me that once when he was in the constituency of the hon. Member for South Down the police seized some poteen and poured 10 gallons of it down a drain. People in the village thought that that was a colossal waste.
<P>
I may have been a bit facetious about the matter, but the clause is wide open to abuse. It should contain a provision that would not allow a police officer to do what he considers appropriate with seized alcohol. It should be set down that the alcohol must be handed to senior officers for disposal in a way that a court may decide. That would be a far more sensible approach than the one in the Bill. I look forward to the Minister's reply.

<P>

<B>Mr. Eddie McGrady </B>(South Down): Despite the possible humorous consequences that have been outlined by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, we are debating an important and difficult clause. All Members of the Committee agree that the abuse of alcohol leads to the abuse of people and to the abuse of the right to parade and to peaceful assembly. We can all recount anecdotes, but on many occasions an otherwise peaceful scenario has been turned into a riot because of the over-consumption of alcohol by those in a procession and by bystanders.
<P>
We can all think of humorous situations that may arise, but we must try to prevent a recurrence of incidents in which the abuse of alcohol has led to serious problems. That has been recognised by the Bill's replication of parts of the Public Order (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 and the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987. It is also significant that recommendation 42 of the North report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We recommend that the provisions in Great Britain for control of alcohol being taken to sporting events be extended to Northern Ireland in respect of those travelling both to parades and open-air public meetings.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is important because hangers-on often cause the greatest tension. Sometimes the resultant disorder does not occur on the parade route, or even alongside it, but in streets nearby. Therefore, it is important to get the measure right.
<P>
Amendment No. 76 is a probing amendment, which attempts to strengthen the hand of the police who are in charge. I am not sure if there is a difference in law between ``surrender'' and ``confiscate''. In my view, ``to surrender'' means to give up something voluntarily. I cannot envisage many people voluntarily giving up their load of liquor in the circumstances that we are discussing. Therefore, amendment No. 76 would allow the police to confiscate alcohol. However, in legal terms, that might mean the same as surrendering alcohol.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> The term ``surrender'' implies that the person can retrieve the alcohol later. ``Confiscate'' might preclude that. That is my only objection to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman, who always lives in the hope that if he loses his liquor, he will get it back. Perhaps someone who has legal expertise can explain whether there is a difference between ``surrender'' and ``confiscate''. The amendments are intended to clarify matters and strengthen the hand of the police.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 74 to 76 contain contextual inaccuracies, which may make them difficult to incorporate in the Bill. I apologise for that, but I would like the Minister to respond to their aims. I would be happy to withdraw amendments Nos. 74 to 77 if the Minister can clarify the police's powers, and strengthen their position, perhaps through an amendment on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> We think that clause 12 provides useful powers to deal with the problems that are often associated with alcohol at processions. The amendments would make the police's job impossible.
<P>
My first comment to the hon. Member for East Londonderry will be hurtful because it is that amendment No. 174 is defective. After years in Opposition, I know what it is like to labour long to produce an amendment only to be told that it is defective. But how can someone surrender alcohol that he has already drunk? That is a difficult challenge. Alcohol that is still being consumed is covered by the Bill.
<P>
The circumstances that the hon. Member for East Londonderry described, in which someone is roaring drunk, are already covered by legislation. It is an offence to be drunk in a public place under common law in Northern Ireland. The police already have adequate powers to tackle that, so the amendment is unecessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down acknowledged that amendments Nos. 74 and 75 contained problems. They would make nonsense of clause 12. If the amendments were accepted, clause 12(1) would read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Where a constable in uniform reasonably suspects that a person . . . is consuming intoxicating liquor, the constable (b) to state his name and address.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is difficult to think of reasons why the police constable should state his name and address. There is a drafting problem there but we think that the clause as it stands is perfectly adequate to pick up the problem of bystanders and those who are associated with processions.
<P>
The hon. Member for South Down suggested in amendment No. 76 that the police would be empowered to confiscate alcohol rather than requiring a person to surrender it. It is not possible to give powers to confiscate anything whose possession is not an offence. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is thinking of the Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 under which the police can confiscate alcohol as the persons are under 18 and possession of alcohol is an offence for them under that Act.
<P>
The Bill deals with adults and it is not an offence for them to possess alcohol. It requires a person to surrender alcohol and if he does not he shall be guilty of an offence. It is the same thing in the end. It gives the RUC sufficient powers to deal with the problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I do not quite understand the Minister. It seems that if a person refuses to surrender his alcohol the police constable has the power to arrest him on the spot and thereby indirectly confiscate the liquor of he may allow him to continue to imbibe the liquor and cause possible mayhem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Worthington:</B> As I understand it, if someone disobeys the order of a constable the offence is disobeying that order. The objective is thus achieved but it is the definition of ``confiscate'' that causes difficulties.
<P>
Amendment No. 77, also tabled by the hon. Member for South Down, is technically complicated. We are not sure what he intended by it but it would greatly expand the powers of the constable to require a person to surrender alcohol even at some distance from the parade. The constable would have the power to confiscate alcohol from any person even if that person was not in the vicinity of the parade but was likely to be travelling to a parade. Taking an extreme example, it would theoretically allow a constable in Londonderry to ask someone whom he thought might be travelling to the vicinity of a parade in Bangor to surrender alcohol.
<P>
At present the Bill gives the constable those powers only if the person is in a vehicle that is defined as a motor vehicle adapted to carry more than eight passengers. It would be strange if alcohol could be confiscated from someone who was merely walking down the road in Londonderry. However, if he was on a bus chartered for the Bangor parade it would be obvious that he was going to that parade and the constable's powers would be useful. The powers that the hon. Gentleman seeks to give the constable go to far.
<P>
Amendment No. 176, which was tabled by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, would restrict the alcohol provisions to those taking part in a parade and would exempt hangers-on and protesters. I am sure that we are all agreed that hangers-on are the source of much of the trouble that surrounds parades. Indeed, the hon. Member for East Londonderry has said that many times in Committee. We assured him on Thursday that this would not affect people drinking at home and in their gardens and I urge him not to press his amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 156 concerns the requirement that the controls on alcohol would begin four hours before the start of the parade instead of six. In this case we are simply following the GB legislation on the control of alcohol carried by those on the way to sporting events, and our information is that it has worked well. The Bill is drafted in that way to ensure that controls will start early enough for people to sober up before the parade. It is important that intoxication does not inflame passions during the procession.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 177 revealed the strange thoughts of the hon. Member for East Londonderry about the probity of the RUC in respect of the possession of alcohol. The amendment would mean that the constable could not dispose of anything surrendered to him as he felt appropriate. The hon. Gentleman's remarks suggest that he does not trust constables of the RUC to pour away any alcohol that is surrendered to them. We are sure that they can be trusted to dispose of it because it falls within the Police Property Act 1897, which applies in Northern Ireland, which provides for the disposal of property that comes into the hands of the police: a person may apply to a magistrates court if aggrieved by their disposal decisions. Following the usual procedures for property that comes into the hands of the police, alcohol seized is sold and the money is paid into the consolidated fund.
<P>
If we were to accept the amendment--we will not do so--it would mean the police would act as a checking-in desk, issuing chits for surrendered beer and returning it at midnight on the day after the parade. The Bill as drafted is perfectly competent; any acquisition of alcohol will be dealt with under the 1897 Act. I ask the Committee to surrender [Interruption.] I mean reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I was beginning to think that the Minister wished that he was a policeman on the route.
<P>
The Minister should have considered more carefully amendment No. 177; the Bill should state what actually happens to material seized by the police--they do not take it home, and it is confusing if there is no such reference.
<P>
The Minister set out clearly how to deal with persons in the vicinity of the procession by referring to our previous sitting, but he did not mention the issue of people consuming alcohol in the context of processions such as the 12 July parade. Such behaviour is not usual; it has certainly never occurred in the processions that I have attended in county Londonderry. I assume that individuals in such cases will fall within the ambit of the measure and can therefore be caught if they behave in that manner.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reconsider subsection (5) and make it clear what will happen to alcohol seized by the police. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Malcolm Moss (North-East Cambridgeshire):</B> I ask the Minister for clarification of the first line of clause 13, which refers to ``a person''. Does that mean only individuals or does it mean a group of persons or a body, such as a group that comes together to hold an open-air public meeting or a counter-demonstration with the intention of breaking up a legal procession? If the clause refers only to individuals, does the Public Order (Northeren Ireland) Act 1987 have the same effect? How often are arrests made under that legislation?
<P>
Does the Minister intend that the amendments to the 1987 Act, as set out in schedule 3, should apply to those open-air public meetings that are organised by a body or a group of persons with the intention of opposing a procession or a legal march?
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> This is an interesting clause, not least because it is pretty much the same as the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Act 1987. As that is so, and because it is clearly intended to accomplish the same purpose, why is it in the Bill?
<P>
My reasoning applies not only to this clause. If a section of the 1987 Act which to some extent consolidates existing law is transferred to the Bill, why are not all the other bits and pieces of public order legislation moved to this Bill so that we have not just a new Bill but a consolidation measure? That might be more satisfactory, because the body of law on the issue would be in one Act. That would make matters much clearer for those who have to deal with public order. The clause is a straight lift, with some different wording, from the 1987 Act.
<P>
There are a number of interesting features in the Bill. It will provide protection to people who are taking part in a procession or going to one. It calls into question the behaviour of the police in the past few years, when processions have been violently obstructed by people who clearly had the most extensive plans to obstruct the procession and to cause mayhem across the Province. After the 1996 riots in Drumcree, the senior officer in Londonderry said that it was the most vicious rioting that he had ever seen; but there were few prosecutions after those riots. I know that I am harking back to the matter of counter-demonstrations, which was mentioned earlier, but I want the Minister to tell us, if such a provision is already on the statute book, how comprehensively it has been used against those who are violently engaged in opposing processions that have received permission to go ahead.
<P>
Only a tiny number of people have been prosecuted under the appropriate section of the 1987 Act. The Unionist, loyalist and Orange population of Northern Ireland believe that the section is pretty much a dead letter, because it is not applied, and they resent that very much. The powers exist for the police to take action against those who oppose the processions, and far too often they fail to do so.
<P>
There have been many instances in Northern Ireland recently of buses carrying people travelling to a parade being thoroughly stoned and attacked. The Minister of State may giggle, but he would not do so if his 11-year-old daughter had glass in her face because a stone was thrown through a bus window.
<P>
The Minister should know that for many years buses going to processions in Northern Ireland have been banned from using roads in some areas and they have to make lengthy detours. Dungiven town is one such place; Glenshane pass is another. The Government, or the police, say, ``That particular road is a no-go area, we cannot allow you to pass through that town because you might come under violent attack''. If such a situation occurs, we should like to know what has been done about it; clear measures should have been taken to prevent such behaviour. The police have the potential to take action against folk who obstruct processions, who attack people en route to processions and who attack people taking part in processions. However, we do not see much being done about that.
<P>
The proposed measures appear to apply to behaviour that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) and I have described as counter-demonstrations to processions. However, such behaviour is not treated as though it were a counter-demonstration. Ministers have suggested that a counter-demonstation would be treated as if it were a new and different procession. There seems to be some divided thinking on the issue. Will the Minister clarify that?
<P>
There are problems when people sit in the street, or when they gather together in a mob and throw stones. There are also occasions when there are really counter-demonstrations. The legislation is in place, but it needs clarification. Will the Government explain how the police should deal with such behaviour in future?
<P>
I note that the clause seems to be far more limited than the provisions under section 3 of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Act 1951. Will the Minister check that earlier legislation and tell the Committee whether changes have been made to it, and whether the provisions that seem to be missing from the Bill have been included in other legislation? How much of the 1951 Act still applies? If section 3 of the Act is still in place, why can it not be transferred to the Bill?
<P>
The earlier legislation is interesting; its wording is simple, to deal with the situation that existed then, compared with the complex wording used in the Bill. Consolidation of the legislation dealing with public order and public processions is overdue.
<P>
The increasing complexity of legislation shows the capacity of those of evil intent to make things more and more difficult for law-abiding citizens. Clause 13 is the one part of the Bill that clearly protects the right of people to process peaceably, as the Minister pointed out earlier in our sittings. However, that right has been allowed to become a dead letter in many places, because, as the hon. Member for South Down said, the police have to bow to the greater evil. That is the primary evil, from which all other evils spring. It is the capacity and the willingness of the terrorist organisations--and in this case, only one terrorist organisation, the IRA, is involved--to use murder and other forms of attack to stop people exercising their right to process peaceably.
<P>
Clause 13 is one of the key parts of the Bill. Will the Minister assure the Committee that a serious effort will be made over the coming months to implement controls against those whose sole intention is to cause mayhem in Northern Ireland? When there is disruption, as there was at Drumcree and a number of other places, the great and the good lament the damage that is done to Northern Ireland. But the IRA wants to do damage to Northern Ireland and it wants to be able to claim that it is an ungovernable and oppressive place. It creates the conditions and gets its spin doctors on to the job. It then presents a case that often has no relation to reality. However, it gets away with that because the law is not applied against those who are prepared to use violence to stop legal processions.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
As I have said before, the Bill will result in the Parades Commission inviting people to object to and to obstruct parades, which will lead to more violence on the streets. That is why the Bill is extremely foolish and dangerous. However, if this clause is applied, much of that which has gone before would not be necessary.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram):</B> The clause, as it stands, makes it an offence to hinder or obstruct a lawful public procession. The offence is intended to cover those who try to prevent a lawful procession from taking place at all or from taking place in a particular area. The final comment of the hon. Member for East Londonderry stands comfortably alongside that. Those who have an unlawful intent when they protest against public processions will be covered by the clause.
<P>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked whether the clause relates specifically to individuals or to a collective group of people. It relates specifically to individuals. He also asked whether it replicated, replaced or measured up to existing legislation. It is a straightforward transfer of provisions in the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Will the Minister explain why it was deemed necessary to transfer one part of the 1987 order to the clause when much of the order is still in place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I was coming to that point. The Bill deals specifically with public processions and matters related thereto. The public order order is a wider-ranging measure. We have, therefore, taken from the order those measures that relate to processions and have left in place those aspects that do not.
<P>
I was also asked about the statistics on the number of arrests that have been made under the public order order. I shall make the statistics available, but I can say now that few arrests have been made under it. It is not a matter for politicians to make arrests; it is a matter for the RUC and its officers to judge the best way to implement a raft of legislation. Very few arrests and charges have been made under the public order order, but many arrests have been made under the legislation covering disorderly conduct. Under that, a person's intent does not have to be proved.
<P>
I undertake that I shall make the statistics available in writing. The hon. Member for East Londonderry may have seen some of that information in parliamentary answers. However, if he has not, it will be made available.
<P>
The clause is important. The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to section 3 of the parallel 1951 legislation. I believe that the 1951 Act was repealed in the 1970s. I shall try to find out more about that. The hon. Gentleman asked a question about which I have no specific information. There is public order legislation on the statute book, and, if the Bill becomes an Act, there will be legislation that specifically deals with public processions.
<P>
The clause is important, and I commend it to the Committee.

<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 10, line 5, leave out `either House' and insert `both Houses'.
<P>
Perhaps the amendment is purely technical. Its purpose is to discover exactly how the statutory instrument will be tackled. Will it have to be passed by both Houses or only one House? Perhaps the Minister can explain the exact process and the reasons for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendment raises a technical matter. Subsection (2) is a standard provision, which is used for subordinate legislation that is subject to negative resolution. It means that the statutory instrument can be annulled if only one House passes a resolution to that effect. If the amendment was accepted, the statutory instrument would not be annulled unless both Houses passed a resolution to do that. It is standard procedure to require only one House to annul the statutory instrument. The amendment is contrary to established precedent and practice. We should not change such a precedent in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Interpretation</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 10, leave out lines 42 to 44.
<P>
The amendment applies to the interpretation clause. It refers back to the provison on alcohol and again raises questions about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any place to which . . . the public has access''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Does that cover a hall where people may assemble? The Bill states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a public place, other than licensed premises.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That could mean a hall where people assemble, a field where a demonstration takes place, or any open-air area to which people have access. How wide is the clause's remit? I should like an answer to that before I raise one or two small points in the stand part debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The amendment would alter the definition of a ``public place'' to cover only roads, whereas in the Bill the term means
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) any road within the meaning of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993; and
<P>
 (b) any place to which at the material time the public or any section of the public has access, on payment or otherwise, as of right or by virtue of express or implied permission''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That is a standard definition and accords with much existing Northern Ireland legislation. Changing it would set a precedent.
<P>
The current definition has its present form for a good reason. If it were changed, the Bill's alcohol provisions and the definition of a public procession would not apply to bystanders drinking alcohol or to public processions taking place on a wide range of open public grounds--for instance, in a field, which would not be defined as a road under the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993. The amendment would not be helpful at all, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> In the light of the Minister's comments I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> As to the alcohol provisions, if the Minister has ever attended one of the processions covered by the Bill, he will have seen that often, as the procession approaches, people come out of public houses carrying glasses of beer. They may not cause any damage, but may just watch the procession and then go back in. I think that a problem may now arise, but I hope that the police will deal with the matter sensitively, because the people whom I have described are not part of the procession and are unlikely to cause trouble. That aspect of the matter needs to be dealt with.
<P>
Two matters arise concerning interpretation. The first relates to the definition at the top of page 11 that states that the term
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>```public procession' means a procession in a public place, whether or not involving the use of vehicles or other conveyances.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister will recall that the House of Lords removed from the Bill a provision that was intended to deal with obnoxious processions involving car cavalcades, run not least by the Gaelic Athletic Association. Those involve driving through Protestant towns and villages with tricolours flying from the cars, shouting obscenities. That has happened quite frequently, though I have never suffered it. I live in the country anyway and would normally be aware of such incidents. I do not suppose that they would be unwelcome where there was a strong Gaelic Athletic Association presence, but it has happened in towns and villages where it has been unwelcome. The Bill's definition of the term ``public procession'' means that anyone who is to engage in those activities in the future will have to obtain form 11/1, fill it in and apply.
<P>
Perhaps I should point out that the relevant processions take place for various reasons, such as winning an important match, perhaps. The organisers could claim that the whole thing had arisen more or less spontaneously as a celebration of the win and that they did not need to give the police notice that such a car or vehicle procession would be taking place--sometimes at high speed. Those involved could get away with that. However, if they were on their way to a match and had arranged a pre-match procession; or if they had organised a parade as part of a formal celebration, they should be caught by the definition. Can we be assured that the police will be able to take action against such people, if only by observing the number of vehicles that are being used and prosecuting people thereafter? Some folk have long since learned that claiming a procession is spontaneous is a beautiful way to get around the legislation. If one lot gets away with it, many more people will get around the Bill in exactly the same manner.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
How is it intended that the police should apply this interpretation of the term ``public processions''? Will the interpretation, which is designed to catch the counter-demonstrations, catch the folks sitting down in the street or will they be dealt with under the other elements of public order legislation? What will happen? The people of Northern Ireland deserve some further explanation about what this clause accomplishes.
<P>
This is an interesting and important clause. It tells us what the words in the Bill mean and raises some interesting questions. Why can the Chief Constable devolve his functions only down to the rank of assistant chief constable? I should have thought that in many cases they should go down to what used to be known as the chief superintendent, a rank which has now been abolished, but which still carries some connotations in regard to the responsibility of a senior police officer for his area. Those are important matters which the Minister needs to address before we allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield):</B> There is one matter in the clause which I should like to ask the Minister to consider. I confess that I had not noticed it previously but I raised an eyebrow at the definition of a band in the clause. Interpretation clauses are important because, ultimately, they are the foundation on which argument takes place in court. According to the clause
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `band' means a group of two or more persons who carry for the purpose of playing or sounding, or engage in the playing or sounding of, musical or other instruments''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The mind boggles at the thought of a band playing instruments other than musical ones. There could be two or more people going up the street playing cassette recorders. Is that what the Bill is designed to deal with? We have dealt in some detail with the definition of a band. If a band is not playing or sounding musical instruments, I am at a loss to see how it can meet the definition of what the Minister wants to deal with under the Bill. It is a small point but a great deal of time can be wasted in court on such small points. If we are dealing only with musical instruments, perhaps the Minister could consider removing the word ``other'', which I suspect has come in through the over-keenness of the draftsman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Someone said, ``You are on your own now''. I know that this is a serious point but there is some hilarity attached to it. Would dustbin lids be considered musical instruments? I do not claim credit for that suggestion: it came from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State. We could spend time describing other accoutrements which are not musical instruments but which could be used to make a band. I remember from my dim and distant past the old skiffle bands which used washboards, an old tea chest with a pole sticking out and a piece of string. Were they musical instruments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): Not when my hon. Friend played them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I played the washboard, not the tea chest. We could spend some time trying to find definitions. The best advice that I can provide for the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is to say that it is a straightforward lift from the 1987 public order measure. His point is valid. If the drafting is over-zealous, I am prepared to consider it again. However, it has been tested as well as it can be and I am inclined to allow it to remain in place and avoid getting into further difficulty.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to the definition of public procession at the top of page 11 and specifically mentioned GAA cavalcades. I have had many representations on this matter but never felt that people have justified their case. Accusations have been made but we have never been given precise examples of a GAA cavalcade.
<P>
In any event, it is not for politicians to decide whether the definition--again transferred from the 1987 public order order--has been breached. In the end, that must remain a matter for the RUC to decide. It is for the police to interpret legislation and apply it when they believe that law has been breached. We have simply put a range of definitions in place under clause 16, which should allow the proper interpretation of the Bill. When it becomes an Act, as I hope it will, people charged with the responsibility of maintaining public order should be able to apply it in a fair and equitable way.
<P>
If an event such as that described by the hon. Member for East Londonderry fell within the ambit of the definition, form 11/1 would need to be submitted and it would fall within that specific definition of a public procession.
<P>
This part of the Bill was debated extensively in another place: what appears in the Bill now is a result of that debate. Originally the Government intended to proceed differently, but we listened carefully to the cross-community points of view expressed on this part of the Bill and decided to alter it to bring it back into line with the public order order of 1987. On that basis, I ask the Committee to accept that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 46, in page 11, line 33, leave out subsection (6).
<P>
This is a technical amendment. It formally removes the privilege amendment moved in the other place, which provided that nothing in the Bill could impose any charge on public funds. The privilege amendment was moved in the other place immediately after the motion for Third Reading had been agreed to. Government amendment No. 46 will preclude the Lords from infringing the privilege that the Commons enjoys, by which it alone can control charges on public funds.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 18, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Commission</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 12, line 13, leave out `more' and insert `less'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it may be convenient to take amendment No. 111, in page 12, line 13, leave out `6' and insert `4'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> This is an important issue. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire says that the number should be reduced to four. I think that it should be increased to at least six members. The Secretary of State may by order vary the number for the time being if she so desires, but there should never be fewer than six because that would reduce the possibility of getting a spread of representation.
<P>
If the commission is to have a chance of being acceptable to anyone in Northern Ireland it must be seen to be fair and reasonable. At present, after the resignation of the Rev. Roy Magee, the membership of the commission is seen to be unfriendly to the Orange institutions and the other loyalist orders. It is seen as an extremely biased organisation. The Minister can say whatever he likes about the probity of the people concerned, but his view is not universal in Northern Ireland. He must start redressing the balance and do so mighty fast and fairly massively if the commission is to be treated with any degree of seriousness.
<P>
The loyalist institutions have no faith in this organisation. They think that it is being set up and organised in such a way as to ensure that all Orange processions will be stopped if possible. They believe that the whole concept of going out to the community and seeking objections--for that is what the commission will do--is utterly mad and will foment trouble as it will, along with the long period of advance notice, give all those of evil intent the maximum opportunity to pick their place.
<P>
I was told a few days ago about a village where some people seem to be seeking registration on the electoral register as living on the traditional route so as to ensure that the balance of the relatively small population on the register is tilted heavily against the Unionist and loyalist population.
<P>
The Minister has not so much opened a can of worms; he has created a bucket of worms and then opened it up to the world. This is foolish legislation. If the commisison is to have any chance of hearing the strong loyalist Unionist viewpoint that is so endemic in my part of Northern Ireland it must have enough members to give it a balance of opinions. It simply does not have such a balance at present.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give me satisfactory answers. So far I have not been given much comfort. There are other matters which no doubt the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire will wish to address. We all want to hear him explain why he thinks that the number should be reduced to four.
<P>
I read the answer that the Minister gave me on the Peach proposals a week or two ago when I asked what efforts were being made to ensure that quangos reflected the communities in Northern Ireland. He said that a huge number of bodies were not required to reflect the communities and that everyone was picked on merit. With this quango, never mind the others, one gets the impression that Protestants, Orangemen or representatives of that community do not have any merit because they do not appear here.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Minister wants people in Northern Ireland to believe that he has good intent and that he is dealing an even hand, he had better think seriously of how many people will be on the commission, how they will be selected and how he will make the body acceptable to the Unionist population. I understand that there are other amendments in the group.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> There is just one other--amendment No. 111.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> Amendments Nos. 119, 120 and 79 cover similar matters and we shall come to them later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I have tabled a probing amendment. I want the Minister to explain why he and his officials have decided that the commission shall consist of a chairman and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``not more than 6 other members''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when the North report recommended four.
<P>
Chapter 12 of the North report deals with the commission and its composition. It points out that the feeling in Northern Ireland was that its composition would be critical, and I endorse that view. It was felt that, because of the polarisation of the communities and the problems associated with parades, it would be difficult to find sufficient people to serve on the commission and that its composition was unlikely to meet with universal approval with all parties agreeing that it was fair, reasonable and appropriate. That problem still pertains, and perhaps even more so than when the report was being compiled.
<P>
The report added that it was not thought that, apart from in the early period, the commission's workload would be onerous. How does the Minister envisage its work load and what does he expect it to do in the medium to longer term?
<P>
Paragraph 12.33 of the North report states that, in addition to the chairman,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We believe that four other members would be the right number.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That would provide a blend of experience, competence and balance from the different communities.
<P>
The North report states that the commission should also have proper geographical representation, and cross-community and gender balance. The more criteria that are set, the more difficult it is to meet them. I have listed the problems that may arise. On geographical spread, one must cover the areas east and west of the Bann, and consider the major cities of Belfast and Londonderry because of the contentious parades that are held in them. In addition, one must consider groupings from north and south. It will be difficult to find sufficient people to cover all those geographical areas. Cross-community balance is fairly easy to attain, and North makes a strong recommendation for proper gender balance to be reflected in the number of women on the commission.
<P>
It was also stated that ex-politicians might serve on the commission. That would seem extremely difficult. If one or two were chosen, many would be left out, which would lead to some resentment. Legal experience would also be useful according to North. However, the more that we build in to try to form a commission that properly represents the whole community and is perceived to be balanced and representative, the more difficult it becomes. Why did the Minister opt for six members? Why not eight or 10? If we want full representation, the larger the group the better, although I can see that there might be difficulties in the commission's procedures when a majority vote will carry the day. The last thing we want is a split of three to two or four to three on a contentious parade. That would get us no further forward than we are now. My amendment probes the reasoning behind the Minister's decision to go for six.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The reasoning is quite simple and has been touched on by the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire and for East Londonderry. The clause deals with the commission's work load and characteristics. If we are to seek balance--and that is a desirable objective--how is that to be done with a small rather than a large number? A balance must be struck.
<P>
The Bill is quite specific. Schedule 1(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Commission shall consist of--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a chairman; and
<P>
(b) not more than six other members
<P>
appointed by the Secretary of State.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Schedule 1(2) goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may by order vary the number for the time being specified in sub-paragraph 1(b).''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The best advice from the commission on its future work load is that it should have the number set out in the Bill. We have taken the best advice. This is not just the logic of a Minister or an official. It is based on the views of those who will be given the job on how to disburse resources in the way that achieves the best return in a difficult process. If the work load falls off or increases, the Secretary of State will have the power to amend the number of people on the commission. The judgment has been taken on best advice that as things stand a commission of not more than six members should apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Am I right in thinking that the body will have to meet formally to take a decision on every parade for which notification is given?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Yes, it must meet formally when it must make a determination. I was coming to a point about majority determination, which will be covered in future amendments. The best way in which the commission can operate--and I am sure that it will intend to do so--will be not to have natural divisions inherent within it. The commission must seek consensus within itself because it will try to achieve a consensus in the wider community. We expect the Parades Commission to go about its difficult task in that way. The task is difficult because of strong objections from a sizeable body of opinion within Northern Ireland. The Commission should be given support in carrying out the tasks with which it is charged, and we should realise the complexities and difficulties that it will face in coming to a determination and in understanding the matters that require determination.
<P>
We arrived at the number for the Parades Commission after taking the best advice about the period ahead. The number can be varied in future. If an increase becomes necessary because of an increased work load, that will be sad for us all. It will mean more division, contention and problems. Ideally, we should like the number to be reduced, because that would result from a reduced work load. I should like everyone in Northern Ireland to apply that logic. Our aim should be for the commission to operate at a minimum rather than a maximum level, because the latter would be a sign of undesirable division and contention.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> Following the point made by the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson), has the Minister an idea yet about the number of decisions likely to be made by the commission in, for example, the forthcoming parade season? Does he, like the hon. Member for West Tyrone, fear--and I share the fear--that the edifice that we are putting in place could perversely be seen as encouragement to protest groups, which want to object to parades, to make formal applications after the notice has been given in, and carry the process through to the wire? Might they, because of the frequent political motivation in such situations, not reach a local accommodation but ensure that the commission sat, so that a determination would be made? If political motivation were strong, the commission would have to make many determinations in the next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> That would be the case, and the previous Administration would have faced that problem if they had passed the Bill as they should have done. That is why I said that we should all hope for minimal operation levels for the commission, as a reflection of what was happening. Clearly, if people are intent on destroying and undermining what the commission is intended to achieve, they will carry on doing so. It is up to people of good will to try to persuade them to do otherwise. That is in addition to the imposition of legislation. There should be a reliance on law, not imagined hurts.
<P>
The Bill has been drafted to deal with the framework of public processions. The counter-demonstration problem has also arisen in debate. I have given an undertaking to return to some of the relevant issues that arose in previous debates, to try to improve the Bill. However, with respect to the present group of amendments, I hope that I have explained the Government's reasoning. We have laid down variable requirements as to commission numbers. The matter will depend on work load, and there is built-in flexibility.
<P>
A question was asked about the number of parades that could be expected. We do not know what will happen in the year ahead, but the best guess has been taken on the basis of past experience. Clearly, if matters develop less favourably than we expect, we shall have to revisit the matter. That is why people of good will and all who want peace in Northern Ireland should not encourage the disruption of public processions in the way that some Opposition Members have described, or the frustration of the Bill. I do not say that the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is calling for that. Clearly, the commission's analysis is based on past experience. If its members could predict the future, they would be playing the lottery rather than serving on the commission to earn money from the public purse.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> One of my difficulties with the Bill is that the report suggested that the commission would deal with controversial parades. However, the wording of the Bill implies that the commission will deal with every parade. Someone could fill in a form and give it to the police, who would send it to the commission, which would have to decide formally whether to make a determination on a parade. That is impractical. In June and July, the commission will receive hundreds, perhaps thousands of applications. How can the commission meet formally, with a quorum of three, to decide whether to make a determination on every parade? The commission will be overwhelmed, and, consequently, will not have the time or the capacity to deal properly even with controversial parades.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I have listened to the Minister and I agree with him. I hope that the Minister listened to my hon. Friend, who spelt out the difficulties that will arise in June and July. I envisage a cactus of problems this year--and we know how many jags there are in a cactus.
<P>
We need balance. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire drew attention to the fact that there was supposed to be a gender, a geographical and a cross-community balance. I am not sure whether ``cross-community balance'' refers to a balance between Unionists and nationalists in the broadest terms, or whether it specifically means Unionists, the SDLP, Sinn Fein, the UDP, Alliance and so on. There are more than two communities. There is, for example, a Roman Catholic community, a Church of Ireland community, a Presbyterian community, an atheist community and a Chinese community in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Those communities are all distinct from one another. The mind boggles when it is suggested that four people can represent everyone. Does ``cross-community'' refer only to religion, or does it cover other issues? Ethnic and political divisions also exist. The Bill does not define ``cross-community''.
<P>
The Minister talked about a balance between interests. The Bill assumes that all objections are valid because they are based on disruption to the life of the community by processions, the behaviour of participants and the lack of welcome to processions from the host community. However, the evidence not only of my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone and I, but of the past two or three years contradicts the idea that objections are valid.
<P>
The evidence shows that objections are simply a cloak for paramilitary organisations that are out to wreck Northern Ireland. They have chosen processions as the means by which to achieve that. That is not new. The problem goes back to the civil rights campaign, legal civil rights processions in the 1960s, and the horrendous events in January 1972 that left so many dead in Londonderry as a direct consequence of an illegal procession. That procession, in common with all others at the time, had been banned to restore some stability and peace to the community. The ban was ignored by the procession's organisers. Therefore, we are not tackling a new problem. Processions, objections to them and the violence that follows constitutes a long-standing phenomenon in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister said that we should probably revisit the Bill. We shall certainly return to the subject and when we do so, I hope that we shall look further at following the American system and allowing all processions. I hope that the Minister has something more to say to me, Mr. Butterfill. If he does not, perhaps you will call me to speak again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I do not have much more to say. The hon. Members for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry have described a doom-laden scenario. It depresses anyone who is not involved with events in Northern Ireland to hear it said that everything will fail. Those words do not convey a determination to make things work. We need to ask how we can make things better? How can we improve our society? That is what the taxpayers of Great Britain want to hear from respected representatives in the House. They do not want to hear constantly the dark side of the debate, although that must be analysed and examined and answers must be found.
<P>
We have moved into a wider area than the one that we should be discussing. However, as more general issues have been raised, I should like to make it clear to the Committee that the Bill is an attempt to find a better way forward. It is not intended to create conflict. Under schedule 1, the Parades Commission has been given a difficult job. The hon. Members for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry have a responsibility to work alongside the Parades Commission; not to attack and undermine it constantly. When the Bill becomes law, they have an obligation, as legislators to uphold the law of the land. I hope that they will take that on board. Although there might be a difficult scenario over the coming months--and possibly for a longer period--we must all try to find ways forward to resolve the difficulties.
<P>
The Parades Commission will be charged with the task of resolving difficulties. Its numbers have been chosen according to calculations based on the existing work load. If the scenario that has been set out by the hon. Members for West Tyrone and for East Londonderry develops, that will be a dark future for Northern Ireland. No one in Great Britain wants to see that. I hope that the hon. Gentlemen do not want to see that and that they will work alongside the Parades Commission and those who have been appointed to bring about a better future for Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> No one in Northern Ireland wants to see the scenes that Ulster Unionist Members believe will arise as a result of the Bill. We have to live in Northern Ireland; our constituents and our friends have died there.
<P>
The Government, and many others, have missed the significance of last week. There were two elements in the murders of last week: the first was a straightforward revenge motive following the murder of William Wright; the second was to inspire sheer terror, by killing totally innocent Roman Catholic people in the most horrific fashion. The lesson from those events is that if the Government or anyone else think that they can create a united Ireland by sleight of hand, or by actions behind the scenes that undermine the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, it will be a bloody and desperate business.
<P>
The Minister referred to the taxpayers of Great Britain. I remind him that there are taxpayers in Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland have had to live with the situation there. The Bill is nonsense and will do nothing to add to peace and harmony. It will create disruption, danger and misery for many. However, given that our discussion has ranged widely and that these matters will be debated further in future, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have had a rather wide discussion, reminiscent of our debate on clause 1. I hope that hon. Members can now restrict their remarks to the amendments.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 120, in page 12, line 34, at end add
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`but no person shall serve for more than two terms'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross:</B> There are two reasons for the amendment. First, we need to know the reasons behind the commission's decisions; we want to see the evidence. We will not be satisfied with the statement that this or that procession will be allowed to go ahead. The people of Northern Ireland not only want to know the reason, but they need to know it, and they need to know it at the time, not six months down the line.
<P>
I move on to amendment No. 120. Leaders of organisations such as the Fair Employment Commission--formerly agency--whose leading light is Mr. Cooper, seem to be waterproof, even fireproof against all criticism. It seems that an individual such as Mr. Cooper can go on for ever like an ever rolling stream, until he decides to retire. That is wrong: nobody should serve for more than two terms on such a body, so that fresh minds can be brought in at regular intervals. The amendments are reasonable and I hope that the Government will have the good sense to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I shall deal first with amendment No. 119, which deals with powers to remove someone from a public body--in this case the Parades Commission. Only in exceptional circumstances would the Secretary of State feel that she had no option but to remove someone from office. That applies generally to any public body.
<P>
It is important to place the matter in context. We are dealing with people of good will who have been adjudged by the merit process which may well reflect the regard of their communities. They have decided to serve on these bodies, so only in exceptional circumstances would a decision be taken to remove them. In that event, the Secretary of State would seek to set out her reasons for so doing as fully as possible.
<P>
I hesitate to provide examples of information that is available to the Secretary of State--and perhaps to me as a security Minister--which should not be allowed into the public domain. I mention that in passing as a matter that could be taken into consideration. The issues must be taken in the round. The reality is that when people are appointed, they are adjudged to be the best available to serve on a public body. As I said, removal would take place only in exceptional circumstances and the Secretary of State would explain why the removal was necessary.
<P>
I come now to amendment No. 120. While the Parades Commission does not fall within the remit of the commissioner for public appointments, the Government have nevertheless adopted the North recommendation to follow the commissioner's guidelines regarding the number of terms of office for which members should be permitted to serve on a public body.
<P>
The commissioner's guidelines provide that, normally, no single individual should serve for more than two full terms in the same office. However, the guidelines allow for individuals to serve for a third term in certain circumstances--for example, to provide greater continuity when more members than expected decide to depart at the end of a specific term. That can happen and it is useful to have some flexibility. On the basis, I ask that the amendments be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I have heard the Minister's reasons. I shall certainly give them further consideration and return to the issues on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendments, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 79, in page 12, line 40, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The quorum for the purposes of a determination under section 7 shall be 3 where there are 5 members of the Commission, 4 where there are 6 members of the Commission and 5 where there are 7 members of the Commission.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In our earlier debate on schedule 1, paragraph 2, hon. Members expressed their concern about the number of people who should be appointed to the commission. It was argued strongly that it would be difficult to accommodate a representative number of people within a restricted membership. Most of us anticipate that membership of the commission will be extended to the maximum permitted by the schedule: a chairman and not more than six other members.
<P>
The amendment covers the eventuality that there could be seven members: a chairman and six other members. In such a case it would not be good practice for the Parades Commission to have to operate with a quorum of three. The amendment would grade the quorum upwards as the membership of the body increased. My firm definition is that the quorum for a meeting of the commission shall stand at three, but a quorum for a determination shall be more if the membership of the board is more than four.
<P>
An additional practical reason for the amendment is that it is important that there is confidence in the commission's decisions; we hope that the confidence will be shared by all the interests that were articulated earlier. If, for example, only three people were making the determination and it was made by a majority--the next paragraph refers to that issue--it could mean that only two people were making a judgment on behalf of the entire commission. That would not give the community the necessary confidence to believe that there had been sufficient input into the determination. There are two aspects to the amendment: first, the practical matter of numbers and, secondly, the perception of credibility and therefore the acceptance of the determination.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> We read the amendment with interest. It goes a long way to accomplishing our general view set out in amendment No. 166 and we give it our most hearty support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The Committee has come to a better frame of mind. Having heard the numeracy test that my hon. Friend the Member for South Down set me and the details that he gave, I find it hard to argue against the amendment's logic. An important point has been made--
<P>
<B>Helen Jackson </B>(Sheffield, Hillsborough): Christmas has arrived!
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> My hon. Friend says that Christmas has arrived. I would not go as far as that; I am not going to accept the amendment as drafted, but I will reconsider it to discover how best it can be applied on Report.
<P>
Public bodies usually have a specified number set down as a quorum, and the proposal takes that practice forward. However, the hon. Member for South Down makes a fair point and his amendment has garnered cross-Committee support. I shall amend the Bill accordingly on Report if the amendment's aims can be achieved. I hope that my hon. Friend will therefore withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> I underscore that the amendment has cross-community support. On the basis of the Minister's assurance--almost, but not quite, his undertaking--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provisions relating to code of conduct, procedural rules and guidelines</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 15, line 18, leave out `or tribunal'.
<P>
Perhaps the word ``tribunal'' appears somewhere else in the Bill, but I have yet to find it. However, I could read through the Bill word by word until I reach it. As the word does not appear to be mentioned elsewhere, will the Minister tell us why it appears in the schedule? Will he tell us what type of the tribunal it will be, what functions and powers it will have and where it will derive those powers from? I am curious to know all about it.
<P>
In what circumstances will the tribunal sit? How will it be made up and who does it represent? How will its members be chosen? These are important points. The only possible time I envisage the tribunal sitting would be if a Salvation Army procession took a route that it did not customarily follow. It would then be caught by the Bill's provisions, and it might be necessary for a tribunal to consider the issue. I cannot think of any other reason why a tribunal should sit.
<P>
Will the Minister give us a full explanation? A world of possibilities appears to be buried in the words ``or tribunal''. What is intended by their use?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Gentleman is working under a misunderstanding and has misinterpreted the Bill's intention. He has read schedule 2, paragraph (9) to mean that a new tribunal will be set up under the Bill. That is not our intention. The subsection relates to the admissibility of relevant instruments to a court or any other existing tribunal. That includes the code of conduct, the procedural rules and the guidelines. The provision will make such documents admissible in a court or tribunal.
<P>
For example, it is possible that documents might be called for at an industrial relations tribunal or in a fair employment tribunal. The provision will ensure that any tribunal sitting to adjudicate on matters that relate to the codes is able to call for documents in evidence. To remove the word ``tribunal'' from the Bill would deny external tribunals the right to documents that is possessed by a court of law.
<P>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Bill will not set up a new tribunal. The schedule deals with tribunals that already appear in legislation. For that reason, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I have a clearer understanding of what is intended. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedules 2 to 4 agreed to.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I thank you, Mr. Butterfill and your co-Chairman, Mr. Welsh, for the way that you have chaired the Committee. We also had a brief interlude with Mr. Maxton in the Chair. I think he came in, saw what was going on and decided that his presence was required elsewhere. Nevertheless, we thank him for the brief period that he served on the Committee. I should like to thank the Clerks for having to deal with a range of regional accents, but no doubt they are used to that by now in the House of Commons. I would like to thank the officials who helped me and my colleague, and other members of the Committee, in our understanding of the Bill.
<P>
We have had a range of useful debates on the Bill. Sometimes they have been heated and at other times they have been less well mannered than they should have been. Interestingly enough, there have been few cries of ``Order'' to bring us back into line. Sometimes we have strayed off course but the 25 hours we have spent examining the Bill have been purposeful and have achieved their overall objective.
<P>
There was detailed examination in the House of Lords and amendments were made on a cross-community basis. I have given indications that certain matters will be taken away and given due consideration. The Bill clearly takes place at a time when other very important matters are being discussed elsewhere on the future of Northern Ireland. This is an important building block to provide a better future for Northern Ireland. That is the view of the Government and, I believe, of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. They will obviously speak for themselves. I believe it is also the view of the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland.

<P>

<B>Mr. Moss:</B> I endorse the Minister's comments, Mr. Butterfill, particularly those about you and your co-Chairman. You have chaired our deliberations with wisdom and a certain amount of licence for which we thank you. Thanks also go to the Clerks and the officials who have served the Minister extremely well. They have usually been very quick in furnishing the relevant information to the Minister and in the main have done a very useful job, not just in this Committee, but in drawing up the Bill.
<P>
I prefaced my remarks at the start of our proceedings by saying that we would be dealing with an extremely difficult area. It is problematical legislation. Getting it right is a bit of a wing and a prayer. The Minister was right that there is a mood in Northern Ireland that something needs to be done. The North report and the surveys it conducted would bear that out. The vast majority of public opinion is for some sort of solution to the parades problem.
<P>
Whether the Bill will provide that solution in the end, I still have my doubts. That does not mean to say that we have not had constructive Committee proceedings. We have. I thank both Ministers for the courteous way in which they have dealt with our questions, criticisms and amendments. I am pleased that the Minister is still considering some of our amendments.
<P>
I do not want us to get hung on counter-demonstrations or protests. There is sufficient thrust, not only in this Bill, but in the 1987 order and the references to the changes regarding open-air public meetings in schedule 3, to suggest that the Minister has only to go a little way and say that we should forget counter demonstrations and protests and look at open-air public meetings and the advance notice that they require, as recommended by North. An extension could be considered of the commission's powers to ban some open-air public meetings in the light of the intent of people gathering together to protest and to hold a counter demonstration against a legal parade.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We will wait to see what the Minister proposes before we consider our next move on Report. I am pleased that he has agreed to consider the amendments carefully; they were discussed in the House of Lords and assurances were given that they would be looked at in detail. To judge from what the Minister said, there is still some fertile ground for change. My reason for tabling the amendment was to try to improve the Bill and to give the impression to Northern Ireland that this is an even-handed, balanced measure. It is not designed to knock the Orange Order and other loyalist parades but to bring public order to activities in Northern Ireland. In that context I hope that the Minister will think carefully about our proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. William Ross:</B> I express our sincere thanks to you, Mr. Butterfill, for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings. You have allowed our debates to range rather more widely than usual. You have stretched the rules of order, which reflects your sensible judgment that the Bill is highly sensitive and has dangerous connotations in respect of processions in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The Minister and the Opposition spokesman said that everyone in Northern Ireland wants something to be done about parades. Yes, they do: they want peace, they want peaceful processions and they want to return to a peaceful existence. The question that my colleagues and I have asked about this whole affair is whether the Bill will accomplish those objectives. It is argued that it will not because it is founded upon false assumptions, therefore it cannot accomplish its stated objectives.
<P>
Peace is desired; but peace in this context depends not only upon ordinary citizens who want a peaceful existence but upon the IRA, who are determined that they will not have a peaceful existence. I say to the Minister yet again that the Bill will not accomplish its objectives. Peace will be restored when the Government accept that they are either defeated by a terrorist organisation or they defeat it. The other ``or'' is that in Northern Ireland, when the Government are seen to be failing in their duty, other terrorist organisations arise in increasing strength.
<P>
This is a bad Bill. We are, however, grateful for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings, Mr. Butterfill. We are grateful to Mr. Welsh and to Mr. Maxton for their help in the passage of the Bill, and to the officials. However, we cannot say that we are grateful to the Minister for the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. McGrady:</B> On behalf of my hidden party, I thank you, Mr. Butterfill, and Mr. Welsh, for your courtesy and kindness to me. I am impressed by the wisdom of your chairmanship in allowing wide-ranging debate on some matters. That was appropriate because the Bill is so complex and difficult, dealing more with human relationships than with the law of tort per se and other matters.
<P>
The Bill may have many imperfections and it will be tested to the extreme, but let us not leave this Committee with the idea that the only genesis of problems with parades emanates from the IRA. Many other problems emanate from legitimate sources and from concerns that are nothing to do with the IRA: they are the genuine concerns of people and residents of all persuasions in the community. I hope that the Bill when it becomes an Act will help to resolve their problems. As I said, human relationships are more important than legislation but, alas, it seems impossible to get those human relationships in tune, so legislation has to be put in place.
<P>
I am sure that the Bill will face many difficulties. There are many loopholes and anomalies, but at least the intent of the Bill reflects the intent and aspirations of the people of both communities in Northern Ireland who want the proverbial ``something to be done''. The Bill may be the something that we can give them. I am sure that it will be launched with good will, that further amendments will help to improve it and that it will be an acceptable vehicle for the resolution of the annual disputes that cause so much concern and stress--social, economic and otherwise--in our communities.
<P>
Once again I thank you, Mr. Butterfill, your co-chairman, Mr. Welsh, and all the officials for the help and assistance that they have given me.

Question put and agreed to.
