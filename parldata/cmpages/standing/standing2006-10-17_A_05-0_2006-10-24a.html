<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000307"></a>Hon.
Members:</b>
Oh.</div><a name="06102456000013"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000308"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): It&#146;s a
pilot scheme for being
nice.</div><a name="06102456000014"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000309"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I notice that the hon. Gentleman on the Tory
Front Bench, from a sedentary position, seems also to be engaged in a
pilot scheme of being nice&#151;he is managing reasonably well so
far. No doubt, however, we shall be able to get some more rancour into
the debate as the week goes
on.</div><a name="06102456000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 171
would allow the Secretary of State to require those carrying out
assessments of claimants with particular impairments or health
conditions, in relation to limited capability for work, to be trained.
The amendment probes the Government&#146;s intentions in that area.
Given the range and complexity of disabilities, impairments and health
conditions that might be encountered in the assessment process, as
described in previous debates, it is important to ensure that assessors
have the required degree of training, knowledge and understanding of
the full range of those conditions or
impairments.</div><a name="06102456000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
interesting to note that in some cases specialist nurses are used
already for assessments in relation to disability living allowance,
specifically to ensure that specialist knowledge is brought to the
assessment. By contrast, however, personal capability assessments so
far have relied exclusively on general practitioners, but it is widely
believed, particularly by disability lobby groups, that GPs&#146;
knowledge of some conditions or impairments might not be sufficient to
make a reliable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 152</div>assessment. The amendment would empower the Secretary of State to order
such training as might be necessary to bring them up to
speed.</div><a name="06102456000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently there
are no statutory obligations for training for medical assessors in
relation to certain disabilities, particularly in relation to mental
health conditions, learning disabilities and so on. A higher level of
understanding of those non-physical conditions would help to reduce the
current high level of appeals and their high success rate. For example,
in 2003 nearly 48 per cent. of appeals against the refusal of
incapacity benefit were successful; indeed, 68 per cent. were
successful when a citizens advice bureau or other adviser with
expertise in the appellant&#146;s condition attended the appeal. In
many cases, the lack of knowledge of the nature of the condition or
impairment at the initial PCA is cited by appellants as a reason why
they think that the first decision was wrong. The amendment aims to
bring more specialist knowledge to the
PCA.</div><a name="06102456000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000310"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): The hon. Gentleman will not
be surprised to hear that I am very much sympathetic to the lines of
his argument; they are entirely congruent with what we have heard from
disability and other organisations over the
years.</div><a name="06102456000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the hon.
Gentleman accept that there are two practical problems with his
amendment? First, in relation to multiple conditions, is it possible
for any one examiner to have the sufficient range of knowledge to be
able to embrace all the difficulties and their interaction? Secondly,
in order to produce the full range of expertise it might be necessary
to have a panel of people examining simultaneously, which could be
extremely daunting for the
claimant.</div><a name="06102456000020"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000311"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes two very good points.
Of course, it might be asking a lot for the same doctor to have
expertise in every single potential condition, impairment or
disability. That is a valid point, and if the answer was to have a
panel of people who a claimant might appeal to, that too might be
intimidating. It could also reinforce some of the biggest problems with
the assessment process at the moment.</div>
<a name="06102456000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to disability
living allowance, specialist nurses can be called upon where someone
with a particular condition is presenting. Bearing in mind that in the
application for employment and support allowance the applicant has to
spell out their reasons, it should be possible to predict with a large
degree of accuracy the cases in which some form of specialist input
might be useful. That could mean either ensuring that the doctor who is
carrying out the assessment has the requisite skills, knowledge or
understanding or,if they do not and if no one in that
particular locality has those skills and experience, making sure that
another specialist doctor or a specialist nurse could be brought
in.</div> <a name="06102456000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not seeking
to create an unnecessarily burdensome or intimidating assessment
procedure. What I am seeking to probe is the extent to which the
Government consider it important that specific knowledge of health
conditions or disabilities is included in the assessment process to
ensure that it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 153</div>accurate. This is also important in relation to fluctuating conditions,
particularly those, such as MS, where specialist knowledge of the
condition may be useful in carrying out an assessment.</div>
<a name="06102456000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Particular representations have
been made to me in relation to people with autism or autistic spectrum
disorders. According to the National Autistic Society, 40 per cent of
GPs do not have enough information to make informed assessments in
relation to disorders on the autistic spectrum. It is worth noting that
only 6 per cent of people who are autistic in some way are in
employment. That is an incredibly low figure compared with 49 per cent
for disabled people as a whole. This may, therefore, be an area where
having a degree of specialist knowledge throughout the assessment
process would really help to add value at all stages. I shall be
grateful if the Minister will address that point specifically in his
response.</div>
<a name="06102456000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000312"></a><b class="B">John
Robertson</b> (Glasgow, North-West) (Lab): The training for
assessors has been brought up in the past and I know that
Mr. Hood said that we would not have any stand part debate
on this clause, so I feel that this is a good point to raise
it.</div> <a name="06102456000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Training in
general terms is a concern of many bodies that represent people with
disabilities; the fear is that a general practitioner would be given a
job as an assessor with absolutely no knowledge of some of the problems
suffered by the people that they would be assessing.</div>
<a name="06102456000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can my hon. Friend the Minister
allay my fears on that, and maybe go into some detail on the training
for assessors? Can he also clarify the point on collation of
information? I mentioned that when we debated an earlier amendment. It
is important that he reiterates the fact that we would pull in all
information and, if all the information were not available, we could go
back over it a second time to gather any missing information.</div>
<a name="06102456000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) makes good points
about the fact that it may be necessary to bring in more than one
expert for discussion. I would like to know what sort of liaison is
carried out in relation to talking to the medical experts, whether they
are, for example, experts on injuries or on mental
health.</div><a name="06102456000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000313"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Amess, on
this grey morning&#151;not as cheerful as the other days when you
have been in the Chair.</div>
<a name="06102456000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to tease out from
the Minister a couple of points which bear on what the hon. Member for
Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson) has just said. On the question of
the types of people who would be doing the assessing, the Secretary of
State in evidence to the Select Committee in the Spring this year
said,</div><a name="06102456000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;my understanding
is that people agree that we should involve the skills and expertise of
a wider relevant range of healthcare professionals to help us do
this.&#148;</div>
<a name="06102456000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#147;Wider&#148; implies wider than
is the case under the current regime. He went on to
say:</div><a name="06102456000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
will be a list of people, I am sure, occupational therapists and
physiotherapists and others, but who actually is involved in individual
assessments I think is going to have to be something we discuss with
people over the next few months.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div><a name="06102456000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is fair enough; the Secretary of
State says that a wider range of specialists and professionals will be
involved. I think I know which group polices and executes the
conditions under the current regime, but it would be extremely useful,
given that the Secretary of State was generous in saying that he would
consult on involving a wider range, if the Minister could give us some
information on that.</div>
<a name="06102456000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">That brings me to my second
point. Does it trouble me? I do not know&#151;it niggles a bit at the
back ofmy mind. In evidence to the Select
Committee,Dr. Boardman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists,
who gave a lot of evidence for the excellent Select Committee report on
the pathways programme, set a hare running&#151;certainly in my mind,
if a hare can be set running in a person&#146;s mind, and I think
other people were also worried&#151;on the question whether there
would be enough people to carry out the wider assessments. Obviously,
there will be more varied assessments under provisions in these clauses
than under the current regime; we all know that.</div>
<a name="06102456000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea was floated that lay
people could be trained to carry out the mental health assessments,
which is an interesting idea. The reason I want the Minister&#146;s
view on that point is that Dr. Boardman is very distinguished and a bit
of a player in incapacity benefit reform. He said to the Select
Committee that</div> <a name="06102456000253"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is
quite possible, for example, to train anybody to do a perfectly good
interview with somebody with a mental health problem and come up with a
reliable judgment. This is used in research all the time. When we look
at the results, say, of the OPCS survey of Psychiatric Morbidity in
Great Britain, a national survey, this was all done by lay interviewers
using a particular form of structured interview.&#148;</div>
<a name="06102456000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know what is in the mind of
Ministers but that distinguished psychiatrist raised the possibility of
lay people carrying out mental health assessments. I do not have a
preconceived view, but I would be interested to know whether the new
regime will recruit lay assessors for the mental health component of
the tests that we are considering.</div>
<a name="06102456000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point relates to
observations fromSue Christoforou and Mind. I shall quote,
becausethe quotation raises powerfully the main issue of this
amendment and a theme that is a leitmotif of the whole Bill. We have
personal advisers under the pathways programme and we will have
personal advisers under the new regime, but do they and will they have
enough training? Later I hope to show that the advisers themselves do
not feel that they have enough of a skill set to be able to do the
extra things required of them under the new regime.</div>
<a name="06102456000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mind
said:</div><a name="06102456000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
majority of doctors who carry out
PCAs&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06102456000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">this is
under the current
regime&#151;</div><a name="06102456000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be
locums. Most will be GPs who have done a day&#146;s work and will do
PCAs in addition.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is Mind&#146;s view; I am not necessary impugning all those who work
with and for Atos Origin. I have seen a simulated version of Atos
Origin&#146;s PCA in Woking and it seems to be a professional
company.</div><a name="06102456000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;They
do get some condition-specific training but it is very limited. They
certainly do not have much in-depth knowledge of mental health problems
in the experience of our&#148;&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div><a name="06102456000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mind&#146;s&#151;</div>
<a name="06102456000257"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;advisers who work with people
with mental health
problems.</div><a name="06102456000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">I spoke
recently to one of our welfare rights advisers. She attended, I think,
50 PCAs with various clients and in only one case did she find the
person to have any understanding of what the issues were, to treat the
person with respect, and to conduct the assessment at a pace that could
give the person the opportunity to discuss as much as needed to be
discussed in order for the assessment to be thorough. So I think, given
that40 per cent. of people in receipt of incapacity benefit at
the moment have a primary diagnosis of mental health problems, not to
mention whatever per cent there is of the rest of the caseload who have
a secondary diagnosis, it has to be the case that the doctors
conducting PCAs have to have a thorough, possibly NVQ level three
mental health training at the very least, as indeed should decision
makers, in order to make proper
judgments.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000278"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="06102456000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking
not about decision makers here, but about the cutting edge assessment
that is the subject of the clause and the amendment. I certainly know
from one of the Department for Work and Pensions reports on evaluation
of pathways that the NVQ level 2 was the average for incapacity benefit
personal assessments. An NVQ level 3 in mental health is being asked
for here.</div> <a name="06102456000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
observations may be partial. Perhaps Atos or Ministers will dispute
what Mind has said, but it is an interesting debating point which
relates to the amendment. I should be grateful if the Minister
responded to that point. I have no idea whetherDr.
Boardman&#146;s suggestion that lay people can be trained to do
mental health assessment is sensible or not, but it would be useful to
hear the Minister&#146;s views on that and on the point that the
Secretary of State raised in evidence to the Select
Committee.</div>
<a name="06102456000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000314"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): Good morning,
Mr. Amess. Earlier in our deliberations the Minister
outlined a process whereby, at the early stages of an assessment, a
paper sift would be possible. I have been looking at cases in my
constituency and at the level to which the NHS can now treat conditions
that hitherto were untreatable. I cite the case of a woman in my
constituency who was horrifically attacked. She was unfortunate to be
attacked but lucky to be alive, given the extent of her injuries. She
would like to work now but, unfortunately, the consultant vascular
surgeon who is treating the injuries to her brain says that she would
be ill advised to do so because he has been able to stabilise her only
enough to be at home, not to be able to go out to work.</div>
<a name="06102456000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the current system,
people looking at my constituent and answering the questions would
assess her as suitable to work because they would not look closely
enough at the consultant&#146;s advice. I want the new process to
take account of such clear advice from a consultant that someone would
be harmed by going through the process, and that the injuries are such
that it could be a threat to their life if such a process were to
continue. We should all be assured that the almost daily advances of
medical science can catch up with the process that we are trying to
deliver for another part of someone&#146;s
life.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000315"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I should like to add one or two comments to this
extremely interesting set of exchanges and questions for the Minister.
If one looks at the rubric of the clause it seems to be about limited
capability for work, which is a kind of lay assessment that, on the
other hand, requires professional expertise to provide the gateway. I
think that trying to blend those two concepts is inherent in some of
the comments made already and, indeed, in the difficulties that the
traditional PCA system has met&#151;the high level of appeals and so
forth. That is not because assessors are wicked or malicious people
proceeding in a hurry, but because their job is inherently very
difficult.</div><a name="06102456000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">My comments
are informed by my now dated experience of being responsible for the
disability brief, and by when the Department kindly arranged for me to
visit Atos&#151;or rather its precursor, Schlumberger&#151;to
observe how it trained its assessing doctors. One day, I sat in on a
session. I went with some trepidation because I thought, as a lay
person, &#147;What on earth can I do?&#148;, but, by the second
hour of the process, I realised that essentially we were in the same
job&#151;I did not see theirs as being very different from mine or,
indeed, any other Member&#146;s when dealing with a constituent at an
advice bureau or surgery, depending on what we call them. The job
involved putting people at ease, enabling them to express themselves
and forming a general view of their condition. That is a stream of the
matter.</div> <a name="06102456000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I and
others in Committee have said before, the ability to encourage
claimants or customers&#151;call them what we may&#151;to act
positively and to express themselves authentically is an important part
of the process. However, the assessment is a gateway to a benefit, so
it is perhaps understandable that it should require a professional
framework, particularly for the physical side. Historically, the IB
process has been driven primarily by physical conditions, such as
muscular skeletal or circulatory problems, but now it is largely
informed by people&#146;s mental conditions. I am saying not that too
much emphasis is placed on mental health, but that anything that might
lead to a clinical illness is examined&#151;the claimant might just
lack confidence. Tuning that change is a difficult part of the
process.</div><a name="06102456000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect
that somebody will ask me to comment, albeit briefly, on my visit last
Friday to the pathways to work pathfinder in Derby. Members were aware
that I was going, and I found it a positive experience and quite
encouraging. However, I came across some information about the mental
health aspect which made me think, &#147;Well, I have not really
focused on this before.&#148; Conventionally, it is said that some 40
per cent. of benefit claims fall within the mental health framework,
but if we include secondary mental health effects&#151;for instance,
for people who have a physical condition such as back pain that has
consequences for how they feel&#151;we are probably looking at two
out of every three claimants. So that is a very big part of the
matter.</div><a name="06102456000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
proposition not a conclusion: the Minister should address the fact that
more people are presenting a series of mental conditions, which are
inherently less easy to measure, and indeed, doctors are often less
equipped to deal with them than with somebody who 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div>has, say, a limb deficiency or circulatory problems.The
situation is becoming more difficult. The tests encourage people to
show their capability for work, not whether they have a series of
finite medical conditions that would make work
impossible.</div><a name="06102456000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a
complex and difficult matter. My exchange with the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander) was
designed to eliminate some of the practical difficulties. Does one have
a full suite of people taking account of allthe circumstances?
Is the cure for that lack of omnicompetence worse than the disease of
not being omnicompetent? Those are difficult issues for the
Department.</div><a name="06102456000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">I add one
more thing. I suspect that there might be a medical test here. It would
fall outside the Committee&#146;s remit to ruminate on whether the
law, and in particular the growth of administrative law, has helped the
nation&#146;s commonwealth, as it were, or impeded it. It is
certainly very good for the lawyers&#151;a member of my family is a
practitioner in that area&#151;but I am not sure whether it adds to
the sum of human
happiness.</div><a name="06102456000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
difficulties, if one uses lay people, is that the nature of their
assessment and the appropriateness of their training become directly
relevant. There is a certain expectation about an examining doctor who
has been registered with the General Medical Council and who meets
certain professional standards and indeed professional commitments and
duties. No matter how they behave, and they normally try to behave in a
highly professional manner, they have at least some cover for their
position. If, on the other hand, one uses a barefoot doctor or a lay
helper on the medical health side, however well intentioned and however
well skilled, it may be that they do not have the kind of professional
coverage that would prevent them or the Department from being
challenged in court. These are serious issues that the Minister and his
Department need to
address.</div><a name="06102456000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where we go
from here should be informed by one simple test. We need to be able to
assess people&#146;s capacity for work in the round. We need to do it
in a way that is positive and sympathetic and emphasises their capacity
and not what they cannot do. That is going to require a rather broader
and more holistic approach than we have had hitherto.</div>
<a name="06102456000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rehearse one more point as
the Minister might like to say something and I do not want to make it
seem banal by leaving it till the end. As he will know, and indeed I
have asked questions of the Department, there are now logic-driven
protocols as to how to do assessments. He has referred to the number of
points that is required to pass, or fail, the test, according to the
way one looks at it. I do not think this is wrong as long as it is not
seen as being a literal-minded exercise. It is a guide to good decision
making. Perhaps he could say a little about the use of protocols. Also,
how is this being mapped on to the experience of GPs who are referring
persons for incapacity benefit or writing them sick notes? We need to
have in these complicated areas a better understanding of the process.
We need people to know what they are talking about, to be able to
exchange information professionally in the right way and to have the
right training to carry out
assessments.</div><a name="06102456000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sympathetic to Ministers as they try to pick a way through that and I
would be even more sympathetic if they could reassure us that logic and

<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>protocols will be used as a servant and not as a master in the process.
The underlying principle should be to support, identify and celebrate
the capacity of the individual rather than to conduct some penal
exercise.</div> <a name="06102456000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
the word on the street is that the exercise is designed to take people
off benefit at all costs. I know that that is not the Minister&#146;s
intention, and it is certainly not our intention or that of anyone in
the Committee, but the process has to be fair and in the end fairness
is probably how this will stand or
fall.</div><a name="06102456000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000316"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): May I too welcome
you back to the Chair, Mr. Amess? It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, which, in the best spirit of the employment
and support allowance, has been light-touch and supportive, with
minimal use of sanctions.</div>
<a name="06102456000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that this is an
important amendment because, on the face of it, it is not a matter of
law at all. The reality is that the Secretary of State does not need
regulations passed by this House to insist on proper training for
people who carry out the assessments or indeed for Jobcentre Plus
personal advisers.</div> <a name="06102456000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey for tabling the amendment because it allows us to draw
attention to an important failing in the current system. I ask the
Minister not simply to deal with the point of law and whether the
amendment should be covered by the regulations, but to address the
wider issues that have come up, put most eloquently by my hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell). In particular, I draw
the Minister&#146;s attention to some comments by the Citizens Advice
Bureau. It says that it
has</div><a name="06102456000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;particular concerns
about the ability of Job Centre Plus personal advisers to appropriately
and accurately identify the support needs of people with fluctuating
and unpredictable conditions or those whose conditions are likely to
get progressively better or worse over
time.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
continued:</div><a name="06102456000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Customers
with mental health problems were seen as particularly challenging and
ever more experienced advisers did not feel confident working with
them.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was according
to recent DWP research. There is clearly an issue about the training of
Jobcentre Plus advisers, and if it is important for those
advisers,it is doubly important for those who perform the
assessments.</div>
<a name="06102456000279"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="06102456000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) and I held a
seminar in which we invited representatives from disability
organisations to talk about welfare reform. One very moving submission
came from a lady who had a bipolar disorder. Hers was a fluctuating
condition and she said that when she went through her PCA, she felt
obliged to &#147;ham it up&#148;&#151;her words&#151;because
although at the time she might have been feeling fine, she had little
confidence in the assessor understanding how a fluctuating condition
works. She was worried that unless she pretended to be suffering at
that moment, she might not get the right
assessment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 159</div><a name="06102456000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday, I was in Sheffield
and I met a man with a learning disability who said that his biggest
fear about the assessment was that the assessors did not really
understand the concept of hidden disability. It is easy to grasp the
disability of someone in a wheelchair, but harder if the disability is
hidden. I draw particular attention to the comments of my hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry and the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali
Mountford). This is a hugely complicated area; it is particularly
difficult to grasp the difference between a learning disability and a
mental illness. A lot of people with learning disabilities also have a
mental illness, but it is crucial, if there is to be confidence in the
system, that assessors understand that difference and know what can be
sorted out by the NHS and what is a long-term
condition.</div><a name="06102456000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds made the point clearly that we
do not want the debate to descend to the level of tabloid arguments
about welfare scroungers. If the assessment does not have credibility,
and if the ability of assessors to accurately determine whether someone
has a hidden disability and to discriminate between that and mental
illness is not absolutely rock solid, we will give ammunition to those
trying to discredit the whole
process.</div><a name="06102456000064"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000317"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): I do not want to make
a speech, so I shall keep this to an intervention. What the hon.
Gentleman said is very important, especially on the distinction between
a mental illness and a learning disability. However, there is no way in
the world that national legislation or even local practice can ensure
that those will always be correctly identified. There is absolutely no
way of doing that. It is important, however, that this legislation
involves organisations with expertise in the identification of those
differences and includes them in the assessment phase in order to deal
with claimants and show them where to go so that they can access the
help that they need. That is what the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds
was talking about&#151;a more holistic approach. Rather than using
lay people, we should bring in
organisations&#151;</div><a name="06102456000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000318"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The Committee is delighted to hear the
hon. Lady, but I think that that did turn out to be a
speech.</div><a name="06102456000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000319"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady; she made an
important point, enthused, I am sure, by her work on the Select
Committee.</div><a name="06102456000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000320"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> As we look forward to the use of contractors in
pathways, which my hon. Friend and I would be happy to accept as a
principle, is it notalso extremely important that there is
also some commonality of understanding as to the availability of
expertise and practice? Although the contractors are responsible for
their areas, they need to operate within the same general framework so
that the test is not merely seen to be fair nationally, but is also
seen to operate evenly and fairly between different
localities.</div><a name="06102456000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000321"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I do not
want to prejudge what the Minister says, but I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>suspect that the fact that this test is conducted by contractors gives
the Secretary of State the opportunity to include any training
requirements into the contractual stipulations, and that would probably
preclude the necessity for legislation or regulation. I completely
agree with the comment of the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire
(Natascha Engel) that no national legislation can deal with the
complexity of these issues.</div>
<a name="06102456000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I ask the Minister to
address is not the legal point on this amendment, but the substantive
point of the very real concern about the understanding of hidden
disabilities, in particular among people performing the PCA as it is
now or the revised PCA and, indeed, among Jobcentre Plus personal
advisers. If this programme is to be successful, there is no doubt that
this issue needs to be
addressed.</div><a name="06102456000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000322"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Good morning to you, Mr. Amess, on
this rather dreich morning that we are enjoying in SW1. I am delighted
to see you with us
again.</div><a name="06102456000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond
first of all to the comment by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey
(Mr. Hunt), by necessity, I have to respond to the legal and
technical sense of the amendment, but I am happy to respond also to the
common-sense comments. I accept it is a probing amendment, but let me
explain why it would not be legally necessary. All health care
professionals undergo such training as designated by the Secretary of
State that he or she considers to be appropriate before they are
approved to carry out medical assessments to determine limited
capability for work. With regard to the specific suggestion that we
place this provision in regulations, we cannot as a Committee, a
Government or Parliament micro-manage every intervention and interface
between a health care professional or a health care practitioner and
each of the customers. To put it in regulations would be generally
accepted as impractical. It would leave us sluggish and with an
inability to respond to ever-changing circumstances. It would also fly
in the face of so much else we are trying to do in terms of empowering
personal advisers and ensuring that at a local level a situation
evolves and changes quickly enough to be able to support people
regardless of their circumstance or condition.</div>
<a name="06102456000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Secretary of State has the
power to designate what would be appropriate training and also the
appropriate support that either assessment staff or personal advisers
should undertake and offer to customers. As this has proven through
pathways to be an effective way to operate, I think that it is the best
way to proceed. I hope the hon. Gentleman accepts the strictly legal
point that we have the power at the moment and that this power is
entirely flexible and enables us to respond to evolving
circumstances.</div> <a name="06102456000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will
try to respond in the time available to the 25 or 27 questions that
were asked, but if hon. Members do not think that I have done so they
can intervene or we can take it up further in our
proceedings.</div> <a name="06102456000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey, it is absolutely clear&#151;we said it on
Second Reading and we say it again today on the record&#151;that, as
we change our ambition, in trying to support people who in
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>past have been written off, and on the basis that we are not being party
political at the moment, let us just say that they were written off for
whatever reason by

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000324"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000325"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> If I could help the Minister out inthe
spirit of consensus, may I ask whether a drafting suggestion would be
acceptable? Successive Governments up until and including this one
have, regrettably, tended to write off those who have been furthest
away from work. All politicians of all parties should acknowledge that
they have not performed as they should in helping those people. We
should all celebrate that acknowledgment on both sides today in
Committee. Does the Minister agree?</div>
<a name="06102456000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000326"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I do not wish to try your patience, Mr.
Amess, by making this point: I would not accept the amendment, but I
would accept that successive Conservative Governments deliberately
allowed people to be written
off.</div><a name="06102456000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000327"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b><b class="B"> </b>This is not a profitable line to go down. Our
response to the Minister will simply be to ask why, if the problem was
so serious, the Government waited eight or nine years before doing
something about
it.</div><a name="06102456000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000328"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I appeal to the Committee to get back to
the
amendment.</div><a name="06102456000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000329"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> You are right, Mr. Amess.</div>
<a name="06102456000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments are about how we
support the2.7 million people who are on incapacity benefit.
Pathways has been exceptionally successful. The funding for pathways
was not entirely consensual. I know that the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey was not here and did not have the opportunity to vote against
the money for pathways, but if he had been, he would have had the same
opportunity as his hon. Friends.</div>
<a name="06102456000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are having a conversation
about the future and how we support the 2.7 million who are on
incapacity benefit. If no action had been taken in recent years, that
figure would be 4 million. The trajectory through the 1980s, half the
1990s and up till now would have put that figure at 4 million. I say
that simply because I was encouraged to do so by the hon. Gentleman on
the basis that it is important to have consensus about the future.
However, let us not forget that people on incapacity or equivalent
benefits have not been supported as they should have been and that is
across Governments. There was a genuinely dark period for about 10
years, when as a matter of public policy, incapacity benefit numbers
were allowed to treble.</div>
<a name="06102456000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can leave it there if hon.
Members wish, or we can continue the conversation. It is nevertheless a
statement of fact that incapacity benefit numbers trebled over that
period. Nothing different was happening in the environment. We did not
have a sudden outburst of a certain condition or ailment. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>There was nothing different in our air, our water or our food chain. The
numbers simply trebled. We can discuss why that
happened.</div><a name="06102456000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000330"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> May I encourage the Minister to return to what he is
seeking to do in the Bill? If he wants to talk about what happened
under the previous Government more than nine years ago, we will feel
obliged to respond. We interpret those events differently, but I do not
think that it is a good use of the Committee&#146;s time to rake over
those arguments. We certainly do not want to have that
discussion&#151;</div><a name="06102456000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000331"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I appeal to the Committee for the final
time. I ask Members to return to the
amendments.</div><a name="06102456000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000332"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you, Mr. Amess. I will do exactly
as you suggest. Perhaps we will continue that conversation another
time, perhaps even in another place. It is important not to forget the
past so that we can avoid repeating the
mistakes.</div><a name="06102456000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to
the consensual tone of five minutes ago, the hon. Member for Inverness,
Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked about specific support. I was in
the middle of saying that if we are to achieve the ambition that we all
now share to cater for those2.7 million customers, with their
various conditions and complicated and multifaceted needs, and for ESA
customers from 2008, we will need to change the training in Jobcentre
Plus and Atos Origin. When pathways is rolled out nationally, we will
need to change the training given to personal advisers through the
private and voluntary sectors. We will need to change the way in which
all our agencies&#151;not just the DWP, those to whom we subcontract
and Jobcentre Plus, but other aspects of the Government, including the
health service&#151;make support
available.</div>
<a name="06102456000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="06102456000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Quite fairly,
the hon. Member for South-West Surrey mentioned the Citizens Advice
briefing on the clauses and amendments before us. It says:</div>
<a name="06102456000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Citizens Advice
therefore recommends that adequate resources and training be provided
to personal advisers to ensure that those in the support group who
chose to participate in work focused interviews are able to do so in a
meaningful way.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree
absolutely with the thrust of that quote. Of course, it is about a
specific group of customers, but the general thrust&#151;that we need
to provide personal advisers with adequate resources and
training&#151;is entirely fair. We are addressing that point, which
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey raised in
his amendment.</div> <a name="06102456000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
asked specifically about
autism.</div><a name="06102456000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000333"></a>Mr.

<a name="06102456000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000334"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I would like to make some progress before I give
way.</div> <a name="06102456000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was asked
specifically about autism, which is another example of what we are
talking about, although there are many others. We will all have come
across such examples as constituency Members of Parliament and in
preparing for these deliberations 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>and we will all have met people and listened to
their experiences. Entirely fairly, the National Autism Society put it
me that a personal adviser who does not have knowledge or experience of
supporting people with autism could mistake a customer with autism for
someone who was being unco-operative or even belligerent, and think
that they were failing to participate. We will ensure that that
important point and others that are made to us feed through the
process. Indeed, that is why, in preparing for the revised public
consultation, I and the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,
my hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs. McGuire),
ensured that autism groups could join some of the technical working
groups in which they had not taken part before. We did that to ensure
that we were sensitive to the autism
spectrum.</div>
<a name="06102456000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000335"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> It just occurs to me that the Minister might like
to comment on the fact that there are also quite strong management and
organisational implications for the Department. Much as we want
outreach&#151;it will certainly be important that rural areas are
also covered&#151;it is equally important that the body of expertise
in a pathways area or its successor, whether contractorised or in the
Department&#146;s capacity, should draw on the advice of specialists
with background knowledge of the individual that is appropriate to the
case.</div>
<a name="06102456000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000336"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I welcome the hon. Gentleman back from his sojourn
in Derby and I am delighted to see him back in his place. He is right
in the sense that it is important, certainly when subcontracting, that
we bring in niche experience and niche service. I will not say which
organisation might be involved, because Ministers are, quite rightly,
not involved in the contracting process.</div>
<a name="06102456000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me step away from the
matter of autism for a moment, however, and deal with the general
point. I recently visited constituencies in west central Scotland to
listen to the experiences of people in pathways and on long-term IB. I
had the sense that trade unions, for example, which had previously
represented and supported the work force in heavy industry&#151;there
is no longer any heavy industry in that community&#151;and which had
campaigned for their members while they were in work, could bid for
some of the contracts to support people in pursuing their right to work
now that they were out of work and had been on IB for a long period.
Such people might have been on IB for10 years, but that does
not preclude a trade union from becoming involved in providing the
support for work-focused interviews that will get people closer to the
labour market. In talking about private and voluntary sector pathways,
we have not yet properly discussed the role of trade unions and other
progressive organisations and charities in the voluntary sector in
supporting people using the relationship of relative trust that exists
already. That would be
important.</div><a name="06102456000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000337"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In the spirit of the Minister&#146;s remarks,
does he not agree that it should at least be open for a consortium or
partnership that may well involve some of the groups that he mentioned
as well as the private sector or other representatives to make a joint
bid?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div><a name="06102456000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000338"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and we are
looking at ways in which we can further devolve that contract, so that
a group of organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors
can work together and say, &#147;In and of ourselves, we could not
provide this, but collectively in this area we think that we
could&#148;. That would be an important and welcome departure from
the current
situation.</div><a name="06102456000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000339"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> If I may, I should like to return to the substance
of the clause, which is about the training provided to assessors. With
the indulgence of the Chair, we widened the debate to include Jobcentre
Plus personal advisers in general. I think that the Minister said that
he recognised that something needed to be done and that plans are
afoot. Will he give us details about those
plans?</div><a name="06102456000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000340"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I think that Jobcentre Plus staff undergo 13 weeks
of initial training and are encouraged to undertake further training.
However, it is clear that, by 2008, Jobcentre Plus will not be
undertaking PCAs&#151;indeed, in most cases it will not be
undertaking five of the six work-focused interviews. It will be
conducting only the first of them, in most instances.</div>
<a name="06102456000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite the fact that the role
of Jobcentre Plus is changing, it will remain an important
organisation; it will still come face to face with most
customers&#151;although probably only once because the other five
work-focused interviews will be conducted by the private and voluntary
sectors. It will meet people with different experiences. Many people at
Jobcentre Plus have already undertaken excellent training and done
fantastic work on pathways. Indeed, the success of pathways is due in
part to the skills that many people at Jobcentre Plus have that enable
them to support claimants. The hon. Member for Daventry saw that for
himself only last
week.</div><a name="06102456000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Between now and
2008, on the basis that Jobcentre Plus will see all sorts of people who
until now it might not have, and be expected to provide them with
support and advice that until now it has not been expectedto
provide, the training will have to be adjusted accordingly. I do not
have a set of prescriptive solutions that state exactly what will
happen in 2008. Jobcentre Plus&#146;s training will adapt to the
demands of ESA in 2008 and we will work with its senior managers to
ensure that that does
happen.</div><a name="06102456000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000341"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not want us to career off into the realm of
personal advisers just yet because we will get to that later.</div>
<a name="06102456000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that the amendment
relates to the skill levels of assessors involved in the reformed PCA,
and the work-related activity and work-focused health-related
assessments. I would be grateful if the Minister responded to my point
about the wider range of professionals at the new reformed PCA stage
that the Secretary of State was talking about in March. What level of
training will they have?</div>
<a name="06102456000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000342"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Amess, I
shall come on to the content of the amendment. We can pick up on the
wider points about the training of personal advisers later in
proceedings.</div><a name="06102456000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman mentioned comments by Mind&#151;both his and Mind&#146;s
intentions were fair, I 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>know&#151;but Atos Origin has 273 full-time doctors. As he knows, it
is not a hotch-potch of part-time GPs doing extra shifts. It has 273
full-time doctors. GPs who work half-day a week as part of their
involvement in the assessments have to undergo similar refresher
training to doctors at Atos Origin. As he accepts, those doctors do not
do it for some overtime, as is also the case with Mind.</div>
<a name="06102456000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The specifics of training Atos
Origin and other health care professionals relate to the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West. They will receive
training in disability analysis, which of course requires different
skills, by 2008. The training includes aspects of clinical medicine,
the gathering and evaluation of evidence and report writing. We know
from our constituency experience that report writing has improved in
recent years, but how the reports are structured and what is in them is
still a source of friction. The language must be understandable to
people with no medical background or experience, particularly those
with fluctuating mental health conditions. There is also training in
general customer care issues such as equal opportunities, how to handle
or avoid complaints and how to carry out assessments sensitively. I
believe that those undergoing the training also have to undertake four
additional modules a year, and as we move towards 2008 we will assess
whether that is the appropriate
number.</div><a name="06102456000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">On a point
that my hon. Friends have raised, health care professionals will be
expected to access additional information through the new PCA when
appropriate, perhaps from a local GP or increasingly from other health
care professionals in the community&#151;psychiatric nurses and
others&#151;who have a relationship of trust and knowledge with
customers and experience of them that an Atos Origin doctor might not
have. That is the sort of additional information that the Secretary of
State alluded to.</div><a name="06102456000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will ensure that the technical groups keep the revised PCA under review
so that it is fit for purpose, particularly on mental health, and is
achieving what we want. That is on top of the commitment that we have
already made that the PCA will run alongside the current PCA, so that
there are no unintended
consequences.</div><a name="06102456000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
responded to the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow,
North-West made on additional medical experts. In an earlier sitting,
he asked how we will gather relevant information, on time, that is
clear enough for decisions to be made. My response was that we will
ensure that there is an additional phase of reconsideration. We will
not simply gather information and come to a judgment that might be
wrong because not all the relevant information has been provided, asked
for, or provided in the right way to enable an informed decision. The
move towards reconsideration in advance of any appeals process will
ensure that decisions are right the first time round and based on
accurate information. In response to the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds, it is important to say that the chief medical officer, on
behalf of the Secretary of State, agrees the content of the training
syllabus and the materials used. That will provide an additional
opportunity for technical and professional input as we move towards
2008 and the employment and support allowance.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div><a name="06102456000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also
mentioned the comments of Dr. Boardman. Neither the hon. Gentleman nor
I are medically qualified, as Dr. Boardman is. I believe that his
suggestion would be difficult to carry out, but a number of people have
argued the case for training others to provide the mental health
support that folk require. For example, yesterday I met representatives
of the Scottish Association for Mental Health, who said that they
wanted to find different ways to support people with mental health
issues. They mentioned their own pilots, whereby the association, or
those working on its behalf with mental health experience, can support
people without needing three or four years of medical training. I did
not commit that that is where we wish to be; I said that we should
continue the conversation to see whether it is a valuable route for us
to continue
along.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000343"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> This possibly answers or anticipates the
Minister&#146;s answer to my specific question about what might be
termed the legal cover for this exercise. Should a possible model be
that the assessment process&#151;it will be a process rather than a
spot event in many cases&#151;is monitored or signed off by a medical
practitioner, drawing on information that others, who might not be
formally qualified but who are appropriately trained, bring to that
assessment?</div><a name="06102456000114"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000344"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> On the point made by the hon. Member for Bury St.
Edmunds, the issue is to continue that conversation to find out the
most appropriate way to support people with mental health experience. I
am happy to have that conversation with him and others.</div>
<a name="06102456000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the specific point made by
the hon. Member for Daventry, through the PCA and the revised PCA a
medical health practitioner would carry out the assessments, so
technically they would sign off the assessment. It is important to put
that on the record. However, they would not make the decision. They
would make the assessment, but the decision maker would make the
decision. Hopefully that reassures the hon. Gentleman that a medical
professional would be involved in the
assessment.</div>
<a name="06102456000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000345"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance.
Does he not also agree with something that I have gleaned from my
experience from Jobcentre Plus: when the decision maker considers the
report of the medical practitioner in a PCA case even now, it is not so
much that they hold up their hands and say, &#147;The whole thing is
wrong medically&#148; but that they refer it back? There is then a
dialogue, or expression of views, which enables the process to be
refined and cross-checked.</div>
<a name="06102456000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000346"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises, for the first time in
our proceedings, this important point: a decision maker is not in place
to second-guess the medical assessment of Atos Origin. The decision
maker is a legal necessity, as the legal responsibility lies with them.
The decision maker, when looking at the paperwork, might say,
&#147;Two contrary boxes have been ticked. This does not make sense.
A procedure has not been followed,&#148; after which they would go
back to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div>assessor and ask more questions to probe further. The decision maker is
in place to ensure that processes have been followed and that there is
a robustness to the journey for the customer. They will then make their
decision based on
that.</div><a name="06102456000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important
to say clearly that the decision maker has a legal responsibility, and
that they have a responsibility to ensure that processes have been
followed. They are not in place to overrule, in a medical sense, the
recommendations from those who carry out the
assessments.</div>
<a name="06102456000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000347"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> My hon. Friend has just made an important
point, but it brings into question what happens when two medical
opinions directly contradict each other, particularly where conditions
are more rare or less well understood. This might be a difficult area,
although possibly a small one. Where a contradiction of opinion exists,
how can it be properly ironed out to the satisfaction of the person who
is being assessed?</div>
<a name="06102456000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000348"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is another important point. On the revised
PCA, the individual carrying out the assessment would ultimately make
the judgment. You would not thank us for going through the whole
customer journey again, Mr. Amess. Jobcentre Plus would
initially ascertain whether it thought it was appropriate for the
person to go for an assessment or whether they could immediately be
admitted to the support group based on paper evidence. We would prefer
that to be the route for most entering the support group. Ultimately,
the decision as to the impact of that illness, ailment or condition on
a person&#146;s ability to undertake work-related activity or to work
at all will be a decision of the person carrying out the assessment.
All the evidence provided in writing and in the face-to-face interview
would be taken into account. Ultimately, the person doing the
assessment is the arbiter of all the different evidence. They will
reach a conclusion and make a recommendation that will go to the
decision maker. The customer, who will also increasingly have the right
of reconsideration, will then have the right of appeal. Additional
medical evidence&#151;perhaps from their GP&#151;will be heard on
appeal.</div> <a name="06102456000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend acknowledges, it is important to make a distinction between the
different medical views: a GP is there primarily to diagnose, rather
than to assess the impact of the relevant condition on the
customer&#146;s ability to work. There will be two different medical
practitioners for two different purposes. On appeal, the issue about
which my hon. Friend is concerned could be raised.</div>
<a name="06102456000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">We had a one-minute
conversation about why the amendment is not technically necessary:
because in our process there is a flexible power to amend training as
is necessary. I encourage the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey, who has been offered additional reassurance,
to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="06102456000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000349"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that detailed response. I
take on board the Minister&#146;s points about the legality of the
amendments. However, I press him 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>for clarity on three further points. Not wishing to try the
Committee&#146;s patience, I shall do so briefly. Some of what he
said at the end of his remarks was important and needs to be teased
out.</div><a name="06102456000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
finished by discussing the role of the decision maker, an issue that
could be brought up under a number of clauses. It may as well be dealt
with now. During our last sitting, we discussed the process by which
someone went from their assessment for limited capability to work to
their assessment for limited capability for work-related activity and
then, potentially, on to their work-focused health-related assessment.
In a previous sitting, the Minister stated that a claimant is
potentially sanctionable if they do not turn up for the work-focused
health-related assessment and that the Government intended the claimant
to take part in that assessment immediately after their assessments for
limited capability for work and for work-related activity. That hangs
crucially on the question of when the decision is taken and the
decision about entitlement to the benefit support component, or
whatever, is taken. If someone attending a first work-focused
health-related assessment immediately after the other two assessments
can be sanctioned at that point, that implies that the decision is
taken when the Atos Origin doctor decides, not when the information
goes to the decision maker to confirm, as the Minister said, that the
process has been gone through properly and so
on.</div><a name="06102456000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
important legally. Someone could be sanctioned following their decision
not to participate in a work-focused health-related assessment because
they believed that the decision as to whether they were entitled to the
support component was wrong and they wished to appeal. I should be
grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification on that
point.</div><a name="06102456000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000350"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I understand the sensitivity of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point. Having reflected on the process at the
weekend, I thought that it must be open to any claimant or customer, at
any stage, to abort the process&#151;or rather not allow the process
to advance beyond the stage under consideration&#151;unless and until
a decision had formally been taken. In other words, if this is a test
on limited capability for work, it would be open to the Department to
say, &#147;Without prejudice to this test and the formal decision on
it, would you like to be considered for limited capacity for
work-related activity?&#148; However, it would be open to the
individual to say, if they wished, &#147;No, I want the issue out of
the way. Then we can come back and consider any subsequent issues under
later
provisions&#148;.</div><a name="06102456000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000351"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, with which
I partly agree. I was convinced by the Minister&#146;s previous
remarks that it made sense for the assessments for the limited
capability for work and for work-focused activity to take place at the
same time, and that the break that the hon. Member for Daventry wants
the claimant to have could legitimately take place after the assessment
for limited capability for work benefit, and before the work-focused
health-related assessment. The question whether one is entitled to the
benefit is one of the criteria that is considered before a sanction can
be applied. If someone has a work-focused health-related assessment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 169</div>immediately following that, but before a decision maker has taken the
decision, that decision not to attend should not be sanctionable. I
apologise for going into this matter now, but as we are following on
from the Minister&#146;s remarks about decision makers, I thought it
was worth pursuing.</div><a name="06102456000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a couple of other quick points. The Minister gave a comprehensive
list of training that Atos Origin doctors are required to undergo,
which I found very encouraging. One thing that he did not mention was
training on when it would be appropriate to bring in outside advice, in
other words training on making decisions about whether to bring someone
else in when the person making the assessment does not realise that he
has reached the limit of his expertise. It is important that doctors
can make that decision and that the decision maker, when looking at the
file, can say that perhaps someone else should have been brought in and
perhaps the procedure was not followed properly in that case.</div>
<a name="06102456000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">An earlier point about the
opportunity to bring these matters forward with Atos Origin concerned
revisions of its contract. Will the Minister tell us whether that
contract is being revised anyway in the context of the Disability
Discrimination Act 1995? If so, does that provide an opportunity to
make some of the points that we have been discussing in this important
debate
clearer?</div><a name="06102456000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000352"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> In order to pave the way for the
Minister&#146;s response, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the
Minister owes the Committee a moment of time on the use of logic-driven
protocols as part of the process as against the by and large
assessments which have perhaps applied in the
past?</div><a name="06102456000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000353"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. The hon.
Gentleman, with his usual degree of foresight, predicts the third point
that I wish the Minister to address. The personal capability assessment
works through logic-driven protocols and the logic-integrated medical
assessment system. Some of the disability organisations and others who
are involved in the consultative groups for the redesign of the
personal capability assessment have been given only limited information
about the LiMA computer system that is used to administer the
assessment. It is therefore important to consider how it
works.</div><a name="06102456000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Answers are
prompted by questions about a person&#146;s typical day, for example.
That is a good way to have the conversation. I can fully accept that.
Answers are inputted into the system using, wherever possible,
pre-coded responses. When one asks about a typical day and certain
responses come up the doctor is asked to fit the response into a
pre-coded response. The pre-coded responses themselves are then linked
tothe descriptors which are described in some detail in the
documentation about the revised PCA. That link between the pre-coded
responses and the descriptors is where the question about protocols is
particularly important.</div>
<a name="06102456000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister consider the
following point? The stakeholder groups&#151;I assume that they will
continue to help manage the process of changing the
assessment&#151;should continue to be involved not just 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div>with the descriptors that are being used, but also with the operation of
LiMA and its effectiveness. If possible the external stakeholders
should be engaged in an ongoing basis in monitoring the effectiveness
of LiMA so that we make sure that the link between the pre-coded
responses and the descriptors continues to be valid and does not lead
to decisions being made which perhaps the Government or the Committee
would not intend to be
made.</div><a name="06102456000282"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="06102456000134"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000354"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In seeking three specific points of clarification,
the hon. Gentleman tempts us to reopen our entire debate. I will try to
respond to those three specific areas. The first area was when and how
the decision is formally taken and the relationship between that and
the Atos Origin assessment. As we discussed in a previous debate, if
someone attains the 15 points and is therefore entitled to
ESA&#151;we can have another competition as to whether that amounts
to success or failure and that comes down to perceptions&#151;and in
the same interview someone meets one of the 46 descriptors that we have
listed on page 18 of the draft regulations, then of course they would
be in the support group. There would be no conditionality and there
would be no requirement to undertake the work-focused health
assessment.</div><a name="06102456000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">If someone
at that point says, &#147;I do not want to be written off. I know
that I have 15 points and I know that I meet one or two of the 46
descriptors but I still want to be in this system,&#148; they would
get the support group level of benefit, so they would have the higher
rate of benefit. If they still wished to undertake the work-focused
health assessment at that point they could do so. Regardless of what
happens to them in that work-focused health assessment, if they do get
closer to the labour market, based on the assessment that was
undertaken by Atos Origin that they did have 15 points and did meet one
of the descriptors, they would continue to receive that higher rate of
benefit, as being part of the support
group.</div><a name="06102456000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where Atos
Origin says that a person has 15 points and meets one or more of the 46
descriptors, the Atos Origin medical expert could then defer the
work-focused health assessment. The decision maker would then examine
all the paperwork. He is not there to second-guess the medical
assessment of the medical expert from Atos Origin but simply to ensure
that all of the procedures have been followed and that everything has
been done within the laws that we agree on and the regulations that
will be decided at a later point.</div>
<a name="06102456000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the customer is told that
they have the 15 points and are entitled to ESA but they do not meet
any of the 46 descriptors and therefore they are not in a support
group, they would be asked to undertakethe second interview
for the work-focused health assessment. If the customer decided not to
attend that interview there would be no sanction at that point. Any
sanction, if appropriate, would be enacted at the point where a
decision maker received the paperwork and the assessment took place.
The customer would, of course, have the right of appeal as they have
throughout this process on any decision that impacts on their level of
benefits. I hope that reassures the hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06102456000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Atos Origin does an important
and technically difficult piece of work for us all and all of our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 171</div>constituents. They know as well as we do that in the past there have
been problems with their systems and they have sought to resolve those.
The figure for the number of complaints about Atos Origin is down to
0.3 per cent. We can continue to find ways to reduce that 0.3 per cent
even further.</div> <a name="06102456000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to disability organisations getting access to LiMA, they are
happy to share that methodology and information with the disability
organisations and, if they wish, will be happy to organise
demonstrations of how the system works and dry run some cases to ensure
that there is greater understanding of the
system.</div>
<a name="06102456000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000355"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> The Minister has been very helpful in giving
those assurances. May I take him back to something that he said a
moment ago about the decision-making process when he tied the main
function of the decision maker to ensuring that processes are correctly
carried out? Let me rehearse with him some wider concerns, which might
or might not apply to the decision maker. If, for example, there is an
examining doctor and there appears to be a pattern building up of
racial prejudice or a particular blind spot on some medical issue,
would it be in the powers of the decision maker to have a conversation
with the examining doctor about it? The conversation would not strictly
be about the paperwork or the process. A skewing of the conclusions
might give rise to concern, however, and it ought to be addressed or

Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, but
it is better if the management information systems rather than the
decision maker pick up on the issue. Work is under way to ensure that
the systems are designed to pick up on wide variations in outcomes that
are based on common character traits or the circumstances of the
individual customer. There are different ways of implementing and
assessing the 15 points or the 46 descriptors. If there are differences
at the extremes, whereby one medical assessor has a 95 per cent.
outcome for access to the support group and another has none, something
is happening, and it is for the management information systems to pick
up on. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman about the way in which we
pick up on that important point, but it is important that we do
so.</div>

<a name="06102456000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;and such other matters as the
Secretary of State may by regulation prescribe&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div><a name="06102456000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that there will be
a clause stand part debate, so my remarks on the amendment will be
brief. Its purpose is to probe the Government&#146;s thinking about
the test of limited capability for work-related activity. The
regulations make it clear that exemption from conditionality&#151;in
other words, from membership of the support group&#151;will be a
purely medical decision, rather than one that introduces any other, for
example, social factors. It will be a purely medical decision based on
an assessment of whether someone meets any one of the 46
descriptors.</div> <a name="06102456000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
factors might be worthy of consideration, and it would be useful if the
Minister explained in more detail why the exemption from conditionality
for the support group is based solely on medical criteria. What is the
conception underlying the way in which the support component has been
created? The amendment seeks to introduce a power to allow other
factors,such as caring responsibilities, to be taken into
account. Could they be introduced to decisions about the support
component? Although they are outsidethe descriptors, the
amendment would allow for the introduction of a social model and take
account ofthe wider barriers to employment that people in the
support group might face. If such factors cannot be taken into account
in considering someone&#146;s entitlement to membership of the
support group, will the regulations ensure that other matters such as
caring responsibilities can be considered when deciding whether someone
entitled to the work-related activity component will be subject to
conditionality, whether that be membership of the support group or
work-related
activity?</div><a name="06102456000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000359"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall respond to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point; as he said, we might have a stand part debate&#151;with your
permission, Mr. Amess. As he knows, clause 9 provides that
the question whether a person&#146;s capability for work-related
activity is limited by his physical or mental condition, and if so,
whether the limitation would make it unreasonable to require him to
undertake such activity, is to be determined in regulations. As the
Committee knows, I published a draft of those regulations two weeks ago
on the day when the Committee of Selection met.</div>
<a name="06102456000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our belief that work is a right
underpins much of the Committee&#146;s deliberations and was behind
the genesis of the Bill. However, we recognise that for some, work is
simply not possible. The support group has been created for individuals
whose functional limitation is such that it would be unreasonable to
require them to engage in work-related activity. As I have said, and as
hon. Members have mentioned, that will be based on falling under one of
the 46 listed descriptors provided to the Committee in regulation 3 of
the draft regulations. Other non-medical circumstances such as caring
responsibilities might make it difficult for ESA customers to engage in
work-focused interviews or undertake work-related activity, but it
would not be appropriate to place such factors on a prescriptive list
in the way that the hon. Gentleman
suggests.</div><a name="06102456000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee has been provided with a copy of the draft regulations on
work-focused interviews, which will allow a personal adviser to defer
an interview if he or she considers that it would not assist the person
in question or be appropriate in the circumstances. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column172" />Column number: 173</div>Personal advisers will be able to take into account non-medical issues
such as transport difficulties, caring responsibilities or bereavement
when making a decision on deferrals. So although I could not give the
hon. Gentleman much comfort in our earlier debate on what he described
as a social model of assessment, I hope that the additional paperwork
that has been provided reassures him that deferrals can take place on
the bases that I have
mentioned.</div><a name="06102456000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000360"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Minister will know that 10 per cent. of the 6
million carers are themselves disabled. If I understand his logic
correctly, he is saying that personal advisers will be able to take
account of that situation when considering whether to defer the
requirement of work-related activity. Will he put himself in the shoes
of a disabled person who, for example, cares for a disabled child?
Simply deferring the obligation to participate in such activity is not
adequate for someone in that situation. They simply do not have time to
work, and it would be completely unrealistic to expect them to do so.
Is there no possibility of greater flexibility so that in such a
situation a person&#146;s obligation to participate could be put on
hold more
permanently?</div><a name="06102456000283"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
pm</div><a name="06102456000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000361"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The length of time taken to grant a deferral will
be a matter for the personal adviser. We are not talking about a day, a
week or a month; it could be much longer than that. I think that there
is unanimity about the idea that&#151;except on medical grounds
relating to access to a support group, although even then, those
involved would be entitled to volunteer&#151;the state and the
Government should not be able to write anyone off by accident or
design. In the scenario described by the hon. Gentleman, a deferral
could be very long term; it would not be a case of &#147;Please come
back tomorrow.&#148; It would clearly be inappropriate to request
that someone undertake a work-focused interview or work-related
activity in that scenario or in many of the others of which we are
aware from our constituencies. That would be counter-productive and
would add to the difficulties that people were experiencing, rather
than doing what the Bill and the regulations are intended to do, which
is, where possible, to lift the difficulties that people experience in
getting closer to the labour market. I hope that that reassures the
hon. Gentleman.</div>
<a name="06102456000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06102456000362"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Wayne David</b> (Caerphilly) (Lab): The Minister will be aware
that mental health organisations have expressed some concern about this
issue. What might happen, for example, to an individual who had
attempted to commit suicide? What flexibility might be introduced in
those circumstances?</div>
<a name="06102456000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000363"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We are suggesting all sorts of flexibilities in
the draft regulations, but we do not wish to be prescriptive and to
say, &#147;This is the exhaustive list.&#148; I am not sure that
this will enlighten my hon. Friend, but some of the provisions are
taken from paragraph 35 of the current decision makers guide, and, even
there, the list is not exhaustive. The guide refers to what constitutes
a good cause for not meeting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>some of the conditionality in terms of, for example, medical
appointments, caring responsibilities and religious
adherence.</div> <a name="06102456000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
specific point about someone who has attempted suicide, my hon. Friend
will accept that people attempt that dramatic act for all sorts of
reasons, including low esteem and a sense of worthlessness. Although he
is not suggesting this, others have suggested that we automatically
passport into a support group everyone who has attempted suicide for
whatever reason. Such people would not automatically be entitled to
condition management, work-focused interviews and the chance to get
closer to the labour market again. The Government have a sense that
that is not the right way to support someone in those
circumstances.</div> <a name="06102456000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
the work-focused interview and work-related activity would add to the
complications and the pressure that a person felt, there would of
course be a deferral. However, it would be wrong to say that we should
put everyone into the support group, regardless of the reason why they
had attempted suicide, and particularly when the pressure on a person
had built up because of long-term unemployment, material poverty, their
perception of their wider role in the world and of their inability to
support themselves and their family, and their sense of worthlessness.
In cases where it would help, we need to afford such people the support
of work-focused interviews to try to get them back to the labour
market. In cases where it would not help, there would be a deferral,
and we would not seek at any point to add to the difficulties that
somebody already faced.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000364"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that response
and particularly for clarifying the circumstances in which a
work-focused interview&#151;and, therefore, the degree to which a
person who is not in the support group is subject to
conditionality&#151;can be deferred. The Minister has introduced a
valuable concept into the discussion, and we might wish to probe it in
much more detail on further clauses. For the time being, however, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000367"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> This group of amendments relates to safeguards
and the power to determine what safeguards may apply. Amendment No. 153
concerns clause 9 and the other amendments relate to other clauses.
They are designed to probe in more detail the Government&#146;s
intentions regarding the provision of safeguards, particularly in
relation to clause 9 and the assessments of people&#146;s capability
for work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06102456000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Elsewhere in the benefits and
social security system, variation is allowed in what Ministers consider
to be &#147;good cause&#148;. By tabling my amendments and for the
Committee&#146;s benefit, I ask the Minister to explain in more
detail certain points regarding, for instance, the acts or omissions to
be covered, the judgment of acts or omissions being considered,
particularly in relation to decisions about information provided by an
individual, and the judgment of whether someone had good cause when
unavailable for their limited capability for work-related activity
assessment. Will that decision be left to the decision makers? To what
extent is it envisioned that external contractors will have the power
to exercise that judgment?</div>
<a name="06102456000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other issues fall within the
scope of the amendments. They relate to the period in which benefit
claims for the support component can be backdated. For example, if
someone has good cause for being unavailable for an assessment, or for
not providing the required information in a timely fashion and, as a
result, a period elapses longer than the 13 weeks envisioned, what will
the rules be on the backdating of those claims, if it is decided
eventually that that person is entitled to the support
component?</div><a name="06102456000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last week,
we debated appeals and the need for an appeals process. The Minister
was generally reassuring in his response in that debate. However, how
will a case in which a decision about good cause has been made be
treated in the appeals process? Again, if someone has good cause for
any act or omission in relation to those assessments, to what extent
will their right of appeal be affected? Would that right be unfettered?
Indeed, will that person have the right of appeal against a decision
that might suggest that they did not have good cause for an act or
omission? I know that that sounds slightly technical, but it is
important to clarify those points and so I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06102456000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000368"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I think that the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments are intended to probe the Government&#146;s intentions, as
he said, and I can reassure him on a specific point: if
someone&#146;s entitlement to a support group has been rejected on
the basis that, on assessment, they failed to meet one of the 46
descriptors, but on appeal it is found that that decision was
incorrect, the ESA entitlement at the support group level will of
course be reinstated and backdated to the start of the 14th
week&#151;the end of the 13-week assessment period. I hope that that
reassures him.</div><a name="06102456000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
hon. Gentleman said, clause 9 gives us powers to make regulations
treating customers as not having limited capability for work-related
activity, if they have failed without good cause to provide information
or undergo a medical examination that they were asked to attend.
However, we recognise the importance of ensuring that customers are not
unfairly penalised if they have good reason for failing to undertake
such an assessment.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div><a name="06102456000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Current legislation relating to
incapacity benefit sets out the matters to be taken into account when
determining whether a customer has shown good cause for failure to
attend a medical examination to assess incapacity for work. Published
guidance provides advice to the Department&#146;s decision
makers&#151;I have referred to that in response to an intervention
bymy hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr.
David)&#151;on the steps to be taken to establish whether there is
good cause.</div> <a name="06102456000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We intend
to follow the same approach under ESA. The draft regulations under
clause 9, which the Committee has seen, set out the matters to be taken
into account when determining whether a customer has shown good cause.
As I mentioned, it is not an exhaustive list, because such an approach
would be impractical and would not allow us the opportunity to innovate
and be flexible, either nationally or at a local level. As we introduce
ESA, it is important that we are able to adjust what constitutes good
cause based on our experiences both from pathways and, from 2008
onwards, from the national introduction of
ESA.</div><a name="06102456000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 155
was tabled by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. Regulations under clause 10, which we will come to next,
will set out what matters are to be taken into account when determining
whether a customer has shown good cause for failure to take part in a
work-focused health-related assessment. They will include taking into
account the nature of the customer&#146;s disability and his state of
health at the time. I alluded in a previous debate to the fact that
customers will have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal
against a decision that they failed to take part in a work-focused
health-related assessment without good
cause.</div><a name="06102456000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to
amendments Nos. 173 and 260. In clause 17, we are taking powers to
disqualify a customer from ESA. I reassure the hon. Gentleman and
others that there are already considerable safeguards in place as part
of the disqualification decision-making process. First, a customer will
be given the opportunity to explain why he has behaved in the way in
which he has, and evidence will then be considered by the decision
maker. The decision maker will also need to consider any other
available evidence.</div>
<a name="06102456000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">In considering the evidence,
the decision maker will have to consider whether the customer has good
cause for not complying, and must take into account certain prescribed
factors and disregard others in accordance with the regulations. A
decision maker will be able to take into account any factor that he
considers relevant, including the state of a person&#146;s mental and
physical health. We follow the same practice under the current IB
regime.</div> <a name="06102456000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">We recognise
the particular difficulties that people with mental health conditions
might face in complying with requests. We will ensure that a decision
is not taken to penalise any person with a mental health condition or
learning disability without contact having first been made with them,
or their carer or healthcare team.</div>
<a name="06102456000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the decision maker decides
that a person is tobe disqualified, that person will, as I
have already committed, have the right of appeal to an independent
tribunal. I assure the Committee that there will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div>adequate training for our staff and that safeguards will be put in
place, meaning that customers will always be given opportunities to
explain their actions before any disqualification occurs. It is
important to mention that. I hope that my comments reassure the hon.
Gentleman on the specific points that he has
raised.</div>

work-related activity group. The Secretary of State confirmed the
comments in the notes during the debate in the House on 24 July. He
also said clearly that he wanted people in the support group to be able
to</div> <a name="06102456000269"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;access all the
appropriate support available&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
24 July 2006; Vol. 449, c. 623.]</div>
<a name="06102456000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should have been very happy with that
statement if he had left off the word &#147;available&#148; and
said that he wanted everyone in the group to be able to access all the
appropriate support, but his use of that word gives rise to some
concern. <i class="I">[Interruption.]&#151;</i>I hear mutterings from a
sedentary position and I do not suggest that there was any intention to
use words carefully, but I am concerned about whether the appropriate
support will be available for people in the support group.</div>
<a name="06102456000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would simply
ensure that the Bill lived up to the promises made by the Secretary of
State. It would, first, make it a statutory obligation&#151;not just
a Government intention&#151;for the work-related activity component
to be available for members of the support group. It would clearly make
participation voluntary, because the Committee has agreed that any
sanctions or compulsions would be totally inappropriate for that group.
However, to make the arrangement realistic, we must accept that the
outcome of the work-related activity process for members of the support
group may not be a full-time job. It could be a part-time job, or
voluntary work. It could be going on a training course or involvement
in community activities.</div>
<a name="06102456000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we carefully observe this
most vulnerable group, real concerns arise that the general tenor of
the rest of the Bill could send conflicting signals. I shall just read
a sentence from page 123 of the excellent book by the Child Poverty
Action Group called&#147;A Route out of
Poverty?&#148;</div><a name="06102456000270"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are concerned that the Government&#146;s focus on the merits of paid
work, which has dominated policy since 1997, makes people who are not
in it feel worthless. Much more emphasis 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 179</div>should be placed on the contribution and participation of disabled
people, irrespective of their ability to access paid employment. Many
disabled people work as volunteers or carers, or run service user
groups, yet are deemed to be out of work because they are not being
paid. The Green Paper with its focus on drawing people into employment
may perpetuate entrenched
stereotypes.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Government are to deliver on their intentions for the support
group, a variety of outcomes is essential for the pathways to work
programme involving part-time work, voluntary work, community
activities and education. Last week, the Minister said that he
recognised that that could be the case for education, and
that:</div><a name="06102456000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Further
education has played an enormous role, and will continue to do so, in
supporting people from all sorts of backgrounds, particularly those
with a disability and a fluctuating mental health
condition.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee A</i>
17 October 2006; c.
51.]</div><a name="06102456000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think the
Minister understands the direction ofmy thinking on these
issues, but I have a couple of concerns. The first is whether the
pathways programme has the necessary resourcing to provide adequate
support for people on the support component. Citizens Advice, for
example, said that it
has</div><a name="06102456000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;great concerns that
the &#163;360 million will not be sufficient to provide the same
level of support, and the same range of opportunities, currently
available to clients in Pathways
areas.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">It makes that
comment about everyone, whether they go into a work-related activity
group or the support group. If there is a resource constraint for
people in the work-related activity group, which is the less
resource-intensive of the two groups, it will be doubly the case for
those in the support
group.</div><a name="06102456000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finance may be
a consideration because every Government must operate within financial
constraints and if finance is the reason, I should be grateful if the
Minister would come clean and say so. It is important when considering
the support group to avoid false economies when it comes to cost.
Yesterday, I was in Sheffield visiting an excellent organisation called
Dimensions UK. I met the chief executive, David Wolverson, who told me
an interesting story about one of his clients&#151;I shall call him
Dave. Dave has learning difficulties and has twice tried to live
independently, but failed. He had to have people sleeping in with him
overnight but during an 18-month period, with coaching from Dimensions
UK, he was weaned off the necessity of having someone sleeping in with
him overnight. I am sure that that process was expensive, but it was a
big lifestyle change for Dave, who said, &#147;I have no bloody staff
here, so I can have a party.&#148; It was a big change for him not
having to have someone sleeping in with him, but it was also a bit
lonely for him and he needed a lot of support. The crucial point is
that the cost of having sleep-in staff is well in excess of &#163;150
a week, but the cost of what he has now&#151;an on-call
system&#151;is only &#163;7 a week. Helping and supporting people
to live independently results in a huge reduction in cost to
taxpayers.</div><a name="06102456000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000371"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> That story is inspiring and the gentleman
concerned is obviously inspirational. However, does the hon. Gentleman
believe that it is practical and appropriate to allocate a sum of money
to cover everyone who might be in a support group? Has he considered
how that could be costed and has he 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>also considered that there might be a better way in the voluntary and
other sectors to support someone who is not yet ready even for a
work-focused interview other than through a mechanistic approach under
the
Bill?</div><a name="06102456000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000372"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As ever, the hon. Lady makes an important point. I
am not suggesting that the provisions under the support component of
the Bill are the only solution or the only way forward for such people.
I am concerned about simply putting a line in the explanatory notes
saying that the work-related activity component will be very good, that
we have seen how it works with the pathways programme and that anyone
else with more severe disabilities can volunteer for it if they want. I
am concerned that that does not give true access to people in that
group. The point about disability is that if we want to move to
equality for disabled people, we must be proactive. It is a question
not simply of eliminating prejudice, as with racial discrimination, but
of taking proactive steps that make equality a reality. There will not
be no statutory right: the explanatory notes say that such provision is
the Government&#146;s intention. Saying that the most severely
disabled people can volunteer to be part of the support group will not
help them as much as they need to be helped.</div>
<a name="06102456000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall illustrate my point,
because there is a particular issue about part-time work. For many of
the most severely disabled people, the most realistic outcome of any
effective programme is to go into part-time work. They may volunteer
first, as a stepping-stone. If they can move into full-time work, it is
likely that part-time work will be a vital stepping-stone.</div>
<a name="06102456000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yesterday I met a cleaner with
learning disabilities, but they will not be able to do a full-time
cleaning job straight away, so they have started by doing a couple of
days a week and seeing how it goes. The benefits system makes that very
difficult, because the moment one gets a part-time job working
mornings, for example, one risks losing one&#146;s entire benefits
package, which is scary. We are asking someone who is vulnerable anyway
to take a huge risk. Add to that the fear that the job may not work
out, and that they may not know about the linking rules, and we are
making it difficult for them.</div>
<a name="06102456000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not arguing that part-time
work has to be a valid outcome for all people who participate in
pathways to work; I am asking whether the Government will consider
making it a valid outcome of the programmes for people who go on to the
support element. In their case, it might be the most realistic outcome
and a stepping-stone to full-time work, too.</div>
<a name="06102456000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last week I raised a concern
that by giving members of the support group a higher level of benefit,
which everyone present supports in principle, there may be a danger
that people will not want to leave the support group, because moving
into the work-related activity component could mean a reduction in
their benefit. The Minister&#146;s response was
that</div><a name="06102456000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we would say that
the person could keep the higher rate of benefit so that there were no
perverse incentives to stay in the support group: they can keep the
higher rate of benefit without going through the
conditionality.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, Standing Committee
A,</i> 17 October 2006; c. 66.]</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div><a name="06102456000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, on page 8 of the regulations, a
case study of &#147;Sarah&#148;, who is on the support component,
says:</div><a name="06102456000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Her
condition gradually improves, and...she is assessed as not having
limited capability for work-related activity. This means she moves into
the work-related activity group which has the effect of a small
reduction in her
benefit.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations
appear directly to contradict the Minister&#146;s assurance that
people will be able to move from the support element to the
work-related activity element. I may have misunderstood them, but I
should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s clarification.</div>
<a name="06102456000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the amendment, I am saying
it is important that, if we can, we use the Bill to give the same
opportunities to people with severe disabilities, particularly people
with learning disabilities, as we give everyone else. The paper,
&#147;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the
21st Century&#148; talks about getting 30 per cent. of people with
learning disabilities into the labour market. The figure is currently
much lower. In that spirit, I hope that we can amend the Bill, so that
we have legislation giving those most vulnerable people the same
opportunity to take the next step forward in their life as we seek to
create for those people with less severe
disabilities.</div>
<a name="06102456000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000373"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I shall make a brief speech this time rather than a
long intervention. The comments of the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey were interesting. Sheffield Dave seems to embody the purpose of
the Bill. We should stop writing people off. We should stop using the
list system&#151;listing all the things that make one incapable of
working&#151;and look instead at what a person is capable of doing.
Having someone front-ending the investment, so that Sheffield Dave can
in the end sleep by himself and may one day take part in some kind of
work-related activity, is exactly what we want to achieve. It is very
important to keep that element of the Bill as it
is.</div> <a name="06102456000285"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="06102456000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">The difference
between the support group and the work-related activity group is also
important. I do not want to pre-empt what the Minister may say in
response, but one pay-off of the Bill for those who move to the support
group is that they will get a much higher level of support and benefit.
Everyone appreciates that those on benefit are poor. Fundamental to the
Bill is the fact that we want to get people off benefit and into some
kind of work or work-related activity, not only to make them better off
financially but because it will enrich their life&#151;just as
Sheffield Dave&#146;s life was
enriched.</div><a name="06102456000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000374"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> My point is precisely as the hon. Lady says, but I
am concerned that the Bill will not achieve that. Those people put into
the support element will receive a higher level of benefit. Is the hon.
Lady not concerned that the aspirations that she and I have for that
most vulnerable group will not be met unless a wide range of outcomes
are permitted, and not only full-time
employment?</div><a name="06102456000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000375"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely spot on, but I
return to the point that I made earlier. We are trying to provide an
enormous range or menu of options, and not only through Jobcentre Plus.
That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 182</div>is the gateway, but engaging all the volunteer and private sector
organisations, as the hon. Gentleman saw in Sheffield, can help ensure
that people&#146;s capabilities, whatever they are able to do, are
best identified and properly exploited. They can then go and do
whatever it is that they are able to do and want to do. Once they are
on that virtuous ladder, perhaps with support and training, and with
the expertise accessed through the Jobcentre Plus gateway, they will be
able to develop and engage more constructively in the labour
market.</div> <a name="06102456000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The bottom
line is not to move every person now on incapacity benefit into work.
That is a million miles away from what we are trying to achieve through
the Bill. We want to give people support and the opportunity to move
off benefits into some kind of work-related activity. It is important
that we should use the phrase &#147;work-related activity&#148;
rather than work; again, it is fundamental to our case. I look forward
to the hon. Member for South-West Surrey withdrawing the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000376"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am delighted, as always, to follow the hon.
Member for North-East Derbyshire; her comments, shared by those on all
sides, about not writing anyone off were absolutely right. We had a
political discussion earlier about the point, but whatever the merits
of the support offered by this or previous Governments, too many people
have been written off for too long. It is important that we change that
culture for good.</div> <a name="06102456000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not convinced by the amendment&#151;it is not exactly how I would
seek to make the change&#151;but the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey none the less raises an important point. He and the hon. Member
for North-East Derbyshire made it clear&#151;I think it needs to be
made clear in the Bill&#151;that assistance such as work-focused
interviews should be available to any member of the support group who
wants it. That is the point that has been made in this debate. The
Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but it is not made clear in the
Bill, although it is made clear in his remarks, the explanatory notes
and so on. The Bill could allow a less well disposed future Government,
or this Government in one of their less well disposed frames of mind,
to
decide&#151;</div><a name="06102456000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000377"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> What interest would any Government, now or in the
future, have in not enabling people in the support group to access
work-related activities or anything
else?</div><a name="06102456000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000378"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I find it difficult enough to get myself into
the frame of mind of other political parties as it is, without wishing
to speculate as to their future motives. I shall not follow the line of
argument down which the hon. Lady invites me.</div>
<a name="06102456000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like it to be made
clear in the Bill that the support available to anyone on the
work-related activity component will be available also to anyone on the
support component who wishes to access it, free from the conditionality
regime that would apply to the work-related activity group. For reasons
that have been mentioned, it is critical that that support be
available, and I know that the Government intend to make it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 183</div>available. I am not querying the Minister&#146;s good intentions, but
that needs to be made more explicit.</div>
<a name="06102456000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">That need is important
particularly for the reason articulated by the hon. Member for
South-West Surrey, which I have also mentioned to the Committee and
probably will again: the amount of funding that has been allocated for
the roll-out of pathways to work across the country. The Minister may
feel a bit hamstrung, because he is doubtless engaged in debates with
the Treasury on how much he should get for rolling out pathways in the
comprehensive spending review. I share the concern expressed by
Citizens Advice and others that the &#163;360 million that has so far
been allocated for the Bill will be insufficient even for dealing with
the needs of new claimants, let alone those of people already on
support who wish to access it in future. We do not even know whether
all that money will be spent on the roll-out of pathways to work. In
answering a question that I asked in the House, the Secretary of State
could say only that the lion&#146;s share&#151;a term that I do not
believe is defined by the Treasury&#151;would be used for pathways to
work.</div> <a name="06102456000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know
where the statistic comes from, but surveys are often said to show that
1 million people who are currently on incapacity benefit wish to work.
We do not know, and I would not wish to prejudge, how many of them will
be entitled to the new support component when migration takes place. I
would like to think that every one of those people who wished to access
the help available under pathways to work would be able to do so
straight away without any constraints on the availability of support.
Will the Minister make clear the position on that
matter?</div><a name="06102456000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000379"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not wish to detain the Committee too long.
We have had a good debate, but as my hon. Friend the Member for
South-West Surrey said, this amendment is important to Her
Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition. I wish to make two points and ask
one question, all of which relate directly to the
amendment.</div><a name="06102456000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
refer to the evaluation by the Department for Work and Pensions of the
experience of incapacity benefit personal advisers in pathways. The
Department&#146;s own research has found that some personal advisers
have reported a worrying tension between the need to give tailored
support to those who receive the support element and wish to volunteer
for work-related activity and the desire to hit targets and get the
&#147;quick wins&#148;. Those are the words in the
Department&#146;s report, Mr. Amess; you would not expect
me to use pejorative language. The desire of an IBPA to help his client
is logical and understandable, but at the same time he knows that he
has targets to meet. The Department&#146;s research reports in 2004
and 2005, each entitled &#147;Incapacity Benefit Reforms&#151;the
Personal Adviser Role &amp; Practices&#148;, indicated a difference
in how different personal advisers reacted to different clients. It was
stated that there were
variations</div><a name="06102456000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the extent
to which IBPAs were willing to persist
with...&#145;difficult&#146;
customers.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sometimes
they felt that they needed permission from their managers to spend
extra time on what will be the support element segment of
clients.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div><a name="06102456000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 227 argues for a
regime where there is resourcing in respect of everyone in the support
element who wishes to try work-related activity&#151;my hon. Friend
the Member for South-West Surrey mentioned that issue. The burden of my
argument also relates to a cultural shift on the part of all personal
advisers. This will extend to any advisers who work in the private
sector or in not-for-profit charitable sector organisations who might
deliver the roll-out of pathways and the new regime. Someone in the
support component element would be under no obligation, because in the
test in clause 9 they have demonstrated that they are further away from
work, but they might want to make an effort and volunteer for
work-related activity, even though the legislation does not require
them to do so. They must be looked at through the prism that they
should be supported and resourced. They should not be treated, as some
of the evidence in these reports suggests they are being, as being more
difficult to help&#151;I would not use the term &#147;easy
wins&#148;&#151;where people say, &#147;We will support those who
are nearer the world of work and are more work ready.&#148; I hate to
use a colourful word, but there cannot be any apartheid between the
support element and those in the work-related activity
component.</div>
<a name="06102456000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000380"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I promise that this is my last intervention. I
think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands the concept of the support
group. It is not a passive parking place for people who are more
severely disabled or unable to work. It is an active group that will
still be encouraged to move into the work-related activity
group.</div>
<a name="06102456000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000381"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I have not
misunderstood the concept; the entire burden of the amendment argues
for her point. Those in the support group must be encouraged more than
ever before under the pathways and previous regimes to have the
opportunity to access the work-related activities, which are the right
of those in the work-related activity component. They are not a right
in the same way for those in the support component, because under the
conditionality they are not required to engage in work-related
activity. I hope that she accepts that the provisions suggest that
although the support component contains those who wish to migrate to
the work-related activity component, it is not obvious that that will
be fully resourced because it is voluntary. People might not want to do
that<i class="I">&#151;[Interruption.]</i></div><a name="06102456000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister from a sedentary position talks about resourcing. That is the
burden of the argument made by Citizens Advice and many other outside
organisations: the &#163;360 million for the roll-out of pathways to
2008 might not be enough to cater fully for all those in the support
group who want to migrate on to the work-related activity, which is
more resource-intensive, as we all know.</div>
<a name="06102456000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000382"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> In response to the earlier intervention, no one is
denying what the intention of the Bill is. Our concern is the practice,
as I am sure my hon. Friend would agree. Does he agree that one of the
particular 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 185</div>causes of concern was the DWP&#146;s own research in 2005 on personal
advisers? The suggestion has been made
that</div><a name="06102456000276"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is a danger
that increasing the weight placed on early job entry targets in the
future might lead them to focus on the &#145;quick wins&#146;
versus those who really benefit from the pilots.&#148;</div>
<a name="06102456000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">Are we not really arguing that we
precisely do not want people in the support element of the component to
end up being parked while the whole focus of people working to quite
tight contracts is on getting people into jobs when that might not be
an
option?</div><a name="06102456000286"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="06102456000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000383"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I am grateful for that intervention. We all agree
here. It is a question of teasing out an understanding that the
&#163;360 million or perhaps even greater resources will be adequate
to fund everyone in the support group who might want to volunteer for
work-related activity, which, under the provision as drafted, they are
under no obligation to do. An interesting question is how many will
wish to volunteer for the work-related activity and whether that is
resourced.</div><a name="06102456000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
point relates to access to work. One of the many active labour market
programmes that might be relevant to getting those in the support group
to work-related activity and making it successful for them is access to
work. This is not the place to have the debate about that very good
programme, which is popular with those employers who know about it. I
know that the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who is
responsible for that programme, understands what good value for money
it represents in public spending terms. It is not just me saying that,
but Citizens Advice, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and
many others.</div> <a name="06102456000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
one question about access to work which bears on the amendment. It is
my understanding that access-to-work funding is not available to those
undertaking voluntary work. Voluntary work could be part of the
work-related activity that support component customers might want to
do. Therefore, those who wish to undertake such work-related activity
seem to be at a disadvantage&#151;access-to-work funding will not be
available to them. I understand historically why that is the case, but
if such funding is not available for those who want to go from the
support component to work-related activity, can either Minister tell us
whether there is anything commensurate to help them? Are there any pots
of money and Government programmes that might meet the needs of people
who wish to do voluntary activity, but who are not required to do it
under the clause because they are in the support component? For them,
an access to work-style programme may be particularly
helpful.</div><a name="06102456000230"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000384"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to make a
short contribution. I am concerned about the amendment for a number of
reasons. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds rightly pointed out the
fact that a cultural shift has taken place over a number of decades. To
answer my hon. Friend the Memberfor North-East Derbyshire,
there are different circumstances in which Governments may seek, for
whatever reason, to use a group of unemployed people. During periods of
high unemployment, low economic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 186</div>activity overall and general economic decline, it is not uncommon for
Governments to use, to take a Marxist analysis, a reserve army of the
work force. It is not an unfamiliar concept.</div>
<a name="06102456000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have to look at how the
cultural shift has come about and why it is important to revisit what
we can do for people. We are in a different economic environment now
and I hope that that will continue for many years. Nevertheless,
circumstances change. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds describes
some people in some departments, some of whom might work in Jobcentre
Plus and some in the voluntary sector, whose attitudes and approaches
to clients have had to change in those periods. We cannot take a single
day and say that it demonstrates how all people operate with all
clients, because it simply is not true. From that point and following
new experiences, people do change their approach to clients. That is a
rather slow but necessary process.</div>
<a name="06102456000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must also take into account
the attitude of the people who are being assessed, in whose interests
we are trying to form the legislation. Opposition Members have moved
some way from what was deemed to be the proper way to deal with people,
and I welcome the way in which they now look at things, but we have to
be realistic and set measures in the context of the real world and what
real people do.</div> <a name="06102456000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inspirational argument about &#147;Sheffield Dave&#148;, who will
for ever more be known by that name, illustrates a certain point about
how people can develop, but using the amendment as a way to deal with
Sheffield Dave is problematic. On the one hand, we can say that the
current system is providing for Sheffield Dave, although perhaps not
for people in all places: it might be that Sheffield is particularly
fortunate, or that some facilities are available in metropolitan areas
but not in rural areas. That is another matter to consider. How on
earth do we make exactly what is available in Sheffield available in
Slaithwaite, the village where I live? Whether that would be the best
way to spend resources is an argument that we could properly have, but
what concerns me more is whether Slaithwaite Dave&#146;s experience
of life is the same as Sheffield Dave&#146;s, and whether some
people, unlike Sheffield Dave, have a longer journey to
travel.</div><a name="06102456000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my
experience, if the Bill says simply that a right could be imposed,
which sounds like a cosy and supportive way of dealing with things,
people will soon think that they have a duty. When structuring
legislation, we have to be careful to ensure that there are no
unintended
consequences.</div><a name="06102456000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000385"></a>Mr.

<a name="06102456000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000386"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I can see that the hon. Gentleman is very
eager, so I shall give
way.</div><a name="06102456000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000387"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> It seems to me that the hon. Lady is making an
extremely eloquent argument in favour of the amendment, because I am
saying precisely what she is saying: Sheffield Dave, Slaithwaite Dave
and the myriad different people with varying disabilities need
flexibility in the system. I do not think that I disagree with her, but
I would put matters slightly differently. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 187</div>All those people want to make some progress towards
being able to live independently, but everyone is starting at a
different point in the journey, and it is important that the
legislation should not foreclose options that might be vital stepping
stones on the way to independent living, such as doing voluntary,
community or part-time work. With the amendment, all that we seek to do
is to make those possible outcomes of the pathway
programme.</div><a name="06102456000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000388"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> But the amendment would also mechanise the
process, and that would not necessarily be helpful because some people
are not even in that place yet. The whole idea is that putting oneself
forward for support and help is the right way. The crux of the matter
is the concept of someone deciding that they have reached a point at
which they can accept support and can venture out and do something else
with their lives. The amendment is well intended, but would have
unintended consequences.</div>
<a name="06102456000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have talked about the fact
that the attitudes of people at officer level in the department or
working in the voluntary sector have changed over the years, but there
have been others with stagnant attitudes who have had to be pushed on a
little. So it is for people with disabilities. Sometimes, they have to
overcome similar attitudes, and if the amendment were accepted certain
issues would rear up in their minds. Over the decades, constituents
have said to me, &#147;I feel as if pressure is being put on me now
to do something I otherwise wouldn&#146;t choose to
do.&#148;</div><a name="06102456000240"></a>

Alexander:</b> I am listening carefully to the hon.
Lady&#146;s comments and she is making quite a profound point about
people&#146;s decision making, how they go about deciding whether to
take part and at what point in their life they choose to avail
themselves of whatever opportunities may be available. My point is that
this is not about imposing a right that could easily be seen as an
obligation on people. It is about making it clear that the obligation
lies with the Government, who must ensure that, where someone makes the
decision for themselves to come forward, the support available to the
work-related activity group is also available to someone in the
circumstances that the hon. Lady
describes.</div><a name="06102456000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000390"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman at least
understands my point; for that, many thanks. However, at many junctures
in this debate, we have discussed how people make decisions and the
information that they believe to be correct that is in fact incorrect.
I think that this is one of those things that could be easily
misunderstood and be detrimental to someone&#146;s decision
making.</div><a name="06102456000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000391"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000392"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> The hon. Gentleman is such a jack-in-the-box,
how can I
resist?</div><a name="06102456000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000393"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for allowing me to
jump up. I just want to remind her that paragraph (b) in the amendment
specifically says that persons failing to participate in the activities
could not be penalised. I completely agree with her, but let us put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>it more bluntly than she has. There may be people with disabilities or
severe disabilities who are simply not ready to start engaging in the
process of moving towards the world of work. That is a huge change.
Sheffield Dave is an example of someone for whom just living
independently, let alone working independently, was a huge step to
take. The hon. Lady is right about that. There are also people who it
is envisaged would be on the support component and desperately keen to
take the next step towards the world of work. All the amendment is
designed to do is to make some options open to them that may not
otherwise
be.</div><a name="06102456000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000394"></a>Kali
Mountford:</b> Again, I completely understandthe hon.
Gentleman&#146;s honourable intention with the amendment, but it is
misplaced on this occasion. We have had many discussions about the
sorts of things that people think they are required to do when in fact
they are not. Simply stating, as paragraph (b) does, that there is no
intention to penalise will not necessarily be the message that goes to
people. The message may well go to them that there would be a duty. I
prefer that people, through the entire process, decide for themselves
and volunteer for help, rather than feeling as if it is somehow being
imposed on them. We need to invest a great deal in people and we need
to ensure that we focus that investment correctly, appropriately and
adequately, but the amendment would not achieve what the hon. Gentleman
believes it
would.</div><a name="06102456000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06102456000395"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In the time available before our interlude, I
shall try to respond to the various points that have been made. I shall
perhaps address at the start of our next sitting the more substantive
points made by my hon. Friend and
others.</div><a name="06102456000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for South-West Surrey said that this is one of the most
important amendments that he has tabled in the proceedings thus far and
perhaps will even be the most important in any of our 16 sittings in
total. We can have a conversation in our next sitting about why he
believes that, but I shall provide clarification now for him and
therefore for others. It surprises us sometimes, but other people do
read whatever is said here and therefore it is importantto
correct the hon. Gentleman when he has unintentionally come to the
wrong conclusion on case study 1 and Sarah. It is interesting that we
have heard of case study Sarah, Sheffield Dave and Karl Marx all in one
conversation.</div><a name="06102456000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
respect of case study 1, it is clear that the point is that
Sarah&#146;s condition gradually improves. It is not the fact that
she volunteered but the fact that her condition improved that is
relevant. That is why she would come out of the support group. If
someone is in the support group and they volunteer, that does not prove
to the Government that the decision to put them in the support group
was wrong. It just shows that someone has a spark, a will, a
determination, above what would be expected through the assessment, to
try and to continue to
try&#151;</div><a name="06102456000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">It
