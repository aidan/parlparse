intend to make legal aid available in cases involving domestic
violence, but you will know that there has been some discussion about
the definition of domestic violence in the Bill. The Government have
now widened it somewhat. Do you believe that the new definition is
adequate and sufficient?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000030">&#160;</a>

Bishop:</strong>
                  </em> The one thing that we would say is that law
centres’ specialty is within the area of social welfare law, but
our involvement with domestic violence is often where it is a trigger
for social welfare law problems. In relation to your question, though,
according to the impact statement, only an additional 1,000 people will
be assisted under the widened definition. We believe that means that it
has only been tweaked, as opposed to widened. We support the submission
from the Women’s Institute and the definition that it proposes
for domestic
violence.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000031">&#160;</a>

Guy:</strong>
                  </em> Broadening the definition is helpful, but the
main issue is identifying where domestic violence occurs. Our
experience in Citizens Advice is that it is very often a secondary
issue. If we are not giving advice on the primary issue—debts or
housing issues—we are unlikely to pick it up and therefore get
the representation that people need.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000032">&#160;</a>

Guy:</strong>
                  </em> First, I would have to agree with the Prime
Minister’s assessment. There are two sets of issues that really
bother us about the reforms. One is the taking out of scope of debt,
housing and benefit advice, which will leave an advice gap. If those
things are, indeed, to come out of the scope of legal aid, the
Government will need to make proper alternative provision to fill that
gap. That is the first argument. The second is that if they do come
out, people cannot just land nowhere. Where will they go? I suspect
that they will go to MPs’ surgeries, but they have to have
somewhere to go to get advice. We have to be able to realise the return
on investment in early intervention and early advice, which will have
gone if we do not have alternative provision. We have to make sure that
vulnerable people are not unassisted going through proceedings or
getting themselves out of the chain of events that takes them into
proceedings. The first set of issues therefore relate to the fact that
there has to be an alternative if these proposals are to go
forward.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second set
of issues relate to the fact that the legal aid that is in scope under
the proposals is particularly complex in terms of eligibility and hard
to apply, so there will need to be more clarity and simplicity around
that. There would also need to be something to bring two particular
issues together, because there is an intention under the proposals to
segregate what is seen as general advice and what is seen as pure legal
advice. People do not present as purely one thing or the other; they
present with a number of issues, many of which are intertwined, and we
need to make sure that there is a way of not segregating advice,
because life is not like that, and people are not like that. We have to
look at the whole system to make the proposals
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000035">&#160;</a>

that—£25 million. That is a stretch as it is, as is the
case with all these resources. I would also like to point out to the
Committee that that should not be seen in isolation. We face local
government cuts in the localities where bureaux give advice. We face
financial inclusion money cuts, which were given a reprieve, but we
still have to face that issue. And here is another £25 million
being taken out of the advice system. We would need at least as much as
we get currently, but demand is not standing still. We have welfare
reform coming along, which will bring an increase in demand. We also
have a recession, as I think we have all noticed, that is increasing
debt and housing problems so that demand is
burgeoning.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000037">&#160;</a>

a high legal aid bill compared to other countries. If you look at the

there is a lower income threshold. On issues such as the welfare
system, should we not improve services at source so that fewer errors
are, for example, made in the benefits system in the first place that
require legal redress? Do you agree with the general principle that it
is wrong to spend all this money on legal services when strictly legal

Before I came this morning, I checked out the handbook that is used by

It has 1,600 pages and refers to 45 Acts of Parliament and 185
regulations. The system at the moment is complex and some people in the

                  </em> There are two things to answer. One is that
to resolve the client’s whole problem we need to provide a
number of services to them, some legal and some non-legal. However, our
agencies work together in a streamlined and co-ordinated fashion. I
have put an example of one in our evidence, where in fact we have
referral routes. In the case of law centres, the problem does not come
to us until it is a legal problem, so we use legal skills and legal aid
to resolve legal problems. We do not provide generalist advice to deal
with a legal problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
point I wanted to answer was your question about the scope being
narrower in other countries. As you can hear from my accent, I can
speak about the Australian jurisdiction. The equivalent of social

<div class="columnNumber">

                  </div>law there is handled differently—you are correct—but it
does come out of what is called the Attorney-General’s
Department. Sixty million Australian dollars is given to the equivalent
of law centres, which have a wide jurisdiction. There are 200 of those.
They serve a couple of hundred thousand people per year. Those people
are not means-tested. The funding is flexible, but the centres are also
funded to do public legal education and to have a look at systemic
issues and provide solutions to Government, with respect to the
knowledge and learning that comes from that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000043">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I am not an economist, but I think another
really key difference is that legal aid in Australia is by and large a
salaried service. That means that there are grants of legal aid, but
private lawyers are so poorly funded with their grants of legal aid in
Australia that they regard it as pro bono, more or less. So it is true
to say that the hourly rate is much lower. However, the bulk of legal
aid is actually delivered through a salaried service. So the
format—the way legal aid is delivered—is actually quite
different, and that can help to explain some of the
differences.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000046">&#160;</a>

system?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000049">&#160;</a>

great if none of us were needed any more. That is where we would
probably aim for; but I think things are going to get worse before they
get better. When we talk about welfare reform, for
example—solving those issues—we have got to go through
transition and dual running first. There is going to be a lot of
confusion that we will have to pick up. The danger I see in being
legalistic about what is legal and not legal is that it is very
difficult to make that kind of definition and draw that line. That is
why we are arguing that we need a whole-system approach to advice. We
also need to be mindful of the fact that early intervention advice
saves things from becoming technically legal and costing the system an
awful lot more once they get to that point. If we are able to resolve
issues at an early stage, we save the court system, the tribunal system
and all those things a lot more cost further down the
line.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000050">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 103<a class="bkMark" name="Column103">&#160;</a>
                  </div>complicated. But there are certainly assumptions
here that the only cost driver for legal aid is the scope. There are
potentially many other cost drivers that ought to be looked at before
that, one of which is how things are screened. There is early advice
and prevention that goes on. One cost driver relates to an entirely
bureaucratic system that we have all suffered at the hands of for some
time, which wastes money and takes it away from the front line, and one
cost driver relates to the balance. If we look at the legal aid
expenditure, in relative terms, there are just a few very, very
expensive cases that are funded through that system. Investment early
on in many, many more cases bears considerably more fruit in terms of
cost coming out of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000051">&#160;</a>

welfare law, which is what we are talking about here, is a small part
of the legal aid budget—it is only about 5% or 6%. I echo the
importance of giving early advice at an early stage of the problem to
resolve it and stop it getting worse and reaching the point where you
need very expensive court proceedings. That early
advice—important though it is—is still legal and is still
on a matter of and a question of law, but it is a way of avoiding
having to go to court proceedings or tribunal proceedings. If we can
intervene at an early stage, we can stop cases spiralling to the point
where they cost more later
on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000052">&#160;</a>

not the case that the legal aid system has partly driven the
legalisation of some of these bodies? Tribunals were initially not
meant to be bodies where lawyers would represent people, but that has
ended up happening. That is partly because we are pushing more money
through legal aid, rather than into other ways of solving these
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000053">&#160;</a>

and difficult, which is why people need the help of lawyers to navigate
it. You could reduce costs by simplifying the system and making it

Gillian Guy, you mentioned that you were obviously anticipating some
substantial welfare reforms and that, at least for a time, there would
be transition problems and parallel running of the system, which would
create a greater need for advice. In the long run, is your expectation

universal credit and other reforms, to the extent that the

understand that proposal. It is not necessarily attractive, but we
think that that could work to resolve some of the issues that we have
spoken about. The alternative is to ensure that at least we have some
more provision at the advice end, which is currently a gap in the Bill,
and we have to work together to think how that interface will be
affected. Otherwise we will have the
separation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000062">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I just want to add to what Gillian said. The
Committee might be interested to visit a well-functioning example of
that, which is called Advice Services Coventry. It already uses
technology appropriately and it has streamlined methods for referral.
It does hot referrals, whereby if you walk into one agency and they are
not able to deal with an issue, that agency can send the notes on via
computer. It has protocols to work with local private advisers and it
has been running for the past five years.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000065">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">That is but
one example, but if you were interested it is quite a good example to
have a look at to see how a conception, such as the one that Gillian is
putting forward, is actually working in practice. It also fits in with
the Government’s agenda, because it is bottom-up, it is local
and addresses local needs, and it provides needs-based strategic
planning. It uses Legal Services Research Centre needs analysis to
provide mapping of where it has to target services,
etc.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000066">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I want to come
back to the problem that the Government have. I think that we all
acknowledge that the issue for the Government is how they control the
budget and manage to keep a purchase on their expenditure on proper
legal aid. I accept the point that you made that a person coming along
for advice does not turn up and go, “Hello, I’m a legal
debt problem.” They turn up with a multiplicity of
issues and it is often the task of the adviser to work out which
category the person might fall into. That is the position with legal
aid
currently.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000068">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Could
a system be developed so that, in effect, there were two thresholds?
One would be the general threshold that you come in on and then there
would be a further threshold to ensure that the Government’s
objective of controlling the legal aid budget was met, so that, in
other words, only people who were filtered through would get
proper legal advice that was properly
funded.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000069">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Julie
Bishop:</strong>
                  </em> Yes. That is exactly the protocol that is in
place in Coventry, where someone can come in for advice. If they arrive
first of all at the law centre and it is not deemed appropriate, their
case would be sent off to a more general agency to deal with those
other problems. For example, with an employment matter, if it is
something that ACAS can deal with, the other agency would have assisted
them to deal with it that way. It is only once a person is dismissed,
or needs something that is of a more legal nature, that they are
actually referred to Coventry law centre.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is our view
that the Government have a very difficult rationing problem. As
grass-roots agencies, this is the nature of our game. That is what we
do—we ration services every day. So the Coventry example has
been a mechanism to try and effectively ration very limited resources.
The collaboration is one means of doing it. What the Coventry example
gives us is the ability to deal with the person who has a multiplicity
of needs. It is not someone who happens to say, “Hi, I’m
in debt and please ignore my loss of
job”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000071">&#160;</a>

trying to describe together is getting the right people, the best
people with the suitable qualifications, to deal with the right level
of problem. What we would not be talking about, which we currently
endure, is a system whereby we have that dictated by funding streams.
The reason that we are particularly anxious about segregation of issues
is that we can have legal advisers, funded through legal aid, who sit
idle for hours during the day when they could be giving advice on other
funding streams, but there is that accountability for how that is
managed. That is why we do not want to see people parcelled up and sent
from one place to another. We want a collaborative approach that allows
us to pool our resources and use them most effectively to resolve
problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000072">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Julie
Bishop:</strong>
                  </em> I can speak for law centres directly. I think
we have supplied in the evidence that around 80% of our legal aid
funding will go. We have already lost 53% of local authority funds.
That is not foreshadowed; that is lost already. We estimate that, when
you add all the bits of funding together, a minimum of 40% of our
funding will be removed. That clearly means that we have to reduce and
really think very carefully about who we can see and who we cannot, and
what we do and do not focus on. The short of it is that for law centres
alone, 80,000 people will not be served. Of those 80,000, 79.5% are not
white. More startling, more than 90.5% earn less than £6,000 a
year. So I am not sure what will happen. Many of our clients will not
be at MPs’ surgeries, because they do not have the wherewithal
to get to them. They will be in doctors’ surgeries, hanging
around churches and sitting on streets begging for money. They will be
adding cost to Government elsewhere in the system. That is where our
clients will be.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000074">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Simon
Pugh:</strong>
                  </em> Shelter estimates that if the proposals go
through we would lose approximately 45% of our income from legal aid.
All of our advice centres across the country do legal aid in
combination with other things. The impact of that on the viability of
each individual advice centre is something that we would have to think
about very carefully. We would not expect our charitable fundraising to
be able to expand sufficiently to fill that gap. We help about 25,000
people a year through legal aid and we would lose many of those cases.
There would be large numbers of people who we would no longer be able
to help.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000075">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are also
concerned about the impact on the people whom we would be able to help.
We deal with housing, welfare benefits and debt, in many places, and,
as has been said repeatedly, people do not have a housing problem, a
debt problem or a benefits problem: they have all three. If we can no
longer deal with the whole issue, we are not solving the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000076">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">If we have a
client who comes in, who is in arrears and at risk of having their home
repossessed because they have housing benefit issues, at the moment we
can get the possession proceedings adjourned and deal with the housing
benefit issues. When the case comes back to court, the benefit problems
are resolved, the arrears are brought down, and the client is allowed
to continue to stay in their home.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000077">&#160;</a>

the proposals in the Bill, we would not be able to deal with the
underlying issue and resolve the cause, so we would simply be able to
adjourn the case, and send the client off to do their own benefits
work: it is not going to happen—we would come back to court and
nothing would have changed. If we cannot solve the
underlying problem, because we cannot deal with the whole issue, that
will have a significant impact on the people we are still able to
help.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000078">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Gillian
Guy:</strong>
                  </em> As I said earlier, we currently get
£25 million through legal aid. The impact on Citizens
Advice is that £20 million of that would go under the proposals.
That is an 80% cut in funding. That would mean that about 450 advisers
would go from within the Citizens Advice system. Clearly, that starts
to hit, with the other funding issues that I have mentioned, at the
viability of bureaux—particularly in the context in which it is
not spread evenly among bureaux. Only about half of them have legal aid
contracts, so the percentage of their relevant income is much higher
than if the funding were spread across the whole
piece.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000079">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Also,
the impact is random, and that is particularly dangerous given where
advice will and will not be available. There will be areas, we imagine,
that will be hit higher. The smaller contracts that could come out of
legal aid will probably not be economically viable or attractive, so we
could see advice agencies and, indeed, small firms of advisers and
lawyers, going out of business or, certainly, keeping out of legal aid
work.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000080">&#160;</a>

first is that the way that law centres try to solve problems is always
diversionary. That is what they were set up to do. It was to use legal
skills and to bring an understanding and knowledge of the law to
people’s problems so that they could be resolved effectively,
but that does not mean going to court. So the choice is always to ring
and to try to get a negotiated settlement. That is our practice as it
is. The staff may not be licensed mediators, but their method of
working is alternative dispute resolution in the broadest sense. That

that there are a lot of different qualifications and different styles

further rationing of that advice. That is obviously not where we want

we turn away, why and how? That is our problem every day—how do
we ration and how do we do it? Rather than nominating today who we will
turn away, one thing that I will say is that one of our key focuses in
the Law Centres Federation and in law centres themselves is young
people. We are concerned that young people are being particularly
disadvantaged by this Bill. By young people, I do not mean under-18s; I
mean under-25s. We have also submitted evidence about the impact on
young people and we believe that if you do not resolve a young
person’s civil legal issues—such as housing, education,
income support, etc.—there is a direct correlation between that
and criminality. Getting young people early, not only do you set them
up for life but you also divert them from other, bigger costs to the
Government in the criminal system. So we have a particular concern
about young people and how they will be dealt with.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000114">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, I
want to say something about rationing and what the endgame will be of
this loss of funding. The Government are not only rationing but with
the closure of any of our agencies they are also losing all the
resources that we bring. This is not a saving figure, but for every
£1 that we give to the Government we estimate that we bring in
about another £15 worth of additional resources. That is from
the big law firms that support us and that house the pro bono, the
charitable funds that the Government are not able to access, and so on.
That is to say nothing of our community links and the work that we do
with community agencies, because it is that work with the non-advice
sector that also gives you a full solution to the problem. What we are
able to do is not only solve the legal problem, but address, through
our community links, the compounding issues. When a law centre goes,
you not only lose skilled workers but you will not recapture that
resource that we
bring.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000115">&#160;</a>

that says, “For every £1 of legal aid expenditure, the

to do; you take things like savings to the NHS and net savings to the
Exchequer. Now, this may not be a reasonable question for you to answer
verbally now, so perhaps you could answer it in writing later. From
reading your numbers, I 
<div class="columnNumber">

loss of employment as GDP loss and that would be many times—or
at least several times—higher than the net loss to the
Exchequer, which is the number that would normally be used in a
cost-benefit analysis such as that. If I have read it
correctly—I am not sure that I have, because I do not have your
source data—that might radically change the £1 to
£2.98 ratio on debt advice, for example. I wonder if you might

that we are seeing some of the personal insolvency practitioners, on
both sides of the argument, later on today. That is where a lot of
focus has been in relation to civil litigation costs. Do you see the
effect on insolvency practitioners as an unintended consequence of the
Bill? Were you surprised by what you found in the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000123">&#160;</a>

unintended consequence. A lot of the consultation, and the Bill itself,
is framed towards personal injury. We have heard a lot about cuts in
legal aid budgets today, and about agencies. What we are looking at is
removing the ability of insolvency practitioners to recover funds for
the
state.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000124">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To
explain a little, quite frequently an insolvency practitioner will go
into a company, or a bankruptcy, where there is no money, because the
directors or third parties have, either through mismanagement or, at
the extreme end, through organised crime, conspired to make sure there
is no money there. The only way any money can be recovered for
creditors is for the insolvency practitioners to make an investigation,
which they are obliged to do, and then to bring insolvency proceedings
against those third parties, for recovery.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000125">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The cases can
range from mismanagement at the low end to the extreme end, such as
cases that fund terrorism. I have seen several such cases
myself—very serious crime. Without the ability, in those cases,
to recover the success fee in litigation, the lawyers will have to work
on risk, and the adverse cost premium, which, obviously, as it is an
after-the-event premium, is quite high. Those costs simply come off
whatever is recovered, which is supposed to go back to
creditors.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
about 25% of general insolvency cases, the Revenue is the unsecured
creditor. I think that the figure is probably significantly higher in
cases where there has been fraud, because the Revenue is a target for
fraud anyway, and tax fraud funds serious crime.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000127">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There would be
three unintended effects, I think. First, cases would become uneconomic
for practitioners and their lawyers to take on at all. Therefore there
would be no recovery. Secondly, there would be a massive reduction in
return to creditors. Creditors are obviously not only the taxpayer
generally, but small businesses, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 113<a class="bkMark" name="Column113">&#160;</a>
                  </div>employees and other people. Thirdly, there is obviously a massive
deterrent effect; if you pursue people who have committed fraud and
take their ill-gotten gains from them, they and others they know do not
do it again.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are
other types of fraud and I have dealt with cases involving gangmasters,
who can cause untold misery at the very basic level. We did one case
where a non-EU national was running a company—running
agricultural workers; they were on minimum wage, and there were
deductions of things like £1.50 for registering them with an NHS
dentist, and taking the rest of the money off them for putting them in
appalling, overcrowded rooms and so forth; and the company was not
paying tax either.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That company
was provisionally liquidated by the Revenue. The insolvency
practitioner who was appointed pursued the director, who had a house
worth £250,000, with no charge on it, and took all his assets
away from him; he was eventually deported. Better than that, the
business was sold to a legitimate business, which employed the people
with proper health and safety, a proper minimum wage and so forth. If
those cases cannot be taken on a proper economic footing, the ability
to do that will be
removed.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000130">&#160;</a>

Tom Brake was asking earlier about how services are organised. Do you
think that there could be improvements, in terms of value for money,
from having multiple centres: for example, having Shelter, law centres
and citizens advice bureaux in the same location? Do you also think
that increased use of phone and e-mail services could help save money,
but deliver the end result to the consumer?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000141">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Julie
Bishop:</strong>
                  </em> I have mentioned the Coventry example several
times now because there is a real potential for doubling up on services
and so on. I raised it because I wanted to highlight the fact that the
more common way we work is in collaboration with each other, rather
than doubling up. The second thing to say is that we are currently not
meeting demand as it stands, so would it be that we were doubling up?
The fact of the matter, as we have discussed, is that we are rationing
services already. Although there appear to be a lot of agencies working
in the sector, we are doing it because none of us, even together, are
meeting the demand that is there—that is the first
thing.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000142">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The second
question was about technological solutions—telephone lines,
e-mail advice and so on. Law centres have long used telephone advice
lines. Again, in certain situations, that is very effective. But what
we have discovered in using it is that you need to have an experienced
lawyer on the phone who is able to deal with the matter, understand
what the problem is, be able to address whether a face-to-face
appointment is required, and bring them in. The way we do telephone
advice lines is to front-load the expertise, rather than have someone
just read from a sheet. We do explore various other forms of
technology, but what we talk about is the appropriate use of
technology. Technology is a tool; it is not a solution. We try to
tailor our services to client needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000143">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On our client
profile, I have said that they earn less than £6
million—sorry, £6,000; I would prefer to be one of the
former at the moment—a year, but I have not said that on
average, they have low educational attainment. They have often left
school early and have poor literacy and numeracy. One of our biggest
problems is people’s ability to deal with the technology. Where
we can, we do. Where people can help themselves, we encourage that.
That is already our practice, and that is one reason why we get good
value-for-money figures.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000144">&#160;</a>

over the telephone through contracts with the Legal Services
Commission. We have experience of delivering legal advice and
information through all the different channels. They all work, and they
all deliver good advice in some cases for some people, but in some
cases that is not suitable. Some people need face-to-face advice. It
depends on the circumstances of the individual and their case. Where it
works, it can work well, be very effective and save money, but it is
not suitable for everybody or every case.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000145">&#160;</a>

Guy:</strong>
                  </em> To pick up the point about unmet demand, it is
undoubtedly the case that there is enough work and more to go round all
our organisations. Currently, there is quite a squeeze on the resource
that we have for them. That said, I am sure that there is room for
improvement. In any movement that has grown from the ground up over a
number of years—our organisation has grown over 70
years—there is room to look back at that and see how we operate.
Also, even with unmet demand—this is something that we would
have a responsibility to look at—we sometimes trip over each
other, and there is a degree of duplication, which we are mindful of
and looking at. A squeeze on resources tends to make us focus on doing
that, because we have a responsibility to keep services
running.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000146">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
said earlier that as Citizens Advice and in the bureaux, we are looking
at opening up different channels and providing advice to people in the
way that they would like to receive it. That echoes the point that
Simon Pugh made. In our view, there will always be a need for some
face-to-face, but we ought to have the most effective and
cost-effective method for each person.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000147">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is also
about public accountability. We all receive some public money, and we
have to be accountable for it. I think that we are transparent about
that, but there is more room around being able to share services,
support services, premises and so on. That is what was in the proposal
that we put forward to deal with the legal aid situation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000148">&#160;</a>

Lewis:</strong>
                  </em> I would like to respond to the question about
the use of technology. I know that the Ministry of Justice has
suggested that telephone advice is cheaper. That might well be the
case, but if you dig into the statistics, it appears that the telephone
advice system currently being run by the Legal Services Commission
attracts different people from those who use face-to-face services, and
possibly different cases. That information has been given to the
Ministry of Justice in our response to its original consultation. It
appears that telephone advice tends to be used more often by people who
need information, although they get information. It also appears, for
example—certainly in housing—that more people who receive
face-to-face advice are rehoused or retain their homes than those who
receive telephone advice. I suggest that that is because people ring
about different
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000149">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
other issue relates to different people using the phone as opposed to
face-to-face advice. It seems, as we pointed out in our evidence, that
more non-white people use face-to-face advice on housing. It also
appears that in relation to other benefits, 63% of users of
face-to-face advice are disabled, whereas the equivalent figure for the
telephone is 22%. I emphasise that when comparing

having earlier about the changes that are going on in welfare benefits,
housing and so on, and managing that transition. We have also got
changes to child maintenance, which are likely to create another
substantial period of need for advice. Indeed, I think that the
Government acknowledge that in their own proposals. Can you give us any
sense of the time scale during which that transition is likely to
create additional needs and are you already beginning to see any
effects, for example, in relation to the early changes in housing
benefit that will come in this year?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000151">&#160;</a>

things that is a real concern for us is that with the combination of
the Welfare Reform Bill, particularly the changes to housing benefit,

duties into the private rented sector and so on, there will be a lot
more people with problems in the private rented sector who will need
housing advice and housing help. The part of the safety net that is
there for them—the legal advice—may well not be there in
the future, unless and until they get to the point of being immediately
at risk of losing their home. But in terms of dealing with poor
landlords, landlord harassment, problems of disrepair and so on, short
of people being at serious risk of harm to health, we will no longer be
able to deal with all those early problems. During the next two or
three years, there are likely to be more people pushed into the private
rented sector, with changes to benefits and housing benefit going on in
the background, and during that time it will be a real

homelessness or actually being made homeless. That is of particular
concern to us. The time frame is probably more like seven to
10 years when we are trying to look at our projections,
because there are many changes coming together. One of the things that
we urge the Government to do across Departments is that, instead of

                  </em> The insolvency practitioner brings the
litigation as a representative, effectively, for all creditors, and
statute dictates how that money is distributed once it is recovered. If
you take my earlier answer, a quarter of those creditors are the
Revenue. Of course, there will be some larger corporations in there,
such as utilities, British Telecom and so forth, but there will also be
large numbers of smaller trade creditors, individuals and employees. As
a body, those individual and trade creditors have already lost money
and asking them to dig into their pocket again is difficult,
particularly when a lot of this litigation can be quite complex and
last a long time. I still have a case that we have had open for eight
years now. We have recovered money and assets but one of the properties
is owned by a Delaware company, and there has been a fake identity and
so forth. So there can be a huge investment of time and energy to get
money back for creditors.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000160">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On other
cases, we are about to send a cheque for £700,000 to the Revenue
from one case. It was not a fraud, but a mismanagement of the company.
There are large sums that can be recovered. You cannot expect
individual creditors to fund these things. They are done on risk by the
practitioner and their
lawyers.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000161">&#160;</a>

not seek an exemption for insolvency practices, although he did in
relation to clinical negligence. He talked about the fact that he
expected legal aid for clinical negligence still to be carried on but,
in your skilled area, he did not try to carve out an exemption. Therein
lies the following question, which is about the success bid and a
principle relating to your defendants. I say defendant because they are
not all dodgy directors. There will be defendants or people from whom
your creditors are seeking money, whose businesses just have not worked
and who have gone bust for lots of other reasons. Is it right that a
defendant—not a claimant or those creditors—pays a lawyer
a win bonus or a success fee to compensate the practitioner or the
solicitor for other cases that they may have elsewhere? Why is it right
that it falls on the defendant to compensate for other areas as opposed
to someone
else?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000162">&#160;</a>

Coulson:</strong>
                  </em> I do not think we are necessarily talking
about cross-subsidy of cases. In an average litigation case, any lawyer
will tell you that there is 25% litigation risk just because of the
nature of litigation. The lawyer and the insolvency practitioner will
have to pay their staff and certain statutory fees. They have to keep
going because litigation can last a long time. That is the risk they
are being paid for: the fact that they may 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 118<a class="bkMark" name="Column118">&#160;</a>
                  </div>not get paid at all on that case and that, in any event, they have to
wait a long time for their money. In insolvency cases, it is not a
matter of winning the case; it is actually recovering the money. I take
your point, Mr Wallace, that it might just be a business that has
failed through no fault of the person concerned. In fact, the
insolvency litigation that we are talking about ranges from wrongful
trading, which is trading at the expense of creditors when you should
have known better, to put it in plain terms, through to fraudulent
trading and that sort of end. You can take early advice if your
business is in difficulties and you do not trade at the expense of
other creditors because it knocks other businesses over. That is the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000163">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I do not dispute the risk—do not get me
wrong—but you never know which practitioner has only good cases.
In other parts of the law where you might see personal injury claims,
there are solicitors who represent only the easy claim. They do not go
for the risky area and certainly no one can assess that at the time. I
do not dispute your risk in insolvency practice; it is the question of
why that risk should be borne by a defendant in a case that may not be
connected with the risk that you carry elsewhere in your
business.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000164">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Frances
Coulson:</strong>
                  </em> The defendant will have had ample
opportunity to settle matters early. In this sort of litigation, unless
it is a fraud where you have to freeze assets because you cannot give
them notice, there have invariably been investigations and interviews.
There will have been letters before action and possibly a part 36 offer
to give them an opportunity to settle early. There will also have been
frequent offers of mediation. It is the wrongdoing of a defendant who
fights and loses that causes the costs and the risk. The creditors will
end up paying for that. In litigation, we are not just talking about
the success fee, which may be negotiated up or down. Practitioners want
to give a return to creditors, but they are taking a personal risk on
adverse costs and they are not excused just because they are taking a
representative action for creditors. That is a high premium. There is
no reason why the defendant, who is the person who has committed the
wrong at whichever end of the scale it is, should make the creditors
pay for
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000165">&#160;</a>

legal aid has expanded beyond its original remit. We take issue with

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To give one
example, 1984 was the largest expansion of legal aid in recent years,
under Margaret Thatcher’s Government. That was the PACE Act, and
nobody is talking about repealing it. On international comparisons, a
lot of figures have been bandied about that are inaccurate. I can quote
at length from Europe and New Zealand if need be. On rising costs, if
you look at the figures, the last Government were actually quite
successful at controlling costs. We took issue with the way that they
went about it, but if you look at the cost of legal
aid—particularly on the civil side, which is bearing the brunt
of something like £280 million in cuts—it has been under
control for about four years at least. The previous Conservative
Government, of course, was successful in cutting back on scope, which
was used as a blunt instrument for controlling costs at that time. I
could go on, but no doubt Members will want to follow up with
questions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000176">&#160;</a>

of a dog’s dinner, to be honest. There are 24 pages of

complex a situation. Three, we are concerned about the end of the Legal

have had real concerns about the use of indeterminate sentences for a
long time. They are bad for rehabilitation, in that prisoners face a
huge amount of uncertainty; they are unable to prepare for life in the
outside world without knowing when their release date will be. We hear
from our advice and information service, which takes queries from the
public, that individuals are chasing courses and not being able to get
on the courses that they want at particular establishments. They are
therefore thwarted in their efforts to attain a certain release date.
We think that these measures are very bad in cost terms; they have
imposed a huge cost burden and they are very bad for
rehabilitation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000181">&#160;</a>

good round-robin piece of research from Professors Bowles and Perry at
York university in his time as Minister with responsibility for legal
aid. I would not read the conclusions of that report or executive
summary too closely, as it seems to be slightly filleted, but if you
look at the report in its entirety, it gives a fair picture.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000187">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In a nutshell,
in continental Europe, inquisitorial systems cost a lost less in legal
aid, but you take the cost of the court systems and they come out as
similar to the UK. It has to be said that the UK has big policy
differences regarding criminal law, which means that we prosecute more
people and imprison more people; that means more costs in the system.
That, of courses, is a decision for Parliament. That means that we have
more costs compared with many jurisdictions.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000188">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">New Zealand is
really interesting. Things are changing there. If Members are
interested, I would look at section 114 of its regulations
on legal aid—what they call legal services. If you look at that,
pretty much in civil, you convert the New Zealand dollar, and it is
much the same level of means test that we have—slightly over
average income for the average family of NZD 30,000 or so a year, and
they would be entitled to civil legal aid in New Zealand. There is a
different spread of services and different types of law, so you cannot
draw direct comparisons, but New Zealand overall spends about
£20 a head; we spend about £38 on legal aid. It is a
different legal system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000189">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
point that I would make in the common law world is that it is difficult
to make comparisons, because you have state systems in the common law
world. For example, Queensland in Australia is completely different
from any other state there. Ontario in Canada—Roger knows it
well—has a legal aid system, and a legal aid board, very similar
to us. They spend less on crime, certainly. You look at that per head
of population, you look at their civil system, and I would argue that
it is a much better system because they deliver it through a salaried
service. The parallels that have been drawn have been slightly
misleading, to say the least.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000190">&#160;</a>

Smith:</strong>
                  </em> The obvious comparator is Scotland. Ten or 15
years ago, the Scottish legal aid scheme was the same as ours and it
has diverged. Some funny things have happened. They have retained legal
aid for personal injury and they have just increased eligibility for
it, to £30,000 from £10,000. How have they been able to
do that? It has been a much better managed scheme, to be honest. They
have avoided all the nonsense of CFAs, and they have made little
adjustments on the tiller instead of going for grand gestures. In some
ways, this Bill is in the tradition of the approaches by two previous
Governments to legal aid. They made grand gestures:
“We’ve got to do something big and enormous to get legal
aid under control.” We have had all this franchising,
competitive tendering and all these great things that were going to
come, and the Scots have just made little amendments here and
there—one or two salaried lawyers here, a bit of duty counsel
there—and they have managed the system much better. It is a real
criticism of how we have done it over two decades.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000191">&#160;</a>

very high-cost cases’ costs that we do. About 400 or so cases
cost around £200 million a year. Of course, they come down here
to our Supreme Court for that. Broadly, however, what Roger is saying
is correct and it has got to be said—their scheme has been
better managed, because it has been less politicised and there has been
less tinkering with the scheme and less introducing of different
management systems. That has led to more stability and a more stable

it is right to compare the inquisitorial system. My question is about
Canada. What are the income thresholds and what is the scope of cases
that are eligible for legal aid in Canada? I ask that because it seems
to me, when I have taken a cursory glance at these other systems, that
there is generally a lower scope and lower income thresholds in those
similar countries than there are here in Britain.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000196">&#160;</a>

of an investigator who obtains the evidence on the basis of which there
is a prosecution. We are concerned about a mission creep, where they go
beyond that to effectively giving someone a sentence. That is an
unfortunate extension of role that is wrong in principle and
potentially has practical problems if it starts to figure in the kind
of negotiations that might occur between a police officer investigating
a case and the

Scottish system? Steve Hynes was correct about the very high cost of
cases. That mostly has a big impact on the Serious Fraud Office and
down south. But the contention seems to be—this came across from
both yourself and Mr Hynes—that the Ministry of Justice should
be looking more at taking some money out of criminal legal aid. If
there is money to find, we should be tougher on criminal legal aid than
on civil. The Scots did save some money in that way. I have had
meetings with academics from Scotland who have said that. But they have
also found themselves in trouble in relation to Cadder and things like
that, where the withdrawal of legal advice from the police station has
landed them in hot water with the European convention on human rights
and the courts. That aside, do you still think we should be looking at
criminal legal aid and whether there is money to be taken from
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000228">&#160;</a>

legal aid has been well managed in terms of the use of salaried lawyers
here and there very strategically. We had a big experiment with the

at fees within the system. Again, Lord Bach knows all about this. He
reduced fees by 12% in criminal cases. The last one coming through in
the current year was a stepped reduction. You could look at very
high-cost cases again. Most members of the Committee will be aware of
Sir Bill Callaghan’s letter of 7 February from the commission.

say that it will be more than that. I warn that one danger is the

look at criminal again. You cannot look at scope, obviously. You
mentioned the case of Cadder. You can also look at fees, but there are
two warnings. You can make savings, but it means consolidation in the
market, lack of choice and the potential for cartels. Then you have the
potential to lose excellence within the system. Lawyers will obviously
tend to oversell themselves in terms of their excellence and their
worth, but you can push and push and you will get to a stage where you
may lose, particularly at the top end with the advocacy and other

to coincide with the consultation. It was an NOP piece of research that
found that the people who are less likely to use the internet and
telephone services are social group DE, and they are the ones who
qualify for legal aid. There you have your answer. If you want a legal
aid system that people do not use, deliver it through telephone advice,
because the ones who pass the means test tend to be the ones who do not
have telephones. The big issue with that is mobile phones and
pay-as-you-go. Obviously, those in social group DE tend to have that

the minimum that you need. What you are going to get is
people—who may be politically motivated—wanting to
judicially review the Lord Chancellor. They will be refused legal aid,
so they will take judicial review against a refusal to give them legal
aid for a judicial review, and that will spiral out. In a way, it is a

interfering or, more importantly, being seen to interfere with
decisions in individual cases. I think that that is a political
liability for any Government, and you should not be putting yourselves
in that position. Roger is right: the minimum should be an appeals
system. You do not need an expensive tribunals system; you can adapt
what you already have and have review panels or set something up. That
is a plea to look again at what you have, because I do not think that
clause 33 will achieve what you want it

                  </em> We have already had good signals from both the
Minister and the Secretary of State that they will look at that again.
I hope that, on Report, the Government will bring something forward to
repeal or withdraw those provisions. I was amused by the Secretary of
State’s performance on Second Reading, when he blamed the
Opposition for it. Clearly, it might be their fault, but he is in
government and I gather from the Minister that you will look at that
again, which we are encouraged by. The case of Cadder has already been
mentioned. It is a given that we need to retain the police station
advice that we
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000252">&#160;</a>

Court, which was what the Cadder case was about. We intervened in
Cadder, so we have some responsibility for the case, which requires the
Scots to have a duty solicitor scheme that they have not had so far.
The problem is that if you do not see a solicitor and get advice before
you are interviewed by the police, what you say in that interview may
not be admissible in court. I hope, in that light, that policy will
remain as it is now and that the Bill will be changed. What is more

Lord Chancellor powers in secondary legislation to do potentially very
damaging things. While we have had assurances that there are no
immediate plans to introduce means and merits testing, this remains a
possibility and that is very concerning—from a justice
perspective and, as others have said, from a practical
perspective—as well as being unworkable. We will have people
escorted into custody and then an attempt to make a means assessment
without any of the available documentation to make it
possible.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000254">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Steve
Hynes:</strong>
                  </em> Thank you for the friendly question. I would
say particularly social welfare law and, for the practicalities, I
cannot understand the logic of the Government deciding that
repossession should be the criterion for a housing case. You have a
situation of litigation not being prevented: people have to get to the
stage of repossession before they get legal aid to spend in court. It
makes eminent sense to me, and to most thinkers in this field, that you
get early advice—housing advice or housing benefit
advice—before you ever get to a property being repossessed.
Looking down those areas, they are very common areas of law which
affect ordinary people up and down the country. I think it makes sense
to retain them because although you can argue about the economics,
ultimately, the state and the private sector save
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
were disappointed that the Government did not look at alternative
methods of funding which we think are out there and could be looked at.
The Government already have an alternative method of funding: it is
called the legal aid impact test. It has not been changed in policy.
Money is transferred within Government when legislation is shown to
have a legal aid impact—family credit introduction led, I think,
to about £30 million being transferred from the Department for
Work and Pensions. It would make sense to give that sort of
market-based inducement for Departments to get their decision making
right first time and to save a lot of problems, mainly for people at
the sharp end of legal
disputes.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000257">&#160;</a>

are going to make these cuts broadly and that there is nothing that any
of us really can do about that, except perhaps here and there. I am not
dissociating myself from what Steve is saying about the broad picture,
but if you are looking for one potential winnable issue, I would say it
is clinical negligence. That is the most vulnerable issue for the
Government—people with catastrophic injuries, or birth injuries
and defects—and you will get major publicity coming down the
line, while the cost is relatively small. The logic is
incoherent—they were exempted from conditional fee arrangements
for very good reasons in the first place. Were you to ask what I would
concentrate on as the one winnable issue, my answer would be clinical
negligence.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000258">&#160;</a>

                  </em> If I can sketch out one overarching
category of concern, it is where the proposals in the Bill will place
many individuals who challenge decisions of public authorities, whether
of a Department or more widely. They are going to lose their practical
ability to do make such challenges. We are concerned that that will
have a real impact of constitutional significance and will, to some
extent, change the relationship between the individual and the state.
We know that public authority problems, in the standard of decision
making in Departments such as the Department for Work and Pensions or
the UK Border Agency, already impose burdens of their own on the legal
aid system. As far as Liberty is concerned, these measures, rather than
trying to deal with the underlying problem of the poor quality of
administrative decision making, will just prevent people from
challenging decisions, which is not the right way of going
about it and cutting waste out of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000259">&#160;</a>

                  </div>would be better to improve the quality of Government decision making, as
you would not then need to spend money on legal aid. You may want to
comment on that. What do you mean by greater constitutional
significance? I see what you mean in relation to being able to review
the decisions of corporate bodies. What do you see as the overall
impact on access to justice of the Bill as a
whole?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000260">&#160;</a>

here. The idea is that everybody is subject to the law. That does not
just mean the fact that there are laws in place that are, in theory,
applicable to all; it means that people can vindicate their rights.
People have practical access to justice. When I talk about the
constitutional argument, I mean equal access to justice, and nobody
being above the law and not having to face the consequences of their
administrative failures, for example. That is the specific point that I
was seeking to address there.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Overall, the
impacts of parts 1 and 2 on access to justice will be huge. Liberty is
extremely concerned about proposals in relation to conditional fee
arrangements and after-the-event insurance. We think that that is
another example of a situation in which victims are going to be unable
to challenge very serious wrongdoing and, in the case of conditional
fee arrangements, wrongdoing by very powerful multinational companies,
such as in the Trafigura case. This will have an impact not just on the
individuals involved in a particular dispute, but on the culture: how
decisions are made in big business and whether considerations about
human rights and due process are taken into account by those who have a
lot of power.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000262">&#160;</a>

Smith:</strong>
                  </em> The phrase “access to justice”
drives me mad. It is completely meaningless. Chipped on to the
architrave of the United States Supreme Court is “equal
justice.” That is the phrase that the Americans use. I take that
to mean that, in any dispute between two institutions or people, the
result will be determined by the intrinsic and inherent worth of the
arguments, and not by the relative money and resources that each has.
That is what is really important. The Bill threatens that in a variety
of ways. One thing that we do not have time to explore now is in
relation to divorce. Poor people and women will be shoved into
mediation. Rich people and men, predominantly, will have the luxury of
having lawyers. You had a discussion earlier about mediation. Mediation
is a really good thing. Mediation for one is mediation for all. You
could exclude all lawyers from the divorce court so that Prince Charles
and Princess Di do not get one, either—everybody does mediation.
But the Bill is a mess because some categories of people will not get
lawyers and will be shoved into mediation, and others will get what
they will see, probably rightly, as a better
service.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000263">&#160;</a>

                  </em> From our perspective in the standing
committee we focus primarily on youth justice. The legal aid reforms
are particularly of concern in relation to the children’s rights
perspective. We are particularly concerned about decisions that have
been taken on what remains out of scope. We—the
Children’s Society—asked for data from the Ministry of
Justice in relation to legal aid representation for under-18s. The data
that were given to us show that nearly 990 cases will remain out of
scope. That is 5% out of scope for legal aid representation, and 5% of
cases for the most recent data for 2010-11 is £8 million. We are
talking about saving a fraction of the total spend here. The majority
of that is in relation to clinical negligence, which accounts for about
£6 million.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000278">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The point is
that we believe in the fundamental right to representation for all
children under 18. Recognition has been given that children in family
law are not able to represent themselves, but there seems to have been
arbitrary decision making about whether or not children can represent
themselves in other elements of law. There is a principle here that we
particularly feel strongly about. There needs to be a differentiation
between children and adults. The impact assessment does not make that
differentiation. The Government have approached this reform with a
desire and speed for legislation that is premised on an economic
imperative, not a principled imperative that recognises that children
are fundamentally different developmentally and are unable to represent
themselves as adults. Access to justice and issues of equal justice
need to be seen differently for children than for
adults.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000279">&#160;</a>

Maggie Atkinson:</strong>
                  </em> I would add to that. We are bound
not only by the international and national articles that are quoted in
the Bill, but by the European Union’s guidance on child-friendly
justice from last autumn, which makes it clear that children are in and
of themselves already vulnerable as a population. As witnesses in the
previous session indicated, legal aid is almost always concentrated on
those who are least able to fund their own access to legal redress. We
are concerned that young people who are leaving care and who do not
necessarily have access to the resources that they might need to set
themselves up independently are out of scope—young people who
have experienced criminal injuries, including abuse. Particularly,
young people left severely disabled in cases where there are contested
issues of clinical negligence may live a long life, and they have a
right, under the United Nations convention, to the best possible
quality of life and to a system that does everything in their best
interests, irrespective. Therefore, as Children’s Commissioner,
I am
concerned.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000280">&#160;</a>

must point out that I am speaking only about England. There is a
commissioner in Wales, who will no doubt talk to you about the Welsh
situation if you wish to. It is important that we understand that
litigation in person by a child is completely inappropriate in a court
system that, even in family law, remains adversarial rather than
inquisitorial. Such children are already vulnerable. Many of them are
already damaged, and the lack of access to legal aid seems to us to be
another insult.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000281">&#160;</a>

However, that will not apply to under-18s. Do you think that it should

lengths in the courts to try to ensure that young people are not sent
to prison unless that is the only available alternative. The figures on
sentences of prison for breach demonstrate that in many cases, where an
offence of that nature has been committed, the courts try to give
another chance to the young person. If they make the best of that
chance and reform themselves, they will not find themselves back in the
court. However, if they breach the order, a prison sentence will be
activated. That discretion should
remain.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000283">&#160;</a>

will not support the approach of a mandatory sentence in such a case.
As my colleague said, from his experience as a magistrate, I think that
that view will be supported by other magistrates. The options available
to the court to deal with children who get involved in serious knife
offences are sufficiently robust and can result in sufficient custodial
sentences if the case

basis, and entirely based on the evidence that we collect as the Office
of the Children’s Commissioner? Whenever we speak with young
offenders and those who work with them, there is a great deal of solid 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 134<a class="bkMark" name="Column134">&#160;</a>
                  </div>evidence, as you said, that restorative justice approaches not only work
for victims and offenders but can be a really solid mechanism for
turning round the lives of young offenders.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000292">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our recent
report launched in this building, “I think I must have been born
bad”, points out strongly that there are always at least two
victims when a young offender offends. The first is the victim of the
crime that young offender commits, but the second is almost always the
young offender. Huge percentages have very special needs, with real
family issues and background difficulties and all sorts of mental
health problems.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000293">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A restorative
justice approach seems to be one of those things that you can and
should use with young people, because it is multi-agency and because it
almost always involves mental health and physical health professionals
as well as those in the justice system itself. I was in an about to be
reopened newly refurbished local authority secure children’s
home only last week, where restorative justice programmes are at the
heart of what they will do when they move those young people into a
fantastic new setting that will help them turn their lives around. More
importantly, when they leave, it should leave them able to call on what
they have learned from restorative justice the next time they are faced
with the temptation to commit an offence. That is the real fruit of
restorative justice when it works well, for the offender as well as for
the victim.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000294">&#160;</a>

                  </em> I endorse that point. Many members of the
Standing Committee believe that there is robust evidence to support the
use of restorative justice. You only have to look at Northern Ireland.
I know that the Minister has been there to see the conferencing model
in operation. The Prison Reform Trust, which is a member of the
Standing Committee, has produced a robust report outlining the
beneficial outcomes in relation to a reduction in reoffending, where
restorative justice is used effectively in the conferencing
model.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In relation to
the Bill, we welcome the loosening of the restrictions on the use of
the referral order for children, which I am sure you are aware includes
a restorative element. We hope that guidance will ensure that it
becomes a more restorative process with higher
levels of victim involvement than at present. We believe
that it should be extended to cases where a child is convicted after
trial, provided that following the conviction they admit their
involvement in the offence and agree to abide by the referral order. We
are supportive of what the legislation is doing with that element of
restorative justice, and would argue that it could be taken
further.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000296">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In terms of
out-of-court disposals being used as a first-tier option, the
restorative element is very much focused around the police and the
delivery of restorative intervention is part of a conditional caution.
Again, we are supportive of that, but the critical element will be in
the delivery, the implementation and the resourcing, and also who
implements it.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000297">&#160;</a>

of the diversionary community-based, community payback and restorative
community action work that the youth offending teams might previously
have carried out entirely on their own. There are also a lot of
preventive strategies at work in schools—almost mediation and
restorative approaches within the school setting that can stop a

manager would tell you that their mission in life was to put themselves

recognise that cuts are biting; something like 18% was the last figure
I saw for reductions in funding for youth offending teams. This is
therefore not something that you can simply pass to a well-meaning but
ill-trained volunteer, lest anyone think it is. People working in youth
offending teams are very specialist indeed, and they are multi-agency.
It is about how those localities meet that challenge without letting
young people fall into risky behaviours, and being offended against as
well as offending. I imagine that the Standing Committee has other
things to say, as would

youth offending teams as constructed under the Crime and Disorder

primary purpose is to deal with crime prevention and reducing offending

aid for children under the proposals. Issues that were previously out
of scope of the Bill, such as special educational needs, have been
brought within scope. The 5% of cases that will no longer be
specifically provided for under legal aid are mainly cases of clinical
negligence, which can be covered by CFAs. In some of the most
complicated cases, there is also an exceptional fund, at the
judge’s discretion. Is it not the case that all children in

the strongest argument against the proposals in the legislation for
cuts to legal aid for family proceedings. The review goes through the
research, which indicates that litigants in person experience a number
of problems that impact on the court. Those include the fact that they
are unable to understand evidential requirements, and that they have
difficulty with the forms they have to deal with and with identifying
relevant facts. According to the MOJ’s literature review, they
are often overwhelmed by the procedural and oral demands, and they have
difficulty explaining their case. The review also goes through the
impact on case outcomes and most of the evidence indicates that case
outcomes are adversely affected by lack of representation. We are very
worried at the NSPCC about the negative result that the lack of legal

Maggie Atkinson:</strong>
                  </em> You will know that both my
predecessor, Professor Sir Al Aynsley-Green, and I have been concerned,
as the Office of the Children’s Commissioner, and indeed
involved in changes to issues to do with children and young people in
the asylum system. We were asked, under my powers, to intervene by a
legal representative in the case of a child and a family. I will
briefly tell you about it, if I may.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000309">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A foreign
national, imprisoned on very serious charges and then further detained
under the immigration rules, had three children. One was a 16-year-old
who was almost at the end of her GCSEs and who had made a life for
herself. The children were living apart from the mother and each other
in different sorts of local authority care. When the Government decided
to deport the mother, they included every child in the family within
that deportation order. The 16-year-old expressed the view that having
made a life for herself and being about to sit her exams, she should
not be made to go and she did not want to go. We intervened. Had we
intervened under the Bill as it is currently formed, and should it 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 137<a class="bkMark" name="Column137">&#160;</a>
                  </div>become law, she would not have had recourse to legal aid of any sort and
nor would the family. As asylum seekers, they had no other recourse to
public funds.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000310">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Unfortunately,
the case went through and was lost, but that is not the point. The
point is that as a very vulnerable young person who had already been
through the trauma of her mother being both a criminal and a failed
asylum seeker, she would not have recourse to legal help. She spoke
English as a second language and there are all of the things that have
just been summed up. That is only one example, but there are many, many
more.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000311">&#160;</a>

encouraging statement that wherever possible children and young people
would be given legal aid. That is absolutely welcomed; I welcome that
very strongly indeed. But it is how you define “wherever
possible”.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000312">&#160;</a>

                  </em> It seems that we are in the area of
one of those escalator things—a technical term. Somebody is
brought before the bench for a minor matter and a fine is imposed; the
fine is not paid and it becomes a criminal matter. The person does not
turn up and it becomes a further step up the ladder of the criminal
matter. Before you know where you are, you have somebody who is out of
scope of the magistrates court and is suddenly somewhere in a higher
court in the land, because they did not pay a whatever-it-was fine.
That includes things like school truancy and goodness only knows what
else. I think that we need to be very careful, and raising the fine to
that level would be one of the things that would almost put the system
at odds with itself. I think that David has just summed that up really
well. I do not know what the Standing Committee thinks.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000316">&#160;</a>

unrealistic that a child or young person would be able to pay the sum
of £2,500. In our briefing on the Bill, we said that the fine
could be capped at £250. But there is a broader point. There is
an extension of adult provisions—this is one of them—to
apply to children that are wholly inappropriate. The other two, if I
may draw your attention to them, are, in clause 67, the extension of
curfew requirements to a maximum of 16 hours per day for up to 12
months, and in clause 69, the extension of the maximum period of the
youth rehabilitation order to three and a half years. These are
essentially extensions of adult provisions, applying them to children,
that will not in any way impact on reducing reoffending or promote
youth rehabilitation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000317">&#160;</a>

back to restorative justice? First, a general question about whose

enormous. Secondly, we had an interesting debate this morning about
what types of offences might sensibly be dealt with in a restorative
justice context; mediation is clearly that. I would be interested to
hear whether in your experience there are types of offence that young
people have committed where victims will never agree to have
restorative justice-type arrangements in
place.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000320">&#160;</a>

I am not a legal expert. I have found generally that what one might
call environmental crimes—graffiti, vandalism and that sort of
thing—generally have a positive response to restorative justice.
For a young person who has been graffiti-ing property to spend time
cleaning it up and talking to the property owner about the consequences
has been quite helpful. I suggest that for certain categories of crime
such as sexual crime or crimes of violence, victims are by and large
not keen to engage in restorative justice—not always, but
generally they would not be
keen.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000321">&#160;</a>

given what we are seeking is a situation in which the lower cost of
restorative justice is of benefit in a broader sense, provided that
those costs and benefits sit with local government, local government
should hold it. Equally, you could transfer that provision to the
probation service or any other part of the system; but it needs to be

raised by Mr Solomon, the extension of YROs? I think you made the point
fairly but I want to press you somewhat. We are dealing with potential
extensions of term, for example if there has been a failure to adhere
to requirements within the three-year 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 139<a class="bkMark" name="Column139">&#160;</a>
                  </div>period. What is being proposed is really an
extension of discretion by the court to impose an extra term, if there
had been a failure to comply with a condition during the three-year
period. It is not a simple question of inflation, in terms of allowing
a court to impose a three and a half year period at the beginning of a
sentence; it is all about the potential to give the court leeway to
impose a further term if insufficient progress has been made by the
young person or if there is a
breach.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000326">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Enver
Solomon:</strong>
                  </em> The point here is what will facilitate a
reduction in reoffending and promote rehabilitation. The evidence is
very clear from criminological research that, for young people under
18, sentence length does not act as a deterrent. The length of sentence
does not make a difference. What makes a difference to a young person
is what happens to them in the course of their experience in the youth
justice system. If they are given opportunities to engage in education,
training and skills, if an approach is taken that addresses the factors
behind their offending, and if, critically, there is resettlement
support for that young person on leaving custody—there was a
recent report by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of prisons, which
was, quite frankly, damning about the nature of resettlement support,
an issue with which we have been trying to get to grips for many, many
years and we are still failing to do so—those are the elements
that determine whether a young person will return to the community as a
law-abiding individual. Those are the critical elements. I do not think
that an extension of sentence length will address that. I would never
argue that one should make excuses for breach, but there needs to be
discretion and a proportionate response to breach. We need to recognise
that young people, critically, learn by making mistakes. Unless we
recognise that, we will not facilitate their
rehabilitation.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000328">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Maggie Atkinson:</strong>
                  </em> I would like to make the point that
one has to realise that, while three years, three and a half years or
any period in an adult life is a bit of a blink of an eye, in the mind
and life of a child it is a very long time. I think Enver’s
point in his earlier contribution was much more about the fact that if
you allow a Bill to pass into law that treats children as if they were
just cut-down adults and applies adult strictures in a child-specific
setting, you are not guaranteeing their rights. You are not creating a
system that is child-appropriate or child-specific.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000329">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This is a very
complex measure, obviously, because it layers legal aid, sentencing,
young people, children and adults all in one big piece of legislation.
It will be difficult to implement if you are not very clear about what
you mean by a child. For example, clause 109 mentions under-18s and
under-17s. There are elements of the Bill that say a child is under 18,
but the caution is for those under 17. I really think that you have an
opportunity to create a measure that is very clear about what you mean
by different age groups and how they should experience the system. How
they experience the system when they are children may well stop them
being adult offenders, if we can get it right. The Bill has been
trailed as a very big opportunity to change things for the
better.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000330">&#160;</a>

point about treating children like adults in relation to curfew. I
think you expressed concerns that curfew provision was being read
across to children, with the potential for their receiving curfews of
up to 16 hours. What, specifically, are your concerns about
the impact and risks to children and young people of that provision in
the
Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000331">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Enver
Solomon:</strong>
                  </em> There are several issues here. Children who
are subject to a curfew and children who get caught up in the youth
justice system are often from particularly vulnerable backgrounds where
there might be family conflicts, particularly domestic violence, abuse
or neglect. We know that the overlap between children in the youth
justice system and those who have experienced abuse and neglect is very
clear. A curfew of that length has the potential to trap them in a home
where they are already experiencing abuse, neglect and the consequences
of domestic violence. In addition, their opportunity to participate in
education and other positive rehabilitative activities would be
severely limited by such lengthy curfews, which also have the potential
to exacerbate any mental health problems or communication difficulties
that they might be experiencing, and to limit their capacity to receive
support for special educational needs, and so on.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000332">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There is also
a further risk of ratcheting up with the provision. It is the escalator
effect that was mentioned earlier. Sentencers might fail to use it to
divert children from custodial sentences, so it might not be used as an
alternative, but instead will apply longer curfews to children who
might otherwise receive shorter ones. There will be a net-widening
effect instead of its being used as an alternative disposal. I have
outlined a number of concerns that I think need to be taken into
account in particular in relation to this
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000333">&#160;</a>

team will tell you that it is no good just slapping a curfew on a young
person if you are not going to give them a package of support to
address their needs holistically. If you just give them a curfew, and
hope that somehow that will address the reasons behind their behaviour,
that is unrealistic. Of course, there needs to be proportionality, but
we must recognise that we cannot just apply curfews to children and
expect them to change their behaviour; we need to apply packages of
support as

                  </strong> The Bill gives more responsibility to local
authorities in relation to children who are remanded, and that may be
welcome in some parts of the criminal justice system. Is it welcome to
local authorities and, assuming that it is in principle, from the
practical point of view are there resource implications, and how will
the courts and local authorities
respond?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000336">&#160;</a>

                  </em> The question can be answered in two
parts. The principle is broadly welcomed by local government. We
already manage quite a large proportion of that work anyway. It will
make the whole position much clearer for all concerned for it to be in
one place.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000337">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">When it comes
to the specifics, as always the devil is in the detail. In the case of
my authority, 64% of young people who are remanded or in secure
accommodation are aged 17. They are groups of young people who are
classified not as juveniles by the courts, in which case there would be
another disposal, but as young people who are legally adults, but are
treated in a slightly hybrid way under the current system. I think
there is a question about whether it is appropriate for the full local
authority care system to be applied to all young people who find
themselves
remanded.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
had the experience of a young woman in court who had committed a
violent crime, which had resulted in her being estranged from her
family. The key issue was whether she would be able to go home to her
family. The answer was yes, but that was discovered after the court had
decided that she had to be remanded because there was nowhere else for
her to go. In that situation, is it appropriate for that young woman to
be subject to the whole process of
care?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000339">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Children and Young People Now organisation estimates that an additional
3,000 children across all the different age groups will come into the
care system in the UK. Clearly, that is a costly prospect, so there is
our usual concern about ensuring that the funding is adequate. When it
comes to the technical operation of secure accommodation, we need to
ensure that Prison Service secure accommodation is sufficiently
flexible to take account of needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000340">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">At the moment,
the nearest secure accommodation to my authority in west London that
provides secure accommodation in the Prison Service is in Bristol, and
that means that any social worker carrying out their duties under the
various care provisions must go to Bristol. The planning for a young
person’s return to their family, their local area, and to
education, which may be in the space of a few days in some cases, must
be done from Bristol. If the prison service decides for technical or
practical reasons that it must move the young person to HMP Deerbolt in
County Durham, our social workers must go to County Durham to do that
work. There is an issue about ensuring that the practical side of the
system is geared up to deal with young people who are subject to the
normal care services provided by
councils.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000341">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Maggie Atkinson:</strong>
                  </em> There is a broad welcome from across
the sector for the notion of moving towards a more care-based system.
You will know that something like 45% to 50% of those who are currently
remanded in young offender institutions and other settings are actually
on remand. Many of them are never found guilty and are released, but
they are locked up on remand, so we welcome moving to a more care-based
system.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
has just been pointed out, the devil will be in the detail of the
implementation. At what point do the provisions of the Bill trump the
Children Act 1989, which has detailed and already legally binding
strictures on local authorities as to what a child in need is, what a
child in care proceedings is and what a care order looks like? If you
mean section 20 of the 1989 Act, you need to say that on the face of
the Bill, otherwise you will have local authorities thinking,
“Do we have the right accommodation? Do we have secure beds? Do
we have the right trained staff? If someone commits the offence over
there, is he ours or is he theirs?” The devil will 
<div class="columnNumber">

                     <strong>Enver
Solomon:</strong>
                  </em> We fully endorse the principle and we fully
endorse proposals that children remanded in custody should be given
care status. My understanding from officials is that they will have
section 20 care status. I agree with Dr Atkinson’s point that it
is important to make that clear on the face of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000343">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is an important principle in what the Bill is trying to do with the use
of remand. The Standing Committee has a reputation for always being
overtly critical of Government in what they are trying to do with
custody. Here, we want wholeheartedly to support what the Bill is
trying to do about the use of remand for under-18s. The number of
children remanded in custody is almost double the number of adults
remanded in custody. There is an overuse and an inappropriate use of
remand for children. Half the children who are remanded in custody are
either acquitted or given a non-custodial sentence. We have wasted vast
amounts of taxpayers’ money on needlessly locking up very
vulnerable children for short periods on
remand.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Bill will introduce a very clear barrier to the use of youth detention
and a very clear incentive to use local authority accommodation. As I
understand it, it will incentivise local authorities to use resources
to respond to children who come to court facing remand decisions. When
a decision has not been made to grant bail, local authorities will be
incentivised to support those children in the community, where
appropriate, while setting down very clear parameters about what has to
be met for the use of secure custodial remand. Any young person who is
a threat to the community or who has committed a severe violent offence
would still be remanded in custody. We welcome measures that will, we
hope, dramatically reduce the needless use of custodial remand for many
children.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000345">&#160;</a>

providing that care will increase exponentially. Due consideration will

litigation in some circumstances. People feel that they have a
duty—and it is quite right that they do—to know what has
gone wrong in hospital. Occasionally, people bring civil claims to find
out what is wrong, but you could not bring one just to find that out.
People will bring a civil claim only if they have physical or
psychological damage, which is compensateable through the civil court
system. It is unlikely that anyone would bring a claim to find out what
went wrong, because there is no remedy there; it is simply to get
disclosure. I do not think that that will have a huge impact, although
it is highly
desirable.</p>

that the current proposals are a double whammy for such clients. Those

costs. That seems fundamentally unfair and

We fundamentally agree that in any system, it is essential that people
who have been in that situation—a car accident or a workplace
accident—who have got an injury when it was not their fault, get
quick and proper redress. That is fundamental to our approach. That can
be through the legal system or outside it, but that is fundamental to
our approach. We believe that the package of reforms that Jackson has
proposed, some of which are under scrutiny in the Bill, will improve
and enhance that system, reduce its cost and increase its speed and
effectiveness.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000368">&#160;</a>

Hopkins:</strong>
                  </em> As an organisation, we strongly disagree
with that position. Any litigant who has to bring a claim financed by a
conditional fee arrangement will be worse off than they are now. There
are two extremes. The first is the case of a brain-injured child. Less
than 10% of the damages that are awarded to a child, even if the
damages run into millions of pounds, represent pain, suffering and loss
of amenity. Most of the damages represent losses consequent on that
child’s injury. Yet, those in themselves are not always enough
to cover the cost. In our submission to the consultation on the Jackson
reforms, we provided case studies that showed that the general damages
element—pain, suffering and loss of amenity—is needed for
the children to supplement their accommodation costs. Without that,
their damages will not pay for the adapted accommodation that they
require.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000369">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">In
any event, the past losses are not the child’s; they are usually
owed in trust to that child’s parents, who might have spent
five, 10 or 15 years providing free care for the child. Although most
parents are generous and do not immediately ask, “Which bits of
the damages are mine?”, it is not the child’s. Yet, both
general damages and past losses are available up to the cap of 25% for
a deduction. We believe that that will leave a severely disabled child
in a worse position; much worse than they are currently. Furthermore,
if you look at the squeezed middle of our society—the people
that Muiris just talked about, on average incomes of £30,000,
£40,000 or £50,000—they could not afford to bring
a claim without a conditional fee arrangement and are not eligible for
legal aid. If your injury is self-limiting and you are recovered in two
or three years, but you lost a significant amount of income, 25% of
your damages—all of them if you do not have future
damages—could be taken towards a success fee. Take a
self-employed plumber: a chunk of the damages will be his loss of
earnings and he will never get those back because they will be deducted
under the conditional fee arrangement. People will be left at a serious
disadvantage.</p>

Lyons:</strong>
                  </em> There is a broad point, which is that the
whole premise behind the package of reforms that with which this part
of the Bill is concerned is addressing disproportionate costs, stemming
from Lord Justice Jackson’s report. But of course, as you will
all know, the Ministry of Justice has been overseeing a very successful
pilot that was introduced for road traffic claims up to £10,000,
which has fixed costs for those cases: £1,350 plus a 12.5%
uplift. Up to 75% of all personal injury claims are now in a
streamlined, fast-track, fixed-cost process. That has addressed the
issue of disproportionate costs in three quarters of all personal
injury cases. I should add that I know the Ministry are

               <p class="tabbed">We are left
with the really difficult, complicated cases. Industrial disease,
clinical negligence, catastrophic injury—those are the sort of
cases in which clients will find it very difficult to find a lawyer to
take on expensive, difficult litigation on their behalf. If they lose
those cases, they will find it very difficult, and in the absence of
legal aid they will find it very difficult to bring those cases where
legal aid will otherwise be
available.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000371">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Nick
Starling:</strong>
                  </em> I want to distinguish between catastrophic
injury claims and the more straightforward ones. Our members are less
involved in clinical cases, but they deal with massive motor
claims—catastrophic claims there—and it is absolutely
essential that people are compensated according to their needs. That is
vital and needs to happen. I would merely make the observation that the
25% limit is not a target; it is an absolutely maximum that lawyers can
take. It need not necessarily be
taken.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000372">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Looking
at the vast majority of straightforward claims I think that that is
where the problems in the system lie; they attract disproportionate
costs. We now have an extremely simple motor portal system that
requires very little input. Liability is usually determined very
easily. As Muiris Lyons just pointed out, the £1,350 fee for
that—£1,200 plus VAT—is utterly disproportionate
to what must happen. We think that a fundamental part of cleaning up
the system is a substantial reduction in those fixed fee costs. I know
that that is not in the Bill, but it is an important part of the whole
system of reform. If you reduced these fixed fee costs, the problem of
referral fees—which we would also like to see banned—goes
away because it would not be worth people’s while to pay a large
sum of money to get an even larger sum in
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000373">&#160;</a>

I understood correctly. We have heard from the other panel members

claimants’ damages. I appreciate your point that clinical
negligence is not principally what you deal with, but the submission on

said:<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000374">&#160;</a>

                  </em> When our members are dealing with claims,
the fundamental issue is liability. In the great majority of claims,
liability is relatively straightforward to establish and quite a lot of
the issues then are about what actually has to be paid in terms of
compensation. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 147<a class="bkMark" name="Column147">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Our members are used to dealing with catastrophic claims; they deal with
them all the time. We have seen no evidence that has demonstrated that
this will affect people’s ability to take forward cases or that
lawyers will be any more reluctant to take forward cases. If someone
presented us with that sort of evidence we would be happy to look at
it, but there is no evidence as far as we can see.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000378">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">When it comes
to the lower-value claims, I would defy anyone not to know that they
can make claims because they are surrounded by people encouraging them
to do so all the time. We understand that people might have concerns
about access to justice, but we have seen no evidence that this will
make it more difficult. On the contrary, we think that we need a system
that is quicker, more efficient and cheaper, because we are all paying
our premiums, which fund these things. That would be to the benefit of
everyone. A great deal of people have before-the-event insurance
anyway, particularly for motor claims, which they can then use under
those circumstances.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000379">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Catherine
Hopkins:</strong>
                  </em> The key difference has been illustrated by
Mr Starling, when he said that liability is not a difficult thing. That
is quite the opposite in clinical negligence. If someone is run over on
the crossing outside, everyone here will be able to tell whether or not
that person was injured by a car and whether the car was being driven
negligently. That is not the case in medical negligence. Apart from a
pregnant woman who is going into hospital to deliver a baby, when
people go into hospital they have something wrong with them, so if they
come out still with something wrong with them the cause may not be
negligence; it could be something else. That means that a lot of work
has to be done on liability and causation. It is not straightforward
and cheap to investigate clinical negligence claims.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000380">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The other
thing that I would say is that practically no claims are worth less
than £10,000. If they are, they are not really brought. Under
legal aid requirements—the cost-benefit requirements—you
would not get a certificate for a client with such a low- value
claim—a claim for less than £10,000. Occasionally, there
are difficulties along the way and the damages are lower, but your
initial valuation must be much
greater.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000381">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
a sense, therefore, we are talking about different issues here. We are
talking about the biggest claims with the most complicated issues on
causation and liability— mostly causation—and currently
they are virtually all legally aided. It is such a glib thing to say,
“Oh, well, they can all be CFA’d.” You would be
asking firms such as Stewarts, which already do a large amount of
conditional fee agreements, suddenly to take a chunk of the biggest,
most complicated cases into their conditional fee agreement management
system. That will mean funding up to £100,000 worth of
disbursements. I know that there is a concession on the insurance, but
you are actually talking about firms carrying an overdraft for those
disbursements. We do not have a remit for lawyers, but we recognise
that lawyers have got to remain in business in order to provide access
to justice for our clients, who are former patients. We worry a lot
about this. Many of our members say they will not be able to afford to
take catastrophic injury cases on conditional fee agreements.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000382">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My phone rang

                  </div>particularly in the north. I think that the north will be more affected.
Muiris’s firm is a largeish firm and it has a Leeds office; it
is fairly unusual for the larger firms. There is one other. Those
people ring, saying, “Well, we do CFAs. We do CFAs for the
slightly lower-value cases. We do all our catastrophic injury clin neg
cases on legal aid and I don’t think my partners will accept
that extra burden on the firm of three or four years of building up
work in progress and being unable to bill it.”<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000383">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Access to
justice is going to be a significant problem. I talked earlier about if
the case runs and is successful, but I think that actually finding a
solicitor who can say to a young mother with a child with brain injury,
“Yes, I will take your case on from today, on a conditional fee
agreement”, will be like finding hen’s teeth in some
areas. Others will say, “Yes, if you can deposit £3,000
with me to cover the cost of the initial investigation, I will do
that—you might risk losing that money, but when I have got the
initial reports from, say, an obstetrician and a paediatrician,
minimum, I will tell you whether my firm will take it on under a
conditional fee agreement.” I think that is the
problem.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000384">&#160;</a>

severely brain damaged. If the case was to be taken on, lots of

there was a case or not. I think we were referring to some of the minor
cases in which you think there is not a problem. We have heard from
previous witnesses that CFAs would probably not be available, and you
have repeated that just now. Is there then likely to be a growth in
insurance policies? Would your members see a growth in people wanting
to take out an insurance policy against that, if they were going into

is not something I have thought about. I do agree that, to some extent,
we are talking about very different situations. As I said, our members
do deal with catastrophic injuries—they are not really the kind
of problems that we are trying to address by the Jackson reforms. By
definition, they have to be dealt with over a long period of time, they
cost a lot of money—the legal fees are much more proportionate
to the amount awarded—and that is a slightly separate issue for

big issue for our members is the huge amount of low-cost bodily injury
claims, for example the £2 billion-worth of whiplash claims, by
far the greatest in Europe. I do not know the extent to which there are
low-cost clinical claims, but we are all familiar with the
advertisements we see in hospitals inciting people to make them. Our
issues really are with the lower-value claims where the costs are,
quite simply, too high. People are encouraged to come forward—I
think the words of Lord Young were “incitement to
litigate”—and that leads to large numbers of exaggerated
and in some areas certainly fraudulent claims. That is where the
reforms will be instrumental in getting the costs and such claims down,
so that the genuine claims—coming back to my original
point—of people who have been injured or they are ill and it is
not their fault are dealt with quickly, so people get proper, speedy
and correct redress.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000387">&#160;</a>

whether the levels of damages are enough to do that. The Law Commission

Hopkins:</strong>
                  </em> Lawyers already do incur a liability in
terms of costs because if you take on a case on a conditional fee
agreement, you risk being paid nothing. There is already that. If you
take on a case on legal aid and you fail, the costs paid to a solicitor
under legal aid are considerably less than the inter partes costs, so
there is still a risk there, although it is smaller. There is probably
a much greater risk if a solicitor is a bad judge of risk and takes on
lots of cases on legal aid that all fail. Even if they fail at the
first hurdle, which is the initial investigation, they risk losing
their legal aid franchise, so it is not without risk
already.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000396">&#160;</a>

defendant. The defendant will go through the process of thinking,
“If I defend this, it’s going to cost me money just to
start the process.” Although you talk about some of the severe
clinical negligence cases, which are 5% of the total market of
litigation, 95% are not clinical negligence. We talk about personal
injuries and Mr Lyons’s examples of industrial disease, but all

which is a win bonus. One of your members, Mr Lyons, had a website that
described it as a win bonus for solicitors for winning a case. But the
defendant, who may have no liability in other cases, has to pay to
compensate that lawyer for having unsuccessful cases elsewhere. Do you
think that it is a fair principle for a defendant that he or she has to
compensate a lawyer for cases that are not linked to that defendant?
Why should they? What have they done wrong to have to pay for your
claims elsewhere that may be bogus, unsuccessful or claim farmed? I am
interested in your view about why we should continue the success
fee.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000399">&#160;</a>

to pay for bogus or fraudulent claims. They are paying those premiums
only in cases that they have lost and where they have insured somebody

It is the insurance premise of the many paying for the few. The idea
behind it is that the success fee on the winning cases allows firms
such as mine to take cases that are unsuccessful. When they were first
brought in, success fees were calculated to be revenue neutral. The
idea is that, across a basket of cases, lawyers do not make extra
money; they just make enough to cover the

is that it is all of us paying for the many, rather than just the many
paying for the few. I emphasise that we are not talking about the very
high-end difficult cases that Ms Hopkins has talked about. We have a
dysfunctional system, in which people play in dysfunctional ways. We
need a system that ensures that when liability is there, it can be
dealt with very quickly. If people play the system—if they take
unmeritorious cases forward or if defendants spin things
out—there should be ways of penalising them for doing so. We
need everything that encourages the system to work smoothly and
effectively and quickly. It is that dysfunctionality that Jackson
tackled and that we need to strip out of the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000404">&#160;</a>

culture is getting a bit out of hand. We talk about it being
dysfunctional, but surely insurance companies appear to be keen to
encourage their clients to seek damages. They inquire very kindly after
them and then check for accidents. I do not know whether that is a
policy to try to see off the no win, no win 
<div class="columnNumber">

                     <strong>Muiris
Lyons:</strong>
                  </em> First, the Government’s report by Lord
Young last year said that there was no compensation culture—that
is Lord Young saying that. Secondly, on the increase in claims, broadly
speaking, the number of claims in employer liability and public
liability is falling. It is only in road traffic accidents and,
recently, in clinical negligence, that claims are starting to go up.
Whether that is down to third party capture or assistance by
insurers—their payment of referral fees and so on—is an
entirely different matter. That issue is not part of the Bill, which I
think is about whether clients who have legitimate claims can get
access to justice, and whether it is fair for them to pay up to a
quarter of their damages in legal
costs.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000406">&#160;</a>

Starling:</strong>
                  </em> The question was put partly to me, so may I
answer that? There is a compensation culture. It may not be absolutely
widespread throughout the UK, but in parts of the UK, if I go into the
back of your car, you are three times more likely to make a personal
injury claim than in other parts. In some parts there is an expectation
that you can make a claim, and we need to sort that out. I do not
intend to do so, but if I were to run into the back of your car, your
car might be out of action—it might need repairs and you might
need a replacement vehicle. You might have an injury and it is really
important that you are helped quickly. That is what you should expect.
I am liable; you should be helped and you want people to come to you.
It may well be that my insurer will come to you direct and say,
“Can we sort you out?” That is what is called third party
assistance.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000407">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We are all
familiar with referral fees—they are a symptom of how the system
has gone wrong. Insurance companies pay referral fees, and the firm
that picks up your vehicle and the garage might pay them. Jack Straw
has alleged that the police and the NHS pay referral
fees—everyone is at it. It is not part of the Bill at the
moment, but it is vital to ban them. We also need to cut off the fuel
supply to them, which is the excessive cost to the
system.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000408">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
is some simple arithmetic. You can charge £1,200 for a simple
road traffic accident cost and you can pay £800 for the referral
fee to get that £1,200, so you make £400 for a relatively
straightforward claim. Let us get rid of the referral fee—the
£800—then we can reduce the costs. If they were
£400, everyone would be
happy.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000409">&#160;</a>

more telephone calls to solicitors saying, “I think that

that keep stats will say that they perhaps take on one in 10 cases.
That does not necessarily mean that they will succeed; they will take
them on to investigate. I was in private practice as a clinical
negligence solicitor for more than 10 years, and we would listen
politely to most calls and say, “Sorry, there isn’t a

You may say you are talking about your sector, but generally there is

constantly see an increasing number of personal injury claims. I come

                  </strong> Mr Starling, you have made some sweeping
statements. I wish to put some of them back to you, if you do not mind.
The big advertisers are the insurance companies. One insurer alone
spends more than £180 million on advertising, including things
like BTE insurance, which you would put as an alternative once you have
got rid of ATE insurance. You say that there is a compensation culture,
and that there are too many claims, many of which are fraudulent, but
almost 95% of people who claim are either making a first or a second
claim. You do not have a large incidence of serial claims. You also say
that insurers are not making profits. Some are. Admiral is a top 10
insurer that is making very healthy profits. I asked them why and they
said that it was because they manage their business and their claims
very well. Are you not possibly making excuses for inadequacies in your
own industry?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000427">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It seems to
me, and this is the main point that I should like to put to you, is
that you are saying that if you have a very straightforward claim where
liability is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 154<a class="bkMark" name="Column154">&#160;</a>
                  </div>clear, then you do not need a lawyer. The insurance company will make an
offer. We have been given examples where the initial offer made by an
insurance company is then beaten by it when the claimant gets a lawyer
six or sevenfold, which implies that the insurance companies are not
always being entirely even handed. You would not expect them to be.
What happens in those cases where someone is going to pay for
meritorious but marginal cases? Should it be the claimant out of their
damages if they succeed? Should it be the NHS which may have to pay for
their health care costs or the Department of Work and Pensions? Or
should it be the tortfeasor’s insurers at the end of the day?
What do you think is fair in social
terms?<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000428">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Nick
Starling:</strong>
                  </em> I think what is absolutely fair is that
insurers pay valid claims where there is a clear liability and someone
has been injured or made ill when it is not their own fault. I have
made that clear throughout. Our member companies compete fiercely. They
advertise. I have noticed that other companies in other sectors
advertise too. That is generally accepted as a way to win business.
Also, without commenting on the profitability or otherwise of some of
our members, in any realm of business, some are more successful than
others. That is just the way that business works. You say there are
lots of examples where lawyers have got a substantially larger
settlement. I can point to many examples where the original claim has
gone down substantially. We can all argue on the fringes about
particular cases. In a dysfunctional system people tend to behave in
dysfunctional ways. If we can sort out the system, if we can
streamline
it—<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000429">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Jackson did a package and he compensated
for that by increasing the general damages so that the whole thing
works properly. He accepted that there were changes and the way that
general damages increase—I do not believe that is in this
Bill—is important. The insurance industry has always said that
you need to take Jackson as a package. We have not tried to cherry-pick
the bits we like. It would have been very easy for us to have said,
“We like the cost shifting and so forth but we don’t like
the general increase in damages.” We need the whole package as a
whole to come in. Some of that is in the Bill and some of it is
outside.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000431">&#160;</a>

Lyons:</strong>
                  </em> May I make a quick interjection while
Catherine recovers her train of thought. The 10% increase in damages
was Sir Rupert’s suggestion to offset the losses that would be
incurred. It is based on a flawed piece of analysis which uplifted 10%
of all damages, not just the general damages. That is not what the
proposal is. The proposal is not in the Bill but the impact assessment
that is published with it makes the same mistake. Based on a set of
data from a defendant’s cost consultants, Jaggards, it uplifts
10% on all damages, not just general damages. That is not the proposal,
even though the proposal is not in the Bill and we are told it will
come elsewhere. It is also, in my view as a practitioner, an unworkable
proposal. The concern is that when you negotiate with defendants, you
ring up and you say, “This claim is worth £2,500.”
They say, “No, it is worth £2,000”. We say,
“Okay, we’ll do a deal of £2,250.” I then
say, “Can I have my 10% uplift on general damages?” They
will say, “You’ve got it already.” We are never
going to see the 10% uplift in practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1107154000436">&#160;</a>
