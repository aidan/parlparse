Mulholland</b> (Leeds, North-West) (LD): I beg to move
amendment No. 233, in
clause 35, page 17, line 38,  at
end insert&#151;</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(ba) to the
relevant professional regulatory
body&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are making reasonable progress, but I will try to be brief because we
are all keen to get as far as possible next week. Amendment No. 27
introduced an important point of principle, but amendment No. 233
raises an important point of practicality. I hope that the Minister
will not use the same arguments against the amendment, unless, of
course, he decides to accept it, because it is not about being
prescriptive&#151;an issue on which he has commented on various
occasions.</div>
					<a name="08011787000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is important in a practical way for two reasons. In
layman&#146;s terms&#151;an always useful method of explaining the
impact of a Bill&#151;one major effect would be a new, clearer
regulatory system for health and social care, with some redefined and
refocused responsibilities. Clearly, an important part of that is
professional regulatory bodies, most of which support the new and
refocused role that they will have. If we are to have a new, joined-up
framework, which makes sense for the reasons stated earlier, surely we
must include the professional regulatory bodies when a commission
issues a notice&#151;be that a notice of decisions or proposals, a
warning notice or a notice of procedure for suspension. I appreciate
the Minister&#146;s comments about not wanting to be prescriptive,
but professional regulatory bodies should be among the organisations
that must be informed of such notices if this is to be a genuinely
joined-up and effective system. We all know from other
areas&#151;from the Shipman case&#151;that when we do not have
properly joined-up systems and effective sharing of information, that
can lead to issues and problems.</div>
					<a name="08011787000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second reason concerns a
potential loophole that I would like the Minister&#146;s views on. Is
there not a danger that when an individual who has been issued with a
suspension notice moves to a different area, they could slip through
the net if the professional regulatory body with an important role in
that area is not
involved?</div>
					<a name="08011787000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011787000614"></a>
							<b class="B">Sandra
Gidley</b> (Romsey) (LD): I am reminded of a number of
practical examples, including one in my constituency whereby a nursing
home owner sacked a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column290" />Column number: 290</div>nurse because of abuse. He took the matter seriously, but we can
envisage a case in which an inspector might highlight problems of abuse
needing some sort of investigation. In the case to which I refer, the
nurse was allowed to enrol with various agencies and work in the next
county, and there was absolutely no way of tracking what she was doing.
She was later, quite rightly, removed from the professional
register.</div>

							<a name="08011787000616"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a useful point
demonstrating a potential practical example, which is what I am trying
to get across. I hope that the Minister understands that practical
point and the need for a properly joined-up framework. We would be
delighted if he accepted the amendment. One could say that it is
absolutely belt and braces, but given that there are still concerns
about the regulatory framework for health and for social care, as the
Minister has acknowledged, surely it would make sense to include the
professional regulatory organisations in this part of the Bill. I look
forward to the Minister&#146;s comments.</div>
					<a name="08011787000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011787000617"></a>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000618"></a>The
Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. Ben
Bradshaw):
						</b> The reason why we must resist the amendment is
not that it is prescriptive; rather, it is a question of degree. As
members of the Committee will have noticed, the commission is required
to give notice of action to any people whom it considers appropriate.
We would expect that in most circumstances, that would include the
relevant regulatory body, but we believe that it is better for that to
depend on the particular circumstances, rather than there being a
blanket requirement. For example, if a registered manager had received
a warning notice for a minor breach that had then been properly
corrected, the commission might consider it appropriate, or
disproportionate, to have to inform the manager&#146;s regulatory
body.</div>
					<a name="08011787000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000619"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point about a minor
breach about which it may not seem necessary to inform the regulatory
body. However, there are cases where a series of minor breaches might
flag up a problem, and surely the professional regulatory body is the
ideal place to collate that information. People do not know where to
complain when there is a problem. Shipman was a classic
example&#151;there were different areas in which concerns had been
raised. There needs to be some way of bringing that information
together in one place.</div>
					<a name="08011787000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000620"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I accept that, but I still think it best that
the Care Quality Commission be left to use its judgment. If there were
a succession of breaches, that would clearly ring alarm bells. If we
are talking about a relatively minor breach of a registration
requirement that had been quickly addressed, it seems unnecessary to
put the Care Quality Commission under an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column291" />Column number: 291</div>obligation. Indeed, there may be some people&#151;care home managers,
for example&#151;for whom there is no professional regulatory body.
Putting that requirement in the Bill is probably not the best way to
achieve the end that I think we all share: that the professional
regulatory bodies, where they exist, be informed when they need to
be.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000621"></a>Greg
Mulholland:
						</b> I appreciate that the Minister did at least
come back with different arguments in resisting the amendment. I have a
couple of brief points to make. Following those comments I am going to
withdraw the amendment, but this is an important issue, which the
Minister acknowledged. We should be mindful of this issue during the
Bill&#146;s passage and when the new regulatory framework comes into
force, and we may need to revisit it in future, with the input of the
Care Quality Commission and the professional regulatory bodies. It is
better to be safe than sorry, and that is a clear principle, even if
that means that minor incidents should be reported. My hon. Friend the
Member for Romsey made a valuable point: where there is a series of
minor incidents that might be missed, the amendment would increase the
clarity of the framework, which is essential to the Bill. It would also
provide a safeguard, which is why we tabled it. However, I appreciate
the fact that the Minister has listened, and I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the amendment.</div>

Browning</b> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con): I had not expected
to speak to this clause, but a case with which I have been dealing this
morning has prompted me to ask the Minister to consider a particular
set of
circumstances.</div>
					<a name="08011787000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
case&#151;perhaps I should have tabled an amendment as a result of
it&#151;involves a learning-disabled woman aged 65 who has been in
some form of care or residential care all her life, and who was in
residential care in my constituency when the care home closed because
of the owner&#146;s age. No one else would take the care home on, so
I negotiated with social services and they agreed to move the woman to
Hampshire, so that she could live nearer to her only remaining
relatives&#151;they did not take on caring for her, although they
obviously took an interest. Unfortunately, her carer died in her sleep
quite unexpectedly in November, and as an interim measure she went to
live with her brother and sister-in-law, who are older than her. Now
that she is living with them, the Devon authority paying for her care
says that that is where she should stay.</div>
					<a name="08011787000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously, I will fight this
case through the county council. Is there any way in which we can, in
the unfortunate and unexpected circumstance of the sudden death of a
named carer, ensure that such an event does not trigger a change to the
underlying entitlement to service that the service user had before?
Perhaps that is an unfortunate case and I will get a good resolution,
but I ask the Minister to consider the context of it. Clearly, Devon
county council now sees the death of the carer as an opportunity to
reduce its commitment to a lady whom it is paying for out of
area.</div>

how long a surrogate would have responsibility for registration, rather
than for it to be set in stone in
legislation.</div>

establishment of parliamentary legislative supremacy. In today&#146;s
world, it would be interesting to know the thoughts of the Lords
Constitution Committee on the clause. I do not know whether there has
been an opportunity for informal or even formal consultation within the
Government.</div>
					<a name="08011787000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
be helpful when considering the clause if the Minister could tell the
Committee what newly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column294" />Column number: 294</div>regulated activities he envisages and what changes they might bring to
the legislation, accepting that the clause is designed to catch the
unforeseen. As an addendum, can he tell the Committee about the
provenance of the list under subsection (3)? Given our discussions and
those of the Liberal Democrats about not wanting to include in the past
certain lists to give priority of identification, such a proposal
suddenly seems to veer towards the Minister&#146;s prescriptiveness.
I question that as a matter of both consistency and precedent. Will he
explain the provenance of the list as it might help us to understand
why he has chosen that list, but not the list that we
proposed?</div>

							<a name="08011787000633"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> Clause 39, as the hon. Gentleman has
acknowledged, is intended to provide future flexibility so that the
system can adapt to changes in the way in which health and social care
are delivered. The delivery is becoming more integrated. It is
responding to people&#146;s needs, and it is changing as a result of
innovation. It is possible that initially primary care will not come
within its remit but, as more elective surgery is being delivered in
the primary care setting, that change would require the flexibility
that we are
discussing.</div>
					<a name="08011787000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is also important to recognise that the power to modify the Bill after
it is enacted does not apply to the registration of NHS bodies and
other providers registered with the new commission from the outset as
listed under clause 39(3). We have already made it clear that NHS
hospital services would be regulated. Respondents to our consultation
put forward convincing arguments for the inclusion of, for example, NHS
primary care providers within the regulatory framework. The reason
behind the provision is to provide the flexibility that we discussed
the day before yesterday in relation to some cosmetic procedures. I do
not want to rein in the future flexibility that might be
needed.</div>
					<a name="08011787000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="08011787000634"></a>
							<b class="B">Anne
Milton</b> (Guildford) (Con): I appreciate that health care is
changing rapidly and that we need flexibility to reflect the results of
the changes. I received information from the Patients Association that
the chief medical officer has commissioned a report from Joint
Commission International, which will be looking at how we accredit and
regulate health care organisations. It has suggested that such matters
are changing even as the ink is not dry on the
Bill.</div>

						</b> As the Minister was going through it, I was
hoping for some reassurance about how we had arrived at the list in
subsection (3). It occurs to me that something that we have already
touched on in earlier Committee proceedings is not included in the
list. For instance, for a housing association that produces many homes
with Telecare that are not known as care homes, but are known as
normal, independent homes that happen to have a lot of Telecare
facilities, it would be quite difficult to make that fit into that
prescriptive list. I think that it is a fair question, and I am hoping
to get an answer.</div>

					<a name="08011787000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a simple amendment. As the clause stands, the Secretary of State is
mentioned only in the context of the NHS. We received a lot of oral and
written evidence about concerns that the social care function would be
lost. It is quite pertinent here to reflect on the words of Sir Ian
Kennedy during our first sitting. He
said:</div>
					<a name="08011787000539"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it is my position
that ultimately, bringing together health care and social care
regulations is desirable because the citizenry do not know, and care
less, under what system they are being looked after&#151;they want it
to be seamlessly well-organised.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official
Report, Health and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January
2008; c. 6.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are all aware of
areas where the system perhaps comes apart at the seams, for want of a
better phrase. I use as an example the case of continuing care. I
suspect that every hon. Member in this Room has played a part in trying
to secure continuing care funding for a patient. Often, they have
Alzheimer&#146;s and have significant health needs, but ultimately, a
decision is made by a person or persons unknown that their need is not
a health need, but a social care need, so they do not receive NHS
funding.</div>
					<a name="08011787000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">In most
cases, it is difficult to see where the division lies. I have had two
very similar cases; one could hardly see a difference in the
capabilities and illness levels of my two constituents. One received
the funding, but the other did not. It was down to the different
assessments on the day. Although the Government have made some attempts
to improve that, I still think that there is a problem. In the case
where the continuing funding was made available, the care was given in
a nursing home, which is not part of the NHS. Although the constituent
was NHS funded and she was receiving some NHS care from nurses, a lot
of the care was also being received from other workers in the home. It
seems rather perverse that the Secretary of State could make decisions
on part of that care, but not that other part. We ought to be aiming
for the seamless care that was described by Sir Ian Kennedy. Others
echoed his sentiments: Denise Platt said that she wanted a strong
social care focus to be retained. The amendment serves two purposes: to
try to have that seamless aspect, and to make it absolutely clear that
the focus on social care is retained in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011787000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000639"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> It seems a sensible proposal. It is difficult to
understand why the Government are confining themselves to quality
standards in NHS care and not beyond. Under the current system in which
Ministers have day-to-day control of the NHS, one would have thought
they would be doing this anyway 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column296" />Column number: 296</div>and that the role would be distinct from that of the regulator. We must
question what the underlying reason is for the power here. That is the
argument.</div>
					<a name="08011787000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000640"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> First, I agree that improving quality in adult
social care is every bit as important as improving it in the NHS, but
there are other mechanisms and methods already in place to do that.
Local authorities have their own local and national reporting and
accountability arrangements, and the Minister for Communities and Local
Government has powers to issue standards under the Local Government Act
2003. The Government are committed to a single performance framework
for local authorities across all their functions, rather than having a
duplication, which we think would be the impact of the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="08011787000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the issue
of independent health care providers, where a PCT uses private sector
providers to provide NHS health care, of course the standards set under
the clause will apply to those providers. As we have previously
discussed, the registration requirements will ensure that all private
and independent sector providers provide services at a particular
level. The hon. Lady&#146;s amendment asks for the Government to
intervene as a performance manager in private transactions between
entirely fee-paying clients or patients. In terms of pushing up
standards, we do not believe that it is the Government&#146;s role to
intervene on matters of purely private health care. We believe that
improvements in the commercial sector should be driven by the suppliers
themselves as they strive to improve and attract more fee-paying
patients. In a way it goes back to the argument we had two days ago
about cosmetics&#151;we must decide on the proper boundary of the
role of the state.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000641"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I find the Minister&#146;s arguments hard to
follow. In the same nursing home there could be residents who are
purely NHS funded, those who receive funding via the local council and
some who are using their own funds for the time being, as they have the
money available. Is the Minister saying that we should apply standards
to one set and ignore the others? It seems to be a mixed
message.</div>
					<a name="08011787000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000642"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> My point is that the hon. Lady asks us to push
the principle of performance management beyond what is generally
considered to be the role of performance management in the private
sector vis-Ã -vis the funded sector. However, in the situations
that she has described, those institutions will fall under the
registration requirement that will set minimum standards. She asks us
to performance manage the care delivered under a purely private
contractual arrangement between provider and client, and we do not feel
that that would be a desirable thing to do.</div>

arguments. There may be a better way of phrasing the measure so that it
encompasses what we wish to achieve. We may wish to revisit the matter,

my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has consistently
confirmed our party&#146;s commitment to the NHS, that it should be

whether to support the amendment, the Minister should be aware that, as

Committee, with the report eight days later in the
&#147;Society&#148; section of <i class="I">The Guardian</i> that the
Secretary of State did not want a constitution to give lots of work to

in legislation.</div>
					<a name="08011787000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
important amendment provides an opportunity, which I hope will be
consensual, to enshrine this core principle. We have offered this and

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000645"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The reason why we have trouble with the
amendment is that we do not think it sensible or desirable to restrict
the scope of the standards to the NHS core principles. Those core
principles have existed since 2000, so we do not think that there is a
need to legislate to introduce them. We have strengthened the force of
the principles by incorporating them into the standard NHS contracts
between primary care trusts and secondary care service providers, which
were introduced in 2007. Those contracts required all sides to have
regard to the NHS principles, and that is a more appropriate way of
confirming the commitment of NHS bodies to the principles than
enshrining them 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column298" />Column number: 298</div>in legislation, as they are by definition general principles of
behaviour that can be applied in practice in a variety of
ways.</div>
					<a name="08011787000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because we want
to put more power in the hands of front-line staff to get on with the
job and let local circumstances help them with the application of those
values, we believe that they will apply the core principles sensibly
and flexibly. It would not be sensible for us to predict what effect
the legal application would have on local practice, which is why we are
inclined to resist the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000646"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The Minister just said that he does not think
that the core principles should be enshrined in legislation. It is
helpful to repeat what the Prime Minister said in his widely reported
personal new year message to the NHS on 1 January, which can be read by
all at www.dh.gov.uk&#151;I even have details of how to find the
particular sentence. He said
that</div>
					<a name="08011787000541"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we will also
examine how all these changes can be enshrined in the new constitution
of the NHS setting out for the first time the rights and
responsibilities associated with an entitlement to NHS
care.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is not to
enshrine the core principles in legislation, one has to ask, what is? I
am conscious that I am not going to make progress with the
Minister&#151;he has obviously decided what his position
is.</div>
					<a name="08011787000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
everybody is clear about our position on this: that it is appropriate
to seek to enshrine the NHS core principles in legislation. Most
unusually, we shall find an opportunity this Session for our NHS
(Autonomy and Accountability) Bill to be considered by the House. That
would be a better, more consistent and principled vehicle to use,
rather than pursuing an ad hoc approach in Committee with the Minister.
I hope that the Government will support our Bill, because otherwise, we
shall be the only ones offering the enshrining of the core principles
in legislation, notwithstanding the Prime Minister&#146;s
well-reported remarks of 1 January. As we shall have plenty of chances
to revisit the issue, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> The amendments seek once again to limit the scope
of the commission to reviews of quality and value for money, rather
than economic viability. The debate will be akin to some degree to that
on amendment No. 6 to clause 2, at column 175 of the <i class="I">Official
Report.</i> I am sure that members of the Committee will recall that I
talked about economic 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column299" />Column number: 299</div>regulation covering all aspects of the operation of the social market.
The economic regulator would need to possess substantial powers to
intervene in order to determine service reconfiguration and the
management of NHS trusts, and to determine how service requirements
must be met.</div>
					<a name="08011787000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
a quality inspectorate needs to report openly and frankly on the
quality of the services provided. There could be tension between the
two activities. We hope not, but I dare say that we can all envisage
circumstances where the need to drive efficiency from an economic point
of view might conflict with the need to warn about the potential of
declining standards of care from a quality
perspective.</div>
					<a name="08011787000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we
discussed the matter before, I must say in fairness to myself that the
Minister misrepresented the position. I am putting forward the
desire&#151;a party position&#151;not to extend massively the
powers of Monitor, which suggests a net increase in regulation, but to
transfer the economic regulation role of the CQC to Monitor. As the
Minister knows, we were unable to take oral evidence from Monitor. We
had hoped to do so, but that was not possible due to compromises made
on the programming.</div>
					<a name="08011787000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the foundation trust sector, which is relevant to the work of Monitor,
quality and economic regulation are already divided along those lines
and to those bodies. Our position aligns with our desire to see all
trusts achieve foundation status. I should be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s explanation of his contention that our establishment
of an NHS board poses a potential massive conflict of interest. That
would happen only if politicians continue to want to run the NHS,
rather than to provide the means by which it can be run with clinical
priorities as the first order of concern. I hope that the Minister has
had time to reflect on matters and sees the merit in our
proposals.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000650"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman said that he wanted to retain
the role for the review of value-for-money elements, but that would be
excluded under the amendment. It would restrict the scope of Care
Quality Commission reviews simply to the quality of provision. I
understand his desire to extend the remit of Monitor, but I would not
be in favour of restricting the reviews of the commission in that way,
and nor would the commission, I believe, given what we heard during our
evidence session.</div>
					<a name="08011787000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, the reviews will look at the quality of provision. Subsection
(4) sets out that assessments will be conducted
by</div>
					<a name="08011787000542"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reference to such
indicators of
quality&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">set out by the
Secretary of State, or delegated to the commission to determine. The
reviews will need to look at more than the quality of services. For
example, when assessing local services we want greater emphasis to be
put on how well they are working together to achieve overall outcomes,
and to see whether they reflect the needs of their local populations.
We will talk later about commissioning, but the reviews may consider
the commissioning record of a primary care trust and how well it is
meeting the needs of local people. Those issues seem to go beyond the
strict definition of quality in the amendment, which is the main reason
why we wish to resist it. We will discuss the role of Monitor at
greater 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column300" />Column number: 300</div>length later, but I point out to the hon. Gentleman that Monitor covers

status&#151;that is our stated aim, and by the very nature of what is

Gidley:
						</b> The amendment is a simple one and was tabled after
listening to the oral evidence. I was struck by the powerful arguments
made by Anna Walker when she was asked what the powers of the new Care
Quality Commission should be. She expressed concern that the Bill, as
drafted, focuses too much on the regulation of providers, whereas the
provision of health care is about what care is purchased or
commissioned on behalf of the user, as well as the provider. I do not
usually read out large quotes, but it is worth reminding the Committee
of what she went on to
say:</div>
					<a name="08011787000543"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that is of course
also true for social care. We have concerns about two particular areas.
The Bill, as drafted, gives the new regulator the power to carry out
wider reviews. That is welcome, because it is under that power that we
have looked at learning disabilities, mental health and dignity in care
for older people in hospital, so it is a very important power to us.
The difficulty is that it is limited to providers only. What we find in
health care&#151;I must leave it to others to talk about social
care&#151;is that you can say to a provider, &#145;Look, that
service simply isn&#146;t good enough&#146;, to which their answer
can often be, &#145;But we are not being paid to provide any more
than that.&#146;</div>
					<a name="08011787000544"></a><div class="hs_brev">In
order to get the issue right, on behalf of the user and the patient,
you have to look at a mixture of commissioning and provision; what the
primary care trusts are doing, as well as what the provider is doing.
We would like to see that power for the wider review cover
commissioning as well as provision.&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[Official Report,

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column301" />Column number: 301</div>
					<a name="08011787000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to pre-empt the
Minister&#146;s comments, but I fully accept that practice-based
commissioning is fairly new. It does not work terribly well in some
parts of the country and I am told that is being replaced by something
called world-class commissioning, for which we wait with bated breath.
There are problems with some of the probity of commissioning.
Sometimes, the commissioners are in effect consulting GPs who
commission services from themselves&#151;there are not enough Chinese
walls in place.</div>
					<a name="08011787000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment tries to pull back the focus, so that it is not simply some
cosy little group deciding what services are commissioned from where. I
am not saying that all groups are like that, but I dare say that the
odd one is. The amendment would provide an extra provision, so that the
commission could come in and say, &#147;You are doing it wrong. You
are not providing service of the best quality and the problem has
arisen because of the
commissioning&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment may not be perfectly drafted, but the general principle is
important. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that he is at least
rethinking the
matter.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> We have tabled amendments Nos. 261 and 263. The
hon. Lady was honest enough to say that perhaps her amendment is not
perfect in all respects. Amendment No. 261 provides an alternative
opportunity, as it seems to achieve much the same thing. Amendment No.
263 would enable special reviews of commissioning practice, for
example.</div>
					<a name="08011787000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is
important here is the point that Anna Walker made to the hon. Member
for Leeds, North-West during the oral evidence: in order to get the
issue right, the mixture of commissioning and provision has to be
looked at, as does what the PCTs and the providers are doing. That
power for the wider review should cover commissioning as well as
provision. The Committee might also want to read &#147;local
authorities&#148; with &#147;PCTs&#148; and even go as far as
including &#147;individual private purchasers of social care&#148;.
If we end up finding that, unusually, the Minister is not able to
accept our amendments perhaps he would like to add that to his
&#147;Reflect&#148; box for what I hope will be a monumental
improvement by the time we reach Report.</div>
					<a name="08011787000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will give an example. The
Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual health check for 2008-09 will
assess PCTs on the quality of their commissioning. We need to ask
seriously whether that will continue under the new CQC. I also alert
the Committee to a report on 2 August last year in the <i class="I">Financial
Times</i>, which stated
that</div>
					<a name="08011787000545"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a battle had broken
out&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">between David
Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, who sees the PCTs as part of his
management empire, and Anna Walker, who said that there must
be</div>
					<a name="08011787000546"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a mechanism for
holding people publicly
accountable&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">for the
quality of purchasing. The report went as far as to say that one
Department of Health official shared that view while others opposed it.
I shall not endeavour  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column302" />Column number: 302</div>to catch the eye of any of the cast of officials that the Minister has
with him today. Under Anna Walker&#146;s system, it would remain the
job of the strategic health authorities to performance manage the
primary care trusts, but there is a need for an independent assessment
of their performance.</div>
					<a name="08011787000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The NHS Confederation has also
backed the idea of independent assessment, saying that it was
needed</div>
					<a name="08011787000547"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;for reasons of
public
accountability&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000656"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss
this issue, not least to put on the record that we are completely
committed. The hon. Member for Romsey asked me to rethink, but I do not
think I need to&#151;I am in the same place as she is and I agreed
with everything that she said. We are completely committed to the
independent performance assessment of PCT commissioning and we believe
that that should be a role for the Care Quality Commission. That is
provided for in the Bill, and I will explain why in a minute. It is
entirely right for that to be the case given that 80 per cent. of
taxpayers&#146; money is now spent on the health service through
primary care trusts, which are the main commissioners.</div>
					<a name="08011787000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was widespread support
for that during our consultation on the proposals in the Bill. That is
why clause 42 requires the Care Quality Commission to review PCT
commissioning, as well as the health care that they provide. Subsection
(1) requires the commission to conduct overall reviews of the health
provided in each PCT area, whether provided by the PCT itself or by
other people under arrangements made by the PCT. Those reviews will
assess how well PCTs are meeting the needs of their local populations.
PCT provision will also be reviewed in its own right under subsection
(2).</div>
					<a name="08011787000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 44 covers
commissioning by local authorities and primary care trusts, and how
that impacts on the services people receive and the health of the local
population. The commission is able to investigate specific incidents,
or series of incidents that put the health, safety or welfare of people
at risk. That would include looking into the decisions that have led to
that situation arising, such as the commissioning.</div>
					<a name="08011787000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that reassurance, and the
positive discussions that I have had with Anna Walker about the issue
over many months, I hope that the hon. Lady will be reassured enough to
withdraw her amendment.</div>

						</b> I am not entirely convinced that Anna Walker was
reassured, judging by her comments during the evidence-taking session.
I fully accept that clause 44 allows for special reviews and
investigations and I can see that that is covered. However, it would be
useful to amend the wording to clarify that that is a key part of the
role. At this moment it is best to reflect on the Minister&#146;s
comments and perhaps go back to the Healthcare Commission to see
whether it is as reassured as he claims. I beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
amendment.</div>

							<a name="08011787000660"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Let us see whether we can get this amendment away
from the &#147;Reflect&#148; box. The amendments would give the CQC
the power to inspect PCTs&#146; plans for improving health, with the
intended consequence that they would take such plans seriously. It is
not a draconian or over-prescriptive measure, but I suspect that the
power to inspect is in itself a potentially powerful tool. PCTs already
have powers to publish an annual health improvement and modernisation
plan&#151;HIMP. Those were originally under section 28 of the Health
Act 1999 and are now under section 24 of the National Health Service
Act 2006, which sets the framework for the local commissioning and
contracting of services.</div>
					<a name="08011787000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have already outlined what we
have argued are the significant failings of the Government on public
health. The force of these plans, therefore, will be to seek to combat
widening health inequalities and poor public health at a local level. I
will not repeat the arguments that we had in relation to other clauses,
but that is what lies behind our concern and why this would be a
pragmatic, cost-efficient measure to include. I hope that the
Government find that it commends itself, because we would require all
PCTs to produce such plans and require each PCT&#146;s coterminous
local authority to be consulted on their development. Of course,
overlapping authorities would therefore have to be on a
multi-consultation process.</div>
					<a name="08011787000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those cases where agreement
between local authorities and PCTs cannot be reached, disputes would be
resolved in the first instance by the relevant strategic health
authority, with a right of appeal to the NHS board. If the HIMP
involves a major service reconfiguration, the independent
reconfiguration panel would be consulted as necessary. I want to ensure
that the Minister realises that this is a genuinely thought-through,
sensible proposal that is not particularly sizeable but is significant.
I genuinely hope that he will find himself persuaded by the
arguments.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000661"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As we have already emphasised, the
commission&#146;s reviews will cover the whole range of functions
carried out by bodies in relation to health care and adult social care,
including public health and community services. Where we differ from
the hon. Gentleman is that while we believe that the local plans will
look at what PCTs and local authorities plan to do, the role of the
commission will be to focus on the outcomes for the people who use
those services. He referred, rightly, to the differentiation between
the role 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column304" />Column number: 304</div>of performance management by the strategic health authorities, and
regulating. I suggest that the amendment, which would require the
commission to review the plans, strays a little further on to the
performance management role than we think is a good idea. I am afraid
to disappoint him, but I will resist the amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000662"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I am not sure that I can take much more
rejection. I am tempted to dwell on the point, which is probably my
best lever. If I cannot persuade the Minister, I cannot. He spoke about
reviewing and having too much of a hands-on approach, but this power
was drafted as &#147;inspect&#148;. I accept that if someone
inspects they are likely to have a view as to whether that amounts to a
review, but I do not want to split hairs on that. However, the power of
inspection was more to have something that would urge people to ensure
that they got it done in a timely fashion.</div>
					<a name="08011787000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was initially sceptical when
the Government suggested&#151;it is a direct parallel and involved an
area like mine, which I suspect is not dissimilar to parts of
the Minister&#146;s constituency&#151;that it would be appropriate
for parishes to bring in parish plans. I saw that as yet another piece
of written bureaucracy that is going to tie people up. Instead, it has
served to bring focus and energy into local communities to decide what
they want collectively to make their priorities. In many
cases&#151;not all&#151;it has served to be a good, rather than a
burden. I wanted to inform what is going on here through that process.
The fact that one has the right to come in and inspect, whether or not
an inspection has been made, encourages that to happen without being
over-prescriptive.</div>
					<a name="08011787000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I say, I do not think that I have been able to persuade the Minister,

					<a name="08011787000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 93 and 32 are slightly more toned-down versions of the Liberal
Democrat amendment. It appears that the Local Government Association
has sought to brief both the official Opposition and the Liberal
Democrats. We want to ensure that the amendments, which have arisen
from the LGA, deal with the regulatory burden on local authorities and
whether that would be disproportionate, given the various angles from
which they are regulated. As an example of the stringent approach that
we have taken to our amendments, we returned some of those that were
proposed because we felt that they were constraining the CQC in a
blanket way, which could be potentially obtuse. However, on the
amendments that we have been urged to consider tabling through the
various representations made to us, we have said that the CQC should
have a statutory responsibility to have regard to the national
indicator set when setting its regulations, and that Parliament should
have the power to monitor the regulations if they become
over-burdensome.</div>
					<a name="08011787000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
record in the House as being completely, utterly and unashamedly
opposed to over-burdensome regulation&#151;not least when I had a
different portfolio in the shadow team&#151;will commend the fact
that the amendment has been not only put forward with some genuine
concern and vigour, but is supported by the three pamphlets that I
published on the subject. Not many people can wear such a large anorak
in getting that excited about regulations. I urge the Minister to
consider the amendment as a sensible way to deal with the potential for
over-burdensome
regulations.</div>
					<a name="08011787000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 32 would ensure that the versions of the method statement drafted
under subsection (6)(a) are available to the public in order to deliver
clarity when and if the Secretary of State, who must approve the
statement under subsection (6)(b), alters the method of statement, and
that the public can be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column306" />Column number: 306</div>made aware of those alterations. As the Minister is so far unwilling to
remove the somewhat unfettered power that a given Secretary of State
may have over the CQC, we think it important to establish some clear
accountability regarding the influence wielded by the Secretary of
State.</div>
					<a name="08011787000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the
Minister can give us some guarantees about the CQC&#146;s not
imposing regulatory burdens above and beyond the national indicator
set. What discussions has he had with the Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government on that issue, and if he has not
discussed it, when will he do so? Will the draft method statements be
available to the public, and why does the CQC have to report to the
Minister in such a way?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000669"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I think that the hon. Member for Romsey said
that amendment No. 32 proposes that the commission should
publish the drafts of its methodology before submitting them to the
Secretary of State, while not seeking to change the requirement of the
Secretary of State to approve that methodology. I can only assume that
she is trying to ensure that a future Secretary of State does not have
undue influence over the final version of that methodology. At least
the hon. Lady accepts that the Secretary of State has a valid interest
in ensuring that the methodology represents a good measure of overall
performance, and a consistency of approach across the whole regulatory
framework.</div>
					<a name="08011787000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not
aware of any difficulties with the system as it has been operating
until now, and as far as I am aware there have been no suggestions by
the current commissioner that the existing system has been a barrier to
independence. Instead, it has been found quite useful that decisions on
the methodology between Secretary of State and commissioners have been
agreed through thorough discussion and agreement. I do not think that
the amendment is
necessary.</div>
					<a name="08011787000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 93 would require the Secretary of State to have regard to the
national indicator set when devising or approving indicators of quality
to be used to assess the performance of local authorities. It would
also require draft regulations to be laid before Parliament if further
indicators were introduced in addition to those in the national
indicator set. The suggestion is that that would place an additional
regulatory burden on local authorities, and I assume that the intention
is that the draft regulations would contain the indicators that pose an
additional burden to allow Parliament the opportunity to consider
them.</div>
					<a name="08011787000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
137 goes even further and would remove subsections (4) to (8) of clause
42. In their place, it proposes that the Secretary of State should not
set any indicators of quality that are outside the national indicator
set. The problem is that that would leave the Secretary of State with
no power to devise indicators to be used by NHS bodies or local
authorities, or to delegate that function to the Care Quality
Commission. Nor would the amended clause say what indicators the
commission should use in conducting reviews of NHS bodies or local
authorities.</div>
					<a name="08011787000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would also remove the requirement for the commission to
prepare the method that it proposes to use to assess and evaluate a
body&#146;s performance. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column307" />Column number: 307</div>would therefore remove the requirement for the commission to publish the
indicators and the methodology. That would mean that none of the bodies
being reviewed under the clause would have any information on what the
commission would be assessing them against. We do not think that that

						</b> I have a great deal of sympathy with the desire
to see a proportionate regulatory system&#151;that came out very
clearly in the evidence session. The problem with the amendment is that
it would oblige the commission to publish an impact assessment
to demonstrate that when it sets the frequency of reviews, they will
result in a reduction in regulatory burdens. We agree with that
sentiment. That is why clause 2 obliges the commission to have regard
at all times to the five principles of good inspection practice:
transparency, accountability, consistency, proportionality to risk and
targeting where it is most needed. That is also why the
commission is required to produce inspection programmes under schedule
4.</div>
					<a name="08011787000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that we
need to allow the commission the flexibility to vary the frequency of
reviews, and for those reviews to not simply be reduced. That would be
the impact of the amendment. There has been the example over the last
few years of health care associated infections. Most of us would regard
as 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column308" />Column number: 308</div>desirable an increase in the regularity of reviews on particular issues.
While I sympathise very strongly with the motivations and
sentiments behind the amendment, we believe that the commission should
be free to respond to rapidly changing circumstances, while at the same
time reducing the overall burden of regulation on providers, as we will
discuss later in considering the commission&#146;s gate-keeping

Gidley:
						</b> Amendment No. 196 was tabled by the Liberal
Democrats and amendment No. 262 by the Conservatives. They have more or
less the same aim. The clause provides for the review and investigation
of adult social services across the board, whereas the powers on health
care are restricted to the NHS. In its submission to us, the Healthcare
Commission pointed out that</div>
					<a name="08011787000548"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there is no evidence that the
risk of service failure that would warrant investigation is higher or
lower in NHS or private
care&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It also
said:</div>
					<a name="08011787000549"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In our
experience, wholly private services may require review just as publicly
funded ones may (for example, cosmetic surgery). In many services
provided by the independent sector it is not possible to separate out
elements of performance which relate to publicly funded patients and
those elements which relate to those privately funded (for example,
many independent mental health hospitals have both publicly funded and
privately funded
patients).&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was also prompted to table the amendment because of a local case.
Someone went into the local BUPA hospital and, sadly, died. It was
clear from the evidence that there was insufficient medical cover and
that certain complaints were not taken seriously at the time. If they
had been investigated, that gentleman might be alive today. I struggle
to see how that case would be covered, because the health care was
privately purchased. Clearly, that case raises questions about the
general provision of care in that hospital.</div>
					<a name="08011787000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the past&#151;not so much
today, but when I was first elected in 2000&#151;local private sector
hospitals undertook a great deal of work on behalf of the NHS. It would
seem invidious to inspect a hospital and reach a conclusion on it
solely on the basis of its NHS provision. I think that most members of
the public undergoing invasive surgery would automatically assume that
private sector hospitals are subject to an 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column309" />Column number: 309</div>appropriate inspection regime, and my amendment is an attempt to capture
all health and adult social care providers and to ensure that nothing
falls through the
gap.</div>
					<a name="08011787000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000677"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The hon. Lady&#146;s amendment seeks to bring
all providers and commissioners of health and adult social care within
the reach of the CQC&#146;s special review process. It is a sensible
amendment. She knows that I am not given to over-praising anything that
comes from the Liberal Democrats, but I must say that it
contains much neater drafting than the Government&#146;s drafting. I
commend it.</div>
					<a name="08011787000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 262 prompts us to ask why the Bill says &#147;NHS&#148; rather
than &#147;health&#148;. The hon. Lady touched on that and gave
examples to reinforce that point. This is the clause about which Dame
Denise Platt of CSCI said the following in the oral evidence
session:</div>
					<a name="08011787000550"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
are also very concerned that some of our functions are dilute and
become permissive in the new
commission.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and
Social Care Public Bill Committee,</i> 8 January 2008; c. 7,
Q7.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much has been said about
the fact that permissive, rather than statutory, functions will have
less chance of being enacted in a tight funding settlement. That is a
problem when the functions that are being made permissive are seen by
both the regulator and third-party groups as being the most
important.</div>
					<a name="08011787000582"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="08011787000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">To save time in
the stand part debate, let me address a related issue that I can better
deal with now. I hope that the Minister will feel able to give some
assurance on a question that has arisen. He might wish to say when the
new commission could commence such reviews and, more importantly,
whether he expects a hiatus in the researching and publishing of such
reviews between the winding up of the current regulators and the full
functioning of the CQC.</div>
					<a name="08011787000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">In her oral evidence, Dame
Denise Platt
said:</div>
					<a name="08011787000551"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is
not clear to us why the function cannot be transferred from the start,
and why it is going to be put into abeyance for a year&#151;perhaps
longer.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social
Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c. 7,
Q7.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, there are serious
implications. The Minister should note that within the first year of
its operation, CSCI carried out three major reports, while dealing with
its own establishment and reviewing the way in which it carried out its
nascent regulatory functions.</div>
					<a name="08011787000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question is of interest not
only regarding the quality of provision and safety; I am sure that the
political angle will not have escaped the Committee. Any hiatus would
prevent reports from being carried out before a rather magical
date&#151;the summer of 2010, well after what is gearing up to be
something of a rocky election for the Labour party. I hope that the
Minister can give an assurance that there will be absolutely no delay,
no hiatus and total continuity; otherwise, such a postponement might be
interpreted as having a political angle, rather than a functional one.
I hope that the Minister will also address the other point that has
arisen.</div>
				
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 310</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000678"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As we have already heard, clause 44 covers
commissioning by local authorities and primary care trusts and how it
impacts upon the services that people receive and the health of the
local population; it also provides for scrutiny of the way in which
strategic health authorities contribute to those operational issues.
The amendments would preclude that last discretion.</div>
					<a name="08011787000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 90 defines the terms
used in clause 44 and elsewhere in the Bill, and makes it clear that
NHS care includes all health care provided by primary care trusts or
other people providing health care under arrangements made by primary
care trusts. At the moment, as we know, independent sector providers
are included in reviews and investigations into adult social care when
offering services under agreements reached with local authorities, but
not otherwise. Independent health care providers can be covered by
special reviews and investigations when they are offering services
directly on behalf of the NHS.</div>
					<a name="08011787000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">That takes us back to
discussions that have been a common theme through this
period&#151;how far the new Care Quality Commission should involve
itself in purely private transactions between individuals and
businesses. Special reviews and investigations are intended to provide
the commission with the power to consider issues that might undermine
public confidence in publicly funded or commissioned services, and to
encourage improvement in such services. In those circumstances, we
think it right that the scope of the commission&#146;s reviews and
investigations under clause 44 should extend to people who provide
services under arrangements made by a PCT or a local authority. That
will apply whether they are statutory or independent.</div>
					<a name="08011787000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission will of course
monitor and inspect anybody providing regulated activities as defined
under clause 4, to ensure that they meet the necessary requirements.
The process will be the same whether they are statutory or independent
sector bodies. The commission will be able to investigate the failings
of a specific provider and take enforcement action as
appropriate.</div>
					<a name="08011787000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think
that we will be talking about the transition a little later, but I hope
not at great length or repetitively. The new Care Quality Commission
will be able to conduct urgent reviews on issues that it thinks are a
matter of safety or quality in the initial 12 months phase. However,
given the substantial registration process that will need to be
established within that first year, we believe that there should be a
transition period during which it does not conduct the special reviews.
We should all note the warm welcome that Anna Walker gave to its
continued freedom to conduct whatever reviews it wants. However, until
the registration process settles down&#151;it is most important to
the new regulatory regime&#151;the reviews that it carries out should
concentrate on safety and quality. That is obviously a sensible
approach.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000679"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I am slightly confused as to why the Minister
appears to think that there are powers to deal with the situations that
I described earlier, whereas the Healthcare Commission thought that
there could be gaps in what it could regulate. I am not entirely
convinced that the example that I quoted would be fully captured by the
proposal. If there is a problem in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 311</div>a private hospital, I suspect that the bar would have to be raised
considerably higher before anyone thought to investigate or review it
in a special way.</div>
					<a name="08011787000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
say that because the Minister stressed that it is not the
Government&#146;s business to consider private arrangements, so, more
or less of necessity, the new commission would focus its efforts almost
entirely on NHS provision. Some would say that that is perfectly
understandable. However, there is a wider public interest issue on
which we need absolute clarity. I should therefore be grateful if the
Minister described what powers will be available and said how the
situation that I described could be dealt with if it seemed that there
was a trend&#151;&#151;that perhaps one or two complaints had been
received. With that proviso, I will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

commission not been part of the new registration process, given the

that will be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 312</div>made, any advance warning that it is going to do so. I am sure that that
is not what the hon. Gentleman intends. It is perfectly reasonable that

any findings.</div>
					<a name="08011787000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
warmly welcomed all the reports made by the commission over the last
two years; they have been extremely helpful and very good. However, it
is not reasonable for the new regulator to be able to give any advance

practice in relations between organisations and their regulators on
this point, and it would not be fair on those other organisations to
accept these amendments as
drafted.</div>

							<a name="08011787000686"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I ought to tell the Minister that I had not
thought of this until I reflected upon why things had gone so badly
wrong in the case of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. It turned
out that it was a draft, not a final report, that reached the
Department in May 2007, but no action was taken until October 2007. I
understand the Minister&#146;s position, of course, and accept it in
a pragmatic way, in the hope that one day our positions may be
reversed. I dare say that if I were speaking from the Treasury Bench, I
too would want advance warning were criticism coming. I am not being
difficult about this just as a member of the Opposition.</div>
					<a name="08011787000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">That said, the normal
forewarning has been the practice of the Government. In this case,
however&#151;a hospital-acquired infection of clostridium difficile
resulting in the number of deaths that occurred at Maidstone and
Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust&#151;there had been a thorough draft report
in May on which we had no action until October. That seems, by every
test, not to be simply forewarning but either not being on top of
things or seeking to manage the situation in a way that was not open to
public scrutiny or accountability. There is a general sense of
frustration that accountability has not been forthcoming: only a sense
of shock at the sheer scale of the terrible consequences, let alone the
individual cases. That was what suggested to me that we needed to
address this, hence these amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011787000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened to the Minister&#146;s general point. I do not cavil at
that, but I do feel that there is a valid point in making sure that
there is not the capacity for the Government and others to sit on
difficult news or information, particularly in health and social care
where the individual or, indeed, general consequences are terrifying. I
will withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Minister has had the
opportunity to listen to that plea, and perhaps he will also add that
to the list of items on which he wishes to reflect. I think that the
point is well made; there is not much purpose to be served by forcing
this to a Division, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

						</b> Amendment No. 260 seeks to add clause 44 into the
commencement clause, clause 158. The effect of this will be to bring
clause 44 into effect on the day the Bill is passed . The consequence
is that the CQC will be able to carry out reports or investigations
from its instigation. This, therefore, ties in neatly with the
discussion we have just had on the amendments tabled by the hon. Member
for Romsey and myself. I do not think that commencing this clause from
the point of enactment will prevent the current regulators from
continuing to carry out reports or investigations until such time as
they are wound up, which the Minister may have had in mind as a
counter-point.</div>

too much about the word &#147;shadow&#148; and are doing our best
to get rid of it. I do not think that the Committee would be concerned
if the shadow body carried out non-duplicative investigations and
reports during the transition period. I believe that the concern for
the Committee, current regulators, patients and the public is that
there is a hiatus in those crucial reports. As I have noted, that
hiatus could prevent any such reports from being carried out until the
summer of 2010, which carries obvious political
resonance.</div>
					<a name="08011787000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would
seem from the Government&#146;s response document to the consultation
on the future regulation of health and adult social care in England,

seeking some form of

autonomy to decide what is urgent, and not be prevailed on by a
Government who might regard some things as not
urgent.</div>
					<a name="08011787000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have said
that:</div>
					<a name="08011787000247"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
will be a phased transition from the current systems to the new. The
first priority will be the safety and quality of care in hospitals and
other care providers. The Care Quality Commission&#146;s general
service reviews, that are not directly concerned with assurance of
acceptable levels of safety and quality, will not start until it has
fully implemented the new registration system. The Care Quality
Commission will agree this start date for general service reviews with
the Secretary of State once it is clear that the new system for
checking safety and quality assurance is fully in
place.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">They stated
further
that:</div>
					<a name="08011787000249"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Once the
safety and quality assurance systems are fully up and running, the Care
Quality Commission will be able to carry out general service reviews,
studies and research on issues that arise from carrying out its
functions. It will bring forward an annual programme of work for
discussion with the Secretary of State; this process will also allow
for the need to respond to exceptional
circumstances.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
continued power to make independent studies, reviews and reports
without direct Secretary of State approval is welcome. However, it is
strongly arguable that the new regulator&#146;s power should commence
at the inception of the body. That is from 1 April 2009, when it takes
on its other functions.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 314</div>
					<a name="08011787000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such reports are crucial in
providing an evidence base for driving up social care and health
standards across the piece, and to reporting fully on their state. It
is arguable that the chair and board of the new commission would be
best placed to decide what reports the new body should make, and when
it should make them; taking account of Department of Health views, but
not reliant on direct approval. After all, the Government seem to have
set great store in allowing the new regulator to make its own decisions
on its structure and activities in earlier stages of the Committee. The
Minister has
said:</div>
					<a name="08011787000252"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
believe it should be for the commission itself to establish the
organisational structures and split of responsibilities that it
determines it needs best to carry out those functions and deliver its
aims&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social Care
Public Bill Committee, </i>10 January 2008; c.
135.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">To do otherwise would seem
to undermine the independence of the new regulator. It is only by
exercising its independence that such a regulator can be of service to
the public and support improvement in the
sectors.</div>
					<a name="08011787000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
within its first year of operation the Commission for Social Care
Inspection carried out three major reports while dealing with its own
establishment and reviewing the way it carried out its nascent
regulatory functions. It is also of note that in the current
legislation CSCI can carry out independent reviews and studies as a
statutory function. The Bill appears to water that down. The activities
described are the same, but the nature of the power is different.
Section 80 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and
Standards Act) 2003 confers that activity as a function rather than a
permissive power. Powers are permissive; functions are duties. In a
tight financial climate, there may not be enough resources to fund
permissive powers. Therefore, that is a diminution of power, by
reducing it to a permissive power rather than a duty as a
function.</div>
					<a name="08011787000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already quoted Dame Denise Platt. She said
that:</div>
					<a name="08011787000552"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
principles of public service inspection from the Cabinet Office talk
about the need for inspection to generate data and intelligence that
enable departments more quickly to calibrate the progress of reform in
their sector and to make appropriate adjustment. We think that special
studies do exactly that, so we cannot see why that function is watered
down.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
continued&#151;rather vital
evidence:</div>
					<a name="08011787000553"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our experience, specific reviews are where we bring together a range of
intelligence and we ask the next question of the policy or the
circumstances. For example, we will publish a report this month on what
happens to people who do not meet eligibility criteria in social
services. Before Christmas, we published a report on risk and restraint
in care homes, and the dilemmas in care that raised for care staff and
where the lines should be
drawn.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
carried on:</div>
					<a name="08011787000554"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It
seems to me that the new commission should have the powers and the
duties to identify those issues and comment on them as emerging issues,
and to identify them themselves rather than in advance seek the
agreement of the Secretary of State and go through a whole process that
might delay looking at an issue that needs immediate
attention.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not think that the Committee will struggle to understand that if
there is a delay because of the negotiation process&#151;particularly
given that I have made the political point about how this could carry 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 315</div>through to the summer of 2010&#151;we would be in the arena of people
worrying about political and electoral advantage in advance of the
inevitable general election, which has to take place before that date.
We can avoid that by following the objective and important advice of
Dame Denise Platt.</div>
					<a name="08011787000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">Her
other important point is the need to get on with emerging issues. The
more experience we all have in the field of health and social care, as
in the rest of life, the more we realise that we do not often get the
clarity of certainty until far too late. We get clues. If the expert
regulators, above all, get clues, then they need to be getting on with
things fast, so that the emerging issues can be identified and
sufficient evidence quickly established. That means that, on advice,
Governments have the best chance to make the best decisions&#151;if
there is anything for Government to do in these matters, rather than
simply the enforcement powers granted to a
regulator.</div>
					<a name="08011787000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
is an important issue. The suggested amendment is for clarifying the
attitude of the Government, so that the new regulator can exercise that
power from the start. To coin a phrase, it would be a sunrise
clause&#151;rather than a sunset clause&#151;which might also
commend itself into parliamentary language. To do otherwise would mean
that the new regulator would not be able to carry out any such reports
or investigations until the summer of 2010 unless&#151;picking up on
the Minister&#146;s words from the previous answer&#151;they were
felt to be urgent, having been approved by Government as urgent and
necessary during that period. Committee members, I am sure, are fully
aware of the value of such reports. In the last six months alone we
have had, &#147;A Fair Contract with Older People?&#148;, &#147;A
Time to Care?&#148; which looked at domiciliary care and the
&#147;Safe as Houses&#148; report into private investment in the
social-care market. They provide a strong, independent critique and
encouragement of the policies that we are all seeking to bring forward
as part of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="08011787000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Depending on the
Minister&#146;s response, I would like to reserve the right to test
the Committee on the amendment. I think that I am right to say that I
might want to vote on amendment No. 260, when we reach clause 158. I
hope that I have the procedure correct. I would like to make that point
clear, which leaves us depending on how the Minister reacts. However, I
hope that it is felt across the Committee that this is a point that
seriously needs to be borne in mind. We have an opportunity here to
make sure that nothing falls through the gaps and that we have done our
duty.</div>
					<a name="08011787000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000689"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> We made it clear in the White Paper and in our
response to the consultation on it&#151;indeed, in the
Bill&#151;that the first priority for the new Care Quality Commission
will be the safety and quality of care in hospitals and other
registered health and social care providers. In the light of that, we
believed that there should be a phased transition from the current
system to the new. That is why we have introduced the provision for the
general reviews&#151;those not directly concerned with assurance of
acceptable levels of safety and quality&#151;of the UK&#146;s
quality commission to kick in a year after the new registration system,
which is going to be very important and a very big job, has been fully
implemented. I would like to reassure both the hon. Member for
Eddisbury and other members of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column316" />Column number: 316</div>Committee that transitional arrangements will be put in place to make
sure that the commission will still be able to undertake investigations
where the commission believes that there is a risk to the health,
safety or welfare of people receiving health or social care.</div>
					<a name="08011787000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me use some recent
high-profile examples. The Cornwall learning disabilities investigation
is an example of the type of activity that the CQC could get on with
straight away, without the year&#146;s delay. The health
care-associated infection investigations that have been done at Stoke
Mandeville and at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells are similar, because
they are so obviously connected to the quality of care and safety of
people. The more general reviews that we are talking about would be
general reviews of a service, either throughout the country or in a
particular region.</div>
					<a name="08011787000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
can assure the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee that
we are not the slightest bit interested&#151;I hope that we have made
this clear; Anna Walker has acknowledged this&#151;in fettering the
independence of the commission to conduct the reviews that it thinks it
should be able to conduct. We simply want to avoid the hiatus that the
hon. Gentleman said that he was worried about in the initial year, and
avoid an unnecessary and unreasonable burden on the newly regulated
bodies during the period of transition and registration, which will be
quite a big
process.</div>
					<a name="08011787000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000690"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:
						</b> The Minister accepts that we are on to
quite a serious matter. Perhaps we should consider it the other way
round and he could help us. In what circumstances does he think that
the Secretary of State or himself, as the Minister in the forthcoming
period, might decline to give approval to the CQC to proceed to
undertake an urgent review? It does have to obtain approval. In what
circumstances does he envisage using his ministerial authority to
decline?</div>
					<a name="08011787000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000691"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I am not aware of any example of that happening
previously. It would certainly not be within our powers under the Bill
to prevent the CQC from conducting an urgent review, as I have made
clear. We are, however, keen to avoid the more generalised
reviews&#151;non-urgent reviews&#151;in the first year of its
existence. If the CQC came to us and said that it was very worried
about x, y and z in a certain place and any patterns that might emerge
from that across the service that were putting safety and quality of
care at risk, it would not be within the powers of the Secretary of
State, let alone be his inclination, to prevent the commission from
acting.</div>
					<a name="08011787000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are simply
trying to send a message to the new regulator that it will have a big
job on its hands for the first 12 months in getting the registration
system in place. It will have quite a lot of work doing that, and while
it is doing that, we want it to concentrate its reviews on the things
that are really serious and matter. A burden will also be placed on the
bodies and organisations being regulated. If more general reviews were
being conducted at the same time, we would be worried about the
capacity of the new regulator and of the regulated bodies to cope, but
certainly we would expect anything that was important and urgent as the
hon. Gentleman described to fall within the commission&#146;s remit
right from the start.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 317</div>
					<a name="08011787000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000692"></a>Mr.
O&#146;Brien:
						</b> Having listened to the Minister, I shall
not resist the clause. I have reserved our position, but I think it
fair to point out, given what he has just said about the burden and
given that three regulators are coming together, that in the previous
discussion we envisaged that almost all the people will arrive in a
much bigger organisation, so the capacity to deploy the staff and the
expert teams should be there to help to overcome some of the great
burdens that will arise in going through the first year, particularly
with regard to registrations. One has to bear in mind that this was
exactly the position that the CSCI managed in establishing itself.
During its first year, it was both carrying out regulation and doing
these reports. That was not postponed for a year while it established
itself and did its various inspections and
regulation.</div>
					<a name="08011787000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
still applies. I accept that the Minister has sought to give some
assurance that Ministers would not want to appear in any sense to
fetter the independence and autonomy of the regulator, but I can
envisage circumstances&#151;that is why we are here, scrutinising the
Bill&#151;in which the temptation is almost too great to resist if
something particularly difficult is arising. One can envisage meetings
that are less of a ministerial nature and more of an inevitably
political nature&#151;we all carry both hats&#151;and we need to be
conscious of that. Unless I put it on the table specifically, the
danger is that if something like that happened, we would be seen to be
falling down on our job.</div>
					<a name="08011787000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said, I reserve our
position for a Division on amendment No. 260 when we get to clause 158,
but I note that the Minister has taken seriously the points that we
have been making and I am grateful for
that.</div>

adults&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning we
heard some examples of concerns about how that might present a conflict
in some cases. The specific example given was the case of a care home
closure under certain powers. Although we may not think of it in this
way, to people in those homes, it is their home. I have had personal
experience of the closure of a home, not through any reasons of
malpractice but simply because the owner did a runner 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column318" />Column number: 318</div>with the money, and suddenly provision had to be made for the elderly
residents. It was difficult for the local authority and it seemed to be
a case of slotting the residents into any available space so that the
authority had done its duty. No regard was given to the particular
needs of the residents.</div>
					<a name="08011787000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is designed to
tease out how important this aspect of the Bill is. We are constantly
reassured by the Minister that it is on the face of the Bill so it will
underpin everything, but there are times when expediency means that
action has to be taken quickly and at that stage the human rights
aspects are often forgotten. In many ways this is a probing amendment
to see whether there is a hierarchy of priorities. The hon. Member for
Tiverton and Honiton raised a pertinent example earlier, where a lady
with learning difficulties had her wishes completely disregarded. The
amendment would ensure that, as a consequence of powers in the Bill,
those situations do not arise. The hopes and wishes of all people must
be taken into account, but particular care must be taken when those
people cannot easily stand up for
themselves.</div>

hon. Lady described and which we discussed earlier, about a care home
having to close all of a sudden, I would point out that clause 2(3)(c)
requires the Care Quality Commission to balance its own action against
the risk that the action might pose for users. I hope that that goes
some way to reassure her, as the commission will have a duty to
consider that sort of situation. Clause 2 makes it clear that the
commission must pay particular heed to the need to safeguard the rights
and welfare of vulnerable people in everything that it does. That
clearly applies to the commission&#146;s actions under clause 48. In
the light of that, I ask her to withdraw the

Gidley:
						</b> I want to direct my comments to new clause 15.
During the oral evidence sessions, we heard concerns that the
commission was able to look at failings by English local authorities.
That is in clause 46. There are provisions to look at failings by Welsh
NHS bodies. However, it is not clear to me, and it was obviously not
clear to the Healthcare Commission, why there is no similar provision
to ensure that NHS bodies in England are so covered. I may have missed
something somewhere, but the insertion of new clause 15 would make it
crystal clear that, whether the problem was with NHS England or Wales,
or with local authorities, it would always be dealt with in the same
way. I seek the Minister&#146;s reassurance on that
point.</div>

							<a name="08011787000698"></a>Mr.

							<a name="08011787000699"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I am aware of the cross-border issues, but as
England does not seem to be included anywhere, I am not sure where that
gets us. If England and Wales are included, we presumably need some
sort of clause to join the two up. I appreciate that, but it seems that
somewhere along the line there is lesser protection in England as a
result of the omission. That is what I want to
clarify.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000700"></a>Mr.

but if the hon. Lady insists, I will read the reasons that I have been
given by my officials. She can stop me at any time.</div>
					<a name="08011787000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under clause
47 the commission will be obliged to inform Ministers in the Welsh
Assembly if the commission encounters serious failings in the running
of a Welsh NHS body or health care provided by a Welsh NHS body, or by
someone else providing services commissioned by a Welsh NHS body.
Although the new commission will only cover health and adult social
care services in England, it may come across patients receiving health
care in England that has been commissioned by the Welsh NHS. It may
also need to review the care being provided by a Welsh NHS body under
arrangements made by the NHS in England.</div>
					<a name="08011787000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances, it is
clearly important that the commission is under a duty to advise Welsh
Ministers of any failings it encounters either in the provision of
health care or the running of services. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 320</div>Patients, of course, draw no distinctions about where they receive care
and they expect any problems that are identified to be followed up and
addressed regardless of which authority is responsible. The commission
will be able to recommend any special measures that it considers
appropriate to remedy the failure in question to Welsh
Ministers.</div>
					<a name="08011787000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Welsh
Ministers will continue to be under a corresponding duty, under section
71 of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act
2003, to report failings in English NHS care to the Secretary of State.
The proposed clause would require the commission to inform the
Secretary of State where it considered that there were significant
failings in English NHS bodies. It would also allow the commission to
recommend certain measures that the Secretary of State should take
where it judges that an English NHS body is failing in the provision of
health care. While we have given the commission that role in relation
to local authorities and their adult social service functions, in the
NHS strategic health authorities in England are responsible for the
performance management of primary care trusts and hold them to
account.</div>

bodies in Wales will not be subject to registration in the same way as
in England. The Care Quality Commission will have the role of
publishing independent comparative information on the performance of
commissioners. SHAs will then be expected to use that information as
part of their performance management of PCTs and to address areas of
weak performance. Local authorities, on the other hand, do not have an
equivalent body overseeing their work and hence we have kept the
provisions allowing the commission to recommend special measures with
regard to
them.</div>
					<a name="08011787000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">NHS
providers will have to be registered with the commission and will have
to comply with regulatory requirements. The commission will be able to
intervene directly in poorly performing providers by taking appropriate
enforcement action. The new commission will have the ultimate power to
de-register. The ability to take direct action represents a significant
increase in the regulator&#146;s powers, with a provision allowing
the Healthcare Commission to recommend special
measures.</div>
					<a name="08011787000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
interests of a fair playing field, all providers should be subject to
the same provision. The commission has both the power to intervene
directly in a situation where an NHS body is failing and the power to
advise the Secretary of State about any concerns it has. Given that, we
do not believe that it is necessary to keep the rather weaker power
that the commission be able to recommend that the Secretary of State
take special measures with regard to the NHS. Therefore, the amendment
is not
necessary.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Stephen Crabb</b> (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con): I am grateful
for the opportunity to discuss clause 47, which deals with the failings
of Welsh NHS bodies.</div>
					<a name="08011787000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
just about kept up with the Minister&#146;s explanation, but some
clarification is needed. It is not obvious how the clause will work in
practice. My first observation is on the criteria by which the
commission will assess whether there is a significant failing in a
Welsh NHS body. The standards in Wales are now different from those in
England. I have here the &#147;Healthcare 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column321" />Column number: 321</div>Standards for Wales&#148;. There are 32 standards, detailed criteria
that have been developed by Welsh Ministers in the Welsh Assembly. They
are the basis on which Welsh Ministers judge the quality of health care
provision in Wales. My question to the Minister is, what read-across
will there be by the commission from the criteria used in England and
the standards and criteria that are already being developed in Wales?
If he were to look at the document, which came out two years ago, he
would read that at that time the Assembly was developing integrated
health and social care standards for
Wales.</div>
					<a name="08011787000296"></a><div class="hs_Para">My other
observation is about the strength of the duty that will be on the
commission in terms of its reporting of failings in Welsh NHS bodies.
Looking back to clause 46, which deals with failings identified in
English local authorities, there is a duty both to inform the Secretary
of State and to make a recommendation about special measures in terms
of remedial action. In clause 47 there is no corresponding duty to make
a recommendation. That seems to be optional in subsection (2), which
says that the commission &#147;may&#148; make recommendations. My
understanding of the clause is that Welsh Ministers are at liberty to
ignore any recommendations made by the commission in terms of failures
identified during reviews or
investigations.</div>
					<a name="08011787000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would therefore welcome a bit more explanation from the Minister about
how the clause will work in practice. The explanatory notes
accompanying the Bill were not very helpful in that
regard&#151;merely five or six lines summarising the clause. I would
like some assurance from the Minister that serious thought has gone
into how the interface will work between the default Administration in
Cardiff and his Department here in England, in terms of making the Bill
a
success.</div>

O'Brien:
						</b> If ever we needed proof that there is great
benefit in having a Member who represents a Welsh constituency on the
Bill we have just heard it. That is absolutely vital because he is a
better test of understanding than someone who happens to represent an
English constituency with a Welsh border, with patients freely flowing
between the two constituencies. There has been a very public and major
dispute between the Countess of Chester hospital and the Flintshire
local health board about funding for patients coming from Wales to be
treated by the NHS in England. They settled on &#163;1 million on the
prospect of future flows, but that is still way short of the true
recovery costs. Those are real
problems.</div>

					<a name="08011787000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire made an important point about
ensuring that the proposal is thoroughly thought through, not just at
the conceptual level but deeply at the practical level, given that
there are two different sets of political accountabilities. The
Minister should bear in mind the practicalities and the difficulties. I
am an English MP who frequently has to ask the Secretary of State for
Wales&#151;when he has that one of his two hats on, assuming that he
will continue in the post in any case&#151;about matters in Wales.
When I seek to question him, he refers me immediately to the First
Minister, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 322</div>and the First Minister says, &#147;I have absolutely no need, right or
intention to answer you. You are an English MP, and I have no
accountability to you. Go
hang.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is
how it works. We have an absence of accountability, hence my hon.
Friend&#146;s germane points. I hope that the Minister will have an
opportunity to ensure that we can set our minds at rest. Otherwise, we
could be off to a rocky

and the Welsh Government to co-operate, and that co-operation, which
has been good in respect of the formulation of the Bill, will continue.
I shall come to Government amendments in that regard in a
moment.</div>
					<a name="08011787000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
will not judge Welsh standards. It has only an English remit, but of
course it will co-ordinate with the Welsh authorities to satisfy itself
that provision which may be commissioned cross-border meets the quality
and safety requirements that it would expect for English patients. If
the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire would like a detailed
exposition in the form of a letter as to how we expect that to work in
practice, I will happily provide it for
him.</div>
					<a name="08011787000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be up to
the commission to decide whether it wanted to judge the quality of a
service being provided against its own or Welsh criteria. We would not
want to tie its hands in that regard. Based on that, I hope that the
hon. Lady will not press the new clause to a
Division.</div>

guarantee that visits will be reduced only because of the CQC&#146;s
judgment of its responsibilities to those detained under Mental Health
Act 1983, and never because of simple financial constraints, there will
remain a genuine concern for all members of the Committee. As was
transparent in the oral evidence sessions, there is a major need for us
to respect the enormous benefit of the work of the Mental Health Act
Commission, particularly with those who are detained. That came through
loud and clear. We must ensure that there is no change and that its
judgment carries through to the CQC instead of being supplanted,
diluted, qualified or in any way watered down by anybody else having
involvement or a contrary or complementary
judgment.</div>
					<a name="08011787000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
about post, and to avoid a lengthy debate on schedule 3, which we shall
consider next, I note that paragraph 12 of schedule 3 adds new section
134A to the Mental Health Act 1983, which itself deals with post in
sections 121 and 134. What does the proposed new section add to that
Act? With that comment, I hope to curtail what might otherwise be a
lengthy discussion on schedule 3. I hope that the Minister will address
the

					<a name="08011787000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would transfer
certain functions currently carried out by the Mental Health Act
Commission to the body that replaces it, the Care Quality Commission.
Those functions are the visiting of patients and inspection of their
records, and the reviewing of decisions to withhold the mail of
patients detained in high-security hospitals. However, schedule 3
already gives those functions to the CQC. As we made clear in other

role.</div>

					<a name="08011787000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">On letters, paragraph 12 of
schedule 3 amends the 1983 Act by inserting new section 134A. Section
134 provides for the incoming and outgoing mail of patients detained in
high-security hospitals to be examined and withheld in specified
circumstances. New section 134A will require the Care Quality
Commission and Welsh Ministers to review any decision to withhold mail
in those circumstances in response to an application to do so. It will
also give the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers the power to make
regulations in connection with such an application. New section 134A is
equivalent to powers that already exist in section 121 of the 1983 Act,

repealed.</div>

						</b> The amendments would remove the function of
undertaking studies into economy and efficiency from the new Care
Quality Commission. That returns to our earlier discussions about the
extension, or otherwise, of the role of Monitor. I shall deal with that
matter in some detail now, because it is a sensible point at which to
do so.</div>
					<a name="08011787000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have
argued before, the amendments would considerably widen the scope of
Monitor, which is currently only a regulator of NHS foundation trusts.
As I am sure that the Committee knows, Monitor has no role in
regulating adult social care, commissioners or other NHS health care
providers. The Care Quality Commission on the other hand will be a
regulator of both health and adult social care, and so the regulation
of the NHS is only a part of its
work.</div>
					<a name="08011787000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a need for a commission that can take a completely independent view
of whether health and adult social care providers, including NHS
foundation trusts, meet essential safety and quality requirements and
impose tough sanctions when they fail to do so. As we set out in our
consultation on the future regulation of health and adult social care
in England, that is a very different role from that performed by
Monitor, which has a specific role in ensuring that NHS foundation
trusts are well managed and financially strong, with statutory powers
to intervene should they be in breach of their terms of authorisation.
Having greater autonomy than other NHS bodies, NHS foundation trusts
require Monitor&#146;s specific regulation to ensure good value for
money for the taxpayer from public
assets.</div>
					<a name="08011787000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">By
contrast, it will be important that the Care Quality Commission can
take a consistent view of the safety and quality of care across all
types of provider, including NHS foundations trusts. The wider scope
proposed for Monitor by the amendment would serve to distract Monitor
from its current, vital, specific focus, which is on foundation trusts.
It would therefore be quite difficult for it to have a function of
undertaking studies in relation to other NHS bodies and English local
authorities. I would go so far as to say that Monitor may not
necessarily be considered a fully disinterested party if it were to
carry out reviews of economy, efficiency or effectiveness in other
organisations while having a specific role in authorising, monitoring,
regulating and driving forward foundation
trusts.</div>

those considerations, the function of undertaking the kind of studies
described in clause 50, and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column326" />Column number: 326</div>publication of the results and recommendations arising from them, should
sit squarely with the Care Quality Commission rather than Monitor. In

O'Brien:
						</b> The amendment seeks to enable the CQC to inspect
independent health care, a point touched on earlier by others on other
amendments. Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 amend clause 67(4), which limits
regulations under that clause to health and social care schemes paid
for out of public funds only. The amendments seek to broaden it to all
health and social care schemes and the clause makes provision for the
commission to make arrangements with Ministers of the Crown to inspect
health and social care facilities within their remit. The obvious
example is health care provided through the defence budget. That is a
useful example to have in mind. On amendment No. 39, we need to ask why
the Bill limits the inspection to NHS bodies. On amendments Nos. 40 and
41, I understand that that is in regard to other Ministers of the
Crown, It might be helpful if the Minister could outline which ones. I

limited to health care paid for out of public funds? Presumably, that

						</b> I am going to have to disappoint the hon. Lady
again. We believe that clause 56 sets out clearly the purposes for
which the Care Quality Commission may carry out inspections. On that
basis I do not think that the amendment is necessary. It is interesting
to have the spokesman for the Opposition advocating from a sedentary
position even more regulation of private transactions between
individuals. That is an interesting position. The intention behind the
amendment is met by clause 56(1)(a), which allows the commission to
carry out inspection
of</div>

enables the Care Quality Commission to make arrangements with another
Minister of the Crown. Under an agreement with the relevant Minister,
that clause allows for the commission to perform any of its functions
in relation to a specific prescribed health or social care scheme paid
for by public funds or to provide relevant services or facilities that
that Minister may require in relation to such a scheme. Amendments Nos.
40 and 41 would extend that power to schemes that are not paid for from
public
funds.</div>
					<a name="08011787000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
67 is intended to allow the commission to share its skills, expertise
and know-how for the good of another public sector service&#151;the
hon. Member for Eddisbury has mentioned a couple&#151;falling under
the remit of another Department. For example, the commission might make
arrangements with the Secretary of Sate for Defence to review the
quality of health care provision for the armed forces. We have been in
active discussion with the Ministry of Defence and the Healthcare
Commission about that. The commission will also have powers, set out in
paragraphs 8 and 9 of schedule 4, to act jointly with or advise and
assist other public authorities. The crucial difference is that the
powers in clause 67 allow the commission to carry out activity on
behalf of another
Department.</div>

out an activity or lending resource to another body is a more

the opportunity to introduce enforcement powers for Wales that mirror
many of those that the Bill proposed for the Care Quality Commission in
England and said that they wanted a little more time to consider the

an inquiry be held in private, or when publication might be
inappropriate. I note that being prejudicial to an ongoing criminal
investigation is an example, but in that case, the power should be to
delay rather than to prevent publication. Perhaps the Minister will
clarify 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column331" />Column number: 331</div>that, in that case, &#147;delay&#148; might have been a more

					<a name="08011787000406"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
highlights the privileged position of the Secretary of State in
relation to the commission. It must be patent by now that we have
sought to remove the Secretary of State&#146;s powers in order to
make the CQC a genuinely and transparently independent body. I have
just one question for the Minister: what is the purpose of
consultations under subsection (2), and could the clause be used by the
Secretary of State to block reviews, however necessary people feel them
to be?</div>
					<a name="08011787000407"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000742"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I simply reiterate what I said earlier. The CQC
will be completely unfettered in its decisions to undertake reviews in
the circumstances that I described.</div>
					<a name="08011787000408"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment would not have
any practical effect, because the Secretary of State has no power to
prevent the commission from conducting reviews. The amendment seems to
refer to the requirement for the CQC to publish in advance its work
programme for the more general reviews that it intends to undertake
during a specific period. That is a sensible requirement, not least
because that way, the organisations concerned will have some idea about
the CQC&#146;s work programme. It can formalise its business planning
processes&#151;an exercise that already takes place under the
existing system to help managers administer burdens of regulation on
front-line service providers. The requirement to consult will also
ensure dialogue between the commission and the Secretary of State.
However and as I have made absolutely clear, important, urgent
reviews&#151;or those that the CQC considers urgent in fulfilling its
duty on quality and safety&#151;would be completely unfettered and
could be undertaken without consultation with
anyone.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000744"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in
clause 79, page 38, line 33, leave
out &#145;specified factors&#146; and insert &#145;factors
specified by
regulations&#146;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000414"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
we gallop towards schedule 5, we just have to rein in a touch on
amendment No. 46. Subsection (1) of the clause enables the commission
from time to time to make provisions for fees to be paid in various
circumstances. Our amendment would give Parliament sight of the factors
on which the amount of a fee would be determined. There is a wider
principle about fees and whether Parliament should vote not only on the
fee-making powers, but the level of the fees charged. One recent
example of the potential impact of such a power comes from the
palliative care
sector.</div>
					<a name="08011787000415"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have set the Healthcare Commission, along with all other
regulators in England, a requirement to recover the full costs of
regulation from fees by the 2008-09 financial year. In the past, fees
for hospices have been at discounted rates. In 2006-07, the Healthcare
Commission froze fees for regulating hospices and type 3 hyperbaric
chambers that are used inter alia to combat the side effects of some
cancer treatments, and by voluntary multiple sclerosis treatment
centres for MS sufferers. From April 2007, it reduced fees by 22 per
cent. for hyperbaric chambers and slowed down significantly the planned
phasing out of existing subsidies for hospices, with most fees frozen
for the second year
running.</div>
					<a name="08011787000416"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Healthcare Commission is working from a principle that the fees should
reflect the actual costs of regulation, not what establishments can
afford to pay. Fees are therefore highest for those establishments that
are unable to provide assurance of standards and need frequent
check-ups, and lowest for those that need the least intervention. The
commission notes that it consulted on that approach and received strong
support, including from voluntary organisations. However, in its
briefing on the subject, it says that it
believes</div>
					<a name="08011787000565"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that if a
special case were to be made for voluntary organisations&#146; fees,
it would be for democratic Government&#151;not the
regulator&#151;to decide that public funds or other
establishments&#146; fees should be used to subsidise
them&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000417"></a><div class="hs_Para">It continues to
say, however, that it
acknowledges</div>
					<a name="08011787000566"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
voluntary organisations and small businesses feel the impact of a fixed
overhead such as regulatory fees more acutely than large
businesses&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000418"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that we all say &#147;Hear, hear&#148; to that. It goes
on:</div>
					<a name="08011787000567"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Our fees
schemes take this into
account&#148;.</div>
					<a name="08011787000419"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
planned increases for 2007-08, the Healthcare Commission is proposing
charge increases for hospices with four or more beds, involving a
frozen fee set at &#163;2,376. A hospice with, for example, three 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column334" />Column number: 334</div>in-patient beds, would see the burden of costs rise from the current
total of &#163;907&#151;the registration fee plus the flat rate for
inspection costs&#151;to &#163;2,213. That is far more than double,
encompassing the doubling of the registration fees for small hospices,
plus the new increased flat-rate inspection fee and the removal of the
exemption from the charge per bed for hospices with fewer than four
beds. Therefore, the impact on smaller hospices is disproportionate and
seems to run counter to the commission&#146;s stated goal of finding
a balance between full cost recovery and affordability for voluntary
organisations.</div>
				
					<a name="08011787000588"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011787000420"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, in
response to a written parliamentary question asked by my hon. Friend
the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton) in February last
year, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who was then a Health
Minister,
said:</div>
					<a name="08011787000568"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We have
made no assessments in connection with the regulatory fees hospices pay
the Healthcare Commission.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 28
February 2007; Vol. 457, c.
1425W.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000421"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my view, that
suggests a disturbing lack of ministerial accountability and
parliamentary control in the fee-charging arrangements. It is not that
it is coarse for us to fix the charge of the precise fees, but the
concept of trying to minimise the burden on the smaller organisations,
particularly the voluntary organisations that are doing such valuable
work, and also of trying to establish a fairer arrangement, rather than
a financially driven arrangement, seems to be an area where we as
parliamentarians can set the appropriate
parameters.</div>
					<a name="08011787000422"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
I hope that the Minister will address the following questions. First,
can he confirm that he does not expect the fees to deviate wildly from
those currently levied by the regulatory bodies? Secondly, can he
confirm the unfortunate increase in the regulatory burden on smaller
hospices? Thirdly, what assessment has he made of the Healthcare
Commission&#146;s contention that it is for democratic Government to
make the case for public funds or other establishments&#146; fees
being used to subsidise voluntary organisations&#146; fees? Finally,
where would he see the power of Parliament in relation to that
contention?</div>
					<a name="08011787000423"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope
that that is a clear outline of the concern that arises as a result of
clause 79. The amendment that we have tabled is to enable the Minister
to give some insight and also to ensure that those who have to deal
with this Bill have the platform of fairness as well as that of
practicality going forward.</div>
					<a name="08011787000424"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000745"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> I accept that it is important that there are
safeguards in place to ensure that the fee levels set are reasonable
and proportionate; I also accept that that is the aim of this
amendment. However, we believe that there are already a number of
safeguards in place in the clause. For example, although the commission
will be able to choose what approach it takes to charging fees, which I
think is absolutely right&#151;we are keen to ensure that the
commission remains independent&#151;those fees will need to be
approved by the Secretary of State. The commission will also have to
consult before making provision about fees. The Secretary of State may
also make regulations to provide for matters that the commission should
take 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column335" />Column number: 335</div>into account when setting the fees. Finally, the clause allows the
Secretary of State to create regulations making alternative provision
about fees to replace that made by the commission in the unlikely
scenario that we think that the commission has exercised, or is
proposing to exercise, its power inappropriately. Given all those
safeguards, I hope that the hon. Gentleman may acknowledge that the
amendment is not necessary.

to these amendments is to note them. They are obviously the result of
discussions and negotiations. The only thing that concerns us is to
ensure that, as we consider the inter-relationship with what is going
to happen under the auspices of Welsh Ministers, the Minister keeps in
mind the fact that we will be perpetually seeking reassurances about
the consistency of approach between Wales and England. He is more than
well aware that it is a genuinely live issue. It is not only to do with
things being better on one side of the border, or the other. It will
have a real effect for those who represent constituencies on the border
between Wales and England. It would be helpful to get it right, as we
would all be dealing with fewer of the cases on border inconsistencies
that tend to fill our surgeries. On that basis, I am happy to note the

							<a name="08011787000757"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> New clause 4 seeks to establish a complaints
handling function within the Care Quality Commission. Hon. Members will
note that we skipped lightly across some earlier parts of the Bill
because we had the promise and the prospect of dealing with this
important issue more appropriately at this point.</div>
					<a name="08011787000464"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 seeks to establish
an independent complaints handling body. Amendments Nos. 86 and 87
would neutralise the Government&#146;s attempts to remove this
responsibility through amendments to the 2003 Act in respect of the CQC
and the complaints framework. I should state from the outset that the
argument for removing the complaints handling function from the CQC has
some merits given that it has been such a drain on the Healthcare
Commission&#146;s resources. During the oral evidence sessions, Dame
Janet Smith, now Lady Justice Smith, stated
that</div>
					<a name="08011787000569"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;health care
complaints are in a mess and causing great
dissatisfaction.<i class="I">&#151;&#151;[Official Report, Health and Social
Care Public Bill Committee, </i>8 January 2008; c.
44.]</div>
					<a name="08011787000465"></a><div class="hs_Para">In considering these
amendments, the Committee must consider where such complaints will go,
and if it is happy with the status quo as concerns social care
complaints, where part-funders and self-funders have no recourse to
second-tier complaints. That point was also made by the hon. Member for
Romsey during 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column343" />Column number: 343</div>discussion of another part of the Bill. We have to look at whether the
Committee is happy that the places where such complaints will go will
be allowed to remain.</div>
					<a name="08011787000466"></a><div class="hs_Para">As regards the quality of
complaints, the Committee should note that there are approximately
95,000 complaints in the NHS per annum. The Healthcare Commission
reviews about 5 per cent., which is some 7,600 complaints. My figures
have been derived from a series of parliamentary questions and other
sources. In 2006-07, the health ombudsman received 863
complaints, 239 of which were to do with continuing care and 623 with
other health matters. In the same year, the local government ombudsman
dealt with six complaints into adult care services and two complaints
into residential care. I do not have the figures for local authorities.
If the Minister has them, it will be very helpful to view
them.</div>
					<a name="08011787000467"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Healthcare
Commission handled 5,867 complaints in 2004-05, 7,644 a year later, and
7,696 a year after that. In 2007-08, up to 14 December last year, 5,515
complaints were made. I hope that that gives the Committee some idea of
the scale of what we have to tackle here.</div>
					<a name="08011787000468"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s confirmation this morning that the backlog of
complaints for the past two years was 5,180 and 2,298 respectively. The
Healthcare Commission is reaching its estimated target of closing 95
per cent. of complaints within two months, which is encouraging. All
Committee members will have had letter from constituents complaining
about the inordinate length of time it has taken to consider and
complete some complaints. We would all like to see a more streamlined
approach, but one that is still
effective.</div>
					<a name="08011787000469"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee will also be aware of the written submission of the
parliamentary ombudsman. I am sure that the Minister will seek to
remind the Committee that the parliamentary ombudsman states:</div>

Department&#146;s
proposals.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000470"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, her
evidence throws up some important statistical questions that the
Minister should answer before the Committee allows the CQC to lose its
complaints
function.</div>
					<a name="08011787000471"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the final
paragraph of her evidence, the ombudsman states:</div>
					<a name="08011787000571"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I have already explored
with the Treasury the additional funding I am likely to
require.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000472"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that hangs
her evidence and presumably her support. I would not want to criticise
her of empire building, but I think that it is important that the
Committee is aware of what additional funding she is likely to require
especially as the first cut from the CQC will be reported as a gross
saving by the Department, but could be a net loss to the taxpayer. The
Committee also should know what costs to the Exchequer it is voting for
as a result of the proposals in the Bill. The ombudsman refers to
forecast increases in her work load. She notes that</div>
					<a name="08011787000572"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in the short term the changes
will result in an increase in the number of enquiries made to my office
and the number of investigations I undertake...as evidence I note that
when the Scottish health system moved to a similar model, the number of
investigations increased, but not unmanageably so&#148;.</div>

					<a name="08011787000476"></a><div class="hs_Para">It would be
helpful if the Minister could expand on the difference between the

also be reassured if the Government would outline how the winding-up of
the complaints process at the Healthcare Commission, and the handing
over to the ombudsman, will work out. Obviously, local providers will
need time, with the commission in support, to bring their own
complaints systems up to scratch. We cannot have a system whereby the
ombudsman wakes up one morning with 7,000 complaints on her
hands.</div>
					<a name="08011787000478"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another issue
that the Committee should consider is the lack of a two-tier complaints
structure for social care. Currently, people who have their care part
funded or wholly funded by the local authority can complain through the
local authority social services complaints procedure. That was raised
by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton in her excellent
example on the previous amendment. If people are dissatisfied with the
outcome of their complaint, they can ask the local government ombudsman
to investigate.</div>
					<a name="08011787000479"></a><div class="hs_Para">Self-funders have no such
option. They are at the mercy of their own home's complaints procedure,
and have no other avenue apart from the courts. This debate very much
plays back into the ongoing debate that this Committee has had about
human rights&#151;a number of hon. Members throughout the House are
very exercised by that, and rightly so&#151;and the disjunction

problem is that self-funders, of whom there are an increasing number,
have nowhere to go if they are dissatisfied with the way in which the
provider investigates their complaints. The regulator, as things now
stand, does not investigate individual complaints. On receipt of such a
complaint, the regulator can visit the home, examine practices there
and take action, but they cannot investigate the individual complaint.
That is an important distinction. I am committed to considering how
that can be put right. In a modern care system, it is unacceptable that
self-funders should not have the protection 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column345" />Column number: 345</div>that other residents have of being able to rely on an independent

							<a name="08011787000758"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> Before the sitting was suspended, I was referring
to what the Under-Secretary said on 11 December 2007 at column 52 of
the <i class="I">Official Report</i>. It is odd that he should have said that he
was &#147;committed&#148;, as that Westminster Hall debate took
place after the publication of the Bill, whereas in a &#147;File on
4&#148; programme on care homes in September, Alan Urry reported that
the Parliamentary Under-Secretary had</div>
					<a name="08011787000575"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;agreed to look again at the need
for an independent complaints body for families worried about the care
of their loved ones, as he prepares to put in place a new regulatory
regime due in
2009.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000484"></a><div class="hs_Para">Presumably, that
regulatory regime is the Bill itself.</div>
					<a name="08011787000485"></a><div class="hs_Para">When interviewed by
Mr. Urry, the Under-Secretary did not seek to disabuse him
of that notion, instead saying
that</div>
					<a name="08011787000576"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;looking at whether
there ought to be a right of appeal if you&#146;re not satisfied with
the way an individual provider has dealt with your complaint or some
sort of independent element in the system of considering
complaints...is something that we will have to consider going
forward.&#148;</div>
					<a name="08011787000486"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
remains: on the back of that commitment from the Under-Secretary, if
the Government are serious about tackling the issue why is there
nothing in the Bill? While in-house complaints avenues may work for
large organisations such as hospitals, social care providers are often
too small for an in-house complaints procedure to work. That was borne
out by many of the examples that we have heard from hon. Members. We
know from our constituency casework the strain that many regulatory
regimes&#151;and thus complaints handling by definition&#151;put on
smaller homes. None of us would wish to see a reduction in the capacity
of such homes or of the service they provide in our
constituencies.</div>
					<a name="08011787000487"></a><div class="hs_Para">Issues
relating to complaints by self-funders in care homes are clearly under
consideration, but there has not yet been any assessment of, or
consultation on, the various options available. Furthermore, an
effective complaints system at local and national level will feed into
better regulation, both in the general guidelines and in the capacity
to provide early warning of specific interventions. This is a well
thought- through and constructive set of amendments and new clauses,
which will give effect to something that, it is broadly accepted, must
be looked at urgently. I am relying very much on the expectation that
the explicit, on-the-record commitment of the Under-Secretary would
lead to something appearing in the Bill. That is why I was anxious to
have this debate on the complaints procedure.</div>
					<a name="08011787000488"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I ask the Minister what
additional funding is the ombudsman likely to require and what have the

<div class="Column"><a name="Column346" />Column number: 346</div>Treasury offered? What length of time does &#147;short-term&#148;
refer to in the ombudsman&#146;s evidence? What is the forecast
increase in her work load? What are the differences between the
Healthcare Commission&#146;s investigation and the ombudsman&#146;s
investigation, which is limited to maladministration or service
failure? How will the Healthcare Commission be wound up and how will it
hand over its complaints function to the CQC? Will the Minister outline
how the new complaints system will feed into an effective alerts system
for the CQC, regarding both broad issues in the sector and problems
with specific providers? What are the Government doing about two-tier
complaints for social care funders?</div>
					<a name="08011787000489"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we persuade the
Under-Secretary to accept the amendment there is a danger that he will
renege on his promise to provide solutions in the Bill. Those pertinent
arguments go to the heart of a number of issues that Members from
across the House have raised, so I hope that the amendments and the new
clauses will find favour with the Minister. They were tabled in a
genuine attempt to improve the
Bill.</div>

							<b class="B">Kelvin
Hopkins</b> (Luton, North) (Lab): I hope not to speak for very
long as it is late, but I must sound a note of concern about patient
complaints. A number of my hon. Friends, not necessarily members of the
Committee, are concerned about changes in patient representation and
procedures for patients making complaints in recent years. Those
concerns remain, and I may talk about them later in Committee
proceedings.</div>
					<a name="08011787000491"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am a
member of the Public Administration Committee and the ombudsman reports
to us on a regular basis. She does a first-class job. The
ombudsman&#146;s role is a part of government and our constitution
that works really well. The quality of the reports that come back to
our constituents are first class and better than those produced by most
other institutions. We would not want to see that service diminished or
weakened as a result of the ombudsman being overburdened or
underfunded. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take note of
these concerns, which are shared by other Labour Members.

							<a name="08011787000760"></a>Sandra
Gidley:
						</b> I will make just a few brief points, as we have
heard a fairly detailed explanation of the provisions. Some pertinent
questions have been posed to which I, too, should like to hear the
answers. I share the concerns of the hon. Member for Eddisbury, as it
is vital that we know what assessment has been made of the extra work
load on the ombudsman. I also share the concerns of the hon. Member for
Luton, North. We would not want to see a diminution in the quality of
service provided by the ombudsman. An overriding concern is that if a
complaints procedure is connected with the regulator, that will be an
in-house and reactive arrangement. If there is a stream of related
complaints, that needs to be flagged up quite early in the
process.</div>
					<a name="08011787000493"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned that however robust the mechanism that is put in place by the
Government to feed back the ombudsman&#146;s concerns, it will not be
as efficient and responsive as an in-house process. The constant
development that stems from the fact that the commission can deal with
complaints should not be dismissed lightly in the overall picture of
improving health care for our constituents.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Jenkins</b> (Tamworth) (Lab): I want to ask the Minister
whether he shares my concerns about this area. We constantly say that
we do not want to get involved with private purchasers of health care.
If one of my constituents goes to a shop and buys a good that is not of
merchandisable quality, they can contact trading standards, which will
intervene on their behalf and ensure that they get something that is
fit for purpose. Why, at the end of their life, when they are in their
most vulnerable position, can they not contact a publicly funded
official who will intervene on their behalf? I know that it is a
difficult area to get into, but I do not think that we should run away
from the problem. A lot of these problems can be solved by early
intervention between the consumer and the provider, without having to
get embroiled in obtaining lawyers and going through a long drawn-out
process. If the Minister could explain why that is the case, I would be
grateful.</div>
					<a name="08011787000495"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000762"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> May I begin with the point made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Tamworth? There would be nothing to stop a
self-funder in social care making a complaint to the Care Quality
Commission if the registration requirements of the independent care
home where they are resident are not being met. The Care Quality
Commission could investigate that complain. What we are talking about
is the investigatory role of the Care Quality Commission in taking on
specific
complaints.</div>
					<a name="08011787000496"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
point made by the hon. Member for Romsey, there is nothing to stop the
Care Quality Commission analysing a pattern of complaints or having
access to complaints so that it can detect patterns. It will be very
important that the ombudsman works very closely with the Care Quality
Commission if he or she identifies a pattern of complaints that is
worthy of closer inspection and investigation. The dividing line that
we are drawing is between a responsibility for ensuring quality and one
for detecting patterns that might indicate that something more serious
is going on. That would come under the remit of the Care Quality
Commission. It will have to take on the role, which, as we have
discussed, has been burdensome for the existing Healthcare Commission,
of being the second-tier investigator for
complaints.</div>
					<a name="08011787000497"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
know if all hon. Members have had the chance to read the submission
from Ann Abraham, the health care ombudsman. I am grateful to the hon.
Member for Eddisbury for drawing attention to it, because Ann Abraham
strongly supports what we are trying to do in this area. She thinks
that it is very important that there is coherent coverage of both
health and social care; effective handling at local level; a major
cultural shift in the NHS from a defensive application of process to
learning from complaints and a will to resolve them; and a simplified
two-stage process. Both she and the Healthcare Commission have made it
clear that they do not think that complaints handling is an appropriate
role for any regulator.</div>
					<a name="08011787000498"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ann Abraham also made it clear
that she has plans to ensure that her office is prepared to handle any
increase, from April 2009. She recently restructured her office and is
confident that it will be able to meet the forecast increases in any
workload, and provide an efficient and effective response to demand. I
do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column348" />Column number: 348</div>have the exact figures to hand, but I shall write to the hon. Member for
Eddisbury with them. I stress again that although it will not be the
role of the Care Quality Commission to intervene in individual cases,
it will take account of concerns, complaints and allegations when
determining whether services in the independent and public sectors are
provided safely and are of appropriate
quality.</div>

pm</div>
					<a name="08011787000499"></a><div class="hs_Para">On self-funders
in the health care or local authority systems, we are still actively
considering options available to them. The Under-Secretary of State for
Health was right about this. We have only just finished the
consultation on the complaints system and the Government will publish
their response shortly. However, before addressing future changes, or
new avenues available to self-funders, I should repeat what I have said
to colleagues before, which is that self-funders can, of course, take
their custom elsewhere. They can choose civil remedies through the
courts and, as I just mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for
Tamworth, they can complain to the PCTs or local authorities, from whom
the provider is contracted, about their concerns, if they think that it
has failed in its registration duties. I hope that, given those
assurances, the hon. Member for Eddisbury is able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
				
					<a name="08011787000500"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000763"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I think the Minister understands the point that
we are driving at. He indicated the seriousness with which he has
listened to our comments. It is clear, therefore, that what the
Under-Secretary of State was saying will not be realised in this Bill,
which is very regrettable. I am sorry that Government timetabling has
not enabled that to happen, because it would have been wholly
appropriate to make it
coincide</div>
					<a name="08011787000501"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
concerned about self-funders, although I accept that other avenues are
available. However, those avenues are available not so much because of
the difference between being publicly or self-funded, but because of
the type of remedy available and the sort of expertise and concerns
applicable to a likely complaint. There will be no difference in the
quality of care, or the vulnerability and circumstances of patients,
whether in a health care or residential social care setting, between
those who are publicly and privately funded. The same set of human
circumstances will apply.</div>
					<a name="08011787000502"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact that there are
potentially two different outcomes or avenues causes a lot of us deep
concern. We could end up with an unintended consequence&#151;in this
case it might be intended&#151;whereby we have a two-tier system. I
am not talking about ability to pay, because clearly from that point of
view it is a two-tier system&#151;that is what determines the cut-off
point between funding social care through local taxation and
means-tested benefits. In effect, if a person has available assets,
they must use them first. The outcome is a two-tier system for people
with a similar condition. We have an issue with that from a
humanitarian point of
view.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000764"></a>Angela
Browning:
						</b> I agree. It often happens in a residential care
setting that we have both sets of people&#151;self-funders and those
funded by social 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column349" />Column number: 349</div>services. When we discussed a previous amendment, I mentioned the
scenario, which is not uncommon, of somebody who requires nursing care,
but who social services fund at the residential rate in a private home.
People who suffer the same problems can be treated unequally, and that
is a matter of great
concern.</div>
					<a name="08011787000504"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000765"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> My hon. Friend puts her finger on an instinctive
concern that is probably shared across the Committee. We will try to
grapple our way towards a solution.</div>
					<a name="08011787000505"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is important to recognise
that the care complaints procedure and potential remedies available to
cared-for people&#151;be that on a health basis or a social care
basis&#151;need to be based on their care concerns, not on their
financial circumstances. That is the underlying sense of this. In the
absence of the Government having picked up on a number of the proposals
on trying to incorporate the rights-based approach&#151;not least
those made by the hon. Member for Luton, North&#151;we have not even
got as our default position the fact that a human being also has
certain rights that carry through irrespective of their financial
circumstances at the start.
</div>
					<a name="08011787000506"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inevitably, those who
have money, if they live long enough and have those care needs for long
enough, will over time get down to the threshold and suddenly go from
private to public. If they are in the same setting, their complaints
procedure will suddenly move from a set of private avenues to a set of
public avenues under the arrangements. There is therefore a legitimate
point, which is causing
concern.</div>
					<a name="08011787000507"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000766"></a>Kelvin
Hopkins:
						</b> A number of us have for a long time supported the
concept of free long-term residential care, as recommended by the royal
commission. The Government have not accepted it. I do not think that
the Opposition have accepted it either. I have tabled two early-day
motions, and hope at some point to persuade the Government to do the
good, honest thing, because then all these problems would
disappear.</div>

						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure
that we all noted what he said, and we certainly know his long-standing
commitment in this area.</div>
					<a name="08011787000510"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may be unhelpful at this
point to seek to divide the Committee. I am tempted to do so, because
it would be an earnest expression of the Committee&#146;s intent. The
trouble is that it may put the matter into a more political sphere. If
anyone outside is taking any notice of what we are doing, I think that
this is the sort of issue which people would regard as being of such
key interest that we need to rise above party politics or
Government-bashing, or whatever it is.</div>
					<a name="08011787000511"></a><div class="hs_Para">I really do want to give the
Government and this Minister the benefit of the doubt. I hope, however,
that the earnest and sincere representations that have been made are
now going to be taken away by him and his officials and thought through
extremely carefully, because we have a right to expect something 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column350" />Column number: 350</div>constructive to appear on Report. It would be helpful if it were in the
Government&#146;s name, but we will also pursue this. To seek to
divide the Committee would inevitably put those on the Government
Benches in the embarrassing position of having to decide whether they
support their sentiment or their party. Rather than forcing the issue
in that way, I hope that I have set the context that makes my
withdrawal of the amendment possible. I have very high expectations
that the Minister will satisfy me and others at a later date. I beg

						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000775"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> I express my gratitude to Committee members
because we are staying slightly later than intended. However, I hope
that it is accepted that we have made pretty good cantering progress.
If we can get through this clause we will be able to conclude part 1,
which is a sensible
aim.</div>
					<a name="08011787000525"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope to
reassure Committee members because amendment No. 66, which for their
convenience appears rather late on in the whites&#151;the amendment
paper&#151;is extraordinarily long. However, I would not want anyone
to take fright, because the principle is clear and simple, and in our
drafting of that amendment we have attempted to ensure that we are
consistent.</div>
					<a name="08011787000526"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 47 makes every resolution in part 1 affirmative. Amendment No. 66
would do the same for the whole of the Bill by amending clause 150. If,
during our deliberations, Committee members notice any imperfections in
that drafting, I am sure that if we establish the principle the detail
can be tidied up and sorted out. However, we should seek to establish
the principle of what we are trying to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="08011787000527"></a><div class="hs_Para">In sum, a
quarter of the clauses in the Bill are dependent on regulations, which
is a very high proportion. First, we have to set that in the context of
how that fits with the Prime Minister&#146;s intention to strengthen
Parliament, given that regulations inevitably tend to receive rather
less detailed scrutiny than we can give to primary legislation. The
linking aspects of the Bill make the amendments and the clause
particularly relevant, because the effect of, for example, clause 39 is
to make every clause in chapter 2 a Henry VIII clause&#151;primary
legislation that can be amended by regulation. By every test, it is a
genuinely colossal power to put in the hands of the Secretary of State.
We have had several discussions about the impact of regulations on the
functions, which, if we remember, equates to the duties, as opposed to
the guidance and the code, of the CQC. The ability to approve
legislation by the affirmative procedure becomes all the more apt and
relevant&#151;not least to our accountability as
Members.</div>
				
					<a name="08011787000528"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 is one of the few
clauses that are already subject to the affirmative procedure, but I
hope that on Report the Minister does not have his own clause IV moment
and decide to change it, because that would be disastrous. It is
important therefore to recognise that, through clause 4, the Bill
contains a precedent for the affirmative procedure. The amendment is
important because it is procedural, and therefore always that much more
difficult to get one&#146;s arms around. It is also important because
we are trying to make the attitude of the Bill consistent. It helps
that clause 4 has set that precedent.</div>
					<a name="08011787000593"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div>
					<a name="08011787000529"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have also
had a long discussion on the regulations and codes of practice on
health care associated infections. I hope that those discussions will
be reflected in the legislation. The ability to do that is very much
assisted by adopting the scheme set out in these lengthy but
straightforward amendments.</div>
					<a name="08011787000530"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 66 stretches
beyond part 1. I forewarn the Minister, in case he is not aware of it,
that the Conservatives have been seeking to ensure that we 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column353" />Column number: 353</div>put true independence in place within both the bodies being created and
the regulation of health and social care professionals. I have grown
used to the idea that I may live in fear and trepidation that he will,
yet again, not give me the wonderful, unexpected joy of accepting my
amendment, but I hope that he does. If he does not accept the merit of
what I have just put forward, I need to reserve the right to attempt to
bring back specific regulatory powers and provisions in the Bill,
although it might have to be through separate amendments at a later
stage as it passes through our House and another place. I commend the
amendments to the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="08011787000531"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000776"></a>Mr.
Bradshaw:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman has said, clause 150 sets
out the arrangements for parliamentary control of the delegated powers
in the Bill and defines which powers will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure. They are set out in the clause, so I shall not
list them here. His amendment No. 47 would make all the delegated
powers in part 1 of the Bill, on the Care Quality Commission,
subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. Amendment No. 66 would
increase the number of delegated powers subject to the affirmative
procedure by 38. That is an unacceptably high increase and would place
an unacceptable burden on parliamentary time.</div>
					<a name="08011787000532"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are confident that both
clauses represent a sensible balance between the negative and
affirmative resolution procedures. They reflect the current situation.
We do not think that it would be sensible, for example, to move
regulation-making powers that the Healthcare Commission currently has
under the negative procedure to the affirmative, and we do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column354" />Column number: 354</div>think that it would be sensible or sustainable to make every delegated
power granted by Parliament subject to the affirmative
procedure. Given the limits of parliamentary time, it is necessary to
make some judgment as to which powers in the Bill are so crucial that
they warrant a higher level of scrutiny. That is what we are trying to
do.</div>
					<a name="08011787000533"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="08011787000777"></a>Mr.
O'Brien:
						</b> The Minister&#146;s answer has demonstrated
clearly that we are dealing with a matter of judgment. It is not
necessarily based on principled positions but more to do with the
capacity of the House as well as a normative approach. I am absolutely
sure that the reservation that I expressed earlier may be relevant, and
I shall continue to study the matter with some care, although it takes
an inordinate amount of work to do so. I suspect that we shall reserve
our position and mention later specific points on which we want the
affirmative resolution to apply, in addition to those for which it is
already provided in the Bill. Unless there is recognition of the need
for that, we are not really underpinning the Committee&#146;s
intention to ensure that there is genuine scrutiny of the independent
body. Instead, there will be scrutiny that is over-burdened by being
refracted through the Minister and his Department. We shall return to
the point in some form or another at a later stage. I beg to ask leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
