Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr.
Pat McFadden):</b> At the end of last week&#146;s sitting, I
was finishing my remarks on clause 1. Suffice it to say that, although
the Government have a number of issues with the clause, I hope that I
have outlined them in full.</div>
<a name="08052169000010"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000077"></a><b class="B">Andrew
Miller</b> (Ellesmere Port and Neston) (Lab): I beg to
move,</div><a name="08052169000056"></a><div class="hs_brev">That the
Committee do now
adjourn.</div><a name="08052169000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">After being
chaired by Mr. Hancock for two sittings, I now welcome you
to the Chair, Mr. Martlew. I propose that the Committee
adjourn in the light of the statements made yesterday by the Government
and the social partners, the CBI and the TUC. I am sure that all hon.
Members welcome the fact that there is an agreement on a way forward.
The agreement is ground-breaking. Members of the Committee who played a
part in it in one form or another should be proud of their
role.</div><a name="08052169000012"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank those
who have helped me from the trade union, Unite, in particular John
Usher the lawyer who acted on its behalf, and Clare Moody. They have
been incredibly helpful in forming my ideas on how to progress the
matter. When the Bill was discussed on Second Reading, I brought in a
couple of the big guns&#151;neither of whom are here today&#151;my
hon. Friends the Members for Lewisham, West and for Nottingham, East.
They did a fine job in helping me to maximise support for the Bill. I
thank my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Central and for
Aberdeen, North. As officers of the trade union group, they have worked
hard on the issue for several years, as, indeed, have other members of
the
Committee.</div><a name="08052169000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also thank all other members of the Committee who have contributed to
our discussions. Our exchanges have been important. From the outset,
the divisions between me and the Minister for Employment Relations and
Postal Affairs were on how we reach a solution, not whether we would
find one. I am absolutely delighted that he and his Department have
been party to such a ground-breaking agreement. The differences between
us and the official Opposition are more profound. There is clear blue
water between us. According to advice that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>I have received from our good Clerks, I hope that, by adjourning the
Committee, we can facilitate the formal process by which I shall
withdraw the Bill. The Government and the social partners can then get
on with finessing the deal that was made yesterday. Important steps
must clearly be taken in respect of the European process, and some
important domestic details have to be sorted out.</div>
<a name="08052169000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want to take up any
more of the Minister&#146;s time when I want him to focus on that
important task. With those few words, I beg to move the
motion.</div><a name="08052169000015"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000078"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The backdrop to the motion is
the agreement announced yesterday between the Government, the TUC and
the CBI on the future treatment of agency workers. The headlines have
been announced. I do not want to go through the whole agreement here;
suffice it to say that I am happy to make the text available. I believe
that it has been placed in the Library of the House; if not, I will
make sure that that happens. The headlines are that there is an
agreement that equal treatment shall be granted to agency workers
after 12 weeks in a job. Other clauses detail how that is
defined, how it is to be enforced and how disputes are to be resolved.
That is all set out in the agreement, and I will ensure that hon.
Members have access to the
text.</div><a name="08052169000016"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000079"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jonathan Djanogly</b> (Huntingdon) (Con): I thank the Minister
for saying that he will put a copy of the agreement in the Library. I
have not seen a copy, so it is difficult for me to comment on it, other
than in the broad terms that I used with the media, having
seen the media reports yesterday. I maintained at the start of
the Committee that I thought it should be adjourned straight away, so
it would be strange if I now changed my mind. The matter was always one
that should have been dealt with by the Government rather than Back
Benchers, and a large part of my complaint was that the Government were
not leading but were being led by their Back
Benchers.</div><a name="08052169000017"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000080"></a><b class="B">Tony
Lloyd</b> (Manchester, Central) (Lab): When the hon. Gentleman
says that the Government are not leading, does he include the CBI among
those rebels who are putting pressure on the Government? Does the fact
that the CBI is supportive of the agreement make any difference to the
so far seemingly hostile views of the Conservative
party?</div><a name="08052169000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000081"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> If the hon. Gentleman thought that the
Conservative party was the voice of the CBI in Parliament, perhaps
having seen my reaction yesterday he will reconsider that. The
Conservative party will take its own view, based on the soundings that
it takes from British business, which have been mixed to say the least.
The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is one to be elaborated on outside
the Committee, but I can assure him that we will be involved in that
debate over the coming months.</div>
<a name="08052169000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is right to adjourn the
Committee. The proper place for the debate is the Floor of the House.
It is a shame that the Government have seemingly decided not to make an
announcement on the Floor of the House. Perhaps the Minister will
reconsider that in due course, but for the moment we support the
motion.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div><a name="08052169000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000082"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): Along with the
hon. Member for Huntingdon, I welcome the adjournment. I attempted to
extract large portions of the Bill through the amendments that I
tabled, so I obviously think that the right way forward is that the
Government now produce legislation for us to debate. I hope that that
will be primary legislation, because of the implications for the
industry and for its flexibility. We welcome the tackling of the
problem of permatemps, which I referred to on several occasions in
Committee, but the Government must ensure that the flexibility of
workers and companies is not damaged through such
legislation.</div><a name="08052169000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
like to try to extract some information from the Minister about how the
legislation might work. Will a temporary person transfer to being a
company employee after 12 weeks? If so, will there be any compensation
provision for temporary agencies? How will the legislation prevent
employers from finishing a temporary contract after eleven and a half
weeks and then recruiting another temporary worker from the same or a
different agency? Will there be any provision for people who want, for
their own reasons, to remain on temporary
contracts?</div><a name="08052169000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
question, which I have raised before, concerns the Professional
Contractors Group, which supplies temporary workers at a premium
payment for their services. If we are talking about equality of pay and
basic conditions, how will the interests of temporary workers who
attract a premium for their services be addressed and those individuals
not be
disadvantaged?</div><a name="08052169000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
finding a comparator, the provisions within this Bill were convoluted,
to say the least. Will the Government be able to find a less
time-consuming and less tortuous route&#151;one that will
work&#151;to enable companies and agencies to work together in a
simple and straightforward way to find a suitable comparator? Finally,
will the Bill win agreement&#151;perhaps that was its purpose, as
well as appeasing the unions&#151;to an opt-out on the EU directive
on agency
workers?</div><a name="08052169000024"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000083"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Frank Doran</b> (Aberdeen, North) (Lab): I
want to say few words of congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston. He has fought the Bill through doggedly
and made a major contribution behind the scenes to the agreement
reached between the unions, the CBI and the Government. It is important
to record that and the work of the Minister in helping to reach that
agreement. There has been a significant amount of work, again not
always seen, but Labour Members know just how difficult it was to reach
that agreement, which is a good one. As I said in my contribution in
the previous sitting, that was unfinished business, and we are
beginning to see it finished. We look forward to the
Government&#146;s Bill once final agreement on the directive is
reached in Europe. I am grateful to the Minister for all his
work.</div><a name="08052169000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is also
important to record the contribution of the hon. Member for Huntingdon.
It is always interesting to hear shadow Ministers pump out the mantra
that the Prime Minister is being led by his Back Benchers, as that
mantra seems to be part of a co-ordinated smear campaign. It is useful
to record the history. The issue covered by the Bill has been around
for at least 10 years, and for six years in Europe, where there
has been ongoing debate about the directive and the direction that the
European partners should take. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>is all coming to a conclusion. What we have seen here is an example of
the way that employment issues should be resolved&#151;by partnership
and work between the social partners, with the Government facilitating
that to reach a conclusion. That is a healthy approach, because at the
end of the day it is the experts who have to put everything into
practice. The CBI, representing the major employers in the country, and
the unions, representing some 5 million workers, are the best people
with the experience. Anyone who thought much of the leader of the
Conservative party&#146;s attempts to paint the Tory party as
progressive should listen to the debate here and see that that is
nonsense.</div><a name="08052169000058"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45am</div><a name="08052169000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000084"></a><b class="B">Mrs.
Betty Williams</b> (Conwy) (Lab): I wish to
place on record my congratulations, and gratitude to, my hon. Friend
the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston on his hard work. One might
think that not a great deal happens outside these walls, but I am aware
that he has worked day and night to get where we are. What pleases me
very much about yesterday&#146;s announcement is that it is the
second announcement within a week that shows that the Government are
listening to Labour Back Benchers on major issues. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Aberdeen, North has said, it took six years of hard work
before my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston thought
fit to present this as his Bill. Therefore, I congratulate him and the
Government on the way that they have reacted to demands and requests
made by Labour Back Benchers on this
issue.</div><a name="08052169000027"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000085"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I join in the congratulations to my hon. Friend the
Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, because there is no doubt that
this private Member&#146;s Bill has focused debate on this important
issue not only in Parliament, but beyond the walls of this institution.
He deserves genuine credit for that, as does the Minister, who worked
on the issue long before the Bill came before the House.</div>
<a name="08052169000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon expressed almost astonishment that the Government
are moving in this direction, but it is important to recognise that the
Government made a clear commitment to regulate agency work many years
ago. That was a clear commitment in the public domain that became known
as the Warwick agreement, and that is no secret at all. It was not
something concocted by Labour Back Benchers.</div>
<a name="08052169000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I congratulate the hon. Member
for Huntingdon on one thing: at least he had the good grace to be
totally graceless in his approach. He displayed no sense of shame for
opposing this agreement, despite the fact that it has been brought
together by agreement between the different social partners. The CBI
matters because it is a major organisation that represents employers,
so it is rather interesting that the Conservative party is setting its
face against those major employers and their representative body. That
might be a signal for the future. I know that it is difficult for the
hon. Gentleman, from his position, to be clear and definitive on what
the Conservative party&#146;s position will be on that, but it is
probably no secret&#151;he might want to correct me if I am
wrong&#151;that it will fight tooth and nail to prevent any advance
in protection for vulnerable workers along the
lines&#151;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div><a name="08052169000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000086"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Could the hon. Gentleman stick to the
Bill?</div><a name="08052169000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000087"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I am referring to the protections that would have
been offered by the Bill, as you rightly remind me, Mr.
Martlew, because we saw that already in the debate on the Bill, and we
see it as a harbinger of the
future.</div><a name="08052169000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000088"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The point that we made was that the Bill does
not address vulnerable workers, but the equalisation of rights, which
we are opposed
to.</div><a name="08052169000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000089"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> That is very helpful, because we
seem to be making progress now. The official Opposition might be moving
in the direction of protection for vulnerable workers, so we will watch
this space with considerable
interest.</div><a name="08052169000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000090"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman really must read the House of
Lords <i class="I">Hansard</i> on the other place&#146;s consideration of the
Employment Bill, in which he will see that we have been in favour,
generally speaking, of protecting vulnerable workers&#146; rights, as
represented in that Bill. That, of course, was a Government Bill,
rather than a private Member&#146;s Bill, and I have given my reasons
before why we believe that that is the approach that should be
taken.</div><a name="08052169000035"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000091"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> That is even better. We now discover that the
official Opposition will support Government legislation to protect
vulnerable workers, which is marvellous. This has social partnership
written on it at almost every level. The CBI is on board with this, as
are the trade unions and the Labour party. Even the Conservative party
is on board with the principle of protecting agency workers, as would
have been brought forward by the Bill, had my hon. Friend the Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston not been seeking to adjourn this sitting.
Alas, the Liberal Democrats are not even in that position. The
expression &#147;appeasement to the trade
unions&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08052169000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000092"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman is still not talking
about the
Bill.</div><a name="08052169000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000093"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> I assumed that appeasement to the trade unions
would be relevant to the Bill, which still lies before the Committee,
Mr. Martlew. Although my hon. Friend the Member for
Ellesmere Port and Neston seeks to adjourn this sitting, he does not
seek at this moment to destroy the Bill. The Bill is the only vehicle
around which we can hold a debate. I hope that my remarks can be
construed as being about the Bill.</div>
<a name="08052169000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that
context the comments of the hon. Member for Solihull are quite
astonishing. When she talks about appeasement, it gives a real clue,
alas, as to where the Liberal Democrats stand on the protection for
vulnerable workers that my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port
and Neston was trying to advance. That is a shame. The Liberal
Democrats have a rather different tradition from the Conservatives on
this, but it is one which, under new management, they are now moving
away from. Perhaps it is worth having on the record the negative and
hostile view that the hon. Lady took of the Bill and of the protections
it sought to give.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="08052169000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000094"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> On no occasion did I say that the
Liberal Democrats are in any way opposed to the protection of
vulnerable workers. I said that the Bill, as it was constructed, was
not necessarily the best vehicle for the protection of vulnerable
workers and that great protections already existed if the Government
would only implement them.</div>
<a name="08052169000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000095"></a>Tony
Lloyd:</b> In that case, the hon. Lady might want to reflect
on her words about appeasement with the trade unions because they send
a signal away and beyond what she may have intended. She might want to
reflect on whether her choice of words was judicious because if it does
reflect Liberal Democrat policy towards the Bill and Bills like it, the
interpretation will be strong among those people whom she seeks to deny
these
protections.</div><a name="08052169000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will bring my remarks to a conclusion. It is important in a society
such as ours that Governments, certainly a Labour Government, offer
protections and recognise the signals given my hon. Friend in the Bill
that he has piloted so far through its various stages in the House.
Those signals were picked up by the Government and have echoed around
the country. They have brought a degree of consensus around this issue.
We may have the Conservatives coming in our direction, although clearly
not the Liberal Democrats yet, but in that sense it is a genuine
victory for the parliamentary process. All Members of Parliament should
take satisfaction from
that.</div><a name="08052169000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08052169000096"></a><b class="B">Ms
Dawn Butler</b> (Brent, South) (Lab): I will not keep the
Committee long. I, too, want to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the Minister on getting us to this
stage with the Bill. I also want to thank the TUC, the CBI, the trade
unions and especially my trade union, the GMB, for all the information
that they forwarded to me in relation to the Bill to ensure that we
moved forward in a cohesive way. I look forward to seeing rights for
agency workers, especially those who are low paid and vulnerable and
are often exploited.</div>
<a name="08052169000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to us pushing
the Bill forward. I also look forward to the debate and identifying the
dividing lines. It is quite correct that the Liberal Democrats sought
to remove large parts of the Bill, which would, in effect, have made it
almost meaningless. Therefore I look forward to having the debate on
the Floor of the House and looking at the dividing lines with the
Opposition, especially as I believe that the Leader of the Opposition
said that he, too, was in favour of protecting vulnerable workers.
Again, I thank my hon. Friend for bringing the Bill to our
attention.</div><a name="08052169000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000097"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am sure, Mr.
Martlew, that you will correct me if veer too widely. Throughout the
process, the Government have had two objectives. One was to secure fair
treatment for agency workers where there are issues of exploitation and
unfair treatment that are not fully covered by the current legal
regime. The second was to secure flexibility for UK employers because
the high employment rate of the country has been built on flexibility.
I believe that the agreement announced yesterday does that. It offers a
qualifying period twice as long as the one that the Government were
asked to sign up to in December and the possibility of local agreement
to go beyond that. The Government remain committed to securing an
opt-out not of the agency workers directive, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div>which the hon. Member for Solihull asked me about, but of the working
time directive. That is a different thing entirely, but also important
to flexibility.</div><a name="08052169000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should probably not go into too much more detail today, because I must
keep to the Bill. As I said in my opening remarks, I shall place a copy
of what was agreed yesterday in the Library so that it is available to
Members. I am sure that it will be much
debated.</div><a name="08052169000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000098"></a>Mrs.
Williams:</b> Can my hon. Friend assure me that following the
deliberations, pockets of the UK that rely heavily on the tourist
industry, which has historically relied on temporary and agency
workers, will be given special
attention?</div><a name="08052169000047"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000099"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This treatment of agency
workers is not intended to stop employers using agency workers, who are
an important part of the labour market. It will benefit agency workers
themselves and the flexibility will benefit employers. As I have said,
we were keen on flexibility. It does not mean that after 12 weeks, a
person will have to transfer to being a permanent employee, but simply
that their rights to equal pay will increase. The agency sector will
remain an important part of the labour market, but those who work in
it, especially those on the longer placements that have concerned us a
lot in our deliberations, will enjoy greater rights to equality of
treatment with those whom they work alongside. It has never been the
Government&#146;s intention to inhibit the flexibility that enables
agency work to be a valuable part of the labour
market.</div><a name="08052169000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000100"></a>Andrew
Miller:</b> I thank my colleagues for their kind remarks, but
this is not a victory for any one of us or, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div>as the hon. Member for Huntingdon seeks to portray it, for Labour rebels
against the Government. I do not think that I have yet rebelled against
the Government in the years that I have been
here.</div><a name="08052169000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000101"></a>Mr.
Doran:</b> Shame on
you.</div><a name="08052169000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08052169000102"></a>Andrew
Miller:</b> Shame, says my hon. Friend.</div>
<a name="08052169000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The true winners here are the
people who are exploited in our workplaces. This is a victory for
fairness in the workplace, for temporary and agency workers and for
those permanent staff who have suffered downward pressure on their
terms and conditions because of some employers&#146; exploitation of
people employed on an agency basis.</div>
<a name="08052169000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to my hon. Friend the
Minister with total sincerity, particularly following his response to
my hon. Friend the Member for Conwy, that there is a lot of expertise
on the Labour Benches on the detailed matters that need to be finessed
in the next few weeks and months. I am sure that every Labour member of
the Committee would welcome discussions with him about how to overcome
the tricky details that need to be dealt
with.</div><a name="08052169000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again, I
thank members of the Committee from both sides of the House, the Clerk
of the Committee, the Officers of the House who have served the
Committee and, of course, yourself, Mr. Martlew, and
Mr. Hancock for your tolerance. I hope that the Committee
will agree to
adjourn.</div><a name="08052169000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
