<P>
Amendment proposed [3 February]: No. 55, in page 2, line 17, after `4' to insert the words--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1) A regional development agency shall have the primary objective to further the achievement of sustainable development.'.--[Mr. Breed.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 60, in page 2, line 17, after `following', insert `additional'. No. 20, in page 2, line 26, leave out from `Kingdom' to end of line.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I do not think that the response to the amendments given by the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions was in any way satisfactory. She referred to commitments arising from the Kyoto conference and in the Labour party manifesto. Our attention was drawn to the way in which those commitments were reflected in the White Paper. That is exactly the point. As I explained on Tuesday, the White Paper gives an unequivocal commitment, without reservation, to sustainable development. I welcome that. But that same unequivocal, unqualified commitment has not been translated into the Bill, and I have therefore tabled amendments.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that sustainable development was being put on an equal footing with the other purposes, but that is not the case. The other purposes listed in clause 4 are not qualified. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to promote employment in its area . . . to further the economic development and the regeneration of its area''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is nothing about where it is relevant to an RDA's area. The clause makes it plain that those are the purposes of the regional development agencies. The Government have drawn a distinction by qualifying the sustainable development purpose.
<P>
To include paragraph (e) is an advance on legislation passed 10 or 20 years ago. The concept of sustainable development is more widely accepted and increasingly understood. It is against that background that I find it so disappointing that the Government have fallen at the last fence.
<P>
The Under-Secretary said that our concerns were ``unnecessary''. Then she said something about Mongolia. I am sorry that that argument has been introduced. It seems absurd. The point about
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where it is relevant | to do so''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is that the paragraph refers to sustainable development in the United Kingdom. Clearly, it will not be within the competence of RDAs to undertake actions which will promote sustainable development in Mongolia, because the clause expressly relates to the UK.
<P>
The Under-Secretary declined my suggestion that she might like to finger the Treasury as the source of the qualification. I gave a clear promise to the Committee that I would keep what she said private and would not blab to anyone, including the Paymaster General--if I happened to bump into him in some tax haven. Nevertheless, if she is unwilling to admit that the qualification has been included as a result of pressure from another Whitehall Department, it must follow that it has been included at the behest of her Department. That is a damning conclusion.
<P>
The backtracking of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions does not sit easily with the Secretary of State's fine words. Only yesterday, a DETR Minister talked at some length on the radio about sustainable development, saying that he wanted to consult widely with the public about how to achieve it into the next century. The left hand has no idea what the right is doing. In the very week when the Department is trumpeting sustainable development and involving the entire British public in it, Ministers are arguing against an amendment that would put into legislation precisely what another Minister said yesterday.
<P>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider. My amendment will not wreck the Bill; it will simply strengthen it by avoiding any downgrading of sustainable development. Arguably, there is no point in referring at all to sustainable development if the reference is qualified. We either sign up to it 100 per cent. or do not bother. The Bill bestows sweeping powers on various people and organisations--most notably the Secretary of State--and it is vital to define correctly the purposes of regional development agencies.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has not explained exactly what the Government had in mind when they included the qualification. Where will sustainable development not be relevant? If the Under-Secretary cannot answer that, I cannot see why she is resisting the amendment. Will she tell us whether the ``area'' in clause 4(1)(e) is geographical or functional? That is also unclear.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> It may help the Committee if I explain once again that the Government intend sustainable development to be at the core of regional development agencies' activities. The purposes of the RDAs are not mutually exclusive, as some hon. Members have suggested. Nor are they ranked in any way that is detrimental to sustainable development. In an earlier debate, the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry) rightly pointed out that there is some overlap in the purposes. We have made no attempt to rank them in terms of importance or to define each purpose completely separately.
<P>
Sustainable development can be looked at in two ways. It is one of the five purposes of the RDAs and will inform the agencies' actions on the other four purposes where sustainable development is involved. It will also enable the agency to act independently on sustainable development even where such action would not fall under any of the other four purposes. The provision was drafted as an enabling factor.
<P>
The two qualifications to the purpose of sustainable development, which have caused such suspicion, are that action should contribute to sustainable development in the United Kingdom and should be relevant to the agency's area. Those qualifications have worried the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo), and I hope that I can reassure him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not concerned about the reference to the UK. That deals helpfully with an earlier worry. I am concerned at the remaining phrase,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where it is relevant to its area to do so.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> In that case I shall concentrate my efforts on reassuring the hon. Gentleman about that qualification, which, in practice, will have an effect only in relation to the not-in-the-UK qualification. We shall therefore leave that aside.
<P>
Against that background, let us consider the effect of the purpose when it is used independently of the other purposes of RDAs. If we removed the qualification
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``where it is relevant to its area''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as the amendment would, we would allow RDAs--indeed, give them a duty--to take action contributing to sustainable development that is not relevant to their area, which is not sensible. RDAs are designed to take action that is relevant to their particular area, rather than action that is relevant only to the rest of England, or of the United Kingdom, or indeed the rest of the world.
<P>
On the other hand, a qualification that would limit RDAs to action within their regions only would be too restrictive. There may be projects, such as the improvement of transport links between the west midlands and Wales, for which action outside the region would be relevant to sustainable development within the region. Limiting RDAs to action that is physically within their regions would jeopardise such projects, and make RDAs less able to fulfil their core duty of promoting sustainable development, because such development does not always stop at the regional border.
<P>
We are attempting to be as flexible as possible and to work out a way in which sustainable development remains relevant, but which allows cross-border activities among RDAs. Problems such as climate change and the hole in the ozone layer are relevant to the world as a whole; action anywhere in the world can be said to affect other places in the world. However, that is the international approach.
<P>
By including the qualification, we are attempting to give--and, I believe, succeeding in giving--RDAs flexibility both ways. We are not restricting them to their areas in some circumstances. We are not giving them a duty to behave with a sustainable development aim within their areas only.
<P>
We are therefore ensuring the opposite of what the hon. Member for South Suffolk fears: we are attempting to give RDAs the flexibility that they need to act across borders when necessary. I realise that that is a rather convoluted answer, but I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman about our intentions.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the clarification about cross-border sustainable development; it is not how I interpreted the Bill as drafted.
<P>
However, I am still worried both that my confusion may not be an isolated case, and about the inclusion of the qualifying phrase for the fifth objective of sustainable development. With my slightly more suspicious mind, I am fearful that those who do not have the interests of sustainable development at heart--perhaps for the sound reason that they have economic development as a higher priority--may find in that qualifying phrase a way round it.
<P>
I am in favour of amendment No. 20, which would remove that qualifying phrase because I believe that that would resolve the confusion. Whereas on page 17 of the White Paper it is made clear that the five purposes are of equal importance, the phrase ``equal importance'' is lost in the Bill as drafted.
<P>
No one can deny that there are inherent tensions among the five purposes. There are many examples of that. In my constituency, we have the regional attribute of Birmingham international airport, which was built primarily for the purposes of economic development and regional regeneration. In terms of the locality, that piece of economic development has some questionable implications for sustainability. Greenbelt land was used, and continues to be absorbed, which is defended on the ground of economic development. The danger of giving the purposes equal weighting is that it will be difficult to resolve the tension between sustainable development and economic development. I impress on the hon. Lady that the phrase at the end of paragraph (e) undermines the fifth purpose of sustainable development and may be used by those who want to give it a lower priority. In view of planning decisions that have been made without the sustainable aspect of development so much in mind, we need to be even more forceful if we want the RDA to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. To relegate sustainable development to an equal purpose is to risk its being a lower priority for those who seek to develop the region.

<P>

<B>Angela Eagle:</B> This debate is becoming very convoluted. One minute the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) seemed to be saying that she accepts that these purposes should be given equal weight in the Bill; then she said that sustainable development was being relegated to an equal place; and then she was worried that economic development, if the two can be separated--I do not accept that they can be--would have primacy. That is a great deal of primacy with a great deal of equality at the same time. I fear that we are becoming rather confused.
<P>
If we remove the phrase ``relevant to its area'' from the Bill, each RDA would have a duty to take actions contributing to sustainable development that is not relevant to its area. By putting in the qualification, as the hon. Member for Meriden calls it, we are saying that sustainable development must be relevant to its area but not restricted geographically to it, as I explained earlier. That is the best legal balance to capture what we want the RDAs to do. It is a difficult balance.
<P>
Our legal understanding is that the amendment would give each English RDA the duty to achieve sustainable development everywhere else as well as in its area. The qualification is there because we want each RDA to focus on sustainable development objectives in its area, but that focus is not confined purely to its area; where it is relevant because of the nature of sustainable development, say in the transport example that I gave earlier, we want to give it flexibility. I hope that the hon. Lady will be reassured by that information--the words are the best way to achieve the ideals of sustainable development at English regional level.
<P>
Mr. Yeo
<P>
: We have probably pursued this point as far as we can at this stage. Opposition Members will want to study the Under-Secretary's words carefully to try to fathom what they amount to. In the light of that, it would be best if we left open to Report the possibility of returning to the question of how to strengthen the Bill's commitment to sustainable development.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 2, line 28, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and its funding allocations shall reflect this.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments No. 83, in page 2, line 28, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) In pursuing these purposes, a regional development agency shall have regard to any effect that its proposed actions would have on the economic and social well-being of local communities in rural areas.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 84, in page 2, line 28 at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(3) In pursuing these purposes, a regional development agency shall foster the economic and social well-being of local communities in rural areas.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I apologise to the Committee for the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) cannot be here today and that I cannot be here for the whole of this morning's sitting. I understand that any amendments in our names that are reached in our absence will therefore fall. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted to know that.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> Ecstatic!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I though he would be. I apologise for that, but something else has come up which is not avoidable. I am pleased that the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A regional development agency's purposes apply as much in relation to the rural parts of its area as in relation to the non-rural parts of its area.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have previously discussed the concerns of people in rural areas that the economic need for regeneration of urban areas will take precedence, and that the special needs of rural areas may not be dealt with appropriately. I think we all agree that it is vital that RDAs do not become urban-oriented, with the possible exception of London, which, I understand, will have few rural parts attached to it.
<P>
We are worried about the demise of the Rural Development Commission, and we are concerned about what will happen to its budget, especially that part of its budget allocated to research and advice in relation to rural areas. It is too easy for a regional development agency in a mixed area to concentrate on the more obvious and larger problems of urban poverty and deprivation than on the often hidden pockets of rural poverty that exist in many of our constituencies. The amendment expresses the fact that we believe that the funding allocations to RDAs should reflect rural, as well as non-rural, parts of their areas.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Undeterred by the Committee's rebuff to our earlier attempts to enhance the consultation process regarding board appointments to RDAs, I take this opportunity to return to the very important and largely unanswered question of how the agencies will serve rural communities.
<P>
We received a warning on Tuesday from the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning that some of the staff of the Rural Development Commission face continued uncertainty about their job prospects. That only reinforces the more general anxieties that RDAs are urban-based bodies, whose staff are drawn from urban backgrounds, and so they will have an urban focus. We remain anxious to find opportunities to redress that mistaken imbalance, and if we amend the Bill in the way proposed by amendments Nos. 83 and 84, we will ensure that the potential damage to rural communities is minimised or, preferably, eliminated.
<P>
The wording of subsection (2) and its inclusion in the Bill is recognition by the Government of the depth of anxiety that is rightly felt in rural areas about the Government's lack of interest in their future. Its inclusion almost seems to reflect a sense of guilt on the part of the Government about some of the concerns that have been expressed by the Opposition in Committee and during the Second Reading debate. The wording of subsection (2) appears to have been cobbled together to create a different impression.
<P>
I welcome the fact that such a provision has been included in the Bill--
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Yes, it is progress, as the Minister says, but the wording could be improved. All the amendments that have been tabled, by both Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members, are genuine attempts to improve the Bill. I am not a fan of the universal imposition of regional development agencies, but if we are to have them, let us make them as good as possible.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 83 and 84 are designed to help the Government to demonstrate their good intentions--if they have such intentions--towards rural areas. The amendments provide an opportunity to put tangibly into effect aims that I suspect--and the Minister will confirm it--the Government to have, which have not yet been sufficiently clarified in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about the depths of anxiety and a sense of guilt. Conservatives should parade their guilt for the state to which they have reduced the countryside during the past 18 years. I have toured the countryside with members of the Rural Development Commission who are extremely anxious that RDAs should deliver effectively in rural areas, where 80 per cent. of activity falls on the non-farming side of the farm gate and 20 per cent. is farming.
<P>
Many of the rural areas that I have visited have exactly the same problems as my constituency, stemming from unemployment. The most devastating cause of the isolation of the rural communities was the Conservatives' deregulation of the bus system. I have met many victims of the negative policies enacted over the past 18 years. We are trying to rectify that situation in a collected way. I hope to allay genuine anxieties by putting the progressive policies of the Bill on to the statute book.
<P>
I understand the intent of amendment No. 4 better than the amendment itself. Its phrasing does not make it clear whether the allocation referred to is that provided by the Government or those which RDAs make to other organisations. The need for the amendment is also unclear. Allocation of funds is part and parcel of the way in which RDAs give effect to their purpose, so to say that allocation reflects the fact--acknowledged in the Bill--that an RDA's purposes apply as much to the rural parts of its area as the non-rural parts adds nothing to the Bill.
<P>
We have carefully considered how to express our commitment that RDAs will have a specific remit to serve the rural areas of their regions. Singling out rural areas for special treatment would be interpreted to mean that RDAs were to favour rural areas at the expense of non-rural areas, and that is not our intention. Some regions--especially the south-west where Plymouth, Exeter and Bristol made strong representations--are concerned that rural areas will dominate their RDAs. I have had to allay their fears. We intend there to be a level playing field.
<P>
We aim to ensure that rural and non-rural areas are treated equitably according to their needs, and that RDAs will not become urban-centred bodies that neglect the needs of their rural areas. We do not seek to give rural areas primacy over urban and suburban areas.
<P>
The White Paper said that local regeneration initiatives of the kind promoted by the Rural Development Commission will be an equally high priority for the RDAs. The Government's strong commitment to rural regeneration will continue to be reflected in RDA funding for rural areas. We intend to make a separate allocation of funds to RDAs for rural regeneration. The Bill provides the Government with sufficient powers of direction and control to ensure that RDAs do not neglect rural areas, although I do not believe that that will be a danger. The RDAs will want to establish themselves as genuinely regional organisations and show that they recognise the interdependence of town and country and the special needs of both rural and urban areas.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 83 is modelled on a similar requirement placed on the Environment Agency by the Environment Act 1995. While it was a reasonable requirement to place on a body primarily concerned with environmental regulation rather than economic or social development, it was not appropriate for RDAs, which have economic development and regeneration among their primary purposes. In performing their functions in rural areas, they will naturally have regard to the needs of communities in rural areas because the development and regeneration of such areas are included among their functions.
<P>
The amendment can be interpreted only as placing a further requirement on RDAs--that in making any proposals for non-rural areas they should have particular regard to the effect on rural areas. For example, before spending any money in urban areas, RDAs would have to consider whether that money could instead be spent in urban rural areas, which would effectively have a prior claim on resources.
<P>
Amendment No. 84 goes further by stating explicitly that in pursuing all their purposes RDAs would have a positive duty to foster the economic and social wellbeing of local communities in rural areas. Clearly, that could be done only at the expense of other areas. I do not believe that that is what hon. Members want and I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the Minister for his reply. I agree with some of what he said, especially his surprise at the conversion of the Conservatives to the realisation that, first, government may have a role to play because the market cannot cure all social ills and problems and, secondly, that rural poverty exists and it is necessary to do something about it. I suppose that we should welcome repentant sinners.
<P>
I hope that the Minister understands that one reason for believing that rural areas may lose out when the RDAs are set up is anxiety about the future of the half of the Rural Development Commission's funding that will not go directly to RDAs. We hope that we shall soon know what will happen to that funding and that it will be ring-fenced so that it will continue to be used to enhance the rural economy and for research and advice for rural areas.
<P>
I accept the Minister's assurance that Government funding will reflect the balance and that the interdependence of rural and urban areas is recognised. In the debate that has been raging for the past few months about wider countryside issues, it has worried me that many people speak as if country and town never meet and do not need each other.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I want to put the matter into perspective in terms of financing. The RDC's total budget is about &#163;40 million, of which approximately &#163;25 million is for regeneration. That pales into insignificance in terms of the single regeneration budget because approximately &#163;200 million has been allocated to bids from rural areas under the first three rounds of the challenge fund--about 7 per cent. of the total. The SRB will be part of the RDA because social exclusion must be addressed and that is important to rural areas that that is considered within a holistic framework in terms of the RDA strategy. The amounts are relatively small compared with the SRB. When objective five, which covers structural funds, is coupled with that, it can be seen that the key is the skill of the RDC staff to use a relatively small amount of money to lever in other money. Our proposal for the RDAs gives greater importance to that facility than when it was on the outside.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I thank the Minister for his intervention. I am sure that he will accept that some interest, if not concern, remains about the &#163;15 million that was not accounted for.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is national.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Bearing the Minister's comments in mind, we should like to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister referred to the state of the countryside as if it were in danger. The danger to the countryside arose in the past nine months. Most of the countryside is still there, but one wonders for how much longer.
<P>
I was glad to hear from the Minister that he had had to see the Prime Minister on Tuesday afternoon during the Committee's proceedings. I wonder whether the purpose of the meeting was to discuss a U-turn in the Government's planning policy for the countryside. There may be some belated recognition of just how disastrous a series of recent planning decisions has been. There may be recognition that the campaign launched by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition on Monday has struck a deep chord with rural dwellers across the country. The Minister will know that his decisions are systematically wrecking the green belt and directly threatening rolling areas of counties such as West Sussex.
<P>
The Minister acknowledged that the wording of amendments Nos. 83 and 84 was lifted directly from the legislation that set up the Environment Agency. I recall that that section had the active support of the then Labour Opposition. However, the Minister rather blew the gaff when he said that it was relevant to include those commitments in that legislation but not in the Bill, which is apparently about economics, not the environment. At least that is all of a piece with what the Under-Secretary said in the previous debate. It confirms the earlier line that environmental considerations are of secondary importance to the Government in dealing with regional development agencies. We shall certainly study with interest the Minister's words--now on record--before Report. We will return to this issue as well as to the environmental issues then.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my meeting with the Prime Minister on Tuesday had nothing to do with U-turns. In fact, it is difficult to establish exactly where the loyal Opposition stand on the issue of green belts and the environment. In terms of targets for house building on brown fields, when they were in Government they aimed for 50 per cent. but achieved only 42 per cent. They subsequently moved to 75 per cent., but were pulled back by their leader to 60 per cent. The final announcement, earlier this week, was of a target of two thirds. When the Opposition have finally decided on a figure, it would be useful if they would inform the House and the country. Over nine months, their movement on the issue has been phenomenal.
<P>
The reason that I provided for saying that amendments Nos. 83 and 84 should be withdrawn still stands. It is logical and reasonable. Now that the hon. Gentleman has heard my explanation, I hope that he will understand it and comply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I had hoped to conclude this debate now, but the Minister persists, however unintentionally, in misleading the Committee so I must put two further questions to him. Will he confirm that the 42 per cent. figure relates to a 10-year period--the achievement over the decade 1987 to 1997? Will he confirm that in no other sector do statistics deal with a 10-year average? For example, we do not regard the gross domestic product in 1997 as the average of what was achieved between 1987 and 1997; it is what was achieved in 1997. Is it not misleading to give the statistic of 42 per cent. and to imply that it shows what had been achieved by the end of the previous Governments term? The figure of 50 per cent. relates to what had been achieved at the end; the 42 per cent. figure that the Minister relied on is an average for the decade.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Touchy, aren't you?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to get the facts on the record. The reason that the percentage for the decade is lower than the other figure is that there was a rising trend. In the mid-1980s the percentage was only 38 per cent. As a result of the Conservative Government's determination to protect the green belt and the countryside, it rose to 50 per cent. Those are the facts that I want the Minister to confirm.
<P>
The relevant election pledge was a figure of more than 60 per cent. The Minister can read the manifesto from cover to cover and will find nothing about 75 per cent. His ministerial colleague referred to a figure of more than 50 per cent. as a recipe for disaster. That is clearly the basis on which the Government's policy has been developed. Will the Minister confirm that the 42 per cent. figure relates to a whole decade, not to what was achieved in 1997?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not want to bandy statistics around, but I will say this for the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> You raised it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I was asked.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Hon. Members appear to be straying from the amendment. Perhaps the Committee will return to that subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely; therefore, I have nothing further to add.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> May I place it on record that the figure of 42 per cent. was quoted by the Minister when he responded to my remarks on the clause? I want the figure to be stated correctly. The Minister implies that 42 per cent. was a figure applicable to matters as they stood in 1997. I have explained that it was applicable to the decade from 1987 to 1997. It is fair to ask the Minister to confirm that he was wrong and I am right.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall leave that in the hands of the Minister, but I repeat my earlier ruling that we are straying from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor: </B>(North-West Leicestershire): As a matter of clarification, if there was a rising trend in the 1980s, would not that most probably reflect the fact that the then party of Government was steadily extricating itself, with respect to its finance, from the sphere of landowners and property developers and moving steadily into the hands of foreign millionaires and far eastern drug dealers? It was thus able to turn its attention to the green belt.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Gentleman will live to regret saying that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I take your guidance on the matter, Mr. Benton, and will not prolong my comments. The information that we gave to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on Tuesday was accurate and what was said at Prime Minister's Question Time clearly upset the Opposition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Committee knows that I have already expressed concern about the basing of the regional development agencies policy on statistics that are already five years out of date. We have now heard another example of the Minister deliberately misleading the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Mr. Benton, I--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must ask the hon. Member for South Suffolk to withdraw that remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am happy to withdraw it, provided that the Minister confirms that the figure is what I said it was.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Again, I must ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the remark.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I withdraw the word ``deliberately'', but I am clear about the fact that the Minister is misleading the Committee.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sorry. I am asking, from the Chair, for an unqualified withdrawal of that remark.
<P>
<B>Mr Yeo:</B> Naturally, if that is your guidance, Mr. Benton, I withdraw it. I place on record the fact that the relevant figure was 50 per cent. The Minister was telling us that it was 42 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the table on page 12. I do not believe that he questioned its accuracy, but he was worried about the date. The Department has gone to some lengths to provide all the available facts and figures to date. I wrote to the hon. Member for South Suffolk on 31 January to ensure that he received up-to-date information. Other members of the Committee also received the letter. The hon. Gentleman's comments are a slur not against me, a professional politician, but against officials, who would not distort facts and figures. As the hon. Gentleman knows, they are professionals. We have considered the provision carefully. The hon. Gentleman needs to apologise not to me but to my officials, who work hard to ensure that the Committee receives up-to-date information. The hon. Gentleman slighted the officials, not me.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have demonstrated sufficient largesse. We should now return to the amendment. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) asked leave to withdraw the amendment. The hon. Member for South Suffolk spoke after that. Therefore, I must put the amendment to the Committee.
<P>
Amendment negatived.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ben Chapman </B>(Wirral, South): I will not detain the Committee, but I wish to make a few comments on rural issues.
<P>
Earlier in our proceedings, the hon. Member for South Suffolk questioned the cohesion of the north-west region, by asking what Cumbria and the Wirral had in common. As I was born in rural Cumbria and represent the Wirral in Parliament, I am qualified to speak about that. The answer is that they have quite a lot in common. They both contain areas of deprivation and areas of prosperity. They both have a coastal industrial belt and substantial areas of farming. As a Cumbrian, I chaired rural challenge for Cumbria for the Rural Development Commission. Therefore, I speak with some knowledge of rural areas and especially of Rural Development Commission interests.
<P>
Rural areas are more than happy that regional development agencies will place rural and urban areas on the same footing. That will happen for the first time. Contrary to what the posturing of the Opposition might suggest, the Bill does not abolish the RDA's regeneration, enterprise and diversification roles; it attempts to integrate them. As the White Paper says, rural needs and institutions may be different, but many of the concerns are common. The Bill seeks to integrate rural and urban interests. The White Paper and the Bill have widespread support in rural and urban areas in the north-west, especially in Cumbria. I sense none of the anxieties in rural areas that the hon. Member for South Suffolk spoke of. They are a myth.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> I make a point of clarification. On Tuesday, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister provided the information that has been the subject of debate today. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Tory party manifesto refers to 60 per cent. for brown-field areas, the consultation document says 50 per cent., both the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) have said that it should be 75 per cent. and a meeting of the shadow Cabinet a few days ago appears to have changed the figure to 66 per cent. However, the record of the Conservatives when in office, over their last 10 years was 42 per cent.''--[Official Report, 3 February 1998; Vol. 305, c. 826.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. That has nothing to do with the clause. Will the hon. Member please stick to the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I would like to make a brief reference to the value of the Co-operative movement in achieving the aims of the Bill. I am pleased that the movement was mentioned in the White Paper, particularly on pages 21 and 49. I am a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament and I strongly believe that the co-operative sector can contribute greatly to the Bill's objectives. I hope the Minister agrees with me and that he will comment on the sector's contribution. Co-operatives are committed regional stakeholders; they advocate, utilise and are beacons of local democracy.
<P>
Concerns were expressed earlier about the alleged lack of accountability and of democracy, and co-operatives are living examples of what can be done to improve such matters. I hope that Co-operative business support and development, delivered by specialists, will be discrete elements of the business development strategy for each region, within the framework of the regional development agencies.
<P>
My second point relates to community economic development, which is explained on page 21 of the White Paper. I am pleased to note the value that it accords to the role of the Co-operative movement, as the promotion of co-operative structures and employee ownership is vital to community economic development. It is entirely compatible with the objectives of the RDA; it adds a valuable dimension by taking a bottom-up approach to local economic development.
<P>
It was alleged, that a top-down, Whitehall-driven approach is being proposed, but the co-operatives rebut that charge. They are a targeted means of attacking social exclusion. I hope that the promotion by the RDAs of employee ownership, in the form of co-operative development, will be a chief part of their activities and that as in the east midlands, in my constituency and in the rest of Leicestershire, co-ops will continue to make a vibrant contribution to regional economies. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reaction to what I have said.
<P>
<B>Dr. Doug Naysmith </B>(Bristol, North-West): I support what my hon. Friend said about the important part that co-operatives should play in RDA-associated development.
<P>
One of the Bill's aims is to influence and expand the local economy. Employee ownership of enterprises, especially co-operative initiatives, are a recognised way of keeping investment local. Although it will remain important to attract new investment to a region, the maintenance and development of existing economic capital is crucial. Employee owners are local owners and their commitment to a locality is tangible.
<P>
It is important to learn from the past. Frequent references have been made to the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies as models. The Scottish Development Agency Act 1975 and similar legislation for Wales included promoting industrial democracy, a function that the agency controlled. This is a different sort of Bill, but many people have said that the agencies created by the 1975 legislation should be a model for this Bill.
<P>
Promotion of industrial democracy by means of co-operatives and co-operative development should be part of the RDAs' activities. Co-ops, in turn, will continue to make a vibrant contribution to our regional economy. I hope that the Minister will confirm my belief that such activities should form a significant part of the projects promoted by RDAs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman), whose contribution brought some sanity to the discussion of the rural element. He brings to the debate a gravitas that seems to have been lacking on the Opposition Benches. It is extremely valuable that somebody who has been at the coal face can share his knowledge and experience with us. We can take reassurance from that that we are moving in the right direction, moving forward, leaving behind the negatives of the last 18 years and looking to a much brighter future--I congratulate my hon. Friend.
<P>
My hon. Friends the Members for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor) and for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) referred to the Co-operative movement, and it is apt that these points have been raised on clause 4, which relates to rural areas. With the approach that the RDAs will take in relation to community economic development, the rural areas will be given a new lease of life. On the continent of Europe, co-operatives and community economic developments have been encouraged, not discouraged, as happened here over the past 18 years. That has assisted their rural areas tremendously, and they are now greater per capita contributors to GDP and to wealth creation. Indeed, that is what we want. We want to get people off welfare and into work; we want them to be part of the real economy, so that they feel a sense of identity and of contributing, instead of being left in isolation in the rural areas, as they were under the policies, particularly the transport policies, put on the statute book by the previous Administration.
<P>
I am a great supporter of the Co-operative movement. My dear mother, who is 82 years of age, was a director of the movement for many years, and people say it is in the blood. I used to know what my divi number was, but I cannot remember it now. If Opposition Members had taken any notice of the Co-operative movement in the United Kingdom and used that for the rural areas in a positive rather than a negative way, they would probably have got more Members elected for the rural areas at the last election than they did.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have been a little generous in allowing new Members particularly to speak on matters beyond the clause. That is the last of my largesse. I ask all hon. Members to stick to the amendments.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 4 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Powers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 2, leave out lines 38 to 40.
<P>
I am glad that our debate on clause 5 will follow so directly and immediately on our debates on clause 4--that does not always happen--because we have had an opportunity to explore the purposes. It is interesting that the clause does not set out many things that the RDAs can do: it is quite limited. There is no mention, for example, of acquiring derelict land, perhaps cleaning it up and making it available for industrial or commercial development. That is the kind of thing that one might expect an RDA to do in pursuit of these purposes.
<P>
We can link that omission to Ministers' refusal on more than one occasion in responding to our amendments to include in the Bill many aspects of RDAs which they have assured us they entirely agree with. One example is consultation with representatives of rural interests which, although not to be included in the Bill despite our best efforts, is apparently something that Ministers intend to do. Another example relates to limits on the length of service of RDA board members, although those limits are not included in the Bill, either. A third example is that an RDA board member with a declarable interest will, under certain circumstances, be allowed to vote on matters that affect that interest; we have been assured that an explanation would be provided under normal circumstances, but that commitment is not enshrined in the Bill.
<P>
Despite the Government's reluctance to include those things, we suddenly find in subsection (3)--

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman but can he confine himself to the amendment? He seems to be dealing with the whole of clause 5. The amendment relates only to the removal of subsection (3). Will the hon. Gentleman keep to that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Indeed I will, Mr. Benton. I was merely trying to establish that Ministers have mentioned many things that RDAs will do but have said that it is not necessary to include those things in the Bill. Subsection (3), however, includes something at least as specific as matters proposed in amendments that have been rejected. What, then, are we to make of the inclusion of a particular function when so many others have not been included?
<P>
Subsection (3) singles out housing. There is nothing about providing factories, which one might expect RDAs to be involved in. There is nothing about offices, opportunities to clean up contaminated land, training or business advice. Only housing is singled out. Given the importance that Ministers have attached to not cluttering the Bill with too much detail, they must consider a function that they have included extremely important.
<P>
I look forward to hearing why RDAs will have an important role in housing, a role not featured prominently in the White Paper. What aims will RDAs fulfil by acquiring housing? For what purpose will housing be needed? Is it for board members? Is it for Treasury Ministers who do not have a tax haven to go to for their holidays? Is it for the staff of the RDAs? What is the housing for? There is no clue in the White Paper. There was no clue on Second Reading. Will the Minister explain why subsection (3) has been included and under what circumstances and for what purpose housing will be provided?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Curry </B>(Skipton and Ripon): May I make a point about our proceedings, Mr. Benton? When the Minister stands up, the glare from the window behind him obscures his face. I realise that this may be an idiosyncratic complaint, but if he were to sit a little way down the Room, I would have the benefit of being able to see him--[Interruption.]--a benefit, despite the ties he wears. [Interruption.] No, let us keep the light, but I am sure that the Minister is perfectly capable of speaking without close proximity to his officials.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> In the 14 years since I arrived in the House of Commons, I have spent many hours wanting to sit at this end of the Room, where Ministers have sat since time immemorial. Now that I have finally arrived, the hon. Gentleman wants me to move down the other end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I wish it only because I want the pleasure of looking at the Minister. I realise that that is an idiosyncratic and incomprehensible request.
<P>
Amendment No. 47 relates to clause 5(3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A regional development agency may only provide''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I want to know what ``provide'' means--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``housing by acquiring existing''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
note that word ``existing''--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``housing accommodation and making it available on a temporary basis for purposes incidental to its purposes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A magazine produced by the National Housing Federation has the Minister's face, and an even worse tie, on the front page. It poses the rhetorical question:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Will the RDAs deliver on housing?''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer, according to the article, is ``No''. Although the Minister may not have written the article, he put his name to it. In it he boasts--accurately--that the single regeneration budget and English Partnerships provide housing. He says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Although RDAs will not be housing bodies, they will inherit the regional regeneration roles of English Partnerships . . . and the administration of the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund, both of which play an important role in housing. English Partnerships is delivering major housing projects within existing urban areas, leading to enhanced quality of life through high standards of design and build. In 1996-97, for example, the agency helped provide 5,200 . . . units across England.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will the RDA, via the regeneration projects that it will take over, build houses? At the moment, the single regeneration budget is capable of refurbishing and providing houses, and English Partnerships ensures that derelict land has development potential for housing. Those functions are carried out with the single regeneration budget. Indeed, housing lobbies have always said that housing should be a large component of that work. But subsection (3) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A regional development agency may only provide housing by acquiring existing . . . accommodation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Do we face a fundamental shift in the thrust of regeneration policy? Will the Minister explain what the role will be? What he says in his article contradicts what is stated in the clause. What is the meaning of the word ``provide'' in this context? What is meant by ``acquiring existing housing accommodation''? Will RDAs be able to sponsor or lend funds through development regeneration programmes to provide housing in urban sites as part of a comprehensive regeneration programme? Those are important questions--I hope that the Minister, whether or not he is a blur to me, will be able to explain.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> There has been a little confusion about the effects of the clause, and I am getting confused by the hon. Member for South Suffolk. One minute he is fulminating about powerful, unelected quangos being set up all over the land, and the next minute he is complaining that they do not have enough powers. He should decide on one objection and apply it consistently.
<P>
RDAs may do anything that is expedient to their purposes. That approach underlies all their powers. It is consistent with our argument that we do not want long lists of functions or prescriptive lists of how RDAs ought to behave and conduct their business included in the Bill. Perhaps the hon. Member for South Suffolk will realise that the parts of clause 5 to which his amendments refer provide exclusions from the basic approach that RDAs may do anything expedient for their purposes.
<P>
Clause 5 determines the extent of the RDA's powers. It ensures in general that powers are wide enough for them to do anything that they consider expedient for their purposes as set out in the Bill. But the Bill places certain limitations on general powers. Clause 5(2) provides that RDAs may only
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``give financial assistance . . . dispose of land for less than the best consideration . . . or acquire an interest in, a body corporate''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
with the consent of the Secretary of State. Clause 5(3) provides that RDAs
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may only provide housing by acquiring existing housing accommodation and making it available on a temporary basis for purposes incidental to its purposes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall explain to the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon what that means.
<P>
The purpose of clause 5(3) is to ensure that RDAs can only facilitate the development and regeneration of housing, such as by site assembly, or acquire existing housing to accommodate, for example, their own relocated staff on a temporary basis. Those are the areas within which the powers can be exercised.
<P>
I am surprised that Opposition Members are not aware of that, because the same powers exist in the legislation that set up English Partnerships. There are no implications for the way in which the SRB challenge or any other regeneration funds are used. Housing is not built and then owned and run by any of the SRB schemes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Why, in that case, does the clause use the verb ``provide'' instead of ``own''? If the clause had stated that an RDA may own housing only by acquiring it on a transient, temporary basis, we would know what it meant. What does ``provide'' mean? Housing can be provided--and that may include facilitation--by helping to make it available to people. The word is confusing and if the Government amended it, the provision would be clearer and the problem would be solved.
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> The situation is clear. It is not the intention of the Bill to enable RDAs to become direct providers, owners or servicers of houses. Other agencies do that perfectly well. Amendment No. 47 would remove that restriction from the Bill and give RDAs the power to undertake housing developments as if they were local authorities, and to become large-scale landlords if that was consistent with their general purposes. I am at a loss to understand why the Opposition are pushing the amendment.
<P>
It is not necessary for regional development agencies to provide housing. Social housing is already provided by housing associations with funding from the Housing Corporation, and by local authorities. It is unnecessary to add a further provider to the social housing sector, although we expect that RDAs will consult with local authorities and other providers of social housing and have regard to local authorities' housing strategies when compiling their regional economic strategy.
<P>
However, RDAs will play an important role in facilitating the provision of housing by others through the regeneration functions that they will inherit from English Partnerships, from the Rural Development Commission and from Government offices for the regions. For example, English Partnerships, as the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon said when quoting from the article by my hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, estimate that in the current financial year they will have facilitated 5,200 housing units, but that does not mean that they have the same relationship to those units as a local authority or the Housing Corporation would have. Furthermore, in taking over the administration of the SRB challenge fund, RDAs will be supporting projects aimed at improving housing and housing conditions for local people.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon asked rhetorically whether RDAs will deliver on housing. He answered his own question by saying no. I think that he is wrong and that the answer is yes, but in the same way as English Partnerships and those involved in SRB challenge fund work and other regeneration projects do at the moment, and not as direct providers. We do not believe that RDAs should undertake housing development by owning and managing, so I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we do not expect RDAs to undertake housing development other than in the role of facilitator.
<P>
The RDA's only direct housing role will be to acquire housing for incidental purposes on a temporary basis, which is the other aspect on which Opposition Members asked questions. That is something which most organisations find necessary to attract high quality staff who must move. Rather than reinforcing that, the amendment would give RDAs wide powers to build housing developments and to own and manage them, providing those developments fell within their purposes.
<P>
The power to acquire housing is for incidental purposes such as staff reasons, but the effect of the amendment would be to create nine other social housing providers by giving RDAs the power to provide social housing on a large scale. That is contrary to the strategic role of RDAs. They may facilitate but not directly provide housing.

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> The Minister says that RDAs may wish to provide housing for staff because people may have to move and it may be difficult to find accommodation. Is it the Government's intention that they should rent property, as Middlesbrough football club did--for example, for Juninho in his brief period at that club with Emerson--or is it intended that they will buy property for staff, who will then pay rent to the RDA? What does the word ``provide'' mean?
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Angela Eagle:</B> I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that we are talking about the odd house for staff if people have to relocate, not the provision of mass social housing on a large scale throughout the regions. The word ``provide'' means provide, in whatever sense the RDAs see fit in the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, and they will take advice from officials. The subsection has been included in the Bill to give RDAs a minor power, when they need it, to move or attract staff from one area of the country to another. It is as simple and narrow as that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> On a point of information, Mr. Benton. The hon. Member for Taunton said that she would have to leave the Committee for a while. Am I correct in thinking that we shall not debate amendments Nos. 61, 62, 65, 66, 67, 63 and 64 because those who tabled the amendments are not in the Committee?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You are right. Those amendments will not be considered. We are debating amendment No. 48.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Clause 6, like so many other clauses in the Bill, bestows enormous and sweeping powers on Ministers. The difference between this and previous clauses is that the powers conferred by clause 6 are not confined to the Secretary of State; they seem to be exercisable by any Minister of the Crown. In effect, they allow the transfer of powers previously under the direct control of that Minister--who is in turn answerable to the House--to an unelected, largely bureaucratic and comparatively unaccountable body. The discretion of Ministers to transfer their powers under the clause and accompanying schedule will be almost completely unrestrained. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain to the Committee what powers and functions the Government believe are likely to be transferred to RDAs in this way. It would be helpful to have a clue to the Government's thinking in order to assess the consequences not just in the regions, but for the House. In the same context, it would be helpful if the Minister could tell us which Ministers and Departments were likely to transfer powers to RDAs and, again, explain what powers might be involved.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 is designed to be helpful and constructive and to ensure that the good intentions of the DETR and Parliament are not subsequently thwarted by misinterpretation of the original intention behind RDAs. The same arguments apply to amendments Nos. 120 and 121, which relate to schedule 3. Again, schedule 3 seems to place no restriction on the Minister's discretion and, like clause 6, gives power to transfer functions not only to the Secretary of State but to any Minister. Therefore, amendments Nos. 120 and 121 ensure that the aims of the Bill and the purposes of RDAs are reinforced.
<P>
I move on to amendment No. 49. I recall frequent proclamations about the Government's commitment to greater openness. The existence of a later clause which deals with the RDAs' annual report implicitly acknowledges that Parliament should be kept informed of what is happening. Amendment No. 49 seeks to achieve that in respect of these functions. I am sure that the Minister does not want to keep Parliament in the dark about the transfer of powers or functions from his Department or by other Departments, so I hope that he will find amendment No. 49 acceptable.
<P>
Similar reasoning applies in respect of amendment No. 122. The schedule gives any Minister of the Crown the wide-ranging power to transfer any property or rights, and there appears to be no mechanism to ensure that Parliament will even be informed of such transfers. Amendment No. 122 would rectify that omission. If the Minister feels unable to accept the amendment--on past form, it is just possible that he may--I hope that he will at least tell the Committee what steps the Government propose to take to ensure that Parliament is kept informed about the shedding of ministerial functions in this way, with all that that implies for accountability to the House.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 is another amendment in the group. Paragraph 11 of schedule 3 seems on initial reading to allow Ministers to take retrospective action, which always raises a serious concern. I believe that it is dangerous for the Committee to pass legislation that appears to contain an assumption that Ministers will make mistakes when they are making schemes for transferring property and so on, and that it will be necessary to rectify those mistakes, not in the conventional way of making a new scheme but simply, by the stroke of the pen, making a retrospective change. Omitting paragraph 11 would enable the Government to avoid the charge that they are building into the Bill the power to act retrospectively when they make mistakes. For that reason, I commend amendment No. 123 to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I assure the honourable Gentleman that Parliament will not be kept in the dark, as it has been for the past 18 years. We intend to open up the process to scrutiny. Last night, in a debate that went rather further into the night than we anticipated--until about 3 o'clock, I believe--I assured the right honourable Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) that he was wrong to believe that we had released a decision on 7 August because we wanted to shy away from that decision. This Government have integrity and will answer for all their decisions openly and transparently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister sneaked it out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> No sneaking at all.
<P>
Clause 6 gives the Government the power to delegate functions to RDAs; it is enabling legislation. Three main areas are dealt with: English Partnerships, the Rural Development Commission and the single regeneration budget challenge fund, which is currently administered by government offices for the regions.
<P>
It is intended that the clause will be used to delegate the administration of the single regeneration budget challenge fund. The challenge fund supports a wide range of regeneration schemes run by local partnerships. RDAs will be responsible for administering the challenge fund in the same way as the government offices for the regions are now. RDAs will make recommendations to Ministers on the merits of individual proposals in terms of their contribution to the RDAs' regional economic strategy--the important aspect of the organisation--the extent to which they meet the national criteria and the feasibility of projects. Ministers will continue to take final decisions.
<P>
We expect the role of the agencies to evolve over time and, once they have settled into their tasks, there may be a case for extending their functions using powers under the clause. However, we will do so only when they have proved their effectiveness and when the new function is appropriate to the purpose of the agencies.
<P>
Schedule 3 provides that in delegating and revoking functions to RDAs, Ministers can make a scheme transferring property, rights and liabilities between RDAs and the Crown. Such schemes are likely to include, for example, details of the staff who will be transferring, the transfer of associated freeholds, leases of property or of assets such as vehicles or office equipment and records. It can also include intellectual property, for example guidance notes or project appraisal software.
<P>
Amendment No. 48 would ensure that the Secretary of State can delegate functions under clause 6 only if they further the purposes of the agency. It is similar to amendments Nos. 120 and 121, which would require that the Minister can make a transfer scheme in consequence of a delegation under clause 6 only if he is satisfied that the transfer furthers the agencies' purposes.
<P>
However, clause 5(1) already provides that RDAs can only act in accordance with their purposes. Safeguards are therefore provided. Delegations by the Secretary of State under clause 6 cannot change that. The Secretary of State can therefore delegate only those functions that fall within the RDAs' purposes and can make transfer schemes only as a consequence of the delegation; otherwise, he would be attempting to delegate functions that the agencies could not legally perform.

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister referred to clause 5, subsection (1) of which does not include the word ``only''. It says that the RDA 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may do anything which it considers expedient for its purposes'';<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it does not say ``may only'' do things that are expedient for its purposes. The provision is therefore not quite as restrictive as the Minister implied.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is the intention; that is the interpretation that I have given the wording. It clearly defines the role of the RDAs. Within that framework, we shall delegate powers and responsibilities on an evolving programme.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister has raised an issue about the interpretation of clause 5 in attempting to justify rejecting the amendments. As I said, clause 5(1) says that an RDA
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may do anything which it considers expedient for its purposes''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, clause 5(2) says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a regional development agency may only--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) give financial assistance'':
<P>
</UL></FONT>the word ``only'' is used in subsection (2). So in the minds of the drafters the use of the word ``only'' implies some restriction; otherwise its inclusion in subsection (2) would be unnecessary. However, it has been omitted from subsection (1). Hence to rely on clause 5(1) as a reason for not accepting the amendments seems a seriously defective argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is not the Government's interpretation. Clause 5(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Subject to the following provisions of this Parliament, a regional development agency may do anything which it considers expedient for its purposes, or for purposes incidental thereto.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``A regional development agency may only--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) give financial assistance,
<P>
(b) dispose of land for less than the best consideration which can reasonably be obtained''
<P>
</UL></FONT>and continues with paragraph (c). I have explained why that is adequate to protect the functions of carrying out RDA activity as outlined in clause 4. Safeguards are, as I have explained, already adequate so amendments Nos. 48, 120 and 121 are unnecessary. I shall deal separately with amendment No. 49.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 49 would require the Secretary of State to lay a report before each House of Parliament every time he delegates functions to the RDA, explaining which functions had been transferred. I fully support the apparent intention behind it--that the Government should be open about what they are asking RDAs to do. A report to Parliament, however, may not always be the best way of achieving that, though it could be appropriate in certain circumstances. We made it clear in the White Paper and during the passage of the Bill that we shall delegate to RDAs the administration of the SRB challenge fund.
<P>
What will that mean? Telling Parliament again in the form of a report would be unnecessary. It may be that Parliament can be informed of further delegations of power by means of an answer to a suitable parliamentary question--a tried and tested way of informing the House. There is no question of exercising the power in secret. As well as informing both Houses of Parliament we shall ensure that delegations to RDAs are made clear to all interested parties. As this point, though, we do not want to be tied down by this specific procedure.
<P>
Amendment No. 122 would require the transfer scheme in schedule 3 to be made by statutory instrument, subject to annulment by a suitable resolution of either House. Opposition Members have not thought through the implications of the amendment. It would make a transfer scheme, including transfers of employment contracts, subject to the approval of both Houses. I am sure that a suitable statutory instrument would be approved as a sensible measure. If it were defeated, however, staff working on the challenge fund would find that their functions had been removed to the RDA but their employment contracts would remain with government offices.
<P>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept that that situation would be unworkable. Staff would be in the uncertain position of having a job with no functions. The amendment is obviously not the work of an hon. Member who is concerned with the job security of government office staff or the continued success of local regeneration schemes, which rely on the support of the challenge fund.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister says that an unworkable situation would develop but it would have come about as a result of the Minister's decision to make the transfer. The purpose of the amendment is to provide Parliament with the opportunity of deciding whether a transfer should be made.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is where we disagree. As I said earlier, we have the responsibility for carrying out RDA policy as stated in our manifesto. The Bill is wholly compatible with that and we are not prepared to accept a wrecking amendment.
<P>
In any case, this is not a matter for secondary legislation. After all, there will be a transfer scheme for each of the nine RDAs, each of which may be substantial. Significant time and resources would be needed to create and debate statutory instruments to enable transfer schemes. In the first instance, RDAs will be agencies of the Government. The delegation of functions, and the resulting transfer of staff and other property, rights and liabilities from government offices to the government agencies is therefore an administrative measure of the type that, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, is generally not embodied in a statutory instrument. For example, the transfers for the establishment of the Environment Agency for England and Wales were not made by statutory instrument.
<P>
Amendment No. 123 would remove the Secretary of State's ability retrospectively to modify the transfer schemes after they had come into force. That would threaten the future of existing challenge fund projects. I begin to wonder whether the hon. Gentlemen who tabled the amendment have ever seen a transfer scheme from the establishment of a non-departmental public body--something that their party was much involved with while it was in power. Such transfer schemes involve a lot of work and may list the leases and contracts to be transferred.
<P>
I hope that all the schemes will have been accurately set up when they come into force; but it is possible that some items that should be passed to the regional development agencies could be overlooked. Alternatively, once the agencies were up and running it could be discovered that a further transfer was required. Paragraph 11 of schedule 3 would enable such cases to be resolved easily and all matters to be placed on a proper legal footing. It would not allow the Secretary of State to change employment contracts retrospectively.
<P>
It would make no sense to remove the paragraph. Even if the hon. Gentlemen who tabled the amendment disagree fundamentally with regional development agencies, I think that they would accept Government's right to put legislation on the statute book. Parliament should not make such legislation inefficient, which would be the amendment's effect. The will of the people must be expressed and that is what the Government are doing. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Given the serious and sometimes widening gaps between the Bill and the Labour party general election manifesto and White Paper--particularly relating to sustainable development--it is natural to be concerned about how to establish additional checks on the Government's activity in this context. It would be surprising if those of us who are concerned about accountability and openness, and the need to confine the extensive powers bestowed by the Bill to the service of the aims set out in it, did not think it important to pursue the matter.
<P>
Will the Minister respond to the question that I raised, about which other Ministers and Departments--besides his--he envisages taking advantage of the powers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman knows the answer, because the single regeneration budget was a creature of the previous Administration. It is quite a good mechanism. For the first time it brought together four Departments of State--education, employment, the Departments of Trade and Industry and the then Department of the Environment--in a single programme. That was innovatory and I want to pursue it; part of the regional development agencies proposal is to build on that idea. The practice was to bring four Departments of state together, with the public expenditure survey lines to follow the policies, and deliver the results through a single Department--which in those days was the Department of the Environment.
<P>
The Departments concerned would include Education--now the Department for Education and Employment--and the Department of Trade and Industry. The Home Office has now become involved with respect to safety programmes, which are dealt with through government offices. It is the Departments whose policies are achieved through the single regeneration budget, and whose PES lines follow those policies, that will have to be consulted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We are making a bit of progress. Is the Minister saying that he does not envisage the powers being used except by Departments in pursuit of the aims of the single regeneration budget?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Absolutely--just as before. I remind the hon. Gentleman that when his party was in power no single regeneration budget project was ever turned over by a Minister. That shows that implementation was in concert with the Government policy of the day as well as with what was happening on the ground. The mechanism has been tried and tested and we shall build on it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> In the light of those comments I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Hepburn </B>(Jarrow): This is my first opportunity to speak in the Committee. Clause 6 is excellent news for the northern region, which is where I come from. It has been in the forefront of the campaign for regional government.
<P>
Clause 6 is the key to the Bill, but unless the Opposition understand that, they have lost the plot. The Government's philosophy is to devolve more power to the regions; that is a welcome change after 18 years under the previous Administration, who centralised power. I am pleased that at last we have a Government who have the humility to say that they are not the fount of all knowledge, that there is a talent in the regions and that people are able and willing to take decisions on their own behalf.
<P>
I am pleased that the Government are carrying out their plan to trust local people. It is a welcome development.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn) has made a useful contribution to the debate. He expressed the sentiment, and spoke with the passion, that one would expect from Jarrow. His predecessor, now Lord Dixon, is a very good friend of mine. He was a great proponent of the devolution of power; he would probably say that the Bill went only a little way along the path that he wanted the Government to take when he was a Member of this House.
<P>
The Bill tackles the structural weaknesses in the competitive base. It will encourage employment in areas such as Jarrow, which my hon. Friend represents, by promoting economic activity and by giving those regions the wherewithal for development. The RDAs will take action to meet the needs of the constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow and others.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedule 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Strategy</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 3, line 25, after `(a)', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`after consulting the local authorities in its area,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 7 is a key clause. The strategy of regional development agencies will inform their approach to achieving the Bill's aims.
<P>
The RDAs will be established and operational long before we know whether there will be elected regional assemblies. Indeed, it is possible that some regions, if they are given the chance to vote for a directly elected regional assembly--that opportunity is being denied to Londoners--will decide to vote against it.
<P>
The Government have not thought through the consequences of what they propose. In four or five years, some parts of the country will have an elected regional assembly, with which the RDA will have a relationship, but in other parts of the country the only locally elected bodies in the region will be local authorities.
<P>
The Government plan to ignore the views of people in London by refusing to put a separate question on a directly elected regional assembly to the capital. Unless they plan to ignore the views of people elsewhere, they must at least take account of the possibility that there may be no directly elected regional assemblies in some parts of the country.
<P>
Therefore, RDAs should be obliged to consult directly elected bodies, such as local authorities, in those areas. I am prepared to consider a proposal to water down the amendment by specifying ``certain local authorities''. I do not argue that every parish council should be consulted about an RDA's strategy, although I do not object to giving parish councils an opportunity to express their views.
<P>
Clearly, some large authorities are anxious about their future after RDAs are established. They should have an opportunity to offer advice which might often be helpful, on RDA strategy. Doubtless the Minister will claim that he would like to encourage RDA boards to consult local authorities, but merely making such a claim is not enough.
<P>
The Bill would be strengthened if it obliged RDAs to consider local authorities' views. Local authorities are currently the only directly elected bodies in the regions, and they may continue to be in some regions. It would be a serious flaw in the Bill to enable RDAs to proceed without dialogue with such bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It may help the Committee if I explain a little about clause 7. It provides for RDAs to formulate and implement a regional strategy. That is one of their core functions, and could be described as their most significant role. I pay tribute to the good economic work that a range of organisations have undertaken over the years in the regions. However, there has never been a single body that held all the strands. No one has been responsible for co-ordination that commanded consensus in a region.
<P>
In previous sittings, I explained to the Committee that the Select Committee on Trade on Industry had travelled around to ascertain how to provide a strategic overview for economic development in a region. Those findings have been embodied in the Bill. Therefore, RDAs' strategies will cover all aspects of economic development in a region; namely, investment, improving business competitiveness, social and physical regeneration. Regional development agencies will provide a framework for the work, including sub-regional strategies for other local and regional partners. We want regional partners to feel that they own the strategy as much as the RDAs. It is to be a bottom-up strategy.
<P>
Regional partners will have key influence on the strategy's content and they will often have to implement it. Therefore, RDAs will work closely with all relevant partners, including local authorities.
<P>
Clause 8 specifically requires RDAs to consult those regional chambers designated by the Secretary of State. Chambers are being set up, with enthusiasm, in every region of England. They will be representative of all the interests in the region, in particular local authorities. We do not, therefore, wish to list in the Bill various other interests that RDAs may wish to consult about their strategies. As I have said, the strategies will only be effective if they command wide support in the regions, and there will be a strong incentive for RDAs to consult widely.
<P>
That is an important point. We are discussing a cultural change. We are moving from dictation from the centre, where decisions have been made by Whitehall or civil servants, to a bottom-up process of ownership and partnership. That is the difference between how the previous Administration operated, with the most centralised state in western Europe, and now, with the devolution of real powers which will enable people in those partnerships to deliver.
<P>
We had a similar discussion on strategy when we debated amendment No. 71. It proposed that strategies should be public documents. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that in the unlikely event of an RDA failing to act reasonably in making public information relating to the formulation or review of its strategy,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State will be able to rely on his general powers under clause 31''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or, indeed, the power in clause 7--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to issue guidance and direction to the RDAs''.--[Official Report, Standing Committee E, 3 February 1998; c. 138.].<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The same applies to consultation with local authorities.
<P>
I think that I have reassured Opposition Members and answered their questions. It is unnecessary to press the amendment to a vote, and I ask the hon. Member for South Suffolk to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister has referred to clause 8, which we have not debated. He said that it requires RDAs to consult regional chambers. The clause says that regional chambers are bodies that are designated by the Secretary of State. I do not see a requirement that those regional chambers which the Secretary of State may choose--his discretion, as in so many clauses, is unfettered--shall include representatives of all local authorities, or even leading local authorities, in a region.
<P>
The Secretary of State may decide to designate a chamber. In the Minister's eyes that obviates the need to specify further consultation with local authorities. The chamber, however, may not be representative of local authorities. Reliance on a requirement to consult regional chambers is not an adequate reason for rejecting a requirement to consult local authorities.
<P>
<B>Ms Jenny Jones </B>(Wolverhampton, South-West): Thank you, Mr. Benton, for letting me make a contribution.
<P>
As a west midlands Member of Parliament who represents a Wolverhampton constituency which, during the 1980s and 1990s, had a plethora of Government-sponsored economic development thrown at it, I want to emphasise how important it is for the RDA in the west midlands to consult local authorities. In Wolverhampton and much of the west midlands, local authorities and towns were told what was good for them. If local authorities had other opinions, that was just too bad. There was a fragmented and incoherent approach to economic development in towns in the west midlands. I know that my local authority and others welcome a more coherent approach which will allow people to listen to grass-roots expertise and which will deliver to people in the west midlands what they really want.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That is a useful contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones).
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Give her a job.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I would give her a job if that were in my gift.
<P>
<B>Ms Jenny Jones:</B> I am happy with the one I have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> There you are, then.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West adequately answered the questions asked by the hon. Member for South Suffolk, who shares the Opposition's negative view of consultation. Their mind set still reflects their dictatorial attitudes, sometimes bordering on arrogance, of the past 18 years. My hon. Friend, a practitioner, has explained how the previous Administration dealt with local authorities. This is a breath of fresh air, which allows the creative thinking and actions of local government to work in partnership with the major stakeholders in the region.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> While the Minister is on about breaths of fresh air and his great generosity in consultation, will he recall the recent consultation on banning beef on the bone? That took five days and the Government took precious little notice of it.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I must bring the Committee back to the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The Chair must always prevail, so I shall not be tempted to go down that route. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones) has adequately answered the point.
<P>
Under clause 8, we shall consult the chambers that are representative of those who are on the RDAs and those in the regions. It would be ludicrous to think that that could be conducted without major consultation with local authorities. As I said earlier, we expect on balance, the chambers to be in the public sector, with 60 or 70 per cent. from local authorities and roughly 30 per cent. from the other stakeholders--business, the voluntary sector, higher education or the trade unions--ensuring that a real partnership drives the programme of regeneration and wealth creation in those regions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I suppose we are making a bit of progress again, and we should be grateful for that, but even by the standards of double-speak, with which those of us who have endured these Committees for a number of years are familiar, to suggest that the amendment is somehow negative in its approach to consultation is a remarkable achievement. That was a characteristic that I associated more with old Labour, but perhaps we should celebrate that fact that old Labour is alive and kicking. To say that a requirement to consult local authorities, when there are no other democratically elected bodies in those regions to be consulted, is a negative approach to consultation is a pretty remarkable use of language.
<P>
However, in the spirit of constructive co-operation that has underlain my approach to the Committee, and preserving the opportunity to return to this important issue--it is an issue that the Local Government Association has taken an interest in and it may have read the Minister's comments with some concern--I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 3, line 26, leave out `and'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take amendment No. 69, in page 3, line 27, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(ba) undertake an environmental assessment of its strategy and any associated plans, policies or programmes likely to have significant effects on the environment prior to adoption or approval,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Some of us who have the stamina to stay here throughout the morning are willing to step in even when the Liberal Democrats are absent.
<P>
I am particularly interested in the requirement in amendment No. 69 to undertake an environmental assessment. I had not intended to speak to the amendment, because I thought that it would be moved by Liberal Democrat Members, but I have no doubt that the Minister will have come to the Committee freaked about the Government's attitude to this requirement and I move the amendment to give him an opportunity to place that on the record.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am getting a little worried about the co-operation across the two Benches. The gravitas of the debate must be having an effect on the hon. Member for South Suffolk and may win him over to more progressive thinking. We are breaking him out of the mould of 18 years of centralism. The book that he may write after this may be worth reading.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The amendment has been moved simply because our so-called partners in the Opposition, the Liberal Democrats, have cleared off.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That was beautifully put--the hon. Gentleman has a way with words. I love the robustness of the north. I thank hon. Members for allowing me to put it on the record, and I shall do so fairly quickly.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let me remind members of the Committee of the purpose of clause 7 and, in particular, how regional strategies are intended to relate to the purposes of RDAs. The regional strategies will cover the whole economic development field--investment, improving business competitiveness, and social and physical regeneration, and will provide a framework for the work of RDAs, including the sub-regional strategies, and for other local and regional partners. Clause 7(1)(a) relates the strategy specifically to the purposes of RDAs set out in clause 4. That means that the strategies, as we have explained in the context of earlier amendments, will set out the RDAs' policies with regard to sustainable development, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary adequately explained.
<P>
Amendment No. 69 and the consequential amendment No. 68 would require each RDA to carry out an environmental assessment of its strategy and any associated plans, policies or programmes likely to have significant effects on the environment. The amendments are not necessary. As I have mentioned, RDAs' regional strategies will set out their policies with regard to all their purposes, including that of sustainable development. Therefore, the strategy will need to set out how it is likely to impact on the environment and on quality-of-life issues.
<P>
Clause 7(2) provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance and directions in relation to the formulation of regional strategies. That includes, in particular, the matters to be covered by the strategy, the issues to be taken into account in formulating the strategy, the strategy to be adopted in relation to any matters and the updating of the strategy. It will be open to us to issue guidance to RDAs on the formulation of their strategies in relation to sustainable development.
<P>
It is Government policy that all Departments and agencies should take proper account of environmental considerations in developing their policies and programmes, and that, where there are likely to be significant environmental impacts, environmental appraisals need to be carried out. That will apply to RDAs once they are established.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for that reply. It was helpful to know what the Government's response would have been. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 3, leave out lines 28 to 39.
<P>
I think that we shall see an interesting juxtaposition of comments in the report of this morning's proceedings. Only a few minutes ago, the Minister was telling the Committee how the Bill was all about a devolution of powers and how he condemned what he inaccurately and sweepingly characterised as 18 years of centralism. Let us see how those criticisms stack up against subsections (2) and (3) of the clause, which amendment No. 115 seeks to omit from the Bill.
<P>
The two subsections are among the most centralising of any legislation that I recall coming before the House. Indeed, if any prospective members of an RDA board took the trouble to read them, they might wonder what the point of being a member of the RDA board was. Subsection (2) says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Secretary of State may give a regional development agency guidance and directions in relation to the exercise of its functions under subsection (1), in particular, with respect to--
<P>
</UL></FONT>	(a) the matters to be covered by the strategy''--
<P>
so the Secretary of State dictates the agenda--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(b) the issues to be taken into account in formulating the strategy''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>so, having set the agenda, the Secretary of State tells the members of the board what they can think about when they are formulating their strategy--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(c) the strategy to be adopted in relation to any matter''--
<P>
</UL></FONT>so without waiting to see what the RDA board might think the strategy should be, the Secretary of State can simply say, ``This is what the strategy will be. This is what you've got to do,'' and--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(d) the updating of the strategy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So even if the board thought that the Secretary of State's attention had been diverted--perhaps because he had been whisked off in his chauffeur-driven, gas-guzzling Jaguar to another part of the country--and that it might be allowed to do something on its own initiative, the updating of the strategy could be directed by the Secretary of State. That is extraordinary, inconsistent and irreconcilable with everything that the Government have said about their wish to decentralise and to take account of views in the regions. If the Secretary of State does not like an RDA's proposal, he will say no. The RDAs will not be allowed to decide even what issues their strategies will cover, unless the Secretary of State agrees. That makes a mockery of the idea that RDAs will be part of a measure that takes power away from Whitehall. The very reverse will be true if subsections (2) and (3) remain in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Cosmetic devolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As my hon. Friend says, it is cosmetic devolution and beneath the cosmetics is the hideous sight of the Secretary of State aggregating more and more power and decisions to himself.
<P>
Subsection (3) continues in the same vein as subsection (2). To amplify the issues which the Secretary of State may tell RDAs to take account of, they include, amazingly, ``the agency's area''. Given the reluctance of Ministers to accept all sorts of sensible additions to the Bill, such a provision seems extraordinary. Subsection (3) also refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(b) the area of any other regional development agency, and (c) any part of the United Kingdom outside England.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am not sure why those paragraphs are in the Bill, but I suppose that it may comfort the Secretary of State to have his powers reinforced in the Bill. When local authorities' interests are concerned, no mention must be made of the need to consult them--they are inferior--below the salt.
<P>
This debate, like that on sustainable development on Tuesday afternoon, which we finished this morning, is on one of the key aspects of the Bill. The Government's claims in support of the concept of RDAs are being blown out of the water by the inclusion of subsections (2) and (3).

<P>

<B>Mr. Curry:</B> May I rapidly explore a couple of points. I do not want to return to the Mongolian question, although it appears rather entrancing. The Secretary of State is taking powers to stop RDAs from dealing with Mongolia. He may direct and give guidance to RDAs on dealing with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any part of the United Kingdom outside England.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Is it not conceivable that the agency for the south-east of England might legitimately wish to co-ordinate its strategy with the Nord-Pas de Calais region of France, which is just across the channel? Does the power exist, or would such co-ordination be banned by the Mongolian clause? If the power exists, why does the Secretary of State need to give guidance and direction if the RDA is dealing within the United Kingdom? It is curious that, if the agency can take the initiative to deal outside the United Kingdom, it needs the Secretary of State's guidance to deal within the United Kingdom. I do not understand the psychological processes. Perhaps the Minister can help.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I shall do my very best, but before replying to the hon. Member for South Suffolk, I shall refer back to a point I made earlier. We are in a process of managing change. The Prime Minister made it clear in our election manifesto that we would devolve power and that different parts of the United Kingdom would be dealt with slightly differently, as we have seen in Scotland and Wales and will see in London in the first week of May. In England, we said that we would manage that transition by setting up regional development agencies, which would consult regional chambers. As I have said to the Committee before, we will give the people of the English regions the right to determine whether they want directly elected regional assemblies, as we have already done in Scotland and Wales, and as we shall do in relation to London. That is the way to get consensus and move forward.
<P>
This Bill is no different from the 1975 legislation on Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. I remind Opposition Members that, some time later, the then Prime Minister Thatcher, decided that it was such a good model that she introduced one in Northern Ireland. We are now implementing in England the same sort of legislation that enabled those areas to have development agencies. As we have assisted Scotland and Wales in setting up agencies accountable to a Scottish Parliament or Welsh Assembly--or, as will be the case, to an elected mayor in London--so, in time, shall we do exactly the same for the English regions. Let us not back away, therefore, from the broader picture that we painted in our manifesto. Amendment No. 115 would delete from clause 7 the power of the Secretary of State to give a regional development agency guidance and directions in relation to the formulation and review of its regional strategy. The Committee will have noted that, for the main part, the Bill gives RDAs general functions, based on the five general purposes in clause 4. The one specific thing that we are requiring them to do--the thing that has been singled out--is the regional strategy provided for in clause 7. That is because regional strategies will be the linchpin of the work of the RDA; the key to improving regional competitiveness. Regional strategies will provide the policy framework for decision taking in the region. So, we felt it appropriate to set out in relatively specific terms in the Bill the things that we may wish RDAs to include in their strategies.
<P>
It is right, and highly desirable, that RDAs work closely with their regional partners and, where appropriate, those working at the local level, to ensure that their strategy commands the consensus and commitment that it will need to be effective. Consistent with our wish to decentralise decision taking to the regional level wherever we can, we want RDAs to have a good deal of autonomy in the way in which they formulate their strategies, and the policies that they wish to promote. Every region is different, and we want the RDA boards, with their broad knowledge and experience, to have the scope to reflect the needs of their region in their strategy documents. We want them to have the freedom to consult key players in the regions and the public to ensure that the strategy covers all matters and issues relevant to regional needs and demands.
<P>
It would be naive, however, to imagine that regional strategies can be developed in isolation from national policies and programmes. It will be crucial, if regional strategies are to carry weight, that they command the support of central Government as well as the support of the regional players. Only if they do so will they provide a basis for central Government decision taking. We need to ensure, therefore, that RDAs, in formulating their strategies, understand clearly how their work will fit into the national policy framework.
<P>
Thus, clause 7(2) set out clearly the way in which we propose to ensure that there is proper coherence between regional strategies and other relevant policy frameworks. This may in some cases mean setting out the matters to be covered in the strategy; in others it may involve indicating what issues should be taken into account and, in some cases, Ministers might want to specify the strategy to be adopted. I believe that that covers the point raised by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), that we shall do that with the Pas de Calais region through, the EU Interreg development. I can see spacial planning coming on to the agenda as well. We shall expect some of the regions to be involved in some of those developments. Strategies will be of value only if they are monitored, kept under review and updated. Clause 7(2)(d) enables the Secretary of State to give guidance or directions in relation to the updating of the strategy.
<P>
We believe that it is desirable, in the case of regional strategies more than in any other case, to set out the broad parameters within which we envisage giving guidance or directions to RDAs. We believe it right to do that. It is not inconsistent with decentralisation. It will enable us to ensure that decisions taken at regional level are consistent with the national policy framework and the EU framework. That is only sensible for bodies whose financing will come from central Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> That is interesting. The Secretary of State has drawn up a Bill that will enable him to compete with the Minister without Portfolio for the title of control freak of the year, 1998. That simply does not chime with claims made in the White Paper, in the Government's manifesto or on Second Reading. I understand that the Government want to set out the areas that might be covered in an RDA's strategy, but total and continuing dictatorial power is not consistent with RDAs performing the regional role that the Government say that they want.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman cast his mind back to when he was in Government and tell us what the difference is between the operation of the RDAs and those created in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland over the past 23 years? In what way does the Bill significantly differ from what has been on the statute book for nearly a quarter of a century and what has been accepted by Administrations on both right and left?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The justification for RDAs in certain special circumstances was accepted by former Governments in the cases of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. What the Conservatives do not accept is that the whole of England should be under the Secretary of State's jackboot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I can see the hon. Gentleman's flexible mind at work. Will he tell us how the ``jackboot'' we are using differs from those placed previously on Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We all know the real reason for these RDAs in England. The Government feel that they need to provide a sop to England because of their extraordinary proposal to set up an elected Scottish Parliament even though Scottish Members of the Commons will still be able to vote on all sorts of matters on which English Members will not retain a right to vote when those matters apply to Scotland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I want to press the hon. Gentleman on my point. Will he tell us how the Bill's RDAs differ from those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? What difference is there?
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> What is different is that the Bill applies to the whole of England, many of whose regions--[Interruption.] The Minister wants to know the difference; that is the first one. Many of the regions to which the Bill applies do not have the special circumstances that applied in Scotland. The sense of national identity in Scotland does not exist in all the English regions. Economic problems existed in Scotland that do not apply to all the English regions. When we want to deal urgently with a serious regional situation by cutting through layers of red tape, it may be necessary to empower Ministers in a way that need not be applied to the whole country.
<P>
The Minister has not told us how he expects a situation to be resolved when the Secretary of State's idea of the RDA's strategy conflicts with the ideas of an elected regional assembly. It is perfectly possible that the assembly might contain a majority of members whose political views are at odds with those of the Secretary of State. Whose will will prevail?
<P>
The Government clearly intend that the will of the Secretary of State will prevail. Never mind all their waffle about democratic accountability. Never mind all their proclaimed desire to let regions develop their own policies. All that is subsumed. Even if in the future there are directly elected regional assemblies--presumably reflecting the will of the people--which believe that their regional development agencies should do certain things and have a certain strategy, if their view conflicts with that of the Secretary of State, the process of democracy will be over-ridden.
<P>
The Minister did not make any attempt to explain what would happen in such circumstances. Do the Government intend through the Bill to retain the power of the Secretary of State effectively to overrule elected regional assemblies in guiding RDA's strategy formulation?

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman's argument is irrelevant. We are not discussing directly elected regional assemblies. He seeks to delete subsections (2) and (3) of the clause. I challenge the hon. Gentleman to tell the Committee how what we are proposing is different from the development agencies that have been operating in the United Kingdom for over a quarter of a century. If those agencies are so bad, why did not the Administration of which he was a member, which had the opportunity for 18 years, remove them from the statute book? The answer is because they work, and they will work for England as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister has more than once told the Committee how much he enjoys travelling around the country and seeing what is going on. I suggest that he travels more if he thinks that the needs of the south-eastern region are the same as those of Scotland or Wales. They are not. It is a reflection of his centralising mentality that he believes that because a particular structure applies in Scotland, precisely the same structure must be set up for the other regions.
<P>
The Minister has not attempted to answer the question about conflict. In an earlier debate, he used the existence of regional chambers as a justification for not consulting local authorities. Let us set aside for the moment the question of directly elected regional assemblies. Is it the Government's intention, as expressed through subsections (2) and (3), that a regional chamber will be overruled when it expresses a clear and specific view about the strategy of an RDA that conflicts with that of the Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> It says clearly in the Bill that responsibility for RDAs lies ultimately with Ministers. That is the only way to operate, because public expenditure lines go through Parliament to regional development agencies as NDPBs. They are responsible to Parliament.
<P>
If RDAs are to be successful, we must ensure that they take into account all stakeholders and partners in their regions in developing their strategies. We are doing that by enthusiastically setting up a structure of regional chambers in the nine English regions. I envisage a good working relationship. If the ultimate question is asked, they are responsible to Ministers, because that is where the public expenditure line ends. The hon. Gentleman knows that; I know that; everyone else knows that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We now have that clearly on the record at least. Just as I wonder how enthusiastic people will be to serve on the boards of RDAs, I wonder whether stakeholders, to use the Minister's phrase, will find the opportunity to participate in the work of regional chambers quite so enticing when they see that they are, potentially, little more than puppet organisations, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) said, are being set up as a cosmetic form of decentralisation.
<P>
In the final analysis, all power remains with the Secretary of State. There is no serious attempt at devolution. The 18-years process of centralisation that the Minister attempted to criticise was as nothing compared to the measures that are now before us.
<P>
We have had a useful debate. However, we have been unable to tease an answer out of the Minister. He mentioned directly elected regional assemblies on Second Reading, when justifying the principles of the Bill. Will those elected assemblies also be overruled if they conflict with the Minister?
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We are not discussing directly elected regional assemblies. Consultation will take place on those and we will ensure that the people of the English regions decided whether or not assemblies are set up. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that constitutional change will result from the will of the people. I appreciate that it is difficult for Conservative Members to comprehend the democratic process, given their mindset of centralising power and the dictatorial attitudes and arrogance that prevailed over the nation for 18 years. We are thinking creatively about the democratic process. We will engage with the people of the nation before we take the fundamental step of setting up directly elected regional assemblies. When we have done that, I will be able to answer the hon. Member for South Suffolk.
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have had a considerable success. There is at least a chance that regional assemblies may be able to make their views prevail over those of the Secretary of State. That is a modest advance on where we were an hour ago. I am grateful to the Minister for his valuable concession. We have explored this matter at some length. I want to press the amendment.
