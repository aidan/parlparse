						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000401">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr.
Tom Harris):
						</b> Schedule 14 deals with moving human remains
and monuments from burial grounds and re-interring or cremating the
remains necessary to construct Crossrail. Before that happens, under
the Bill the nominated undertaker, as it were, must publish the
proposal twice in a local newspaper and erect a site notice unless the
remains were interred more than 100 years ago and the Secretary of
State considers that no relative or personal representative is likely
to object. That will give relatives and personal representatives the
opportunity to re-inter or cremate the remains themselves.</div>
					<a name="07112812000053"><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions have a precedent in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996,
and have not proved controversial. Under the amendment, if the
interment took place less than 25 years ago the
nominated undertaker would have to seek out relatives or personal
representatives, which would place substantial additional burdens on
the nominated undertaker. In addition, the requirement in the amendment
is open-ended, so that if no personal representative were found, every
relative would have to be sought, which I am sure was not what the hon.
Member for Wimbledon intended. Lawyers look at the exact wording of
such proposals with great care, and it would be difficult to establish
whether sufficient steps had been taken in any particular case and thus
at what point the nominated undertaker could proceed with his
work.</div>
					<a name="07112812000054"><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment is also unlikely to have any substantive effect. As reported
in the Crossrail environmental statement, Cross London Rail Links has
carried out an archaeological assessment of the land affected by the
project, expected scheme impacts and appropriate mitigation measures.
The assessment indicated that the project is not expected to affect any
interments made within the past 25 years. For those reasons, I do not
support the amendment, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw
it.</div>

						</b> There was some confusion about
the amendments. There was initially some
transposition of their wording, but that problem has been corrected on
the amendment paper. The Minister was quick to spot the transposition,
and I congratulate him on doing so. I have also made an error in
amendment No. 61, which I am sure will cause him to make some other
point. The amendment should state &#147;Royal Parks Agency&#148;,
not &#147;Royal Parks
Association&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112812000066"><div class="hs_Para">Clause
51 looks at the disposal of land managed by
the Royal Parks Agency or the Crown Estate
Commissioners on behalf of the Crown. Under the clause, the Secretary
of State may grant a lease, easement or other right over such land. The
purpose of my amendment is to avoid any perceived conflict of interest
resulting from the fact that, as the explanatory notes point out, the
Secretary of State is also</div>
					<a name="07112812000067"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the legal personality of the

					<a name="07112812000068"><div class="hs_Para">It
would require the Secretary of State to consult with the operational
head of the Royal Parks Agency before exercising his powers in respect
of the Crown land, and it would introduce a consultation process with
other interested parties. It would also ensure that the basis of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>any decision to dispose of Crown land is as robust
as possible, and is informed by consultation with the most appropriate
parties.</div>
					<a name="07112812000069"><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 63 and 62 are designed to achieve the same effect. They would make
a minor change to the wording of the clause, and would require the
Secretary of State to demonstrate that the land in question was needed
for Crossrail. A consistent theme of mine during our sittings has been
to ensure that we provide accountability and responsibility while
giving the Secretary of State the flexibility and the exceptional
powers that he wants. I hope that the Minister will look favourably on
the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07112812000070"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000408">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> Clause 51 deals with technical constraints arising
under the Crown Lands Act 1851 and the Crown Estate Act 1961. Because
land forming part of the royal parks or the Crown estate
belongs to the Crown, it does not need to be compulsorily
acquired, but it may none the less need to be used if we are to
successfully build and operate Crossrail. Clause 51 applies only to
land within the limits of deviation for the scheduled works, and thus
within the limits of land to be acquired or used. Its provisions have
effect only where the body responsible for managing the land&#151;the
Secretary of State in the case of royal parks and the Crown Estate
Commissioners in the case of Crown estate land&#151;considers that it
is required for Crossrail. It might be helpful if I gave an example to
explain why we need clause
51.</div>
					<a name="07112812000071"><div class="hs_Para">To comply with
safety requirements we intend to build a shaft in Hyde park. The likely
significant impacts of the shaft were assessed in the environmental
statement that was deposited with the Bill and those affected had the
opportunity to petition against our proposals. Naturally, we discussed
our plans with the Royal Parks Agency. In addition, some land required
to provide the subsoil land for the Crossrail tunnels is
owned by the Crown Estate Commissioners. Amendment
No. 61 would require the Secretary of State to consult the chief
executive of the royal parks association and any other relevant
interested parties before granting a lease, easement or other right
over a royal park. However, as I have explained, our proposals for Hyde
park have already been the subject of extensive consultation during
proceedings on the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112812000072"><div class="hs_Para">On the question
of the royal parks association, as the hon. Gentleman has already
pointed out he meant the Royal Parks Agency, which is an executive
agency of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The status of
the agency may change from time to time, so it would be inappropriate
to write the Department&#146;s internal management structures into
the Bill. That has some relevance, given our earlier discussion about
whether to name Network Rail in the Bill.
Furthermore, a requirement to consult</div>
					<a name="07112812000359"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other relevant interested
parties&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112812000073"><div class="hs_Para">would give rise
to uncertainty as to who they were. After listening to the hon.
Gentleman I am not clear what other interested parties he has in
mind.</div>
					<a name="07112812000074"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
62 would require the Secretary of State to prove that land within a
royal park is needed for, or in connection with, the construction of
Crossrail before he or she could grant any lease, easement or other
right in relation to that land. The Secretary of State granting a
lease, easement or other right will, at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>the relevant time, have to make a judgment as to whether it appears to
them that the land is required. To include a requirement to prove that
it is required does not make an awful lot of sense, because it suggests
that a third party exists to whom it should be proved. No such party
exists and no such party is proposed in the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112812000075"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 63 would limit the effect of clause 51(3) to cases in which the
Secretary of State has determined that land within the Crown estate is
needed for, or in connection with, the construction
of Crossrail. Under the Bill, it would be for the Crown Estate
Commissioners to be satisfied that part of the Crown estate was needed
for, or in connection with, Crossrail. For the purposes of the
provision, we think that it is right that that approach should be
maintained and that it is the Crown Estate Commissioners who should
take a view. I hope that that has clarified things for the hon.
Gentleman and that he will consider withdrawing his
amendment.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): As
the constituency Member for Hyde park, among other royal parks and
landmarks of this great city, I should like to confirm what the
Minister said. There was extensive consultation on the building of the
new site at the edge of Hyde park, close to the border
with Bayswater road. A number of concerns were raised
by my constituents, many of whom voiced ongoing concern about the
increasing commercialisation of Hyde park. The issue was used as yet
another cause c√(c)l√®bre, but it is important none the
less.</div>
					<a name="07112812000077"><div class="hs_Para">I support the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon. It does
not strike me that &#147;other relevant...parties&#148; in the
context of this issue are an extensive group of
bodies. There is a well regarded list of amenity societies and
residents associations in central London&#151;I am sure the same
applies to any other part of the UK covered by the measure&#151;and
the provision would apply to Friends of Hyde Park and Kensington
Gardens, and perhaps to the Marylebone Association and the South East
Bayswater Residents Association. It would therefore apply to a very
small and defined group. Westminster city council gives status to
certain residents groups for the very purpose of their being consulted
before planning changes are made, and they have locus standi in such
matters. I do not expect that to be a particular
problem.</div>

background. believe he trained as a solicitor&#151;I am sorry about

relevant interested
parties&#148;,</div>
					<a name="07112812000079"><div class="hs_Para">suggests a
level of ambiguity that is not helpful? He is right that there is a
very specific list of organisations that I am sure would be
appropriate, but the proposal does not necessarily point the way to
those
people.</div>
					<a name="07112812000080"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000411">Mr.
Field:
						</b> I am happy to assist the Minister by suggesting
that there must be something in the channel tunnel rail legislation
along those lines. The world did not become a much worse place when I
ceased to be a lawyer. Some of my constituents might argue that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>same will be said if I cease to be a parliamentarian before too long,
but I sincerely have no such intention in
mind.</div>
					<a name="07112812000081"><div class="hs_Para">I accept what
the Minister said. We need clarity, and I am not suggesting that the
proposal is 100 per cent. ideal. However, it does make an important
point about Crown estate land. The royal parks are very close to the
hearts of countless millions of people&#151;many of them are
constituents of mine, but many of them are not&#151;who value the
wonderful amenity they provide. I would point out to the Committee that
there are many royal parks outside central London, and it is
with that in mind that we tried to target a particular
concern.</div>
					<a name="07112812000082"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
think that there is any likelihood of the royal parks soon leaving the
hands of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is important
to remember that in relation to compulsory purchase, particularly in
central London, large tracts of Crown estate land are outside the scope
of the Bill unless we protect them individually. I hope that the
Minister has taken account of what we have said, because it is an
important point. It would be a crying shame if, given the importance of
much Crown estate land throughout the country, we bypassed the
interests of residents and amenity groups in the vicinity by not giving
credence to their concerns. It would be perverse in many ways if the
Secretary of State had cart√(c) blanch√(c) to develop those
areas, which are regarded by many people almost as common land, given
that we rightly have all the safeguards in place for the compulsory
purchase of privately owned
land.</div>

section deals with those
claiming</div>
					<a name="07112812000091"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;compensation in
respect of any land, or any interest in land, which has been taken for
or injuriously affected by the execution of the works, and for which
the acquiring authority have not made
satisfaction&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112812000092"><div class="hs_Para">There is,
however, a small but significant alteration to the wording of the 1965
Act&#151;the substitution of &#147;nominated undertaker&#148; for
&#147;the acquiring authority&#148;. If we do not do that, the Bill
will effectively muddy what is already the grey area of the respective
duties and responsibilities of the Secretary of State and the nominated
undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112812000093"><div class="hs_Para">The
Committee might recall that when we dealt with clause
6 on compulsory purchase, I tabled an amendment that would have given
the nominated undertaker, as opposed to the Secretary of State, the
powers to purchase compulsorily. The Minister said that he was
tempted by my amendment, but not quite enough, and it was
therefore withdrawn. It is clear in the clause that the Secretary of
State alone is responsible for the compulsory purchase of land.
However, on the question of compensation, it appears that, although the
Secretary of State will have compulsorily purchased the land and will
be the acquiring authority, the responsibility for compensation now
passes to the nominated
undertaker.</div>
					<a name="07112812000094"><div class="hs_Para">To make
the clause work, therefore, we need to insert the words
&#147;Secretary of State&#148; rather than &#147;nominated
undertaker&#148;, as outlined in the amendment. Otherwise, we will
have an odd perversity, which is that the Secretary of State will have
compulsorily acquired the land, yet the nominated undertaker&#151;who
may or may not be the Secretary of State, as we discovered
previously&#151;will pay out the compensation. That is very
strange.</div>
					<a name="07112812000095"><div class="hs_Para">If a
landowner&#146;s land were seized or compulsorily purchased by one
person, it would seem strange if he had to seek compensation from
another. If, as is the case in clause 6, we make the Secretary of State
the person who compulsorily acquires the land, it seems perfectly
consistent that that Secretary of State must also take on the duties
and responsibilities associated with the purchase. Therefore, my
amendment would make the clause consistent with other clauses by taking
out the words &#147;nominated undertaker&#148; and replacing them
with &#147;Secretary of
State&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112812000096"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000414">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> On this occasion, I am not even tempted to support
the amendment, and I can explain why. Clause 53 is a technical
provision that arises from the fact that, although under the Bill the
power to acquire land compulsorily for Crossrail is conferred on the
Secretary of State, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>the power to carry out works on that land is conferred on the nominated
undertaker. Section 10 of the 1965 Act gives a right to compensation in
certain cases where, although landowners do not have particular land
that they own compulsorily acquired from them, they none the less have
rights associated with their land adversely affected by things done by
the undertaker in constructing works on neighbouring land that has been
acquired from someone
else.</div>
					<a name="07112812000097"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of
clause 53 is to reflect the division of responsibilities made in the
Bill so that, in such cases, it is made absolutely clear that the
nominated undertaker pays the compensation under section 10 of the 1965
Act, rather than the Secretary of State, simply because
of the practical reason that the actions of the
nominated undertaker, in carrying out work on neighbouring land, have
given rise to the right of
compensation.</div>
					<a name="07112812000098"><div class="hs_Para">In this
case, it is not the purchase of the land that has
given rise to the right of compensation, but the
&#147;injurious affection&#148;, as it is described in the clause.
The clause does not change the cases where compensation arises, or the
amount of compensation payable. It is concerned only with who will pay,
as a consequence of the particular division of responsibilities in the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112812000099"><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would negatively affect the clause by providing for the Secretary of
State to pay the compensation. For that reason alone, I cannot support
the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
understands my point and withdraws the
amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000415">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> I certainly understand the Minister&#146;s
point. Effectively, he is saying that the actions that occur on the
land after it has been compulsorily acquired attract compensation, not
the physical act of compulsory purchase itself. However, I am not quite
sure that I follow his point that the amendment would negatively affect
the Secretary of State. Can he clarify
that?</div>

						</b> To clarify, the clause refers to section 10(1) of
the 1965 Act. I am not accusing the Secretary of State of carrying out
any injurious affection on anyone. My point is that the nominated
undertaker will carry out the work. Therefore, there is a clear
division of responsibility. The Secretary of State purchases the land,
and there are compensation arrangements in place for that purchase,
separate from the clause. The nominated undertaker, however, will be
responsible for carrying out any work that may be injurious to the
private landowner, so it does not make sense for the Secretary of State
to pay compensation for the purchase and the work that is carried
out.</div>

							<b class="B">Susan
Kramer</b> (Richmond Park) (LD): In many senses, the clause
represents a huge lost opportunity. When it was proposed that Crossrail
might come down into my neck of the woods, properties along the route
under discussion immediately lost about 25 per cent. of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>their value. The proposal was not particularly serious and it
disappeared in a matter of months, but I did have
extensive conversations with Crossrail&#146;s management about a
property protection scheme to ensure that proper compensation was paid
to people whose property was affected. In cases of direct compulsory
purchase, it was well understood that the needs of the property owner
would be satisfied, but the clause talks about others whose property is
impacted by the
scheme.</div>
					<a name="07112812000106"><div class="hs_Para">Crossrail&#146;s
management was very positive about the property protection scheme that
we discussed. It had been piloted by the central railway project, which
never happened, although I should declare that I had an
interest in it. Much of Crossrail&#146;s management
was familiar with the scheme, which would have given anyone who
believed that their property had been affected the option of requiring
it to be compulsorily purchased at the point of construction at what
would have been the full market value without the
affliction.</div>
					<a name="07112812000107"><div class="hs_Para">In effect,
the scheme was structured like an insurance scheme, in that it would
have remained attached to the project and been exercised only at the
point of construction. The money would not have been drawn down, and
the option would have attached to the sale of the property so that
people could have sold freely, knowing that they were selling on
protection to whoever purchased their property from them. The matter
would finally have resolved itself during the construction
phase.</div>
					<a name="07112812000108"><div class="hs_Para">We have a
serious problem with major projects such as Crossrail, which have an
impact on people who must sell their property because they need the
money as part of their retirement plan or for some other purpose. The
existing legislation is not adequate to cover such circumstances, and I
hope that the Minister will use the opportunity afforded by the Bill to
set out how such people can be protected
appropriately.</div>

Peter Soulsby</b> (Leicester, South) (Lab): I understand the
hon. Lady&#146;s concern about property owners affected by major
projects such as Crossrail, but I remind the Committee yet again that
it is for that reason that Parliament has the hybrid Bill procedure,
which is intended to protect private interests during the promotion of
such public Bills. We go through the process of specially establishing
a Select Committee so that we can look at exactly the concerns she
expressed.</div>

							<a name="07112812000420">Susan

						</b> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, even with the
hybrid Bill process, there is often a long delay and that people
selling property in the interim are inevitably injured? Does he also
accept that one advantage of a property protection scheme is that the
market identifies who has suffered because the price that they are
offered for their property is different from that offered for a
comparable property that is not afflicted? Many issues of contention
regarding which property is or is not affected therefore disappear
because the market establishes the
facts.</div>

							<a name="07112812000421">Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> Again, I entirely understand the hon.
Lady&#146;s point, but the hybrid Bill process allows for precisely
the concerns that she has expressed. It enables those who fear that
their land or property might be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>adversely affected by the Bill and the scheme that it enables to
petition against the Bill in the Commons&#151;the stage that we have
gone through&#151;and the Lords. I assure her that that the hybrid
Bill Committee heard many petitions on matters related to compensation.
Many people expressed both their particular and general concern about
the likely effects of the Bill on their neighbourhood on behalf of
those who lived around them. We took careful note of
the concerns that were expressed and, in some cases, made
recommendations to the promoters and the Government on ways in which
those interests could be given special protection. We are grateful to
the promoters for the attention that they paid to those concerns and
the amendments that they made to deal with specific situations and more
generally as a result of those representations.</div>
					<a name="07112812000112"><div class="hs_Para">I certainly think that the
other members of the Select Committee all felt at the end of the
process that those who had had concerns similar to those expressed
today by the hon. Member for Richmond Park were heard appropriately and
had the opportunity for their concerns to be taken into account. In the
overwhelming number of cases, those people felt that their concerns had
been adequately satisfied and their interests appropriately protected.
I feel that her concern about what she described as a missed
opportunity in the clause is misplaced. Those concerns have already
been taken into account and those with lingering concerns will have the
opportunity to petition again when the Bill goes through the Lords and
to ensure that their concerns are taken into account if they have not
yet been so.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): As the other
member of the Committee who was also a member of the hybrid Bill
Committee, I support what has just been said. The hybrid Bill Committee
concerned itself at great length with the whole issue of compensation,
because it seemed to us that the promoters were shoving through a
project, rightly so from many people&#146;s perspectives, but that
was not the fault of the people who would be affected. Therefore, we
fought long and hard on their behalf and gained some considerable
advantages for them as a result.</div>
					<a name="07112812000114"><div class="hs_Para">My fear is that the amendment
would be immensely misplaced in relation to the work that we did. I
think that the rights are already protected in the Bill and I am well
satisfied that the compensation code would be properly applied.
Additional rights were given as a result of the work of the hybrid Bill
Committee and it therefore seems that, not only is the amendment pretty
pointless, it could also be harmful.</div>

Harris:
						</b> I thank hon. Members for their contributions on
the stand part debate. The hon. Member for Richmond Park made some
important points, and I know that she is concerned about the general
problem of blight as it affects many private property owners. Of
course, that problem has impeded any number of civil engineering and
construction projects throughout the country and it continues to
trouble many private property owners along the routes of roads and
other potential civil engineering projects.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>
					<a name="07112812000116"><div class="hs_Para">I disagree that the clause is a
missed opportunity. If I understand the comments of the hon. Member for
Richmond Park correctly, she is looking for a new, general purpose
procedure that would apply not only to Crossrail, but to other civil
engineering projects. Of course, that is not part of the purpose of the
Bill and the clause is somewhat narrower than the scope of her points,
but they were well made and I am sure she will want to continue that
campaign elsewhere.</div>
					<a name="07112812000117"><div class="hs_Para">I
echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South and
those of the hon. Member for Northampton, South. It is invaluable to
have two previous members of the Select Committee, as they bring a
certain perspective that none of the rest of us have or would have
wanted, given the length of time that they served on that Committee.
Their remarks have always contributed to positive debate and I am
grateful to them both.</div>

the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South made
about the opportunity for petitioners to speak to the Committee, raise
the issues with which they had concerns and have them addressed. A
discretionary hardship policy exists that allows qualifying landowners
to require the purchase of their property. Of course, it is
discretionary and will not meet all the demands of the hon. Member for

						</b> Before we move on, I want some clarification from
the Minister. The clause disapplies the provisions of the Water
Resources Act 1991, which prohibits any form of water abstraction if it
has injurious effects on another person. I understand that water
abstraction might be a necessary part of the works performed to build
Crossrail, but there are some serious implications that I want to
consider with the Minister. Have the deposited plans identified any
scenarios in which water will need to be abstracted in a way that might
cause loss or damage? As I understand it, the clause is one of the few
that has no precedent in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996. The
Minister wants extra new powers that have no precedent. I am sure that
they will be necessary because of the uniqueness of the Crossrail
project, but will he tell us why the Secretary of State will need those
plans and where on the identified route they are likely to
apply?</div>

							<a name="07112812000425">Mr.

						</b> As far as I know, the hon. Gentleman is correct
that the measure is unprecedented in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act.
The Bill is not intended as a carbon copy of that Act and many of the
clauses in the Bill will be adopted by future Governments to inform the
construction of their policy.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>
					<a name="07112812000124"><div class="hs_Para">Clause 54(1)
disapplies the provisions of the Water Resources Act 1991 that would
otherwise impose an absolute prohibition on
abstracting water if that causes loss or damage to another person. Such
a restriction could well prevent or delay Crossrail works from being
constructed. Clause 54(2) provides that where water abstraction has
caused loss or damage, the person suffering the loss or damage must be
compensated. The overall effect of the clause is that the duty to avoid
damage by water abstraction creates the possibility of compensation for
damage but not the possibility of a court injunction. The practical
protection for property owners arises from the requirement that the
Environment Agency pre-approve abstraction, for which the hon.
Gentleman can refer to paragraph 3 of part 3 of schedule 16.</div>
					<a name="07112812000125"><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman asked
whether any work had been done that would suggest that water

Once again, because we are at such an early stage without even having
started construction, the purpose of those who drafted the Bill was to
try to foresee all circumstances in the hope that the powers in the
clause would not ever have to be used. Once again, going back to the
cost and importance of the project, it is only fair that we should

							<a name="07112812000426">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> In the same spirit as my comments on clause 54, I
want to clarify some points with the Minister. Clause 56 effectively
allows most of the provisions in the Bill to apply to any proposed
extension of the Crossrail network. Does that mean any extension that
is carried out under an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992? I
can see that if the network is expanded, it should
receive the same statutory support as planned under the network.
However, unless I have read the clause completely wrongly, would not an
extension to the Crossrail network that occurred or was proposed in the
construction period re-hybridise the Bill? The extension would then be
subject to the same scrutiny that the hon. Member for Leicester, South
has indicated he experienced and
enjoyed.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000427">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I strongly suspect that the hon. Gentleman has
read the clause completely wrongly, but I shall try to explain. Clause
56 allows any TWA order that relates to a proposed extension of
Crossrail or to provision of a facility connected with Crossrail to
apply to any provision of the Bill, with any modifications necessary to
the order, or to provide that any provision of the Bill should have
effect as if the extension were part of Crossrail.</div>
					<a name="07112812000132"><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain the purpose of
Clause 56. As the hon. Gentleman knows from earlier debates, the Bill
establishes a bespoke regime for Crossrail. It modifies
and disapplies various pieces of legislation, and
replaces them with a tailor-made regime that is based heavily on that
created by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>Indeed, he will recall from our debate last week
that the Bill creates a bespoke planning and railway regulatory regime
for Crossrail.</div>

order is subsequently sought for an extension to Crossrail&#151;for
example, to Reading or Ebbsfleet&#151;or for a new Crossrail facility
such as a new station, the TWA order cannot necessarily apply the same
regime to the works as is established by the Bill. The reason is that,
as a form of delegated legislation, TWA orders are limited in their
ability to modify the application of
legislation.</div>

think that, in fact, I read the clause correctly, and I still have not
had the answer to my question. The question was whether any route
extension to Crossrail can be made without it being subject to hybrid
Bill provisions, such that it does not require the same
scrutiny&#151;nor present the same possibility of
petitioning&#151;as was the case for the original route. If that is
the correct position, it is a curious one.</div>

present&#151;could be achieved through a TWA order rather than
through the hybrid Bill process. Perhaps I could continue to the end of
my remarks, and if the hon. Gentleman then has further questions I
shall be happy to answer them.</div>
					<a name="07112812000138"><div class="hs_Para">The clause would allow any TWA
order to make the necessary provision to ensure that any extension or
new facility was subject to the same regime as the Crossrail scheme
covered by the Bill. The Government believe that that
makes perfect sense. It would be confusing and unhelpful if one regime
applied to parts of Crossrail and another applied to others. Having
said that, there are safeguards. Certain provisions of the Bill that
deal with extension of compulsory purchase powers, listed buildings,
buildings in conservation areas and ancient monuments are excluded from
such application. Any TWA order that sought to apply the Crossrail Bill
regime would of course follow the normal procedures for such orders.
Those affected would have the opportunity to object to any aspects of
the Bill regime that the order proposed should apply, and have their
concerns heard by an independent inspector as part of the TWA order
process.</div>

						</b> I am not sure whether I can add to the comments
that I have already made. The situation remains that a TWA order can
extend Crossrail. The hon. Lady mentioned safeguarding. The decision to
safeguard, for example, the route to Reading is on my desk, and I will
be considering that in the very near future. That would simply keep
options open, so that in the future the Government could choose,
through a TWA order, to extend Crossrail to Reading. Once again, I must
emphasise that that is not what the Government propose at the moment. I
talked merely about safeguarding. However, that is the process that
would have to be gone through if Crossrail were to be extended either
westwards to Reading or south to
Ebbsfleet.</div>

					<a name="07112812000148"><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
15 is obviously important, in that it deals with the steps that must be
taken to reinstate facilities that have necessarily been taken out of
use as a result of the construction of Crossrail.
Paragraph 1(4) provides that the
reinstatement</div>
					<a name="07112812000361"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;need not
be on the site where the facilities were situated prior to

					<a name="07112812000149"><div class="hs_Para">Of
course, in a perfect world, once Crossrail was up and running, we would
be able to return buildings and facilities affected by construction to
their original state and, in most cases, to their original location and
no one would know that it had been a construction site before. This is
not a perfect world and I acknowledge that in a number of cases it
might not be possible to do that. However, as the Bill stands, there is
no obligation on the nominated undertaker even to try to reinstate the
disused facilities in their original location.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>
					<a name="07112812000150"><div class="hs_Para">My amendment is designed to
address that gap in the Bill. If the amendment were to prevail, the
nominated undertaker would have a duty to reinstate the facility on its
original site if it were possible physically to do that. If it were
found to be physically impossible, he would have to reinstate the
facility as near to the original site as he could. That seems a logical
and reasonable way to ensure that the damage caused by Crossrail
construction is, to as great an extent as possible, reversed once the
construction work is done and reversed in such a way that the original
facility is put back in its original state. I look forward to the
Minister commenting on the
amendment.</div>
					<a name="07112812000151"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000437">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment is
perfectly reasonable and sensible. Nevertheless, I ask my colleagues to
resist it if it is pressed to a vote, because it is not appropriate to
this clause. Schedule 15 relates to the reinstatement of facilities
that have been discontinued as a result of the construction of
Crossrail, and provides for conditions to be placed on the deemed
planning permission granted by the Bill for such reinstatement if it
has been environmentally assessed. That reinstatement may be on the
original site or elsewhere within Bill limits, which is to say that it
must be within the limits set out in the Bill for land to be acquired
or used. For example, there is a concrete batching plant at Royal Oak
that falls within an area that we need for a worksite. We are in the
process of negotiating an agreement with the owners of the plant
regarding the provision of a replacement facility. The amendment would
mean that any such replacement facility would have to be placed on, or
as close as possible to, the original
facility.</div>
					<a name="07112812000152"><div class="hs_Para">Proximity to
the original site is not the only, or even the most important, factor
when deciding on the most appropriate site for
reinstated facilities. Generally speaking, Crossrail works will have
altered the site and the former location of a facility may no longer be
the best one. When deciding on the best location for a reinstated
facility, there may be a number of factors to balance, including the
operational needs of the business, the operational needs of Crossrail
and the impact on neighbouring sites. Depending on the circumstances of
the case, it is possible that all of those factors might point towards
relocating the facility. The availability of sufficient land within the
limits set out in the Bill for land to be acquired or used, may also be
a consideration.</div>
					<a name="07112812000153"><div class="hs_Para">That
said, for facilities that we intend to reinstate, we currently expect
to put the replacement facility very close to the site of the original,
where practicable. For instance, there is a Travellers&#146; site in
Tower Hamlets that will need to be used for a worksite. To meet the
desires of the Travellers and the local authority, we plan to relocate
them to a site adjacent to the existing one. I believe that it overlaps
the existing site. We do not think that it would be appropriate always
to constrain the position of a new site in the manner proposed. It
would not necessarily result in a location that pleased anyone. Local
amenity considerations regarding the site of replacement facilities
could mean that it would be wrong, in planning terms, to reinstate near
an existing
site.</div>
					<a name="07112812000154"><div class="hs_Para">There are a
range of considerations that the Secretary of State might take into
account in the public interest. I should stress, however, that the Bill
provides deemed planning permission for reinstated works only 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>if an appropriate environmental assessment has been carried out and
reported in an environmental statement accompanying Bill. The amendment
is a touch too prescriptive and represents some form of
over-regulation. I do not think that it is appropriate to this part of
the Bill, although I accept that the intention behind the amendment is
good.</div>

							<a name="07112812000438">Sir
Peter Soulsby:
						</b> I will not harp on for too long about what
was discussed at the hybrid Bill Committee, but I will back up what the
Minister has said. At that Committee, a number of the
representations were made about those who will have to be relocated
temporarily and about whether it was appropriate for them to be
reinstated on the original site or whether some alternatives were to be
found. Those who were to be affected had an opportunity to petition and
many took it.</div>
					<a name="07112812000156"><div class="hs_Para">To
accept the amendment would be too prescriptive. The solutions that were
found were in some cases quite creative, but in almost all cases meant
that the petitioners whose land was to be affected would find
themselves in a better position than they had been
in.</div>
					<a name="07112812000157"><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
mentioned one example of a concrete batching plant.
That was a case that we spent a considerable time on and came to some
particular solutions that were satisfactory to all parties concerned. I

unnecessary, given the consideration at the hybrid Bill Committee and
that which will be given in another

that the Minister accepts that we are on to something and I take his

no firm obligation to restore sites as close as possible to the
original site. I take the Minister&#146;s point that it will be done
as much as is practically possible in as many cases as possible. I take

planning permission for reinstated facilities or to disapply or modify
the application of schedule 7 to such works. As the duty to publish is
a duty placed on the Secretary of State, she must be the one to decide
what is the most appropriate manner to do so. Moreover, I remind the

permission is given and to anyone else who might be affected. That
might incur a little additional work for the Secretary of State but it

<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>the Crossrail network. It deals, in turn, with highways,
utilities, water issues, electronic communication
networks, waterways and finally the Port of London Authority. In each
case, there is a sub-paragraph that deals with dispute resolution.
Disputes will be settled by arbitration if the two parties agree; if
the two parties do not agree, then, with the proviso that the dispute
is not about money, it will be up to the Secretary of State to appoint
someone to find a
solution.</div>
					<a name="07112812000187"><div class="hs_Para">I do not
want to regurgitate the concern that we have had all the way along
about arbitration. All I will say is that, given the
fact that there will be a very real relationship between the nominated

where&#151;we have been through this before&#151;the defendant is
trying his own case.</div>
					<a name="07112812000188"><div class="hs_Para">It seems to me that the
arbitration process that should be employed should be fair and
independent, and the Secretary of State should not intervene in that
process. The decision of a third party arbitrator will
enjoy the benefits of authority and impartiality. The
Secretary of State, however much they believe themselves to have a duty
of responsibility, cannot be seen to be independent. Therefore, it
should not be the job of the Secretary of State to resolve disputes of
this
kind.</div>

						</b> Schedule 16 contains protection for
various bodies and statutory undertakers whose
interests and functions may be affected by the powers of the Bill. In
each case, there is provision for determination of disputes, with the
nominated undertaker to be referred to arbitration if the parties agree
or if the dispute relates to the amount of payment. Otherwise, the
dispute is determined by a person appointed by the relevant Secretary
of State; that is the Secretary of State for Transport, together
with&#151;where it is a different Secretary of State&#151;the
Secretary of State who has the responsibility of overseeing the
statutory undertaking in question. In other words, for the water
industry it would be the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs, and so
on.</div>
					<a name="07112812000190"><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendments would require all disputes to be referred
to arbitration. May I refer him to the response that I gave in relation
to the similar issues in respect of amendments Nos. 26 and 27? Giving
the Secretary of State the ability to determine disputes on various
matters is well precedented for projects of national significance and
follows similar provisions in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996.
Arbitration can be a time-consuming and costly experience that may not
be consistent with the timely implementation of the project.</div>
					<a name="07112812000191"><div class="hs_Para">In this case, however, we have
gone beyond the precedent in CTRL in spelling out that disputes are to
be determined by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and we
have also provided that any disputes about the amount of money payable
will be settled by arbitration: such disputes would not hold up
implementation of the project in the way that a dispute over approval
of plans of the works might do. The statutory undertakers concerned
have the additional reassurance that the Secretary of State responsible
for them will be one of the Secretaries of State appointing the person
to determine the
dispute.</div>

has given assurances about how the powers will be exercised. My
understanding is that the statutory undertakers are now content with

Gentleman&#146;s question directly, he will know that it is intended
that the Mayor and TfL will be responsible for the delivery of the
project, and the powers in clause 59 might be needed to facilitate
their taking the project forward. That said, I have to disappoint him
because it is not yet clear which of the powers that are listed in
subsection (7) will be devolved to the Mayor and/or TfL or whether the
project governance arrangements that have been announced could be
better delivered by other means. However, we believe it is right that
the Secretary of State should be capable of devolving specific powers
in the Bill if that is what is decided should
happen.</div>

Cross London Rail Links Ltd will continue as a project delivery vehicle
for Crossrail. The Department for Transport will remain as a co-sponsor
of the project and will form a joint sponsors board with Transport for
London to supervise the project. The Department and TfL will execute a
series of formal arrangements that will specify how the project will be
taken forward. CLRL will become a wholly owned subsidiary of TfL, but
with a level of independence needed to focus solely on delivery of the
Crossrail project for its joint
clients.</div>

have a board dominated by independent, non-executive

with&#151; and free to appoint a world-class team at market rates.
The written statement issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Transport that accompanied the publication of the heads of
terms provides more detail about how the Department and the Mayor, as
co-sponsors, will take the project forward. I hope that the explanation
that I have given and the material with which I supplied each member of

							<a name="07112812000466">Stephen

						</b> Amendment No. 72 is very simple and needs little
explanation. It would merely require documents that are to be served
under the Crossrail Act to be sent by registered post. As the Committee
will be aware, a registered item of mail is recorded in a register when
it moves from a local post office, through the sorting office and on to
its final destination. It incurs a small extra cost and provides the
added comfort that the item&#146;s location can be tracked through
the postal system. Those of us who have just experienced the
circumstances of October, including many of my constituents, will
understand that, if the document is important, that protection would be
not only relevant, but appropriate. It is a small measure that would
ensure that the Secretary of State&#146;s documents get to the people
concerned, and the excuse that mail got lost in the post would not
apply. I therefore hope that the amendment will find the
Minister&#146;s favour.</div>
					<a name="07112812000225"><div class="hs_Para">I will not spend long talking
about amendment No. 73, whose purpose is to fill a
small gap in the clause. The clause states that, for non-UK businesses,

					<a name="07112812000363"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;principal office within the

					<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>
					<a name="07112812000226"><div class="hs_Para">All I am suggesting is
that there may be a situation in which the company in question does not
have an office in this country. The amendment
provides that the documents by delivered to the company&#146;s legal
representative in the UK and fills a minor gap. I will not press
amendment No. 73 but I am interested to see why the Minister feels
unable to accept amendment No. 72, if indeed that is his
desire.</div>
					<a name="07112812000227"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000467">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The clause deals with the service of documents
under the Bill. Its purpose is to set out how notices under the Bill
should be served. Amendment No. 72 would require that any document
served under the Bill by way of the postal system should be delivered
by registered post. It is important to realise that that would apply to
any person serving a notice, whether they were the
Secretary of State, the nominated undertaker or any other member of the
public serving a counter-notice. A number of provisions provide for
other parties to serve notice on the nominated
undertaker, and the amendment would require such notices to be served
by registered post. Using some method of registered post might be
sensible in some cases. It is in the interest of the person serving the
notice to ensure that it reaches the intended recipient, as the person
serving the notice would be disadvantaged if, in the event of a
dispute, they could not later demonstrate that the notice had been
properly served. The hon. Gentleman was right to point that
out.</div>
					<a name="07112812000228"><div class="hs_Para">Registered post
is more expensive than regular post and cost may be a
consideration in some cases&#151;presumably not for the Secretary of
State, but possibly for private individuals. The person concerned
should decide how they wish to proceed, bearing in mind that it may
later be a matter of dispute before a court or other judicial
body.</div>
					<a name="07112812000229"><div class="hs_Para">I am
instinctively opposed to any measure that might incur the accusation of
ushering in a nanny state, and I would have thought that a legislator
prescribing the method of post that an individual should use to serve
any particular notice is perilously close to territory that might lead
the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>to take issue. That does not concern me, but it
might concern Opposition Members.
</div>
					<a name="07112812000230"><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 73
would allow documents to be served on legal representatives rather than
a business partnership. However, clause 61(4) already allows the person
on whom a notice would otherwise be served to specify an alternative
address to which documents should be served. That
allows a person to ask for notices to be served to the office of the
legal representative if they so wish. I therefore consider the
amendments unnecessary, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
consider withdrawing the amendment.</div>

the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>would rather like the amendment. It gives
protection to the small person and allows them to know with absolute

						</b> The Bill contains provisions for various matters
to be referred to arbitration. For example, if the parties agree,
disputes with highway authorities under schedule 3
and with various statutory undertakers under schedule 16 can be
referred to arbitration. Subsection (5) allows the Secretaries of State
for Communities and Local Government and for Transport acting jointly
to make the rules governing such arbitration. The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s amendment would remove that power.</div>
					<a name="07112812000258"><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(5) follows a similar provision to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act
1996. It address the possibility that it may be necessary to have
special tailor-made provisions to address the settling of disputes
arising under a scheme of the complexity, size and importance of the
Crossrail project. Two Secretaries of State will have responsibility
for that, rather than just the Secretary of State for Transport, and
they will have to ensure that such rules are consistent with the
principles of natural justice.</div>
					<a name="07112812000259"><div class="hs_Para">I am not saying that it will
not be necessary to make such rules; however, it is important that the
Secretaries of State should have the power to do so should it be
considered that the need arises. The amendment would
remove the power of the Secretaries of State for
Communities and Local Government and for Transport to make rules about
procedure in relation to arbitration under the Bill. The clause was
applied successfully to former Conservative Secretaries of State and it
worked extremely well under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996. I

arbitration it is because both parties agree to it. If the procedure is
in some sense up in the air, and it has to be enforced by Secretaries
of State against the will of one or perhaps even both parties,
that runs wholly counter to the notion of what
arbitration is, and should, do. Arbitration is about parties getting
together on the basis that they agree not only on its application but
presumably on the procedure for it. That is why my hon. Friend the
Member for Wimbledon thinks that subsection (5) is redundant, and I
agree with him. Nothing that the Minister has said has convinced us
otherwise. One hopes that the provision will never be invoked, and I
suspect that it never will be, because if such a dispute began the
parties would not wish to go to arbitration, still less accept an
arbitration procedure that was pushed upon them by Secretaries of
State.</div>

Harris:
						</b> May I clarify the position? The clause
does not propose that the Secretary of State for

two Secretaries of State agreeing a procedure for
arbitration.</div>

take powers that will enable them to become party to a dispute and seek
arbitration, yet at the same time try to affect the arbitration process

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000503">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> The clause is the standard clause that appears in
Bills that provide for the expenditure of public money. It simply
provides that any expenditure by the Secretary of State under the
Bill</div>
					<a name="07112812000364"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall be paid out
of money provided by
Parliament&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112812000287"><div class="hs_Para">The
content of the clause itself is entirely
uncontentious.</div>
					<a name="07112812000288"><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the new clauses, the hon. Member for Wimbledon seeks to
achieve transparency in the way that Crossrail will be funded. I am
happy to say that the Government agree that
transparency about Crossrail is desirable, as evidenced by the
documentation that we have already made available, to which I referred
in an earlier sitting. I can give comfort to the Committee that we
intend to more information public in future. Yesterday, a copy of the
heads of terms agreed by the Secretary of State for Transport and
Transport for London were placed in the Library of the House. Some
details have been redacted to protect commercial confidentiality, but
the key terms of the deal between the co-sponsors of the project are
now in the public domain. We and TfL need to produce the detailed
arrangements that will support the heads of terms. That will involve
the production of a large number of documents, which we expect to take
several months to finalise. Our presumption is that those documents
will be made public, again subject to the need protecting commercial
interests.</div>
					<a name="07112812000289"><div class="hs_Para">Turning to
new clause 2, the publication yesterday of the heads of terms means
that the Government have in practice already published the
information that proposed subsection (1) would require. May I make it
clear that we intend to make public the relevant detailed agreements
that will be negotiated over the coming months to implement the heads
of terms? I believe that that will deal in large part with what
proposed subsection (2) seeks to achieve. The issue of the wider
financial consequences of Crossrail for London mentioned in proposed
subsection (2) (b) is a matter for the Mayor. I expect that he would
want to be very clear with Londoners about that, and he is subject to
ongoing scrutiny by the London
assembly.</div>
					<a name="07112812000290"><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
subsection (3) refers to the desire for ongoing information about
progress during construction. Our intention in that respect is captured
by paragraph 3.11.2 of the heads of terms, which makes it clear that
Cross London Rail Links Ltd will be required to publish
information,</div>
					<a name="07112812000365"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to ensure a
high level of transparency as to the progress and cost of the Crossrail
Project.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112812000291"><div class="hs_Para">To
conclude, while I sympathise with the sentiment underlying new clause
2, I think that it is unnecessary. I hope that I have made it clear
that the Government and the Mayor recognise the importance of keeping
the public well informed about the way in which Crossrail is taken
forward, and that we are already taking steps to do that. On that
basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Wimbledon will not press the new
clauses to a vote.</div>

					<a name="07112812000292"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000504">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Certainly, we have already had one attempt this
morning to introduce finance into our discussions, and the Minister
congratulated the hon. Member for Richmond Park on the elegant manner
in which she tried to inject the issue into this morning&#146;s
debate. I was tempted to speak in the debate on her amendment, but I
resisted the temptation to do so, because I expected to have the
opportunity to discuss my two new clauses and to speak on clause stand
part.</div>
					<a name="07112812000293"><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, clause 65 provides for the expenditure incurred by the Secretary
of State as a consequence of the Act to be paid for out of money
provided by Parliament. It is a standard clause and we have no problems
with it; we do not object to it. I have no doubt that, subject to
commercial confidentiality, the Government are keen, or certainly have
proved be keen, to provide details of the Crossrail package. In that
spirit, I want to offer my thanks to the Minister both the briefing
that he gave to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, who is a
Liberal Democrat spokesman, and me. I thank him, too, for the package
that he provided last night for Committee members&#151;that package
is now is in the Library. His spirit of transparency
and generosity is appreciated. However&#151;as the Minister would
expect, there is always a &#147;however&#148;&#151;the Bill gives
explanations of the moneys provided by Parliament but not by other
bodies. It does not provide, either, for updates to be delivered to
Parliament on the subject of funding and costing. That was what I might
have said about with the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment this morning:
although I thought it an excellent and elegant amendment, it was a
one-off, and did not require an annual statement to be made to
Parliament.</div>
					<a name="07112812000294"><div class="hs_Para">My new
clauses go further than the hon. Lady&#146;s amendment. We appreciate
and accept the Minister&#146;s generosity of spirit in making those
disclosures, but it would be wrong of us as the Opposition not to
ensure that adequate and appropriate protection is available. New
clause 2 would provide such protection by making
three provisions. First, it would ensure that the
Secretary of State makes available to Parliament details of funding
arrangements. Secondly, the Mayor of London, whoever that is at the
time, will commit Londoners to extra expenditure and potential
liability, and it is only right that he should provide them with a
statement of the financial consequences. I am not sure that I share the
Minister&#146;s confidence that every person elected Mayor would be
keen to provide such a statement. Thirdly, the new clause states that
the Secretary of State shall, after consultation, provide an annual
statement of costs and
liability.</div>
					<a name="07112812000295"><div class="hs_Para">The
justification for proposed subsection (1) is clear. The provision would
allow us to scrutinise the elements of the package, to undertake proper
risk analysis, and form a view on the financial probity of the
providers, before considering the provisions behind the finance package
and the financial model so that we could take taking a view on the
associated risk. The Conservatives have said throughout the
parliamentary process&#151;I am sure that the Liberal Democrats have
done so, too&#151;that we support the principle of Crossrail, but
that we would need to see the funding. The Minister has acted in a
spirit of generosity and transparency, and it is appropriate that we
enshrine that transparency in the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>
					<a name="07112812000296"><div class="hs_Para">Proposed subsection (2) is
simple. All councils have to provide an annual statement on how they
deliver services and how those services are paid for. The subsection
would not place any greater requirement on the Mayor of London.
He is happy to commit Londoners to potential liability as a co-sponsor,
so he should be happy to tell Londoners exactly what the financial
consequences of his actions will be. I see no problem with that, and I
am sure that Londoners would appreciate it.</div>
					<a name="07112812000297"><div class="hs_Para">Proposed subsection (3) would
provide for an annual statement or update. As we embark on the
building, maintenance and operation of Crossrail, we do need more than
a snapshot in the House; we need dynamics. If there were a problem of
overspend or&#151;less likely, I suspect&#151;underspend, or if was
a delay, the new clause makes provision for Parliament to be notified
of such things, which would be subject to
parliamentary scrutiny. I have listened carefully to the Minister. We
are grateful that he has deposited information with us, and we thank
him sincerely for doing so. At the same time, I hope that he recognises
that it is the Opposition&#146;s duty to make sure that his spirit of
generosity is not transitory and that it is enshrined in one of the
most important parts of the Bill so that it will be available for
future scrutiny. I shall therefore seek to divide the Committee on new
clause
2.</div>
				
					<a name="07112812000378"><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07112812000298"><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3 is
a simple but important housekeeping measure. This is an exceptional
project, and it requires exceptional powers and exceptional discretion.
We have recognised that spirit throughout. The
Secretary of State has been granted powers of compulsory acquisition
both within and without the scope of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965;
she has been granted rights of easement and licences; and she has been
granted powers of purchase along the deemed route within and without
the limits of deviation. We all accept that that is necessary and
desirable.</div>
					<a name="07112812000299"><div class="hs_Para">After
Crossrail is built, however, there will undoubtedly be land excess to
the needs of the Crossrail operation. I am sure that any member of this
Committee, particularly those who served on the Select Committee, can
think of petitions they have heard where the land that is going to be
used for the building of Crossrail will not be necessary for its
operation. The Government and the operators of Crossrail will not
necessarily want to be a landlord so that excess land should be
disposed of. The proceeds from the disposal of the surplus lands should
be directed to reducing the overall costs and funding the compensation
payments. This is a sensible housekeeping measure and I commend it to
the
Committee.</div>
					<a name="07112812000300"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000505">Susan
Kramer:
						</b> I will be very brief. Obviously I was sad that
those on the Conservative Front Bench could not see their way to
supporting my amendment because it gave the advantage to the House of
being able to give its assent to the final package on Crossrail. I,
too, am very impressed by the generous amount of information that has
been provided by the Minister. However, there is an issue of underlying
principle that is worth establishing. We have noticed that every time
there is an issue here, reference goes back to the channel tunnel 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>rail link and no doubt future Bills will all talk about what was in this
Bill. Establishing the ongoing principle on the face of the Bill that
information should be disclosed on a regular basis is probably no bad
item to have.</div>
					<a name="07112812000301"><div class="hs_Para">Again,
although we all have a great deal of confidence in this Minister, the
project runs way out into the future. It would be sad to give leeway to
others to provide less disclosure than the current Government are
willing and able to do. Although I shall support the new clause tabled
by Conservative Members, if for some reason it should fail, will the
Minister consider these matters and reflect his own attitude towards
transparency in a clause that he might bring forward at a future date
to ensure that providing information is an ongoing
principle?</div>
					<a name="07112812000302"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000506">Mr.
Binley:
						</b> I apologise to the Committee for detaining hon.
Members for perhaps longer than they might have hoped, but financial
accountability and especially annual reporting are vital matters. I
want to talk briefly about why I believe them to be so important. Most
people know that my background is in a business environment. Annual
reporting creates a discipline that simply is not created in any other
way. It creates an accountability that gives credibility to a
project.</div>
					<a name="07112812000303"><div class="hs_Para">The second
thing that annual reporting provides is the ability
to put things right if they are not going right. We have seen too many
projects from Governments of all political persuasions that have gone
wrong because they have not been properly managed. It is all very well
seeing a problem, putting money into it, and, finally, setting targets,
but that is not the secret of management. The secret of management is
managing the process thereafter. Very often it does not mater whether
the decision made about a specific issue falls within a set of
parameters, but it clearly matters if it is managed, fine tuned,
tweaked and the subject of drastic effort in a way that changes a
process that is clearly going wrong. Financial reporting allows a
process to be looked at in a clearer way than almost any other
mechanism.</div>
					<a name="07112812000304"><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
a company would have to proceed along the lines that I have described,
but it is not clear that that applies in this case, even if we bear in
mind the constitution of the package that we are talking about with
regard to Crossrail. I want to ensure that it does apply. Putting the
new clause into the Bill offers a protection not only
for respective Governments&#151;because it is likely that this
process will be undertaken by respective Governments as it goes on into
the future&#151;but for the taxpayer, who will contribute sizeably to
the project. It is not only the taxpayer in London who will contribute,
but also those throughout the rest of the
country.</div>
					<a name="07112812000305"><div class="hs_Para">I
therefore urge the Minister, whom I know to be keen on transparent
government, to consider the process, even if on this occasion he does
not accept it. At the very least, will he come back on Report with a
mechanism that would accede to this request, which I am sure that he
feels in his heart is
sensible?</div>
					<a name="07112812000306"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000507">Mr.
Field:
						</b> Just for once, let us be wise before rather than
after the event. The Minister and I have been in Parliament for exactly
the same time, six and a half years, and there is a sense of
d√(c)j√  vu as I consider many of the Bills on which I served
on the Committee.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>
					<a name="07112812000307"><div class="hs_Para">For example, the first Bill
Committee that I sat on was the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; we pointed
out, time and again, the enormous costs that would go into setting up
the associated agency. On the Enterprise Act 2002, we repeatedly talked
about the risk of allowing too many 20-somethings to become bankrupt,
but all that came to pass. On the Licensing Act 2003, I talked
endlessly about the notion of 24-hour drinking and the risible idea
that bringing in more flexible licensing laws would somehow lead to a
Parisian drinking culture on the streets of London and of the country.
Likewise, on the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006, we
endlessly talked about the spiralling costs, and, of course, they are
precisely what have come to
pass.</div>
					<a name="07112812000308"><div class="hs_Para">Our biggest
concern in relation to Crossrail is not the idea of it, as the project
is something that we very much support, but the notion of blight if the
proper funding is not put into place. I fear that, notwithstanding the
assurances made by the Minister and the Prime Minister over the last
six or seven weeks, the funding package for Crossrail is a good deal
less robust than we would like it to be. It is for that reason that I
totally support new clause 2, and my hon. Friends have put forward
robust reasoning for it. I fear, however, that if we do not get this
right and we do not get the proper funding in place, there will in
years to come be a sort of half-Crossrail that will not do anything
like as much as it is planned to do at this stage; there will be a
phase 1, with phase 2 or 3 deep in the future, which will never come to
pass because of the enormous, spiralling
costs.</div>
					<a name="07112812000309"><div class="hs_Para">We need to get
this right, and the worst of all worlds, as I have
said, is that countless numbers of constituents, not only in my
constituency, but in dozens across London and the south-east, will have
their lives blighted by being on the Crossrail route, with very little
prospect of the project coming to fruition, unless we get the funding
right. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will give serious
consideration to ensuring that, for once, we are genuinely wise before
rather than after the event.</div>
					<a name="07112812000310"><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000508">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I have already made some comments about new clause
2. Shortly, I would like to make some comments in response to the
comments by the hon. Member for Wimbledon about new clause 3.</div>
					<a name="07112812000311"><div class="hs_Para">First, I would like to respond
to what the hon. Member for Richmond Park has said. I do not feel that
a commitment in the Bill to the kind of reporting that she is looking
for would be appropriate in this case. I understand why she and other
members of the Committee have belittled the notion of always using the
precedent of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 to justify a
particular clause in this Bill, but let me suggest a corollary of that.
Can she, or indeed any other member of the Committee, name a piece of
legislation about a large infrastructure project where this kind of
reporting, aimed at creating the level of transparency that we all want
to see, has been included in the Bill? It is a rhetorical question; I

whether he thinks that, although there is no precedent, it is time that
we set one? That is the point about this new clause. We want to improve
government and I am sure that he also wants to improve it. On that
basis, and in the spirit of going forward to ensure that we have more
transparent government, surely he would accept that
point.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07112812000512">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> There is a good reason why such commitments have
not been included in previous legislation. I must say to the hon.
Gentleman that I am not about to make political history and create a
precedent with the Crossrail
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112812000316"><div class="hs_Para">On the comments
of the hon. Member for Cities of London and
Westminster, I am clearly far more optimistic than he is about the
robustness of the financial package that has been put together. Time
will tell, but I think that the amount of work that has been put into
creating that financial package will show in time that that package is
extremely impressive and, I must say, robust.</div>
					<a name="07112812000317"><div class="hs_Para">The purpose of the hon. Member
for Wimbledon in proposing new clause 3 is to ensure
that</div>
					<a name="07112812000366"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any land or
property...if deemed thereafter surplus to the needs of this Act,
shall be disposed
thereof&#148;</div>
					<a name="07112812000318"><div class="hs_Para">and
the proceeds will be used for Crossrail-related purposes. I can assure
him that this new clause is unnecessary. The Secretary of State has
already given a number of undertakings on the matter of the land
disposal policy. These form part of the environmental minimal
requirements and she has given undertakings to Parliament on the
enforcement of those requirements. The relevant paragraph in that
policy is as
follows:</div>
					<a name="07112812000367"><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
any land which has been acquired and used for the construction of
Crossrail is:</div>
					<a name="07112812000368"><div class="hs_brev">(i) no
longer required for the satisfactory completion of the Crossrail
works;</div>
					<a name="07112812000369"><div class="hs_brev">(ii) not
required in connection with the operation of Crossrail;
</div>
					<a name="07112812000370"><div class="hs_brev">it will be sold subject firstly
to the Crichel Down Rules 2004 and to the extent that this does not
apply, then in accordance with this
policy&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07112812000319"><div class="hs_Para">As I am sure the
hon. Member for Wimbledon will recall, those rules provide for the
circumstances in which land acquired under threat of compulsion but no
longer required for public purposes will be offered back to the former
owner. The requirement under the rules to offer land back is not
unqualified.</div>
					<a name="07112812000320"><div class="hs_Para">The terms
of the Crossrail land disposal policy were
published in advance of the Select Committee&#146;s
consideration of the Bill. Therefore, they have formed the backdrop for
many agreements reached with persons whose property would be subject to
compulsory purchase as a consequence of the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07112812000321"><div class="hs_Para">On the question of the use of
the proceeds, I assure the hon. Member for Wimbledon that it is
integral to the funding package announced by my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister last month that the proceeds will be applied for
Crossrail purposes. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, however, the
timing of those receipts is unlikely to marry with the timing of
payments of compensation and therefore they will go towards the
repayment of Transport for London borrowing to finance the
project.</div>
					<a name="07112812000322"><div class="hs_Para">The heads of
terms between the Department for Transport and Transport for London,
setting out the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 145</div>details of the funding arrangements, were published
yesterday, as the hon. Member for Wimbledon will know. He will find in
the table on uses and sources of funds, at paragraph 4.1.3 of those
heads of terms, that it is envisaged that &#163;500 million will be
raised from sales of surplus land and property. With
those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider not
pressing the new clause to a Division.</div>

							<a name="07112812000526">Mr.
Harris:
						</b> I want to take this opportunity to thank you, Lady
Winterton, for your service as Chair to the
Committee. As I predicted in our first sitting, it
has been a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. You have been
extremely clear and genuinely helped the progress of the Bill. I also
thank the Clerk, the <i class="I">Hansard</i> team, the police officers who have
managed to keep 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>order, my own officials whose advice has been absolutely invaluable and,
of course, my private secretary, Sandra St. Louis.</div>
					<a name="07112812000348"><div class="hs_Para">I noticed the hon. Member for
Wimbledon looking with envy at the ranks of officials who offer me
advice. May I thank him for his very positive approach to the Bill? It
was a pleasure to debate some of the issues with him and with the hon.
Member for Richmond Park. I am not sure whether it is normally done,
but when there are Whips around it is never a bad thing to pay tribute
to the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside for his contribution and help
throughout this process. If I have missed anyone I
apologise.</div>

						</b> May I echo the Minister&#146;s remarks? It has
been a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton. We
have undertaken these proceedings in an orderly and timely way. I am
grateful for your forbearance to those of us who jumped up at the wrong
time and in the wrong place. I think that the Committee has been
characterised by the words, &#147;Channel Tunnel
Rail Link Act&#148;, &#147;compensation&#148;,
&#147;arbitration&#148; and, occasionally,
&#147;accountability&#148;.</div>

							<a name="07112812000529">Stephen
Hammond:
						</b> Indeed. According to my count, the Minister
kindly said that if I withdrew three of my amendments, he would bring
them back on Report. On that basis, I count the score
as Opposition 3: Government 104. None the less, I pay tribute to the
Minister for his genuine spirit of transparency in obtaining
information for us and debating with us. Like him, I thank the Clerk
for his invaluable help and assistance. I thank the <i class="I">Hansard
</i>reporters and the police. I thank my colleagues, my hon. Friends
the Members for Cities of London and Westminster, for Ilford, North,
for Northampton, South, and for Rugby and
Kenilworth.</div>
					<a name="07112812000352"><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
thank those who have given the Minister divine inspiration, which has
been extremely helpful in moving the Committee forward. In the same
vein of tribute, I thank my researcher, who has given me divine
inspiration at times. I calculated that as Opposition 1: Government 6.
These proceedings have been useful and helpful, and Members on both
sides of the Committee will agree that we wish to give the Bill speedy,
yet proper, scrutiny in the House. I think that we can be pleased with
what we have tried to do in
Committee.</div>

Kramer:
						</b> I will be brief, but I should like to take the
opportunity to express my thanks for your patience and generosity, Lady
Winterton. I know, from my little experience in working on such Bills,
that it is genuinely appreciated. I wish to express that same sense of
appreciation to the Public Bill Office and to the Clerk. They make a
great deal of difference when one is a novice. Their assistance
in getting things drafted, even elegantly drafted, was valuable. I
thank the <i class="I">Hansard </i>reporters and the police. I would thank my
colleagues, but that is somewhat tricky under the circumstances. I
express thanks, however, to my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton
and Wallington who covered for me when I was unavoidably absent for
several hours. I appreciate his generosity, as he acted purely from
kindness of spirit.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>
					<a name="07112812000354"><div class="hs_Para">The views that have been
expressed are all positively in favour of Crossrail. That is an
important message that needs to go out as the Bill makes its progress
through the House. A number of markers have been put down, particularly
on disclosure and the wish of the House to know the details and to
understand the financial structure of the Bill. Such things
should not be forgotten, even though those votes did not
necessarily carry the day. I thank the Minister for his
willingness to provide information and to be
supportive. I only wish that all the Ministers with whom I have dealt
in my two years in the House took a similar
latitude.</div>

						</b> Before I put the final question, on behalf of
everyone who has been thanked, may I thank 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>members of the Committee for their thanks? It has been a pleasure to
chair the Bill. We have debated in great good spirit and a lot of
kindly humour, and it has genuinely been a very pleasant experience. It
has also been interesting to watch a Minister on his maiden voyage in
Committee, and we wish him well for the future: the same goes for the
Opposition spokespeople. We are always indebted to the Clerks
Department and to our Clerk in particular for his very valuable advice,
to the reporters of the <i class="I">Official Report</i> and to the police who
have ensured that nothing untoward happened in the
Committee.</div>
