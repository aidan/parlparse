<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Humfrey Malins </B>(Woking): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. May I say what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair? I am sure that the Minister of State and other Front-Bench spokesmen will say the same.
<P>
When we concluded our deliberations on Tuesday, the Minister was responding to several concerns that had been raised during our debate on clause 2. This morning, some of us have received from the Minister a letter dated 29 April. In it, he encloses a copy of the draft guidance on anti-social behaviour orders for the benefit, he says, of the Committee's consideration today. Several Labour and Opposition Members will not have had a chance properly to consider the measures in the letter, which runs to several pages; indeed, some might not have received it in the post this morning. Why has it come so very late? We are already part of the way through the debate on clause 2, and many Opposition Members want ample time to consider the measures.
<P>
At the bottom of the first page, the document states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It should be noted ... that it" <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the document 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"contains the intentions for how the provisions should operate in practice as discussed in Parliament."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My hon. Friends and I feel that we have not had the opportunity to discuss the provisions in Parliament. Will the Minister tell us exactly when we did so? I cannot recall. Will the Minister confirm that vital papers will not be served so very late in future? If papers are likely to arrive late again, it would be sensible to adjourn the Committee's deliberations for six months until the Government have got their house in order.
<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Alun Michael) rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The point of order was addressed to me. I have been indulgent in allowing the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) to state his concern fully. The Minister might want to respond.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to do so. I join the hon. Member for Woking in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. I hope that this will be an interesting and productive debate.
<P>
The information has been provided now because the Government are keen to make as much information as possible available to members of the Committee during their deliberations, not because it is essential to those deliberations. The clauses are still under consideration. The hon. Gentleman was absent from this place for a time and he might find it instructive to consider the number of occasions in the previous Parliament when information was not made available until well after Committee stage. Some progress was made in the later stages of that Parliament, and information was sometimes made available to Committees and dealt with constructively.
<P>
The papers were placed on the Board yesterday, which is when most hon. Members received them. We did that so that hon. Members had the opportunity to consider them overnight. Hon. Members who were not in the House might not have received the papers from the Board. Spare copies are, therefore, available in the Room.
<P>
The information in the papers is intended to inform the debate. It is very much a first working draft, which will be subject to considerable consultation; it might be amended in the light of the Committee's debates if clarification is needed. I hope that hon. Members will accept the document in the spirit in which it was intended namely, to inform debate constructively about one of the most important elements of the Bill. I look forward to outlining that element in detail so that the Committee may understand exactly the Government intentions. The document is intended to complement that discussion, not to be a substitute for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I add my welcome to you.
<P>
The Minister may be unaware of the circumstances. I entirely accept that he spoke in good faith about the Government's intention for papers to be placed on the Board yesterday, but will the Minister confer further with his officials? I was in the House all day yesterday, and I kept a close eye on the Board because I hoped that papers might have been made available. No paper addressed to me was on the Board. The papers arrived in my post this morning. My position is the same as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Woking. I know that the Minister did not intend it, but no papers for me were on the Board yesterday.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Committee has heard enough about that point of order. I received the papers in time to do my own homework. The complaint has been stated in full, and the Minister has given a full response. I see no grounds for adjourning the sitting because of the complaint. The Committee should now proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am pleased that members of the Committee are keen to read the documents and to take them seriously. I shall add one point. I asked staff to ensure that the documents were to be held on the Board for hon. Members to collect, and not to be mailed. I understand from a number of hon. Members that that intention was carried through. If something has gone wrong in one case, the matter should be raised with the staff responsible for the Board.
<P>
The Government will do all that we can to get information to hon. Members as quickly as possible. A good deal of work is being done on drafting guidance for people whom the legislation will affect, in the light of debates in another place. The people doing the work in the Home Office are under enormous pressure. I intend to provide further guidance to the Committee as soon as is possible, to assist debate. That may be possible today regarding other clauses. I should make it clear that such information is provided to enhance the debate and not because it is essential to it.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 2, in page 2, line 45, leave out "anti-social acts by him" and insert "harassment, alarm or distress".
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It may be helpful to set the new orders in context, and to remind the Committee why they are so important to victims of serious anti-social behaviour. I shall then answer any specific outstanding points. I hope to give the Committee the whole picture of the provisions. Tuesday's debate was wide ranging, and many central issues were raised, as was appropriate. The Committee did not debate narrow amendments, because of the grouping of amendments and because of the way in which issues were raised.
<P>
I have made available the first working draft of guidance on the orders. I should make it clear that it is at present under discussion with various organisations, including the police, local authorities and the courts. One reason for publishing first drafts early is to give at least two or three opportunities for full discussion and improvement of the guidance available. I hope that the draft will give a clearer picture of what the Government intend the orders to do and of how they will operate in practice.
<P>
Hon. Members have expressed considerable concern about the use of the orders for trivial matters or to penalise people who are merely eccentric. The guidance states that this must not happen. That firm position will be strengthened if the document carries the weight of discussion in Parliament behind it and is seen to express clearly Parliament's views on the proper use of the orders.
<P>
It may help the hon. Member for Woking, who raised a query about the phrase at the bottom of the first page of the draft, to know that the Government intend the document to reflect the intentions and discussions of Parliament. Such matters will not be decided in advance, and that is why the draft has been produced.
<P>
It was clear from our discussions on Tuesday that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee wish to achieve the right balance of protection both for members of the public and for those who are subject to the orders. We all want the measure to be effective.
<P>
A key issue running through the debate on Tuesday was the threshold for behaviour to be covered by the orders. Some amendments were tabled that sought to specify the behaviour, or to define it as serious, and, more generally, to specify that a threshold should be defined in the Bill.
<P>
It would not be right to limit the definition in the ways that have been suggested. The essence of such orders is their flexibility to respond to local needs, but, in practice, a threshold must be observed. That will be established in three ways. First, there will be a safety net formed by the requirement that the police or local authority, in consultation, must apply for the orders. Individuals cannot apply for orders. Secondly, there will be a minimum duration for the orders of two years. Behaviour not meriting that should not be the subject of an order, and if such an application is made, the court should reject it. Thirdly, the guidance will set out firm advice on the threshold to be applied. That will help the police, local authorities and the courts to act in accordance with Parliament's intentions.

<P>

<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere) rose 
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall give way, but I should like to continue my remarks and then respond to questions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, as my intervention is relevant at this point.
<P>
The Minister said that the police and local authorities will take account of the guidance, but, of course, the courts will not do so. Will he explain sub-criminal behaviour, and can he give the Committee an example of it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall illustrate that when I discuss the type of behaviour that would reach the threshold required to grant an order. I shall touch on the question of whether non-criminal behaviour can be adduced in making out a case for an order. I should like to proceed with my remarks and deal with that point coherently when it arises. I shall certainly be happy to answer further questions from the hon. Member for Hertsmere if he is still not satisfied.
<P>
I have referred to the three elements that will establish a threshold for anti-social behaviour orders, to ensure that such orders are not used for trivial behaviour. The courts will be aware of the guidance and of the intentions of Parliament. That is an important point.
<P>
In our previous debates, several hon. Members raised the issue of the type of behaviour to be covered by the orders, and I was challenged to give examples. There is a danger that if illustrations are given, they could be used to set the position in stone. We had long debates about such matters during the passage of previous legislation on criminal justice. Members of the Conservative Government shied away from giving examples when challenged to do so.
<P>
I have tried to help hon. Members by including in the guidance a few generalised types of behaviour that might be caught by the orders, although they are merely illustrations. I shall cover the matter further in a moment, by giving some more examples. However, I must make it clear that they will be examples, not a definition of the type of behaviour that would be covered.
<P>
It is important to examine what the orders are intended to do. There are three key elements. First, the orders are intended to tackle persistent behaviour. Indeed, a preventive order would make no sense if it dealt with a single event. Secondly, the cumulative effect on the victims of anti-social behaviour will often be more important than each individual act. That creates a perspective in the case of the orders different from that which relates to normal criminal offences, in which the seriousness of each action counts. Thirdly, the orders are intended to be used for criminal or sub-criminal activity, not for run-of-the-mill civil disputes between neighbours. If the relevant behaviour is criminal, the order should be used if criminal procedures might not be appropriate or might not prevent further anti-social activity. The intentions are precise.
<P>
We want primarily to target activities that ruin the lives of individuals, families or communities, and which cannot be dealt with effectively by existing measures. On Tuesday, hon. Members pressed very hard to be given an example. I remind them that it is for the police, the local authority and the courts to recognise what has been described as the elephant on the doorstep, which is easier to recognise than to define, but I shall give an illustration.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Let us take the example of the proverbial family from hell. It might involve arguments with neighbours, peppered with threats; persistent loud noise at unsocial hours; the posting of excrement through the letter box of a neighbour who dared to complain; the dumping of refuse all over the place, perhaps in neighbours' gardens; and abusive language, intimidating behaviour and the intimidation and bullying of neighbour's children on the way to and from school. Hon. Members can fill in further detail for themselves. Several of the events that I have listed might be criminal acts, but the impact of that pattern of behaviour on neighbours is the important thing.
<P>
Some actions in any list of types of anti-social behaviour might be criminal offences, while some might be subject to civil remedies; for example, loud noise can be dealt with under environmental health legislation. It would be appropriate to make it the subject of an order only if it was part of a wider pattern of behaviour that caused concern. If the family in question lived in a council property, the powers of the local authority as landlord would be available. In some circumstances, the sum of existing remedies fails to deal with the real problem. I have experienced such cases. I have spent time with the police and relevant local authority trying to tease out a way of using options such as prosecution or eviction, and found that the problem, and the misery for the neighbours who were targeted, continued. That is why we need the new remedy.
<P>
A series of events such as I have described should be dealt with as a package. The inability of existing remedies to do so gives rise to the need for the order. Such events need to be prevented from recurring, not merely where a remedy exists punished. Often, the criminal burden of proof could be satisfied with respect to one or two actions. However, that would not reflect the impact on neighbours of all that was being done, which there was a need to prevent from happening subsequently. That could be taken into account in an application for an anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
What I have explained answers, in part, the question whether an order would be more or less serious than sanctions under the Public Order Act 1986, which I was asked in Committee on Tuesday. It is a misleading question. The anti-social behaviour order is to be used in circumstances that are neither more nor less serious. The orders differ in conception, operation and affects from the criminal law. Essentially, the orders are to be used for criminal or sub-criminal activity to tackle serious, persistent, anti-social behaviour that affects a community, causing one or more persons harassment, alarm or distress. They are not intended for run-of-the-mill disputes between neighbours, petty intolerance, minor, one-off disorderly acts or the penalising of the merely eccentric. That is why it is the breach of an order that would be a criminal offence. The behaviour to be prohibited in an order should be serious enough to justify the available sanction. That is what the guidance says, and I should welcome the Committee's endorsement of that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) asked in his intervention about sub-criminal activities. I hope that it is clear from what I have said that some acts might or might not be criminal a court would have to resolve that but if such acts formed part of a wider pattern of activity, they would not need to meet the criminal standard of proof. Those acts would be part of a pattern of anti-social behaviour that affected other individuals and families in the neighbourhood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> In the list that the Minister provided today, and in his comments on Tuesday, he said that orders would be made in circumstances where there was a pattern of mixed criminal under existing law and non-criminal activity. Could be order be granted if all the behaviour was non criminal or subcriminal, and thus not covered by existing law? Would it be possible for an order to be made for a repeated, but non-criminal, act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It would be theoretically possible; and, in a wide range of activities, those to which the hon. Gentleman referred might be easiest to prove. Such circumstances however would be unusual; the guidance shows that. It is possible to go to the extreme in definition and pose theoretical anomalies. That was true in legislation passed by the previous Government in for example, the definition of seriousness. When we discussed that we accepted that it was important to have a definition that was sufficiently wide, but to ensure that, through tests and a safety net, it did not cover silly examples in practice. Therefore, the circumstances that[Mr. Michael]
the hon. Gentleman described are theoretically possible, but unlikely.
<P>
I deal now with two specific anxieties that were expressed on Tuesday. The first is discrimination. Hon. Members asked about the danger of orders being used to penalise those who are simply different. That must not happen, and orders must not be used in a discriminatory way. The guidance will make it clear that the police, local authorities and the courts must exercise extreme caution. That point was made on Second Reading, when we undertook to ensure that the guidance specifically emphasised that point of principle.
<P>
Individuals who should be protected against discrimination are also those who may benefit from the protection that an anti-social behaviour order might provide.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): I want to return to section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986. It uses precisely the same words as the the Bill about "harassment, alarm or distress".
<P>
I have had an opportunity to examine the Minister's guidance notes, especially paragraph 3.5, which deals with various examples. I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to give examples to the Committee. Does he accept that those examples, especially the intimidation of neighbours and abusive behaviour, could be covered by section 5 of the Public order Act? If so, the Minister seems to argue that, although section 5 could cover the sorts of behaviour we are considering, he wants to tackle repeated behaviour. We must define the position clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Within the range of activities that would be presented to the court as evidence for the need for an anti-social behaviour order, some would be caught by the Public Order Act. However, the comparison with Public Order Act offences is misleading: a Public Order Act offence is an offence. The order does not represent offence, nor is it a response to an offence. It is a civil order which seeks to prevent future behaviour. I am happy to accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but it does not offer any argument against the need for an order.
<P>
It is also worth making the same point that I was making about what has been described as sub-criminal activity. The behaviour may well be criminal, just as behaviour may involve a transgression of the Public Order Act, but it may not be possible to prove it to the standard required for a criminal conviction. There are a variety of reasons for that. One might be that the victim is too frightened to give evidence. That is a serious consideration which I am sure hon. Members would recognise. Clause 2 enables third-party witnesses to give evidence of the behaviour in circumstances in which they are not the victim. That means that protection can be provided for members of the public.
<P>
It should be borne in mind that we are not turning the subject of an order into a criminal; he is not guilty of an offence before the court but is merely required not to indulge in specific types of behaviour. It therefore provides a protection in circumstances where it is not possible to get a conviction on the basis of the criminal standard of proof. That is the essence of what we are trying to do in these clauses.

<P>

<B>Sir Robert Smith </B>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine): Would the order prevent only behaviour that was criminal, or could it prevent someone from doing something that was not criminal in itself and which someone without the order against him could carry out?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It is an interesting point. It could prevent behaviour that was not criminal if it was part of a pattern of behaviour that was defined in the order. It would be unusual, which is rather similar to the response I gave to the hon. Member for Hertsmere about the behaviour leading to the order, for it merely to be non-criminal behaviour that was prohibited but it would be theoretically possible.
<P>
The purpose of the order is not to punish behaviour but to prevent it. There has to be evidence that that behaviour has existed in the past. It is brought before the court not to gain a conviction and a punishment, but to provide evidence that there is a need for an order to prevent that behaviour in the future. That is the essence of the provision, and I hope that I have managed to make it as clear as possible.
<P>
Having dealth with discrimination, I should like to turn to the second of the two major concerns, which is human rights. Human rights issues go further than the issue of discrimination. The promotion of human rights is a key element of the Government's programme. It is a vital factor in the Bill. We have read with great interest the article referred to by several hon. Members which was published by the Howard League. As I mentioned on Tuesday, two changes have been incorporated in the Bill which help to meet the points that those legal experts made about the anti-social behaviour order.
<P>
First, legal aid will be available for anti-social behaviour orders and sex offender orders by an extension of the assistance by way of representation, or ABWOR, scheme. Secondly, in the other place we inserted a crucial new subsection to provide a defence to an anti-social behaviour order namely, that the behaviour was "reasonable in the circumstances". Taken together, those two elements provide the necessary protection of human rights.
<P>
I can assure hon. Members that we scrutinised the proposals with a fine-toothed comb. We are confident that they meet the standards required by the European convention on human rights, which is soon to be part of our domestic law. That is, in itself, important: the ECHR will be relevant to all decisions taken by the courts, which means that aggrieved citizens will no longer have to go to the European Court to resolve any conflict between domestic law and the convention. The courts will, in future, have to consider the ECHR in taking decisions.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Does that mean that people will not have a remedy under the process? Will the Minister please clarify the position.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> At present, ECHR requirements are not matters for our courts because they are not part of domestic legislation. In future, not only will remedies, as the hon. Gentleman put it, in respect of this and other orders under the ECHR be avialable in domestic courts, but our courts will have to bear in mind ECHR considerations in reaching their decisions. That will be true of the law generally.
<P>
Domestic law has not been affected by deliberations on conflict between ECHR and domestic legislation because the ECHR requirements are not part of domestic law. Incorporation is therefore crucial in providing protection for citizens in our courts, rather than remedies being available only to those who go outside our court system to take their grievance to the ECHR and to the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I was pleased to hear the Minister say a moment ago that legal aid would be available in respect of complaints made on behalf of a defendant. That is something that we must clear up, and set in concrete. The Minister will agree that it is important that those who are subject to an anti-social behaviour order should have legal representation; by definition, if they are involved in such matters, they will probably be poor.
<P>
I forget whether there is a limit to assistance by way of representation; the Minister may need to take advice on the amount that can be paid to a lawyer under the ABWOR provisions, and I am content to wait for his comments because it is an important matter. Has any account been taken of the overall annual bill for extra representation? Will there be further cuts in other aspects of the criminal legal aid system? I do not expect the Minister to respond to my first point now, but I should be grateful for his comments later, especially, for example, on how much will be available to a defence solicitor one of the fat cats, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere says from a sedentary position representing a defendant in a case involving ABWOR.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Despite the currency of media comments on the issue, I shall not treat the hon. Gentleman's remarks as a trade union point. I shall take advice on the matter; legal aid and the income of lawyers is not a subject on which I have detailed information. The hon. Gentleman made a serious point and I shall respond to it.
<P>
I can confirm, for the avoidance of doubt, that legal aid will be available in respect of anti-social behaviour orders and the sex offenders orders which we shall debate in due course, by an extension of the ABWOR scheme.
<P>
I shall deal now with the individual points raised by hon. Members. First, in respect of juveniles, I must make it clear that they are not the main targets of these orders. Their use against juveniles, especially those at the younger end of the age range, would be exceptional. They may be used because the juvenile is one of several members of a family involved in a pattern of behaviour, which, as I mentioned earlier, may be followed by young members of a family, perhaps even with the encouragement of the parents. The issuing of an order in respect of a juvenile would be entirely appropriate in those circumstances. An order would not be issued in isolation, but as part of an attempt to tackle the general problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am interested in what the Minister has just said; I think that this is the first time we have heard about juveniles in that context. For clarification, will he define juveniles? Do we take it that the term covers young people up to the age of 17?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes, I believe that that is correct, but I shall take advice. My general point is that the younger the individuals, the less likely they are to be the number one target of an order or a group of orders. I have already made it clear that the order is not being introduced primarily to deal with juvenile offending or youth justice, or to prevent offending by young people. That might be its consequence in some cases, but it is not its main target.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I appreciate that, but the Minister used the word "exceptional". Was he saying that he thought the order would be applied for in respect of someone aged 17 or under only in exceptional cases?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I think that the provision can apply to 17-year-olds, so we are talking about people under the age of 18.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> Seventeen or under?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Well, 17 or under is under 18. If we get the language right as well as the law, we will be doing well.
<P>
To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, I believe that it would be unusual; juveniles are not the main target of the order. I have already given examples of situations largely undertaken or led by adults that have led to the introduction of the order. There may be circumstances in which the order would be appropriate for a young person or a group of young people acting together, consistently, over a period. We do not rule out that possibility because it is sensible to leave the matter, together with the test of seriousness, for the common-sense decision making of the police, the local authority and the court. I merely repeat that the order has not been introduced primarily to target young people, and we will make that clear in the guidance.
<P>
Where juveniles are concerned, the welfare provisions in the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 will apply. The juvenile would need to be at least 10 when the order was applied for. We consider it almost inconceivable that an order would be sought and granted where the behaviour pre-dated an individual's 10th birthday and had not continued beyond it. Any subsequent proceedings for a breach of an order would be thrown into question if the order was based, prior to the breach itself, on behaviour that took place before the age of criminal responsibility had been reached.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I shall try to help the Minister the age of 10 is specified in clause 2.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That is right, but there was a query about circumstances in which the behaviour complained of had started before the age of 10. I was trying to deal specifically with the hon. Gentleman's comments in our previous sitting. I regard the issue as fairly academic and unlikely ever to be a matter of discussion, but I hope that my remarks will further assist the hon. Gentleman by insulating against any such danger.
[Mr. Michael]
<P>
We think it unlikely that an order would be sought against a child unless his behaviour was part of the behaviour of a wider or older group. It is important to bear in mind the fact that the Bill contains other measures that would be more appropriate, more useful and more effective when a juvenile alone is under consideration. We shall debate those provisions when we deal with the reforms of youth justice and the different orders that are available to the courts.
<P>
In respect of the definition of households, I was asked about a multiple dwelling such as a block of flats. We do not think that that is a problem. "Household" is a common term and commonly understood. Whatever the technical interpretations in other contexts, I cannot believe that it will be misunderstood in terms of these common-sense orders. A separate flat or bedsit is clearly a household in its own right. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.
<P>
It is a basic tenet of these provsions that the behaviour need not be intentional. What is relevant is the effect on the victims. Much anti-social behaviour can be thoughtless or heedless but can nevertheless destroy its victims. In a way, that is also relevant to the question of whether the definition includes sub-criminal or non-criminal as well as criminal activity. For example, if an individual who is habitally drunk or on drugs or who simply does not care can plead that his behaviour was reasonable in the circumstances, an order cannot be made. If it is not reasonable in the circumstances, it is exactly the kind of behaviour that needs to be dealt with and prevented in the future. If a breach occurs, all the criminal law safeguards are in place. Although a breach does not need to be intentional, there is provision for reasonable excuse. I hope that that deals with the question about intention.
<P>
It must be remembered that a breach is not just a repetition of the anti-social behaviour; it is also a flouting of a court order. The order is made to prevent behaviour; therefore, a breach flouts a court's decision. That is reflected in the rigorous penalties, as is not just the real evil that such behaviour causes in the community, but our absolute commitment to dealing with it. The penalties make it clear that the Government are determined to prevent and reduce behaviour that ruins people's lives, not just to punish it.
<P>
It has been suggested that anti-social behaviour is a victimless crime. That is not the case. I make it clear yet again that we are not talking strictly about a crime but about behaviour that needs to be prohibited. There will always be victims of such behaviour. Although they may not be the intended victims, but merely casualties on the way, their level of pain and anxiety is what counts. We intend to prevent that pain and anxiety.
<P>
I was asked whether the terms "anti-social behaviour" added anything to the Bill. Legally, it does not, but it is an essential label that sets out clearly and succinctly what the provision is about: preventing anti-social behaviour. Hon. Members should not be afraid of that. The fact that it is so carefully designed as to be legally superfluous might well be a comfort to them, given their reservations about the phrase being too widely drawn.
<P>
Hon. Members asked whether the definition covered intimidation. I assure them that it does. Incivility on its own, however, as in the circumstances described by hon. Members in Tuesday's sitting, would be below the required threshold of behaviour. It might, however, be relevant as part of the overall picture painted for the court when applying for an order.

<P>

<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> How will the court know that?<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> How will the court know what?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> How will the court know that incivility is not a qualifying act?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The point I am making is that incivility would not be a criminal act if it did not reach the level of criminal definition, but it might well be part of a pattern of behaviour. For instance, shouting at other people and the conflict that arises from that is associated with more serious acts which could give rise to an application for an order. In other words, incivil behaviour could well be part of the context. I do not think that there is a problem with that. The court must decide whether the behaviour that is described in the evidence of those applying for an order is serious enough to justify an order being given. Any such behaviour should be seen in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I refer back to swearing on the bus or swearing across the garden fence at the neighbours such behaviour would clearly be deemed incivil. Am I correct in understanding the Minister to say that although it would not be sufficient on its own to merit an order, it may be referred to as part of a pattern of behaviour?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I want us to treat these instances as examples and not end up with definitions. I am saying that I think it extremely unlikely that such behaviour on its own would lead to either the police or the local authority feeling justified in applying to the court for an order. I suppose there might be circumstances in which the behaviour was so intense and extensive and took place over such a long time that the court might be convinced that it was serious enough to give rise to an order, but it is pretty unlikely. There are other ways of dealing with the problem. However, it might well be part of a pattern of behaviour that could be prohibited by an order to prevent distress, alarm and other problems continuing. Such exchanges help to take us towards an understanding of the mixture of issues that we have to take into account when considering the orders.
<P>
As regards the list of specifics, there is also the issue of the victim's firmness. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) dealt with that completely, so I see no need to linger on it.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised of a sensitive soul who was unduly affected by the behaviour of others. That is covered by the fact that the police and the local authority would have to examine the behaviour and its impact and by the test of reasonableness before the court, which would have to be satisfied.
<P>
On a slightly more trivial note, the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who suggested that he might send smoke signals in his back garden, would be covered by environmental health legislation. An anti-social behaviour order would not be needed unless he took his tendency to the cultural behaviour of the red indian to the extreme in other ways.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that we need an instrument that relieves people in communities of the misery that they presently experience. When I have described events and the elephant on the doorstep to Members of Parliament, councillors, housing officers and people who, like me, have worked in high-crime areas, there has been a great deal of nodding. There is much enthusiasm for the orders.
<P>
I entirely accept the points that hon. Members raised on Tuesday; they are legitimately concerned that the order should be used to protect the public and that it is not abused or misused. I hope that I have satisfied hon. Members and allayed any fears that they might have had by providing the illustrations that I have done. I hope that we can move forward and allow the anti-social behaviour order to become part of legislation so that it is available to the police and local authorities. That will enable them to provide members of the public with the protection that has been sadly lacking until now.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that we have had a useful debate on the scope of the order in the context of a group of amendments that is headed by amendment No. 38 in my name. My initial brevity was partly customary on my part; it was also partly the result of my wish to extent to the Conservative spokesman the courtesy of letting him introduce his amendments without rehearsing his arguments for him. I was pleased to see that we now have a grand alliance that seeks to uphold our traditional civil liberties. The two great parties of the 19th century and the Howard League are allied in their serious concerns about civil liberties.
<P>
Despite the Minister's additional clarification, however, questions remain. The hon. Member for Hertsmere made some useful and informative points about existing remedies. He was ably backed up by the hon. Member for Woking, who made particular reference to the Public Order Act 1986. The hon. Member for Hendon helped to make our point about the test of a reasonable person even though he tried to speak against it. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) showed himself to be a true libertarian, while the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) warned us not to be too distracted by busybodies, burglar alarms or neighbours from hell.
<P>
The Minister offered important clarification on the order's scope in response to our queries. Some of the human rights concerns to which he referred remain, and there will be scope to test them against the Human Rights Bill when it becomes law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Stinchcombe </B>(Wellingborough): Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the most important human right of all is the right to live free from fear and intimidation and to feel safe in one's own house?
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Certainly, we accept that. There is, however, the major issue of the relationship between the citizen and the state. This country has quite rightly always had a tradition of law under which the state has had to follow the usual legal remedies, and these remedies must be proportionate to the acts. Liberal Democrats seek to clarify that the proposed remedies are proportionate and not overbearing. The Human Rights Bill will go a long way towards establishing such proportionality throughout criminal and civil law. We welcome that.
<P>
We are pleased to hear that juveniles are not the main targets of the order. Anxiety clearly exists that the wider body of citizenry may feel that tools are being provided to attack groups of youths who do just what young people do, which is to hang out on street corners. Young people have done that since time immemorial and they will continue to do so. We would be uncomfortable about supporting measures targeted specifically at such groups. People's ability to suggest in their defence that their intention and behaviour were reasonable is an important qualification.
<P>
We seek assurance that such qualification will extend to people such as the mentally ill. Somebody with mental illness may frequently engage in unreasonable behaviour that causes significant harassment, alarm and distress. The Bill should have scope to cover the fact that such behaviour would be reasonable, given the nature of the condition involved.
<P>
The key to the Bill's success or failure will be implementation. Liberal Democrats welcome the guidance notes, even if they are a little late. We shall consider the exact niche that the orders will eventually fill. We are anxious that they should not be used to level up offences, against those which were previously too trivial to bring the people involved into contact with the justice system. They should not level down offences either; they should not be used in circumstances in which a sensible remedy is available. Discussion of the Public Order Act 1986 was relevant in that context. If possible, a remedy should be sought to the criminal standard of proof within the Public Order Act rather than by resort to the order.
<P>
Liberal Democrats will ask the Minister to propose procedures effectively to monitor use of the orders. Such monitoring will be the key to establishing whether the Committee's debate about scope will be reflected in reality, when the legislation is used by police and local authorities. I hope that the Minister will agree that such monitoring is necessary, and assure the Committee that the Government remain open to amending procedures and to redefining the scope of the orders if they are misapplied for any reason.
<P>
We remain anxious about these issues. With the assurances that we have sought, I shall seek your leave, Mr. O'Hara, to withdraw amendment No. 38.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman leaves me with a small problem. Other hon. Members had indicated their wish to speak to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman has expressed an intention to withdraw it. I shall take the view that he has not sought the Committee's permission for that withdrawal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his responses. The matters debated have not been sorted out or answered to everybody's satisfaction, but the[Mr. Malins]
Minister's approach has been constructive. He made it clear that the orders were not to be directed at very young people. That is odd; the Home Secretary has always said that his principal intention is to nip youth crime in the bud. One always had it in mind that the Bill's basic aim would be to get hold of and to deal with 10, 11 and 12-year-olds.
<P>
One or two points have not been dealt with fully. I am still interested in whether there is a particular reason why, when under the Public Order Act 1986 conduct from one dwelling to another is exempted from being an offence, it can constitute behaviour subject to an anti-social behaviour order under the Bill. That is a good thing, if anti-social behaviour is to be dealt with. It is perfectly possible for behaviour to have an effect that moves from one building to another for example offending a person in a building opposite. That is an intriguing difference.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> That reason that youth offending is not the main target of the clause is that young people's behaviour particularly the development of offending behaviour in young people is dealt with in a practical and constructive way later in the Bill. I look forward to the debates on those clauses.
<P>
As to the comparison with the Public Order Act 1986, we should remember that we are considering a preventive order. It is more appropriate to ask whether any particular distinction should be made in the case of the order than to draw such a comparison.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I understand. Much of what I said a day or two ago has been cleared up by the Minister's comment that the Bill is intended to deal with criminal or sub-criminal behaviour a term that we can never define, although the Minister thinks he knows what he means by it, and I hope that we think we know what he thinks he means by it. Clearly, the Bill is not meant to deal with the kind of oddball behaviour that I referred to the other day, which goes on in any free society and which should not be stamped on.
<P>
The Minister is concerned with criminal behaviour, or something pretty well adjacent to it. Many hon. Members might ask why that could not be dealt with under existing law. Much of the conduct mentioned in the papers that were given to us overnight is, of course, criminal. However, the Minister has presented reasons for his approach this morning, and given an example in which criminal proceedings might not be appropriate. Therefore, I understand his argument, even though uncertainty remains in my mind.
<P>
It is a pity that under the Bill an isolated act of quite lawful behaviour, by which the defendant intended no harm, could result in an order being made. However, the Minister has made it clear that that is not the purpose of the measure. One hopes to goodness that no such application would ever be made. It is worrying that a policy decision would be needed whether to proceed with an anti-social behaviour order. The Minister says that the conduct that he wants to have dealt with amounts often to criminal conduct. Assuming that someone committed what appeared on the face of it to be a criminal act, the decision whether to apply for an anti-social behaviour order could be made by the local authority alone. It seems to me that the authority would not need the consent of the police; nor would it have to consult the Crown Prosecution Service. It would merely have to consult the police.
<P>
It would be possible for certain local authorities to adopt a policy towards a type of behaviour, though their staff lawyers would probably not be experienced in criminal matters, but better versed in planning law. The authorities would make policy decisions on criminal acts, without being subject to CPS guidelines, or having appropriate legal training or the necessary expertise. The result would be fortunate for those we might call the defendants in some parts of the country, where an anti-social behaviour order would be made against them for acts which elsewhere would lead to a criminal case being brought.
<P>
I should be intrigued if the Minister would confirm that so long as the person concerned abided by an anti-social behaviour order, the order would form no part of his or her record, could never be referred to by the courts as part of an antecedent history and would never have to be compulsorily disclosed on a job application form. If my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere and I were living in the boroughs of Hertsmere and Woking respectively, our conduct could be equally outrageous but I could walk away with a criminal record and he might not. It is the unpredictability that troubles me and I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with that. I need go no further at this stage.
<P>
I appreciated the way in which the Minister approached the various questions that we raised on Tuesday. The position is not wholly clear and I am not sure that it ever will be, but we are much better informed this morning.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> It might be helpful if I dealt with that point. The hon. Gentleman has a remarkable talent for constructing a series of points that turn into a chain of intriguing questions that are difficult to deal with separately.
<P>
There must be consultation. The clause makes it clear that either the police or the local authority can apply for an order, but the clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A relevant authority shall not make such an application without consulting each other relevant authority."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The intention is clear for the courts. The courts would need to be satisfied that that procedure had been followed. Local authorities must consult the police who are responsible for deciding to take criminal proceedings, and they might say that criminal proceedings were more appropriate. In some circumstances both might be appropriate.
<P>
I reiterate that an anti-social behaviour order would not be part of a criminal record. The purpose of the guidance is to iron out local variations. I am certain that the courts would deal with any of the extreme aberrations described by the hon. Member for Woking. Paragraph 3.4 of the guidance I appreciate that hon. Members will wish to look at this in detail makes it clear that the Crown Prosecution Service is not directly involved in applications for orders, but that it will be involved in prosecution for any breaches.
<P>
There is a recommendation that the CPS should be consulted in an advisory capacity when strategic discussions on the formulation of an area strategy take place on issues relating to proof of breaches such as the wording of orders, and to ensure that arrangements are in place to deal expeditiously with breaches.
<P>
As part of the local partnership to cut crime, police and local authorities may discuss the use that they might make of orders. Exceptionally, there may be occasions where the views of the CPS on an individual case are useful. If there is doubt about the intention set out by Parliament and in the guidance, it may be sensible for the local authority to ask the CPS for its opinion. Such advice would help to supplement the guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stinchcombe:</B> I have a simple point of clarification which I hope my hon. Friend can deal with at some stage, perhaps in correspondence. The guidance is of critical importance: it directs people with wide discretion and it provides the protection that Opposition Members seek. Where is the statutory provision that empowers the Secretary of State to issue guidance and amend it, and where is the statutory provision that requires people to take it into account?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The guidance does not require a statutory provision. There are sometimes legal requirements on the Secretary of State to issue guidance. In other words, the legislation is not implemented until that guidance is in place. We made it clear that we would issue guidance and publish it as quickly as possible to enable the House to consider it and examine the details of the intended use of such orders. That is why we have presented the draft now. I emphasise that it is only a first draft. I should be happy to consider and respond to any matters that hon. Members might like to raise.
<P>
I hope that we shall deal satisfactorily with the major issues in our debate, but I am happy to consider further points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I should perhaps have begun by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara. On Tuesday, I said that I was delighted to serve under you, and I express the same delight today.
<P>
I am pleased by the form if not the content of the Minister's response. We are considering serious issues, to which the Minister provided a full and considered response. However, several matters remain outstanding.
<P>
The Minister's comments justified many of the later amendments that we have tabled. He said that the orders should not be used primarily in neighbours' disputes. We have tabled an amendment about that. I do not want to stray out of order; therefore we shall return to the matter later. That also applies to discrimination. The Government promised in the consultation paper that the Bill would include an anti-discrimination provision.
<P>
We discussed human rights issues on Tuesday. I do not want to speak for the distinguished academics from whose document I quoted, but I suspect that they would not be entirely satisfied with the Minister's comments today. They may welcome what has been said about legal aid, as will members of the legal profession. I declare an interest as a member of the Bar. I do not know whether the fat cats will see the measure as an opportunity to get more cream, but it is more likely to provide semi-skimmed or skimmed milk! The hon. Member for West Lancashire (Mr. Pickthall) is very interested in fat cats. He has managed to restrain himself from asking questions about the extra provision of legal aid.
<P>
The Minister's comments about a provision in another place for a defence by an individual of being able to show that his behaviour was reasonable in all circumstances will not allay all the anxieties that have been expressed, especially as the individual will bear the burden of proof. We shall return to that point, which is not the real bone of contention between the Government and the academics.
<P>
The academics are worried about the sweeping definition of anti-social behaviour, the standard of proof and the legal procedures, which provide an opportunity for the defendant to test the evidence against him. We shall also return to that point later.
<P>
It is inevitable that we should return to the definitiion of behaviour that will justify or qualify for an order. We read the consultation paper with interest. In its completed form, it will be available as guidance for councils and police authorities when they consider whether to apply for orders. However, it will not be available to the courts. They may hear about the Minister's comments today, but when applications are made to the courts, they will not have the benefit of the guidance.
<P>
Many magistrates have expressed anxiety about operating the provisions of the Bill, and about how they will know what constitutes the anti-social behaviour that they are supposed to tackle. They are worried about the width of the definition. Nothing in the Bill will assist them. Anti-social behaviour is defined in the Bill entirely by reference to its effects. The Minister referred to previous legislation, but that was always qualified by definition of the behaviour that was to be covered. The type of behaviour that the Public Order Act 1986 covered was spelt out in that measure. A magistrate who has to deliberate on an application for one of these orders will find no guidance in the Bill about the type of behaviour that he is supposed to be considering.
<P>
We appreciate that the Government's intention is to deal with behaviour that is mainly criminal if I may paraphrase the Minister's words but there is nothing to exclude an application for an order relating to non-criminal behaviour. The Minister referred to the need for evidence and said that the behaviour should form part of a pattern. However, the important matter is whether the acts are criminal or non-criminal. Non-criminal behaviour could be brought within the ambit of the orders. An order could be applied for, and granted, against behaviour that was entirely lawful under criminal law or, indeed, under civil law, when used to obtain a civil remedy.
<P>
With masterly understatement, my hon. Friend the Member for Woking said that he was still a little dissatisfied with some aspects of the Bill. He originally described the Bill as a dog's breakfast and as a piece of pick 'n' mix legislation. That was not entirely wide of the mark.
<P>
The Minister made some important remarks about juveniles, which were also included in the guidance.[Mr. Clappison]
However, I was not aware that the Government had stated that there would be restrictions on applications regarding juveniles. There is no mention of that matter in their consultation paper. Paragraph 24 of the paper stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is proposed that a community safety order would be available against any person over the age of criminal responsibility."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is no suggestion that there would be qualifications on such orders.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Let me emphasise that I wanted to clarify today the intentions and the natural targets of those orders. There is no restriction in the legislation. I shall return shortly to the point about the age of criminal responsibility. We want to find a definition as did the previous Government that is wide enough not to fall over its own feet. However, we also want the intentions of the legislation to be absolutely clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> If that had been the Government's intention, surely there should have been at least a hint of it in the consultation paper. There is nothing about the matter in that paper. What is more, the Home Secretary has paraded the anti-social behaviour orders around the country as some of the key elements in the Government's fight against youth crime. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking was quite right on that point.
<P>
The Minister said that the orders were only part of the strategy against youth crime. That is fair enough, but I remind him of the way in which the Home Secretary referred to anti-social behaviour orders in the context of the Government's actions against youth crime. In a press notice about disorder, dated 25 June 1997, the Home Secretary stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In responding to the concerns of local communities, top of my agenda is to tackle youth crime. At the moment, the youth justice system fails to nip youth crime in the bud. We will reform that system to ensure rapid, consistent and effective response to youth crime."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He then outlined three measures to deal with youth crime. At the top of the list was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"introducing community safety orders to allow police to deal with threatening and disruptive behaviour to provide protection and redress for victims of chronic abuse."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government now say that such orders can be applied for only in respect of those who are aged 17 or under, in unusual circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> I am being fair to the Minister. He used the word "exceptional", which I picked on. He then qualified it to "unusual". If I may, I shall finish my sentence and then the Minister can comment fully. He referred to "unusual circumstances", in which the anti-social behaviour by a youth was part of a pattern of behaviour involving older people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Indeed. I said that it would be unusual or exceptional for an anti-social behaviour order to be taken out only against young offenders, when there were no similar orders against adult members of the same family or of another group. There may be circumstances in which that is appropriate, as I made clear. Anti-social or criminal behaviour by young people as part of a pattern of activity involving older people and adult members of the same family is not unusual.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> No doubt it happens, but that is not everyone's understanding of the expression "young crime" as it was used by the Home Secretary. We know that it is only a rough draft, but the Minister's guidance stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is envisaged that the measures will rarely be used against younger children on their own and that an order will only normally be sought when a child's behaviour is part of anti-social behaviour by a family or group which includes other people."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government cannot have it both ways.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> My hon. Friend has already referred to the proposal as being something of a dog's breakfast; it strikes me that every time the Minister intervenes, the picture gets more confused. Those of us who regularly dealt with such issues in magistrates and Crown courts know that defence advocates can refer to what is said in Committees and in the House in conducting a case. The confused statements from the Government Front Bench will cloud the issue and make it more difficult for prosecutions to be brought. The picture is extremely confused.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> We have been trying to clarify matters this morning. I do not want to take issue with the Minister about the availability of the guidance we received it only yesterday but if we had seen it earlier, we would have known the Government's intention and could have tabled amendments to clarify the issue further. Today is the first time that we have heard about the qualification in the use of anti-social behaviour orders in the case of juveniles, or young people under the age of 17. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins), I wonder how much value is being added to the criminal justice system by the anti-social behaviour orders. After Tuesday's sitting, the Home Secretary announced to the world that he thought the existing law was inadequate. We read in the consultation paper that that is not entirely the view of the Goverment, as it speaks of the anti-social behaviour order being an alternative in circumstances in which the existing law might not be entirely appropriate. That is hardly dismissing the existing law as being inadequate in the same way that the Home Secretary did.
<P>
We wonder whether, in practice, the existing law is so inadequate. Most of the examples that the Minister quoted would, I imagine, be covered by the existing law: the public order provisions, the law relating to offences against the person, the Noise Act 1996 or the housing legislation.
<P>
The Government create an impression I am sure inadvertently that when someone commits an offence against the Public Order Act 1986, which contains a fairly wide definition of disorderly behaviour or of threatening the use of violence and so on, nothing happens. That is not the case. The first time that people commit an offence under that Act, they may be prosecuted and brought to court. It is not the case that nothing happens; they face a penalty. It will be the first appearance in court, which, under the Government's scheme, will lead to a community safety order being made.
<P>
It is not the case that nothing would happen on the second appearance in court if someone already had a conviction for a public order offence. As the Minister knows from his own experience of these matters, on the second appearance in court the fact that there had been a previous conviction for an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 would be taken into account by the magistrate, and the person concerned would receive an even stiffer sentence.
<P>
That is what happens in real life under the existing laws. People would not have to wait for a second, or subsequent, anti-social act to be committed as part of a pattern of behaviour; if an act is against the law, the offender should be prosecuted. If the offence is serious and satisfies the Crown Prosecution Service criteria, a prosecution should be brought and the people concerned brought before the courts and duly punished, and punished again if they commit a further offence.
<P>
We have listened to the Minister's arguments and we are grateful for the full and courteous way in which he has responded to our anxieties, but we remain dissatisfied with much of what he said. However, in the interests of making progress, I shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
<B>Ms Sally Keeble </B>(Northampton, North): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara, although it is perhaps a little presumptuous of me to do so, as I was not at the previous sitting. I apologise for that.
<P>
I am grateful for the chance to make some brief comments about the gap in current provision and the level of criminality in the behaviour that might give rise to an anti-social behaviour order. It is clear from what my hon. Friend the Minister said that the order will add value to the criminal justice system and plug a gap in current provision.
<P>
Perhaps I might illustrate what I mean with an example. On the Spencer estate in Northampton, a family was evicted from their council property because they disrupted the entire estate. It was a high-profile case which was reported in the newspapers because the family lost their appeal against the decision. That was the only occasion on which the matter went to court.
<P>
The family then bought a property on the same estate and local residents were in some trepidation; they did not have any immediate means of dealing with what might come next. If an anti-social behaviour order had been an option at the time, limits would already have been set on the behaviour of the family and the local residents would have had the structure for a proper remedy. In that instance, the behaviour was clearly unacceptable because it was deemed that there were sufficient grounds for eviction and the council's decision was upheld in court. However, there was no immediate legal remedy for local residents, other than that taken by the council.
<P>
People argue that there are already sufficient remedies through the law, but why do people not take up those options? If current remedies were clear, people would probably use them; but they do not. That is another demonstration of how the anti-social behaviour order fills a gap in the law. My hon. Friend the Minister set out clear guidelines on how the orders will operate, but they will to some extent have to be tested in action so that people who encounter certain behaviour will know exactly the level and type of behaviour that might lead to an order being made.
<P>
On the other side of my constituency in the east of Northampton, which the Minister knows, there is a young woman who owns her own property and has invested all her money in it. However, because of the neighbours from hell moving in next door, she cannot rent it and she has been advised that she cannot sell it. She cannot live there, but she cannot take legal action because it would be onerous on her. She cannot get other locals to give evidence because they are to frightened.
<P>
That family have also been evicted from a council tenancy in the same local authority area, and they did not dispute the eviction. Thus, their behaviour is recognised as unacceptable, but there is no means of dealing with it. The provision for anti-social behaviour orders therefore fills an important gap. In practice, the orders can be implemented by local authorities, which have enormous experience of anti-social behaviour although they currently have great difficulty in dealing with it. The measure will be enormously important to people across the country in dealing with a difficult social problem.

<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> I shall make some comments on the helpful note that the Minister circulated. Paragraph 1.4 states:
 <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The guidance is non-statutory. It is for guidance and should not be regarded as providing legal advice."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
One must assume, therefore, that the note will not be before the courts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has made clear, the only matters that will be are those in the Bill, which is widely drafted. It refers to someone acting
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in an anti-social manner, that is to say, in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Following the case of Pepper v. Hart, the courts can consider the words that the Minister uses in Committee, although that was not the case when I and my hon. Friend entered Parliament. The Minister's comments in Committee are, therefore, very important. Although I accept that he has done his level best to shed light on the matter, the courts might still be confused as to exactly what is required of them. Those who administer the criminal justice system are justifiably anxious to ensure that Parliament's intentions are clear. It might therefore be necessary for me and my hon. Friends to clarify perhaps on Report the nature of the behaviour that the Bill is designed to prevent. My hon. Friends have explained that previous legislation particularly the Public Order Act 1986 used words such as "harassment", "alarm" and "distress". It made clear, however, that such behaviour had to involve threatening, abusive or insulting words or disorderly behaviour. We might have to return to the matter on Report; otherwise the courts will be put in a difficult position.
<P>
I can illustrate my point by reference to paragraph 3.5 of the Minister's guidance notes. If one considers it in[Mr. Leigh]
detail, one discovers the behaviour about which the Minister is concerned. The examples given include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"individuals who intimidate neighbours ... persistent unruly behaviour by a small group of individuals ... persistent abusive behaviour ... serious and persistent bullying of children in public recreation grounds".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I questioned the Minister about the matter, and he helpfully accepted that the Public Order Act 1986 or other legislation would or could cover such behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I wonder whether I could clarify the matter again for the hon. Gentleman, although I know that I am repeating something that I have said several times. The fact that other legislation deals with punishment for certain behaviour does not make it inappropriate for the Bill to deal with such behaviour. The Bill is designed to prevent certain behaviour we are considering an order to prevent behaviour, not one to punish it. The breach is subject to the criminal burden of proof and to punishment. As I have made clear several times, the order is not a punishment; it is designed to protect the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Yes, that would be fine if one was convinced that the problem would be solved simply by making an order. In many cases, however, if not most, the mere making of an order would not solve the problem. The matter would, therefore, be taken before the criminal courts.
<P>
The hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) mentioned witnesses who were unwilling to come forward, and we all know of such instances. Presumably, the local authority in such a case makes an order against a person. If, as is probable, the behaviour continues, criminal convictions could result. We have to be careful to outline exactly what happens during those subsequent criminal procedures and to ensure that traditional civil liberties are protected. It is not enough for the Minister to say that this is purely a civil matter, that people will be given a warning and will not acquire a criminal conviction, and that the problem will be solved. It is not as easy as that.
<P>
The order will be perceived by many people to be the start of a process that could lead to criminal convictions. Much of the behaviour that is complained about could presumably be dealt with by a caution. My hon. Friends who have more experience in judging such matters will correct me if I am wrong, but surely under existing public order procedures, the courts can impose a caution to deal with a persistent pattern of behaviour.
<P>
The Minister is shaking his head. The point is important, and no doubt he will respond later. We are talking about a serious matter. For the first time, a local authority, which is an executive agency, will be able to impose a curfew on somebody, solely subject to a complaint. The case will have to be proved on a balance of probabilities that is a civil burden of proof.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
I think that I am right in saying that that is a departure in the way in which such matters are dealt with. I shall illustrate my worries by speaking briefly about other paragraphs in the notes. Instructively, because the notes have been delivered fairly later, the Committee has not had much detailed debate about them. The Committee should examine the notes very carefully to enable it to deal responsibly with the matters that are raised by the notes.
<P>
Paragraph 4.5 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The order, although available in the magistrates' court, is a civil proceeding, with the civil burden of proof (`the balance of probabilities') and civil rules of evidence. Sections 1-4 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995 which permit the use of hearsay evidence in civil proceedings apply to proceedings for applications for orders."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It should be made clear that the use of hearsay evidence is allowed. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking, who is a distinguished recorder of the Crown court, knows that criminal courts look askance at hearsay evidence for very good reasons.
<P>
I find another aspect worrying. The notes also state that the local authority may hire "professional witnesses". They are paid snoopers, employed by the local authority to snoop, and will not actually live on the estate.
<P>
I mention the notes because the more that they are read hon. Members may not have had time to read them closely the wider they get.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> My hon. Friend draws attention to a point that concerned me in my understandably cursory reading of the notes; I saw them for the first time only this morning. Terminology is introduced in the notes that is very unfamiliar to the courts. As a fellow member of the Bar, will my hon. Friend comment on the use of the phrase sub-criminal behaviour? The concept is completely alien to hon. Members who are experienced in dealing with such matters in court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Despite the Minister's efforts I am happy for him to correct me he has been entirely unable acceptably or reasonably to define what sub-criminal behaviour means. Behaviour is either criminal, in that it infringes an Act of Parliament and a provision clearly laid down, or it is not. there is no such thing as sub-criminal behaviour; there is behaviour and criminal behaviour. The Minister should, to be fair to the courts, spend more time in explaining what he means by sub-criminal behaviour. If he does not, they may get into an awful mess later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman invites me to intervene, and I do not wish to delay him. I thought that I had made the matter clear. Sub-criminal behaviour is behaviour of a level that may be criminal, but to be actually described as such it would have to be proved to be so before a court. The question of proof may be a problem, but it makes perfect sense as part of a general pattern of activity, in which evidence is given to a court as part of the civil burden of proof about the need for an anti-social behaviour order to be made to prevent the repetition of certain behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> It does not make perfect sense. That is summed up by the Minister's phrase, "The elephant on your doorstep", which he has used on several occasions. To him, it clearly describes something that amounts to sub-criminal behaviour, but which cannot be defined in the Bill or in the Committee. That is not good enough. It is not the way in which sensible criminal law is made. The elephant on your doorstep is not the language of Lord Denning. It is meaningless. The more one reads the guidance notes, the more worried one becomes. We shall have to return to the issue at a later stage.
<P>
Paragraph 6.2 says that it will sometimes be necessary to proceed in a defendant's absence. My hon. Friend the Member for Woking sits in judgment on alleged criminals does he sit in the defendant's absence, or does he require the defendant to be around to answer the charge?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> It is quite normal to hear matters such as speeding offences in the absence of the defendant, but I am aghast at the prospect no doubt my hon. Friend is, too of matters of this gravity being heard in the defendants' absence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Of course they should not be. Whatever the Minister may say, this is entirely different from speeding. We might go on to have an interesting debate on intention, but everyone knows that, whatever the Minister says, we are effectively talking about criminal behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I know that the hon. Gentleman has declared his intention to take no notice of anything that I say, but I repeat, very slowly, that we are not talking about a prosecution of an individual leading to a punishment. It is evidence being provided to a court of the need for an order to be made in order to prohibit certain behaviour and thus stop people's lives being ruined.
<P>
Of course, it is preferable for an individual concerned to be present and able to respond as he considers appropriate to the evidence that is put to the court in justification of the request for an order, but I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman has had any experience of the sort of incidents that we are seeking to tackle, he will have come across individuals who would choose not to come to court if that would frustrate the intentions of the application for an order. That should not be possible, because it would frustrate the intention of protecting people against serious anti-social behaviour, which the order is designed to target.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> Obviously, we require people to come to court because it is important that they hear the evidence against them and that there is adequate notice. There are in any event adequate procedures for people to be brought to court by the police.
<P>
On the Minister's first point, he cannot keep repeating himself. The offence is not equivalent to a speeding offence. Real punishments such as exclusion or curfews could be imposed on people. Such punishments are curtailments of civil liberties. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that this is not a criminal proceeding because effectively, it is although it is a criminal proceeding that can, very unusually, be instigated by a local authority.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I do not want to try your patience, Mr. O'Hara, by jumping ahead to a later debate, but it is relevant for us to investigate the Government's intentions when they talk about orders being made in the absence of the person against whom they are being made.
<P>
We must also consider what would happen if such an order were made as a result of evidence being given maliciously, when the only way of appealing against it is by taking the much more dramatic step of going to a Crown court. Some of these matters will have to be considered again when we deal with the appellate procedures in clause 7, but it is absolutely essential that we examine the seriousness of a measure that is apparently not going to be a criminal conviction, although if malicious neighbours made a complaint in the absence of the person against whom it was made, the only appeal would be to go to a Crown court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The world is not populated by the good and the bad except in cowboy movies. There are many grey areas. There is no question but that there are obvious thugs and bad people on estates who need to be dealt with, but the courts have adequate powers to do that but we shall leave that on one side. My hon. Friend made it clear, however, that there are many malicious people, which is why we want adequate safeguards.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stinchcombe:</B> On the point of principle that the hon. Gentleman raised, what is the difference between the procedure in the Bill and applying for an ex parte injunction and, if that is breached, applying the same criminal standard of proof for commitment? The procedure clearly mirrors tradition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The whole point about an ex parte injunction is that it might be necessary because of an element of urgency. One has, however, to deal with the matter properly in the courts later with both parties present. If I wanted to publish something about my hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath which he considered libelous, he could get an ex parte injunction to prevent me from publishing it the next day. There would, however, have to be a proper hearing to make permanently sure that it did not reach the public domain. That is different from what we are talking about.
<P>
Paragraph 6.13 of the guidance notes deals with reporting restrictions on juveniles. It says that defendants should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"accept the consequences of their behaviour and this may be inhibited if the proceedings are in private."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I thought that it was a tradition in our courts that it is usually not in juveniles' interests to be held up in a public pillory, however badly they have acted. I might be entirely wrong about this, but the Minister's note says that it might be necessary publicly to pillory certain juveniles, which is a worrying development. I mention paragraph 6.13 to appeal to hon. Members to read the guidance notes. If they do, they will become more and more worried.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Helen Brinton </B>(Peterborough): I take this opportunity to welcome you formally to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
So far, we seem to have had a semantic and esoteric debate on anti-social behaviour, with the intrusion of cowboys and indians at virtually every point. I do not know whether Opposition Members are trivialising anti-social behaviour. As we heard from the Minister and from my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,[Mrs. Helen Brinton]
North, the situations that we encounter in our constituencies do not suggest that the issue is trivial or has anything to do with cowboys and indians or with people waving their arms in the air and doing rain dances.
<P>
Clause 2 will make a considerable difference. It will enable local authorities and the police to prevent anti-social behaviour from escalating into criminal behaviour. That is the importance of the anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am intrigued by that. The hon. Lady said that the point of the clause was to prevent anti-social behaviour from escalating into criminal behaviour. Is that what she thinks the clause means? The Minister says that it is intended to prevent criminal behaviour. Conservative Members have asked whether we are talking about anti-social behaviour that causes criminal behaviour or about criminal behaviour. The hon. Lady seems to be completely at odds with the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> We are trying to stop both. The importance of the anti-social behaviour orders is that they will contribute to that.
<P>
I want to return to the semantic quibbles that have been raised about what constitutes anti-social behaviour. I thank the Minister for the guidance notes. Opposition Members have quibbled about them. I should like to read from them. They describe behaviour that may be appropriate for the use of an order as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"persistent unruly behaviour by a small group of individuals on a housing estate or local area, who perhaps dominate their peer group and use minor damage to property and fear of retaliation, possibly at unsociable hours, as a means of intimidating other people".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The matter is indeed one of intimidation. It is interesting that Opposition Members do not seem to feel that there are any problems at all; they seem to believe that the present law is working perfectly well. Circumstances in my constituency and in many others show that that is not the case.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Brinton:</B> No. I wish to make progress.
<P>
My constituents know what anti-social behaviour is. So too, I suspect, do those of Opposition Members. Anti-social behaviour orders will be granted by magistrates courts on the application of local authorities and high-ranking police officers. Do Opposition Members distrust the judgment of the police and the courts so much that they believe that they cannot judge anti-social behaviour when they see it?
<P>
The clause fulfils an important role in protecting the public from distressing behaviour. After the 18 years in which disorder has been allowed to thrive, I believe that my constituents and, indeed, those of Opposition Members realise that the new Labour Government are grasping the nettle of crime and disorder. I ask hon. Members in other parties to support us in tackling anti-social behaviour.
<P>
<B>Sir Robert Smith:</B> It is much better to take interventions, because it is quicker than forcing hon. Members to speak in the debate.
<P>
Liberal Democrats believe that the Bill covers serious problems. It would be dangerous, however, for the Committee to mislead people into thinking that a few lines in the Bill will necessarily make all the difference to their lifestyle, or for it to oversell any provision as making the difference.
<P>
We have heard of the failure of current legislation. That may often relate to the lack of resources necessary to provide the protection and police presence that enable people to be confident enough to use current law. It would be dangerous to believe that rewriting a few Bills deals with a resource problem.
<P>
Legitimate concerns will arise from any Bill that will mean that an order can be placed on someone because of a non-criminal act, and breached without that person engaging in a criminal act. Such a person can be turned into a criminal, the trigger point being the balance of probabilities. The Minister spoke earlier about testing to the extreme. It would be farcical to allow legislation to pass through Parliament without being tested to the extreme. The courts will test it to the extreme; that is what happens to legislation when it reaches the statute book.
<P>
The Minister should reassure the Committee. If his words can be used as protection for the individual, it is important to recognise that the state must not become overly oppressive. The Committee has discussed civil liberties. In providing protection for people who are genuinely and seriously suffering from the current state of disorder, we should not create a monster that overreacts and creates other problems. It is therefore important to clarify as the Minister is trying to the aims of the Bill and how it will work, and to ensure that the extremes will not become the norm.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I shall respond to new issues, and try not to cover old ground. I referred earlier, however, to guidance about sex offender orders. I said that I hoped that the draft might be available today. We have been able to complete one or two points and I shall place on the Table copies of the draft in envelopes addressed to hon. Members so that they may collect them as they leave. That is the most certain way to ensure that hon. Members receive them as soon as possible.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith), I should say that the courts or those who seek to use legislation do not always test it to the extreme. Widely drawn legislation with clarity of purpose, and with clear expectations placed on those who use it, can be a flexibile method.
<P>
I recognise the dangers, which is why I have been at some pains this morning to spell out our intentions in these orders and to deal with some of the misapprehensions. In conferences in recent months with the police, local authorities, housing officials, magistrates and others, I have put forward what we see as the benefits of the anti-social behaviour order and have listened to the responses precisely because of the importance of getting this right. I hope that today's debate will have helped to make clear what is intended.
<P>
Individuals who are subjected to the sort of anti-social behaviour that the order will target and who are not protected by the law as it stands would be stunned by some of the comments from Opposition Members. There is no place for the complacency which continues to leave people without the protection that they need. A number of hon. Members pointed out that some acts are punishable under existing legislation, such as the Public Order Act 1986. However, many people have not been protected by existing legislation. There may be a failure by the responsible authorities or resources may prevent action being taken.
<P>
I am keen on the order because I have seen situations where there has been no doubt about the commitment of the police, the housing authority or the environmental health officers to deal with the problem, but the outcome has been unsatisfactory. The fact that the system may deal well with an individual incident, with proving it and punishing the person responsible but not with the situations that I described earlier makes the measure essential.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hawkins:</B> I should make it clear to the Minister that the Opposition are far from saying that the sitation is perfect. I would be the first to concede that what he just said is right. There is quite often a need for further powers, and a number of us have sought to probe the effectiveness of the Minister's proposals. I am concerned that there are flaws in those proposals and we are seeking to persuade him that there are aspects, particular in the matter of malicious complaints, which he may wish to address later. We want to see something that will be effective in helping the sort of people that every member of the Committee wants to protect.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that comment, which is somewhat more reassuring than some of the others that have been in the past half hour. I can reassure him on two points. First, I am convinced that the applications made through the local authority or the police will filter out some of the trivial cases and those from malicious neighbours. The protections in the procedures will deal with that half of the equation. We want this procedure to be effective at preventing, not just punishing.
<P>
Perhaps I can deal with whether this approach will simply lead to later prosecutions as if it is just one step in the tariff. That is not the purpose. In Coventry, for example, the police and the local authority became concerned about serious harassment and intimidation and used the present system of injunction to try to prevent the behaviour. An injunction was granted by the court and the behaviour of the family who were subject to the injunction lessened. Interestingly, the anti-social behaviour of some other people on the estate and of people elsewhere in the city also lessened. The police and the local authority were perceived as being determined to prevent anti-social behaviour, and the courts as supporting them in that.
<P>
Unfortunately, the injunction was overturned on appeal. Its use was found to be beyond the powers that were intended when the systems of injunctions was established. Therefore, that vehicle for improving behaviour and preventing anti-social activity ceased to be available. I am sure that the relevant courts were correct and justified in their decisions. However, Coventry was trying to tease out a way of dealing with anti-social behaviour. That is what we are trying to do, having learnt from its experience. We want to introduce a measure to prohibit some behaviour, rather than merely using punishment. The possibility of punishment will not be removed either under existing law or for breach of an order. However, it will become possible to prevent behaviour that ruins people's lives.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> Why in the Coventry case did not the police use their ordinary powers of arrest for a criminal offence? Did the conduct fall short of a criminal offence, or were the witnesses frightened?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The hon. Gentleman is good at raising a series of questions. I outlined earlier a type of behaviour with elements of criminal action that could be dealt with by criminal prosecution and punishment, and other elements that might or might not be criminal. The choices under existing legislation do not deal with the whole package of such a continuing patterns of activity. I do not know all the details of the Coventry case, but having discussed it with some of the people involved, I am certain that it involved such a mixture of elements.
<P>
There is no room for confusion about our intentions. I hope that the debate will enable Opposition Members, on reflection, to decide that there is no confusion in their minds on the topic. I do not think that the hon. Member for Gainsborough has yet fully appreciated how effective an order would be. A caution is a first step in a tariff. It is not imposed by the courts but administered by the police, only if the person to be cautioned admits the offence. If some of the criminal acts that were part of a pattern of behaviour could be dealt with by police cautions, the police would use them. However, the orders are not designed for use in cases that could be dealt with so simply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> What the Minister says is correct as far as it goes, but if the person to whom a caution is offered does not admit the offence, he or she can be prosecuted. One of the conditions for administering a caution is that there should be evidence to enable proceedings to be taken against the person concerned. I think that that is embodied in the guidance notes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> Yes. The evidence would then have to be brought before the court and the case proved, according to the burden of proof in criminal cases. The court could then punish but not prohibit. That course would not deal with the patterns of behaviour that I believe will be the most common reasons for using the anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough also said that making an order would not solve the problem. It would not solve all problems, and on occasions orders would be breached. People would not observe the court's decision. So be it. Anyone who disregarded a court's prohibitions should be subject to strong penalties. However, I have shown through the evidence of Coventry other examples exist that many cases could be successful, and that there could be a knock-on effect on anti-social behaviour in the community, provided that Government and the responsible authorities are determined to use the new instrument.
[Mr. Michael]
<P>
Professional witnesses are not new. To describe them as paid snoopers casts an outrageous slur on housing officials and others who daily deal with problems that affect people in their area, or their constituencies, in the case of councillors or Members of Parliament. Housing officials are often unable to use information about continuing nuisance because it cannot be acted upon under available legislation. They want to protect people on the estates or in the properties for which they are responsible.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to emphasise a point that the hon. Member for Gainsborough does not understand: the clause provides for an order that will prevent people's lives being ruined, not for criminal prosecution. He has missed the point, and I do not think that his constituents will understand him.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere had to work hard to justify his suggestion that the measure was a dog's breakfast; it is not. It is a carefully considered solution to genuine problems. The hon. Gentleman was worried that the measure concentrated on behaviour rather than intention. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which was passed in the previous Session, concentrated on the effect of behaviour rather than on whether behaviour was criminal. The proposed order is intended to prohibit anti-social behaviour.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clappison:</B> My hon. Friend for Gainsborough made apposite points about intent. I said that, in the Bill, behaviour was defined entirely by reference to its effects, but that there was no guidance about relevant behaviour. That remains a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> The intention of preventing anti-social behaviour and its effects on people are crucial factors. As I said earlier, the point of the proposed order is to protect people. Section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 punishes breach of a civil injunction with criminal penalties.
<P>
I do not want to quibble about whether existing law is adequate to punish. However, it is inadequate to protect people from behaviour that could lead to an anti-social behaviour order. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made it clear that existing law is inadequate to protect people, and I agree with him.
<P>
The academics whose work was published by the Howard League were again mentioned. Reference was made to the fact that the burden of proof is on the person who is subject to the order to show that his behaviour is reasonable. That makes sense, because the court will consider whether to prohibit behaviour, not whether to punish the perpetrator. The opportunity to show that his behaviour is reasonable, despite the fact that its unpleasant, intimidatory or damaging effects have been proved to the court's satisfaction, is a fair protection.
<P>
Reference has been made to magistrates' anxiety. The Magistrates Association was involved in the consultation exercise. There is no reason why the guidance should not be available to it, and it has made it clear that it welcomes it. I was involved in court decisions for many years before I became a Member of Parliament, and I do not believe that magistrates will experience difficulty in deciding whether to grant an order.
<P>
An application under the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 to bind someone over to be of good behaviour can be made in the defendant's absence. In such circumstances, the court has the power to issue a warrant for arrest as an alternative to making an order. That procedure will apply to anti-social behaviour orders.
<P>
I want to deal with the remarks of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan). Juveniles were not a specific target when we set out to tackle anti-social behaviour and design an instrument to deal with it. We intend to nip things in the bud when dealing with young offenders. Some activities that qualify for an anti-social behaviour order might be perpetrated mainly by young people, but we want to involve young people, and ensure that they are part of the solution, not simply part of the problem.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hallam also referred to mental illness. Discussion between police and the local authority about whether an anti-social behaviour order was necessary might lead to identification of an alternative. That might involve prosecution, or examining mental health legislation or other options. The police and local authorities are likely to consider alternatives to anti-social behaviour orders. The order is intended to tackle one sort of damage to individuals, families and communities, alongside other options. The authorities should choose the most appropriate option.
<P>
To move away from the necessarily heavy note that we have struck, I point out to the parties of the 19th century that the Bill is introduced in the 20th century by the party for the 21st century.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for correctly interpreting my tenses earlier, and enabling us to continue with a largely measured and rational debate on issues that are important to anyone who wishes to balance the civil liberty to go about one's business with that to be free from harassment and intimidation by other members of society.
<P>
We have begun to consider important matters, which we shall discuss further when we debate other amendments. To ensure that we have the maximum amount of time to debate those amendments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 2, line 38, leave out "10" and insert "13".
<P>
The amendment relates to age. It would replace "aged 10" with "aged 13". I propose the amendment as a matter of principle. In 10 years' time, when the mayor of London or some other part of the country presents his or her political agenda for the benefit of the electorate, he or she might say, "The last regime in this local authority area applied for only 21 anti-social behaviour orders. I shall double it, I shall treble it and bring zero tolerance to our streets. I shall lower the age limit and crack down on crime." Perhaps I exaggerate in saying that the trend is for our elected local politicians to be more involved with measures against crime and similar activities. That is not greatly to be applauded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's train of thought, which is intriguing, as always, but I should like to relieve him of one fear. The matter would not come under the jurisdiction of the mayor of London; the local authority and the police would have those responsibilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I am unhappy that the clause applies to children aged 10. Earlier this morning, the Minister said that the purpose of the anti-social behaviour orders was not to target the younger element, but to focus on those who were older. I believe that that was in writing, and my hon. Friends might draw attention to that fact in due course. As the Minister has stated that the orders would be directed at older people, perhaps my amendment might find favour with the Government. I might be pushing at an open door and the Government might accept the amendment. I am sure that many Labour Members would agree with me that it is wrong in principle to take out such orders against someone as young as 10 years of age. Many of the Minister's comments reinforce that view.
<P>
We shall debate the issue of doli incapax, and my amendment also touches on that. I should like the age of 13 to be substituted for that of 10. It is conclusively presumed in this country that no child under the age of 10 can be guilty of any offence. That is from "Archbold". The position of a child between the ages of 10 and 14 is somewhat different and we shall discuss that later in our debates. However, the Committee will know that there is a presumption that a child between the ages of 10 and 14 is doli incapax. That can be rebutted only by clear and positive evidence that the child knew at the time that his act was seriously wrong, and that it was not mere naughtiness or childish mischief. Mere proof of an act however horrifying or obviously wrong the act cannot establish the requisite guilty knowledge and rebut the presumption.
<P>
The presumption makes good sense. However, under the clause, a 10 or 11-year old could have an order made against them. There is no doubt about that. If there is a complaint, the court can make an order. At a later stage, the child, perhaps still aged 10, might break that order. Under the Bill that would be a criminal offence, and the child would be subject to the rigours of the law. Despite the presumption of doli incapax, that child could not say, "I intended no offence. I didn't know I was doing wrong. I didn't realise the gravity of this." The child cannot say that, and no such defence is available to that child. A child cannot prove that it is reasonable which is what he must do in the original application. What is the position of that 11 or 12-year-old?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What about the age of criminal responsibility? I did some research and discovered that, as at three years ago, the age of criminal responsibility varied enormously in the 38 countries in the Council of Europe. Most of them have an age of criminal responsibility much higher than ours; in only five countries is it as young as ours or younger. The average age was 12 years seven months; in this country it is 10. That ought perhaps to be looked at on another day.
<P>
I feel distinctly unhappy about the prospect of 10, 11 and 12-year-olds facing the rigours of an anti-social behaviour order. The penalties may or may not be draconian. Will the Minister confirm that the penalties available for a child under 14 who breaches an anti-social behaviour order are a supervision order, an attendance centre order and a curfew order? I do not think that curfew orders are yet available in all parts of the country. Is a secure training order for a period of six months to two years available for a 12-year-old breaching an anti-social order? Specific help on those points would be appreciated.
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that a child or young person would be dealt with only in a youth court, as the notes that he sent to us earlier talk about a young person being dealt with in a magistrates court? I think that that is a misprint and the notes intend to say a youth court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ivan Lewis </B>(Bury, South): The hon. Gentleman referred to European norms of criminal behaviour and ages. Is he advocating a Europe-wide definition of the age of criminal responsibility and that we have a federalist approach?
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> No. That is certainly not a road that I should be drawn down. I apprciate the point of the hon. Gentleman's question. No, it is not something I want because I recognise the diversity and the difference. I have other views about harmonisation which boil down to a short sentence: I am not wholly in favour of much harmonisation of the criminal or civil law. It is interesting that the age of criminal responsibility in those countries is by nand large higher than ours. As in Committee we are probing, debating amendments and discussing matters generally, it is fair to point out that our age of criminal responsibility is low compared with that of so many other countries. Is that not something that we should consider?
<P>
I feel uneasy at the thought of 10, 11 or 12-year-olds effectively being subject to the same sanctions as much older people. The Minister said that the purpose of the anti-social behaviour orders was to deal with older children. I believe that a wholly different approach should be taken with younger children; I wish that there was much more emphasis in the Bill, and in the Government's thinking, on encouraging diversion from stupid, and arguably criminal, behaviour. The wrong place for a young child to appear is in court, even in civil proceedings such as this, because of the serious sanctions that result.
<P>
The question of a child's mental intention is indeed relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lewis:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman accept that this is only part of the Government's approach to the problem of crime and disorder in society? We are committed to investment in early-years education and to ensuring that people have proper parenting skills. The parenting orders in the Bill deal with parents who need assistance and support in developing the parenting skills that some of us take for granted, but which some in society do not have. It is wrong to consider the prohibitive elements of the Bill in isolation from the rest of the Government's strategy. While the Bill focuses on those issues as they relate to the criminal justice system, it is only one part of a much bigger picture in the Government's approach to preventing young people from drifting into crime and in helping them to avoid it in the first place.
<P>
Another example of the Government's approach is that of the new deal 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is a rather long intervention, which I mistakenly thought that the hon. Gentleman was bringing to a close. I ask him speedily to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lewis:</B> I was bringing my intervention to amend, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's intervention, lengthy though it was. As an aside, Opposition members of the Committee are gladdened that is not the wrong word by the fact that a number of Members on the Government Benches have contributed to the debate. It is important that they do so. The Minister and the Government Whip must be delighted to have heard such thoughtful, lengthy contributions.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) made a good point: the matter of young people and crime is a wide one, and many different strategies are needed to deal with the problem. The hon. Gentleman said that important work needs to be done in schools and in the home, and he is right. We shall probe other measures later in the Bill; the hon. Gentleman is right to say that it is not just the criminal law, or indeed this clause, that is important. What troubles me is the thought of 10, 11 and 12-year-olds appearing in court because, as I said earlier I cannot put it very well in words I find it an unhappy and somewhat offensive situation. I wish that the orders could apply to children who are a little older. That is the spirit of my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is a difficult line to tread to speak to the amendment without anticipating our later debate on doli incapax. The hon. Gentleman may have overstepped the line on one or two occasions, but I respect the fact that he was trying to keep in order. I ask other hon. Members to do the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael:</B> I do not intend to break your ruling, Mr. O'Hara, on the absurd doctrine of doli incapax, which presumes that those aged 10 to 13 do not know right from wrong. I am tempted to suggest that the hon. Gentleman cannot know many 10-year-olds if he thinks that that doctrine is sustainable.
<P>
In cases involving individuals in that age group, courts will use their common sense, as they usually do, in ensuring that, if there is a breach of the law and if sanctions are to be imposed, those sanctions are commensurate with the age and development of the individual concerned. The point is that if individuals aged 10, 11 or 12 are involved in the sort of anti-social behaviour envisaged for the imposition of an order, the public need to be indeed, should be protected against them.
<P>
I do not intend to go into detail, but the amendment would create a gap. For instance, all the members of a family may be involved in anti-social behaviour of the sort that I described earlier. For members of that family under the age of 10 who are below the criminal age of responsibility, under the child protection orders, which we shall come to later in the Bill, we shall create a vehicle to do something to prevent their behaviour and protect them.
<P>
If we accept the amendment, those over the age of 13 could be made the subject of an anti-social behaviour order, but those aged between 10 and 13 could not be touched. Nothing could be done, and the community would not be protected from them. Such children could be used by older members of the family and the parents as an instrument for further activity that the parents were prevented from engaging in but which the youngsters were not. That is not an academic point. On many occasions, children under the age of criminal responsibility have been relied on as an instrument for that sort of anti-social behaviour. As I said, those children are dealt with under child protection orders, but it would be ludicrous to exclude those aged between 10 to 13.
<P>
As for the protections, only the normal child penalties apply. Therefore, the protections are similar for other appearances before a court. For a breach of an order, the youth courts would have to make the decisions, but the application could be made to a magistrates court. We should not be concerned about that; it is likely that evidence would be brought forward at a magistrates court when an order was applied for, which would be relevant to the behaviour of older members of the family.
<P>
I assure the Committee that the various safeguards in part III of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 will apply. We are discussing with the various organisations how to ensure that that group is properly catered for, but I expect orders against that age group to be rare. However, on occasion, the children may be the younger members of the family from hell referred to earlier.
<P>
For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment. I understand that the hon. Member for Woking has genuine worries, but the amendment would create a gap; it would be a mistake, and there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure that inappropriate decisions are not made in respect of youngsters in that age group. As I said, that leaves aside the question of whether those in the 10 to 13 age group should be dealt with differently; we shall return to that subject when we debate doli incapax.
<P>
<B>Mr. Malins:</B> On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
