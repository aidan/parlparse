<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Thursday 14 January 1999</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><a href="/pa/cm199899/cmbills/001/1999001.htm">Water Industry Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the benefit of the Committee if I apologise. The notices on the boards that announce Committees are yesterday's, not today's. Furthermore, it took me 40 minutes to get here this morning, although I do not know about anybody else. I shall write to the Modernisation Committee about that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household): On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. This is a moment of history. I am sure that all members of the Committee are delighted to be part of the first Committee to meet under the new modernisation rules. Some of us are even looking forward to other days like this.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order, but the hon. Gentleman is entitled to his opinion.
<H4><center>Clause 14</center></H4>
<H4><center>Application to Wales and Scotland</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales </B>(Mr. Jon Owen Jones): I shall not echo my Whip's comments, although I share some of his sympathy for modernisation. I do not, however, want to anger you too much, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
Clause 14 deals with the application of the Bill to Wales and Scotland. As regards Wales, it provides for the relevant functions of the Secretary of State in the Bill to be transferred to the National Assembly for Wales. That will be achieved by means of an Order in Council, which will be subject to negative resolution and separate from the main transfer of functions order, which is likely to have been laid before Houses some time previously. That is an appropriate way in which to proceed in the interim stage before the National Assembly is established.
<P>
The clause provides for the Scottish provisions in the Bill to be considered as a pre-commencement enactment under the Scotland Act 1998. When devolution takes effect in Scotland this July, the powers and functions that clauses 12 and 13 confer on the Secretary of State will be transferred to the Ministers of the new Scottish Executive. They will then be accountable to the Scottish Parliament for the exercise of those powers.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, my hon. Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), said on Second Reading, it will be for Scottish Ministers to implement the Scottish provisions if they wish when they assume their responsibilities. However, they will not be obliged to do so. They may, if they prefer, continue with the existing arrangements or make proposals for consideration by the Scottish Parliament in due course.
<P>
The provisions in clause 14 are fully consistent with the Government's devolution policy. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept the clause.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 14 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>Minor and consequential amendments and repeals</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Minister for the Environment (Mr. Michael Meacher):</B> It might be helpful if I briefly described the contents of clause 15. It introduces schedule 2, which makes minor and consequential amendments, and schedule 3, which introduces certain repeals.
<P>
Schedule 2 has two functions. The first is to enable clause 10 to allow water companies to install meters in circumstances in which they do not have an immediate intention to charge by reference to volume. Secondly, clause 10 ensures that water companies have the power to carry out works that are connected with meter installation, such as the installation of pipes, where they are needed to give effect to the Bill's provisions. That includes cases in which there is an immediate intention to use a meter as a basis for charging. Although the clause has a limited impact, it is a necessary piece of machinery.
<P>
Schedule 2 provides for necessary consequential amendments to allow clause 10 to have effect. The schedule also provides for guidance given to the Director General of Water Services under clause 4 to be entered on the director general's register. Schedule 3 states the repeals to other legislation that are described in the relevant clauses.
<P>
It is a business-like clause, and I hon. Members to support it.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Schedules 2 and 3 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 16</center></H4>
<H4><center>Financial provision</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I shall briefly spell out the clause's purpose. It provides financial cover for any provisions in the Bill that require money to be spent by the Government. The clause is needed because it amends existing legislation, primarily the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 and the Water Industry Act 1991, and because any increased expenditure under the Bill would not be provided for under the original legislation.
<P>
The Government do not expect the Bill to result in any significant increase in expenditure. The only clauses that might result in such expenditure are clauses 4 and 5, which provide for the Secretary of State to give guidance to the director general on his powers of approving charging schemes and making regulations and for the setting up of the water industry commissioner and consultative committees in Scotland. The first of those provisions represents a minor additional task. With regard to the second, it is intended that the commissioner and the consultative committees will be funded by a levy on the water and sewerage authorities. There should, therefore, be no additional claim on public funds.
<P>
We do not believe that any of the Bill's other clauses will increase Government expenditure. The director general is being given additional functions, but those will represent only a minor additional task because he is already consulted by water companies about their charging schemes. The costs associated with that will, in any case, be covered by the licence fees, paid by water companies, which cover the regulator's cost.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I put the Question, I remind members of the Committee that the money resolution is available in the Room.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 16 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>New Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Liability of owners for charges</center></H4>

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tom Brake </B>(Carshalton and Wallington): I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time
<P>
I am not entirely unsympathetic towards water companies' concerns about the withdrawal of disconnection powers. However, I tabled the new clause to discover whether the Government can give water companies any help in relation to a small group of customers who are not as diligent as others in paying their water charges. I refer specifically to short-stay tenants or residents who may move into a property and move out again soon afterwards, for legitimate reasons, but&#151;unwittingly or otherwise&#151;without paying their water bill. That is easily done. I admit that, when I moved into my new constituency office, it was several months before I realised that I needed to pay my water bill&#151;which I have, of course, now done. I assure Labour Members that there is no dirt to dig. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be heard in silence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I shall let hon. Members dig and expend their energies in that way if they so choose. The water bill has now been paid.
<P>
In other circumstances, however, a customer could have moved on to another property having forgotten to pay the bill or deliberately not done so. The new clause would ensure that landlords of tenants with a tenancy of 12 months or less would be liable for water bills for their premises, thereby reducing water companies' exposure to potential bad debt. Does the Minister have any comments or suggestions?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman, who spoke straightforwardly and fairly, as he has throughout our proceedings. I accept that there is a problem with short-term tenants or licensees but, for reasons that I shall give, I do not believe that his proposal is the best way of dealing with it.
<P>
The simple rule in section 144 of the Water Industry Act 1991 is that the person responsible for paying water charges is normally the person who occupies the premises. Obviously, that has the great merit of associating the bill with the person who actually uses the water and sewerage services. Section 144 does not inhibit any convenient arrangement that the parties may wish to make about how the charges are collected and paid. For example, many landlords&#151;including several local authorities&#151;collect rent and water charges and then pass on the relevant payment to the water undertaker.
<P>
I accept that in some cases there may be an advantage for all concerned in agreeing that the landlord should pay the water company's bill direct and include water charges in the tenant's rent. That is a perfectly sensible arrangement. Some water companies are exploring that option on a voluntary basis. I welcome such initiatives where they bring benefits and are in the interests of&#151;and agreed between&#151;all parties. However, whatever arrangement is made, the agreement entered into between landlord and tenant or between owner and licensee will normally make it clear whether the rent includes or excludes payment for services such as water and sewerage.
<P>
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) is really asking the Government to lay down whether rents are to be net or gross of water charges. It is a matter of judgment, but our judgment is that it is not appropriate. To prescribe that landlords are responsible for payments, as the amendment proposes, would in effect force all rents on short lets to include payments for water charges; otherwise, the landlord would be doubtful of recovering his costs.
<P>
I do not believe that that is the right approach to any difficulty that might arise when a water bill is not paid. If that happens, it is already open to the water company to approach the tenant who is the actual occupier and user of the water. If the tenant believes that he has paid his charges to the landlord, that amounts to a tenancy dispute, which needs to be settled like any other dispute about rent or charges.
<P>
The water undertaker may have difficulties with short-term tenants who are responsible for paying their own water charges but move on after failing to pay. I accept that a small minority do that, inadvertently or perhaps in a few cases deliberately, but I do not accept that we should legislate to make landlords responsible for bills simply because it is easier for water companies to collect debts from landlords than from tenants&#151;if, indeed, that is the case. I would point out to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington that in the case of landlords who are simply brass-plate companies, or of absentee landlords who may be out of the country, having left their house on a short let, it may be as difficult to collect debts from the owner as it is from a transient tenant.
<P>
I am sympathetic to the problem of sorting out payment for water charges of tenanted property, but I believe that the current provisions are satisfactory and that it would not be justified to use the heavy hand of legislation in this manner to deal with a small minority of cases. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that explanation and not press his amendment to a Division.

<P>

<B>Mr. Donald Gorrie (Edinburgh, West):</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington. The Minister strongly argued that our amendment is not the right way to crack the problem. However, one issue arises from what he said. If, as a result of the negligence of a landlord, a whole succession of rapidly-moving-on tenants do not pay, will the Government give the water company some comfort by allowing it to apply pressure&#151;perhaps by removing the water pressure from the landlord? If a negligent landlord does not ensure that his tenants pay, and tenants keep moving on, will there be some arrangement whereby the water company could be helped to deal with a rogue landlord, instead of with the tenants?
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> My view would be that if, as the hon. Gentleman describes, a succession of tenants had not paid, it would be for the water company to take early action. The water undertaker would be aware of a change of tenant; it would be alerted to the problem and need not wait for the series of events that the hon. Gentleman describes. It is for the water company to take action&#151;to send someone round to knock on the door, if writing a letter or sending a further bill is not sufficient. We are talking about a small minority of cases, and the use of the whole portentous edifice of legislation to protect water companies in such cases cannot be justified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brake:</B> I have listened to what the Minister has said, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill to the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Meacher:</B> Before our proceedings close, Mr. McWilliam, may I briefly say on behalf of the Government that we are most grateful for the way in which you and your colleague, Mr. Atkinson, have presided over our proceedings? I always feel that, as one gradually gets into Bills, one begins to enjoy what I will call not the banter but the exchange over issues, which, dare I say it, creates a relationship with the Opposition. The Bill is small, but has been interesting.
<P>
I also praise you, Mr. McWilliam, on your readiness to inhibit what must be your desire in many cases to jump in to the debate. You and Mr. Atkinson have supervised our proceedings in a helpful and constructive way, and we are most grateful to you.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Burns (West Chelmsford):</B> I concur totally with the Minister's remarks. Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, and your colleague, Mr. Atkinson, for the way in which you have looked after and controlled us in this Committee. On behalf of the Opposition, may I say what pleasure we have found in doing business with the team of Ministers? We were extremely flattered that so many Ministers had to be present to deal with the three of us; we understand the reason for that. We look forward to Report, and to the Government accepting the first set of amendments that we tabled to clause 1.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On behalf of the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) and myself, I thank all members of the Committee for their co-operation in behaving themselves, by and large, in staying in order, by and large, and in sticking to the amendments that were before the Committee, by and large. It has been a pleasure to chair the Committee considering this Bill. It is the first Bill to report in 1999. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said earlier, this is an historic occasion, but it has been an experiment, and I shall of course report its result to Madam Speaker at 9.18 am.
<P>
Bill to be reported, without amendment.
