<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000389"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Atkinson. Having spoken in the opening minutes of the
first sitting, I shall now, in the sixth sitting, make some more
substantive remarks&#151;at least I hope that they will be more
substantive than what I said previously.</div>
<a name="09060283000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might help
the Committee if I give some background to the schedule before
discussing in detail the amendments, which are probably not
comprehensible without an explanation. Clause 23 and schedule 6 provide
a temporary extension for carrying back trade losses for income tax and
corporation tax. The provisions were originally  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column188" />Column number: 188</div>announced in the pre-Budget report in 2008. They will enable both
incorporated and unincorporated businesses to carry back their losses
for three years.</div>
<a name="09060283000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
assumption is that, in the current economic conditions, a number of
businesses would make losses. They are currently allowed to carry back
their losses for one year, and they then carry their losses forward.
Extending the carry-back by a further two years will give businesses a
cash-flow advantage by reducing their tax bills for previous years. In
effect, a business that expects to be profitable in future can utilise
its loss relief now, rather than when it returns to profit, in a way
that will generate further cash-flow advantages. The Budget changed the
temporary extension from one year to two so that a company that makes a
loss in 2008-09 or 2009-10 can claim tax relief for its loss. The
losses that can be carried back have been capped at &#163;50,000 a
year, and amendments 31 to 35 would increase that limit to
&#163;100,000. I shall say a little more about that in a
moment.</div>
<a name="09060283000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
understanding&#151;I will be grateful if the Minister confirms
this&#151;is that the rules mean that the taxpayer will get the
benefit at the highest rate of tax that they pay. Someone who runs an
incorporated business and pays tax at 40 per cent. will receive a
benefit of up to &#163;20,000, whereas as a business paying a
combination of the starting rate or the basic rate of tax in previous
years would receive a significantly lower sum. A company paying tax at
the main rate would receive a maximum benefit of &#163;14,000, while
a company paying tax at the small company rate would receive less. The
relief seems to provide more help to businesses who pay higher rates of
tax; effectively, it provides a subsidy to businesses that are making a
loss.</div>
<a name="09060283000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said
earlier, the scheme announced in the pre-Budget report allowed only one
year of losses to be carried back. However, a number of representations
were made prior to the Budget, and the Institute of Chartered
Accountants suggested that two years&#146; losses should be available
for carry-back. The Government obviously listened, but a significant
cost is attached to that change.</div>
<a name="09060283000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The total
cost of the measures announced in the pre-Budget report and the Budget
is &#163;475 million, which is &#163;180 million for the relief
announced in the pre-Budget report 2008 and a further &#163;295
million for the measures announced in the Budget. In the next clause we
will consider the temporary increase in first-year
allowances&#151;from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. Will the Minister
give us a flavour of the Government&#146;s thinking about how they
decided to split their finite pot of money for helping businesses
between the loss relief provisions we have been debating and the
first-year allowance provisions that we will debate under the next
clause? Will he also clarify just how the Government came to their
estimates of the costs of the
measure?</div><a name="09060283000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
people looking at this matter will think that perhaps, given the
current economic climate, many businesses will be making losses and
those losses will be available for carry-back. However, when I looked
at the regulatory impact assessment that supports the measure, it
surprised me that the Government had estimated that only 1 per cent. of
incorporated taxpayers and 2 per cent. of companies would benefit from
the proposal. That seems at odds with people&#146;s assumption about
where the economy is heading, given the scale and projected length of
the downturn. It seems rather surprising 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>that the proportion of businesses that the Government expect to benefit
is particularly low. If that is a forecasting estimate&#151;the
Treasury is good at getting its forecasts wrong&#151;the cost to
taxpayers could be significant. If the figures are out by a factor of
three, we are talking about a cost to the Exchequer of &#163;1.5
billion, rather than &#163;500 million. What comfort can the Minister
give us about the cost of the measure, and how certain is he that the
cost estimates in the Red Book are
correct?</div><a name="09060283000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have tabled three sets of amendments to this schedule. The first are
very much probing amendments that would increase the threshold of
losses from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000. I am trying to
understand why the threshold was set at &#163;50,000 rather than
&#163;100,000, or a lower amount. Clearly, this is a matter of
changing the timings for businesses getting relief for losses made.
There is a cash cost from increasing the threshold from &#163;50,000
to &#163;100,000, but over the lifetime of a business, there should
be no total tax loss to the Exchequer. Will the Minister explain why
the Government chose to set the limit at
&#163;50,000?</div><a name="09060283000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second set of amendments&#151;amendments 28, 29 and
37&#151;tries to tidy up some of the drafting in the schedule. The
dates that are used in the schedule are based on the date of the
pre-Budget report in November 2008, so we have an odd accounting
period, ending on say 23 November 2010. This set of amendments would
move the accounting date to coincide with the more normal year end for
businesses: 31 December
2010.</div><a name="09060283000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon.
Members might ask whether that means that we are likely to increase the
level of loss available for relief against profits in previous years,
but again, because of the way the schedule is drafted, there is a cap
of &#163;50,000. I do not believe that that would increase the amount
of losses that taxpayers would be able to relieve by virtue of the
schedule. It would just tidy up the accounting dates and make tax
compliance easier, from the perspective of businesses, meaning that
they could look at their losses for an entire year rather than for
parts of the
year.</div><a name="09060283000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
30 addresses any confusion that there might be about how the cap will
operate. Paragraph 3(3) sets out &#163;50,000 as the limit for losses
carried back for periods between 23 November 2008 and 24 November 2009,
and the same limit for losses carried back for periods between 23
November 2009 and 24 November 2010. I assume that that is intended to
mean that, no matter how many accounting periods end after
23 November 2008 and before 24 November 2009, the maximum
extended carry-back total is still &#163;50,000. If that is the
correct interpretation, paragraph 3(4) is redundant, because it sets
out rules for cases in which losses are made under a shorter accounting
period and the carry-back is then in proportion to &#163;50,000 at an
annualised rate. If losses are capped strictly at &#163;50,000, we do
not need paragraph 3(4), hence my amendment to remove it. If the
intention of paragraph 3(3) is not to cap the amount at &#163;50,000
in a 12-month period, the provisions need to be
redrafted.</div><a name="09060283000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a couple of final points. The Institute of Chartered Accountants
has done rather well in arguing its case for a second year of losses
and has decided to push the Minister&#146;s patience a bit more by
asking the Government, given the continued economic uncertainty, to
make it clear that there is still a window open for a review, perhaps
next year, if the economy has not improved, if the Chancellor&#146;s
ambitious and optimistic growth 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>forecasts have not been realised and if the recession goes on for longer
than expected. It has asked whether the Government could look at a
further year or more of carry-back, and I would be grateful for the
Minister&#146;s comments on that.</div>
<a name="09060283000049"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060283000390"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Graham Stuart</b> (Beverley and Holderness) (Con): My hon.
Friend is giving a powerful speech on a technically challenging area. I
declare an interest, both as a director of an incorporated business and
a partner in an unincorporated business. The unincorporated business,
interestingly enough, has a year end of 30 April, and unincorporated
businesses with that year end will find on 30 April 2010 that they will
be unable to use the relief because it will finish with the end of the
tax year a few weeks before. That seems to be unfair on unincorporated
businesses, when compared with the impact on incorporated businesses,
which can continue if their year end stretches up to November 2010.
Does my hon. Friend sympathise with their
position?</div><a name="09060283000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000391"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that
question. That is part of the challenge, because, as he stated when we
discussed the reduction in small companies tax on the Floor of the
House, there is a range of models for the legal structure of
businesses, and some partnerships or unincorporated sole traders will
be seeking to take advantage of that. Some incorporated businesses will
also seek to take advantage of that, and the regulatory impact
assessment sets out the proportion of people in that category. The
Government expect the measure to be taken up by about 15,000 people.
They will be self-employed, but deemed to be partners in companies, so
it will obviously affect them. I do not know the size of my hon.
Friend&#146;s company, but of the 75,500 businesses that could
benefit, the Government expect 30,000 small to medium-sized companies
and 5,500 large companies to do so. We need to ensure that the rules
are reasonable and fair and that the compliance costs are kept under
control as well. That is one reason for my proposed date change, which
I commented on
earlier.</div><a name="09060283000338"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="09060283000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend asked about businesses with a year end on 30 April. The
risk is that they will end up having to shift the two-year period, so
that profits made in earlier years do not apply. However, I am sure
that the Minister will want to respond to my hon. Friend&#146;s
comments
directly.</div><a name="09060283000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
some are concerned about the interaction between paragraphs (1) and (2)
of schedule 6 and the anti-avoidance and sideways loss relief
provisions in section 74A of the Income Tax Act 2007. I have been asked
whether the operation of provisions in section 74A will
restrict the losses that can be used in the current tax year and each
of the three preceding tax years. The purpose of the discussion is
threefold&#151;to ask the Minister about tidying up the accounting
periods; to look at the way in which paragraph 3(3) works in practice
and whether paragraph 3(4) is redundant; and to probe the
Government&#146;s thinking on the cost of this measure. Is this the
most effective way of providing relief to businesses? Have the
Government accurately estimated the cost to the Exchequer of
introducing this measure?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000392"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen
Timms):</b> I, too, warmly welcome you to the Chair of our
afternoon sitting, Mr. Atkinson.</div>
<a name="09060283000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
respond to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Fareham. As
he pointed out, clause 23 and schedule 6 provide additional
support to loss-making businesses by extending the carry-back of
trading losses from one to three years for losses of up to
&#163;50,000 a year. This will apply for two years from 24 November
2008 for companies, and for the 2008-09 and 2009-10 tax years for
unincorporated businesses. He is right that, if someone pays the
corporation tax main rate of 28 per cent., they will receive relief at
28 per cent. Similarly, a self-employed person with an unincorporated
business and liable for income tax at the basic rate will receive
relief at the 20 per cent. rate. He talked about benefiting from relief
at the highest rate paid, which is an accurate characterisation of the
way in which the measure will
work.</div><a name="09060283000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
estimate that about 140,000 businesses will benefit over two years by
an average of &#163;4,000 per year. The hon. Gentleman asked whether
that was an accurate estimate. It is based on some modelling of records
of tax returns submitted by businesses and an assessment of what we can
expect, given the current economic conditions. He asked whether the
proportion of businesses benefiting should not be rather larger, but I
remind him that substantial loss relief is available already. There is
one-year carry-back for companies and non-incorporated businesses,
terminal loss relief with three-year carry-back for the self-employed
and companies ceasing to trade, and so on. The majority of businesses
making losses in the current climate will get relief through those
mechanisms, so we would expect that the number of businesses getting
relief through the clause and the schedule to be of the order of
magnitude that I have indicated. Is it absolutely certain that that is
the right answer? No. Of course there is some uncertainty. However, it
is a pretty sound estimate of what the measure is likely to
cost.</div>
<a name="09060283000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000393"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The last time that I asked the Minister about
elasticities he was singularly unforthcoming, although he was always
polite in his reply. So, if I can follow up on the question put by my
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham, I want to ask the Minister, who
expressed confidence in the soundness of this estimate, what is the
elasticity that might surround this estimate? In other words, how great
could the losses be? Is my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham
completely off the wall in suggesting that they could be three times
higher than the numbers that we see before us? Can the Minister give
his view on
that?</div><a name="09060283000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000394"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am not quite sure what the parameter would be in
this case for the elasticity that the hon. Gentleman is questioning me
about. All I can say to him is that some significant evaluation work
has been carried out to come up with this figure. It is the best
estimate that we can provide. I am not in a position to say to him that
there will be a 90 per cent. range or anything of that kind, although I
can understand why he might be interested in knowing that
information.</div>
<a name="09060283000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the hon.
Gentleman knows, in the Red Book we set out our best estimates and I
think that this estimate is quite a well-founded one. Having said that,
of course he and the hon. Member for Fareham are right that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>there is inevitably some uncertainty about exactly what will happen in
the next few months and years when this arrangement will be in
place.</div>
<a name="09060283000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000395"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I take on board the Minister&#146;s comments, and
it comes through in the RIA that some work has gone into assessing this
number. However, what concerns me is that the proportion of businesses
is quite small. I also take on board the comment that he
made about the number of other available reliefs that could absorb
losses made in the next couple of years.</div>
<a name="09060283000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,
at what point does the Treasury say, &#147;Actually, we got this so
badly wrong that we are just going to allow this relief to be in place
for one year&#148;, effectively reversing the decision taken in the
2009 Budget to extend the relief for a further
year?</div><a name="09060283000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000396"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> We are agreeing in the schedule and in the clause,
if it goes forward, to a relief that will be in place for the period
that has been set out. I am not sure if it would be possible to reverse
the measure in the finance Bill 2010; it probably would be possible.
However, that is not something that I would expect to happen.</div>
<a name="09060283000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me respond to the interesting points that the hon. Gentleman raises in
the amendments that he has tabled. First, amendments 28, 29 and 37 seek
to extend the relief for companies to losses in accounting periods
ending on or before 31 December 2010, instead of on or before 23
November 2010. He is right, of course, that company accounting periods
are unlikely to align exactly with the qualifying windows. That will
mean that accounting periods will straddle the start dates or end dates
for the qualifying periods. That is not particularly problematic,
although it is perhaps somewhat untidy. However, since companies have
different accounting periods, it is inevitable that that will happen,
whatever period we choose.</div>
<a name="09060283000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure
is intended to apply for two years, for both companies and
unincorporated businesses. Extending the provision for companies by an
extra month to 31 December 2010, as the amendment proposes
would mean that, for companies with accounting periods ending on 31
December, each of the accounting periods ending 31 December 2008, 31
December 2009 and 31 December 2010 would fall within the qualifying
period. That would give companies scope to access relief for losses
over a three-year period. Therefore, I suggest that it would give them
an advantage over unincorporated businesses, which make up three
quarters of the business population in the UK and whose interests have
already been raised with us by the hon. Member for Beverley and
Holderness. Those unincorporated businesses would be able to claim
losses from only two years. Essentially, the argument is that we want
both types of businesses to be able to claim in respect of two years,
and the amendment would extend it to a third year in the case of
incorporated
businesses.</div><a name="09060283000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000397"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b><b class="B"> </b>The Minister has been generous in giving
way. Am I right in saying that even if we extended it to a third year,
the maximum loss would still be capped at
&#163;100,000?</div>
<a name="09060283000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000398"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that the &#163;50,000
per year loss would still apply, but the amendment nevertheless gives
access to the facility for a longer period for some incorporated
business, depending on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div>their accounting period, than would be the case with unincorporated
businesses. In that way, there would be an element of unfairness. If we
had introduced such a measure, I am sure that it would have been
challenged in the Committee.</div>
<a name="09060283000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">One way in
which we could have introduced the measure was by starting the period
on 31 December 2008. That would have delayed implementation, but we
wanted to introduce the facility as quickly as possible, so we decided
to do it with effect from the date of the pre-Budget report.</div>
<a name="09060283000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 36
seeks to remove the reduction to the &#163;50,000 limit when losses
arise in an accounting period shorter than a year. Paragraph 3 of
schedule 6 provides extended relief for trading losses of relevant
accounting periods ending within each of the qualifying
periods&#151; 24 November 2008 to 23 November 2009 or 24
November 2009 to 23 November 2010&#151;subject to a limit of
&#163;50,000 on the losses from each qualifying period. With such a
two-year period, there will always be accounting periods that end just
outside and which therefore do not qualify for the extended relief. The
rule is intended to deter a company from arranging for additional
periods to qualify for relief when that is not intended. Companies can
change their accounting periods and there could be some unfairness as a
result.</div>
<a name="09060283000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not
want to impose unnecessarily burdensome rules to determine the eligible
losses, such as requiring profits and losses of accounting periods to
be apportioned, so instead we have gone for a simple
approach&#151;reducing the annual limit pro rata when an accounting
period is shorter than 12 months. That is sensible and
proportionate.</div><a name="09060283000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000399"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I think I understand now the drafting of paragraph
3(3). Is the Minister&#146;s argument that if a company&#146;s
accounting period ended on, say, 31 March 2010, and then it had another
accounting period ending at the end of December 2010, it could
effectively try to claim two lots of &#163;50,000 in the period,
hence paragraph 3(4)?</div>
<a name="09060283000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000400"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> That is absolutely right. That is what paragraphs
3(4) and (5)
address.</div><a name="09060283000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
30 seeks to prevent the &#163;50,000 limit applying to an accounting
period immediately preceding the relevant accounting period in which
the trading loss arose. I might be able to help the hon. Gentleman on
that. Paragraph 3 provides for an extended loss carry-back for losses
incurred in a relevant accounting period&#151;it is available for
&#163;50,000 of losses incurred in relevant periods. However,
paragraph 3 is concerned only with the &#163;50,000 of losses that
may be subject to the extended relief; it does not apply to any losses
in excess of the &#163;50,000 limit. Those further losses are
available for carry-back against profits of the preceding accounting
period, subject to the normal 12-month carry-back rules. I hope that
that explanation reassures him that the amendment is unnecessary and I
hope that I have made the measure
clear.</div><a name="09060283000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000401"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Minister thinks that 114,000 companies will
benefit. Has he done any modelling work on how many of those would have
gone out of business, but will now survive as a result of the measure?

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000403"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It is 140,000, not 114,000. I have some anecdotes.
I was speaking to an accountant recently who told me that his
colleagues who work as liquidators appear to be less busy this year
than they were last year. He believes that it is because HMRC&#146;s
time-to-pay arrangements, introduced around the time of the pre-Budget
report, are extremely helpful in enabling some companies which would
not otherwise have done so to get through a very difficult period. That
is not about this relief, but it is about the related measure that we
put in place in the pre-Budget
report.</div><a name="09060283000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5
pm</div><a name="09060283000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000404"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Despite the despairing feeling of some of the
Minister&#146;s colleagues, it seems important to try to understand
the impact of this. If the Treasury&#146;s dynamic model of the
economy&#151;which we would all like to see&#151;was available, we
could model this more precisely and understand the impacts on the
survival of businesses and then perhaps we could see that this is a
relief that should be extended for all time. If, over time, it is
neutral in its impact on the Exchequer, but leads to the real survival
of businesses, some of which at least must happen as a result, then
this relief could be extended for a longer period. In any case, the
Government should be congratulated for having brought this
forward.</div><a name="09060283000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000405"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that
last remark. I do not have access to a model of the kind that he
describes. If he is able to find one, that would be a valuable
contribution.</div><a name="09060283000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
31 to 35 seek to raise the amount of trading losses that businesses can
carry back for three years from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000. I
shall urge the Committee to resist these amendments. Essentially, I am
arguing that we should reject them on the grounds of cost. The measure
that we put in place is proportionate and targeted in the light of the
current downturn. Limiting the extended relief to &#163;50,000 a year
ensures that additional resources are targeted on smaller businesses,
which are perhaps the most vulnerable at a difficult time.</div>
<a name="09060283000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
estimated that 90 per cent. of eligible businesses will be able to
claim full relief on their losses at the &#163;50,000 limit. Doubling
the limit to &#163;100,000 would not benefit the vast majority of
smaller businesses, although it would benefit some larger ones.
However, it would also increase the cost of this measure by about
&#163;150 million over two years on top of, according to
the estimate in the Red Book, &#163;230 million in 2009-10, plus
&#163;215 million in 2010-11. There would be a significant
additional cost and we should not be committing in this
way.</div><a name="09060283000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
I draw attention to the benefits that we have seen from the business
payment support service, which we also introduced at the time of the
pre-Budget report. We expanded that in the Budget to allow businesses
expecting to make losses this year to offset them against tax bills on
profits from the previous year which they are unable to pay. That is
another worthwhile extension 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div>to the help that we are providing. The hon. Gentleman explained that
these were probing amendments. I hope that I have been able to give him
some reassurance and some explanations. I hope that he will not feel it
necessary to press the amendments to a
vote.</div>
<a name="09060283000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000406"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his
comments and responses to my amendments. As I indicated, the amendments
to increase the limit from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 were
probing amendments to get the Government to put on record their basis
for choosing &#163;50,000 as a threshold. The Minister&#146;s
argument about cost is important, but compared to the cost of the
40 per cent. first-year allowance, which is the subject of
clause 24, it does not seem a huge amount. It would be beneficial to
get some cash help to businesses
now.</div><a name="09060283000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful for the Minister&#146;s confirmation that the measure
will apply for the next two years. It is important to give the taxpayer
some certainty about its availability, particularly as businesses start
to look at their forecasts and projections not only for this financial
year but for the next one, and as they seek to understand the impact of
potential losses and how they may be able to reduce their historical
tax bills by taking advantage of losses that arise in the following
financial
year.</div><a name="09060283000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also grateful that, in his response to amendment 30, the
Minister made it clear that the measure did not affect the existing tax
treatment of losses set off against the preceding year&#146;s
profits. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09060283000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<a name="09060283000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000407"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I was not sure whether the Minister was going to
speak to the clause&#151;he has a text in his hand&#151;but I will
kick off the debate. Clause 24 amends the provisions of part 2 of the
Capital Allowances Act 2001, which relates to plant and machinery
allowances, to provide a one-off, first-year allowance of 40 per cent.
on expenditure incurred on plant and machinery. The allowance is
available for unincorporated businesses, such as that in which my hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness is a partner, during the
12 months from 6 April 2009, and is available for businesses
that pay corporation tax, which again applies to a business in which my
hon. Friend has an interest, during the 12 months from 1
April 2009. He will be noting the measures very carefully when looking
at his capital expenditure plans for the year
ahead.</div><a name="09060283000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only
a year ago, the rate of allowances was reduced from 25 to 20 per cent.,
but now we are doubling it in the context of the economic crisis. The
timing of relief is central to capital allowances, and when the
first-year 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column196" />Column number: 196</div>allowance is increased, relief for the expenditure is accelerated when
it would otherwise be spread across later accounting periods.</div>
<a name="09060283000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of our
concerns about the issue takes us back to the debate about cost and the
question of what benefit we can expect from the introduction of the
first-year allowance. When the Chancellor announced the allowance in
his Budget statement, he was very bullish about what it meant in
practice. He
said:</div><a name="09060283000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
want other industries to invest, too. Businesses already benefit
significantly from the annual &#163;50,000 investment allowance,
which was announced two years ago. I want to go further to promote
investment now. So for this year, I will double the main capital
allowance rate to 40 per cent. That will encourage firms to bring
forward investment, in particular those companies in the growth sectors
that will deliver the rewarding jobs of the future. It will mean
enhanced tax relief to support investment of up to
&#163;50 billion this year. That includes &#163;10
billion of investment in the vital communications
sector.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 22 April 2009; Vol.
491, c. 247.]</div>
<a name="09060283000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Minister
elaborate on where that additional investment is coming from? The
Chancellor explicitly expects to bring in an extra &#163;60 billion
in total, &#163;10 billion of which will be from the
communications sector. How can the Government be so certain that that
will be the
case?</div><a name="09060283000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Page
206 of the Red Book, for example, notes a contraction from 11.5 to 11
per cent. in gross fixed capital formation for business in 2009, and a
smaller contraction from 4.75 to 4.25 per cent. in 2010. The Minister
has been probed this afternoon and his colleague, the Exchequer
Secretary, was probed this morning on what models were used to estimate
those figures. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us
what the figures for gross capital formation would have been if the
temporary increase in the first year allowance from 20 to 40 per cent.
had not
happened.</div><a name="09060283000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is some scepticism among outside bodies about this measure.
PricewaterhouseCoopers
said:</div><a name="09060283000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
problems with this measure are first that it is ad hoc and temporary.
This will only help a business that is able to react quickly as there
is very little time to plan and incur the expenditure. A business needs
to have sufficient one off, immediate expenditure requirement to make
the allowance useful, and of course, sufficient profits available
against which to set it off. How effective it will be must be
problematic.&#148;</div><a name="09060283000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
made similar comments in their representations. If we are going to
bring forward investment of that magnitude, in excess of the amount
that will benefit from the annual investment allowance, we need to use
what several Government Ministers have termed shovel-ready
projects&#151;things that are ready to go. Suddenly telling
businesses in April this year, &#147;You have a 40 per cent. capital
allowance for the first year; use it now&#148; actually makes it very
hard for businesses to respond promptly. In reality, what I suspect
will happen is that they will get enhanced relief for expenditure that
has already been planned, but further allowances will not necessarily
be brought forward in the future.</div>
<a name="09060283000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses
will have already sat down and worked out their plans. Businesses will
have done cash flow budgets for this year some time ago. They will have
already put those plans in place, and so will not be in a position to
respond quickly to the Government&#146;s pledge. Of course,
businesses know that there is no point in trying to accelerate things
too much, because we know that by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column197" />Column number: 197</div>the end of March 2010, the first-year allowance will go back to 20 per
cent. for incorporated business. So they know that it is a transitory
allowance, and their willingness to respond quickly will be limited by
that.</div><a name="09060283000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
have been some suggestions about how the Government could have
responded and dealt with this better. They could have looked at the
scope of excluded expenditure to identify investments that would not
have otherwise qualified for capital expenditure, but which might have
been brought forward this year. They could have looked at lengthening
the period beyond one year to two years to give businesses time to
bring forward that investment so that they could take advantage of the
relief. Alternatively, given the expense of the measures&#151;it
costs &#163;1.6 billion and in the previous debate the Financial
Secretary was concerned about doubling the relief for losses carried
back from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 on grounds of
cost&#151;the Government could have found some way of capping the
benefits arising from the introduction of the 40 per cent. rate for
capital allowances and to use the money saved elsewhere in a more
targeted way to help businesses.</div>
<a name="09060283000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">So there is
some concern about the effectiveness of the measure and what the
Government are seeking to achieve. The point that the Chancellor made
in the Budget statement was that the relief would stimulate additional
investment. There was scepticism among accountants and business
advisers as to whether that was actually going to happen. I would be
grateful if the Minister could further explain the Government&#146;s
thinking on this and whether he is confident that it will bring forward
additional investment, as outlined by the Chancellor in the Budget
statement. Was it wishful thinking on his part, like so much of the
economic forecasts that were announced in the Budget in
April?</div><a name="09060283000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000408"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The clause is part of our package of targeted
support for business&#151;temporary tax relief providing real support
for businesses investing for the future. The cost is substantial, as
the hon. Gentleman said, and its scale reflects our recognition that
business investment is key to recovery. The measure will stimulate and
bring forward business investment. It is time-limited because we
recognise the exceptional nature of the current downturn and want to
support and encourage businesses to invest now. My right hon. Friend
the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his Budget speech that we must
grow rather than cut our way out of recession, and this measure is one
building block we have in place to do that.</div>
<a name="09060283000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Fareham queried the balance between the cost of the
carry-back measure that we debated a few minutes ago and this
first-year capital allowances measure. The balance reflects the
importance of encouraging investment at this point in the downturn to
move us into recovery as quickly as possible. At this critical time, it
is absolutely right to support businesses and their cash flow,
including through the loss carry-back measure, but it is perhaps more
important to provide an incentive to invest, which this measure will
do.</div>
<a name="09060283000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000409"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> All the outside experts tell us that it takes
time, as my hon. Friend said, to plan capital investment. There seems
to be no rationale for doubling the relief in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column198" />Column number: 198</div>this financial year rather than the one following, when it would have a
far more positive effect. Cynics outside view it as having more to do
with the electoral cycle than the business
cycle.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000410"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Opposition Members may have slightly misunderstood
what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said about the scale. The figure
he used was &#163;50 billion, not &#163;60 billion: that is the
amount of investment that will qualify for support from the allowances.
I certainly do not wish to give the Committee the impression that there
will be an additional &#163;50 billion or &#163;60 billion of
investment. That will not be the case. However, I expect some increase
because many businesses are likely to have some flexibility regarding
the timing of their investment and will be able to bring it forward,
compared with what they otherwise would have
done.</div>
<a name="09060283000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000411"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> If the Financial Secretary looks back at the Budget
speech, he will see a clear implicit message that the provisions would
lead to additional investment of &#163;50 billion. The right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to say that I misquoted the number; it is
&#163;50 billion, which includes &#163;10 billion of
communications expenditure. The expenditure would have taken place and
was already planned. There might be a slight increase at the margin,
but it is simply already planned benefiting expenditure. The measure
will not generate additional investment to bring us out of the downturn
quicker.</div>
<a name="09060283000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000412"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> It will bring forward more investment than would
otherwise have been the case, but only a modest share of the total
investment, which is the &#163;50 billion figure to which the
hon. Gentleman and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
referred.</div>
<a name="09060283000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000413"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> How much additional investment does the right hon.
Gentleman think it will bring
forward?</div><a name="09060283000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000414"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> My estimate is that it will be in the order of an
additional couple of billion.</div>
<a name="09060283000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000415"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> So a couple of billion in additional investment for
a cost of &#163;1.6 billion in additional tax relief&#151;is that
good value for money?</div>
<a name="09060283000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000416"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> Yes, it is, because the cost will be recovered in
future years due to the way that first-year allowances work. We are
bringing forward investment and the cost will be defrayed in future
years. Winning that additional investment at this time, given what is
happening in the economy, is a very worth while prize, which is why we
are taking it forward.</div>
<a name="09060283000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060283000417"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): My
hon. Friend the Member for Fareham has very transparently expressed
Opposition Members&#146; concerns. Can the Minister give us any other
example in which a multiplier effect, which he thinks will emerge in
the years to come, can be bought only by an up-front cost of as much as
80 per cent. of the first year&#146;s expense? It seems almost
incredible, from our perspective, that to invest, as he puts it,
&#163;1.6 billion now for the hope of getting &#163;2 billion in
year one is a satisfactory use of
allowances.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column199" />Column number: 199</div><a name="09060283000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000418"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> I think it certainly is. As I said, much or perhaps
all of the cost in the first year will be recovered in future years.
The device enables us to achieve significant additional investment at
this critical time, thereby speeding the recovery and the point at
which the economy returns to growth. That is a valuable prize. That is
the reason why clause 24 introduces the temporary 40 per cent.
first-year capital allowances for most business investment between
April 2009 and March 2010, in effect doubling the main rate of capital
allowance for new business investment over that period. That is in
addition to the significant benefit that the vast majority of
businesses already receive from the &#163;50,000 annual investment
allowance introduced last year. The AIA provides about 95 per cent. of
UK businesses with 100 per cent. tax relief against investment in
qualifying plant and
machinery.</div><a name="09060283000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
temporary first-year allowance will provide additional support to those
businesses that invest the most and will encourage firms to bring
forward investment. I have certainly spoken to businesses that think
they can bring forward investment as a result. It will both improve
cash flow in the short term, supporting businesses that invest, and
encourage investment now by reducing the cost of investment in the
current year relative to later
years.</div><a name="09060283000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000419"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> The Minister is probably about to come on to this,
but may I press him on the &#163;10 billion from investment in the
communications industry? Where did that number come from, and will he
explain whether he expects any of the additional brought-forward
expenditure to be in that particular
area?</div><a name="09060283000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000420"></a>Mr.
Timms:</b> The figure comes from an assessment of what is
going on in the communications sector. Much is happening in that
sector, and one development that we are keen to see is the development
of next-generation broadband services&#151;a roll-out of broadband
into those parts of the UK where services are not provided. If those
investments take place in the current year, there will certainly be
benefits, but communications is quite a wide sector and one in which, I
am pleased to say, an encouraging level of investment is going on now.
If one looks at the historical pattern, one sees that about
20 per cent. of investment has been coming from the
communications sector. That is the view that is reflected in the figure
to which the hon. Gentleman
refers.</div><a name="09060283000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
measure provides real help to businesses investing for the future at a
time when they are most in need of support. I put it to the Committee
that supporting business investment now is a very important step in
ensuring economic recovery and I commend the clause to the
Committee.</div><a name="09060283000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000421"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am disappointed by the Financial
Secretary&#146;s justification for the measure. The whole thrust of
the Chancellor&#146;s Budget statement when making the case for the
measure was the increase in investment. We can look at the Red Book.
The Minister said that he thought that the measure would bring forward
additional investment of about &#163;2 billion this year. That is
about 1 per cent. of the total fixed investment projected in
the Red Book for 2009 and it accounts for an increase in GDP of about
0.1 per cent., so we are seeing a relatively small benefit for quite a
significant hit to the taxpayer. Given that the Government forecast
borrowing to be &#163;175 billion this year and &#163;173 billion
next year, they need to be careful about their rationale for a making
big increase in the relief available to companies. If the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column200" />Column number: 200</div>Chancellor had said at the time of the Budget that the measure was not
about bringing additional investment but more about supporting
businesses, it would have been a much more straightforward explanation
of the increase than suggesting that it would bring forward a huge wave
of additional investment.</div>
<a name="09060283000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe was right when he said
during the Budget debate
that</div><a name="09060283000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Doubling
capital allowances for a year, however, is not likely to shift a lot,
as it normally takes people more than 12 months to plan investments
that they were not previously planning to make. Furthermore, at a time
of falling consumer demand people will not be falling over themselves
to go in for capital investment, regardless of
allowances.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 27 April 2009;
Vol. 491, c. 612.]</div>
<a name="09060283000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">That encapsulates the
situation. When making the case for a significant increase in tax
reliefs, we need to be much clearer about the benefits rather than
suggesting that it would bring forward huge additional
investment.</div><a name="09060283000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000422"></a>Mr.
Stuart:</b> Through my hon. Friend, I thank the Minister for
being straightforward and honest, as he always is, in sharing the
Government&#146;s view. It is a shame that the Chancellor was not as
straightforward in his Budget speech. Given the news of recent days,
there may be a vacancy, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will be
promoted to fill it.</div>
<a name="09060283000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000423"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The Financial Secretary is always transparent on
these occasions, and gives a good account of why the changes are
necessary.</div>
<a name="09060283000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060283000424"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Browne</b> (Taunton) (LD): I wish to bring the
conversation back to the matter in hand. I take the point about what
the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe said, but to be fair
to the Government, one could envisage a company that intends to invest
at some point in future&#151;such investment already being programmed
into its thinking&#151;choosing to bring it forward slightly because
of the extra inducements. It may not necessarily choose to make an
investment that it had no plans to make, but if it had chosen to
invest, it could decide to do so a little
sooner.</div>
<a name="09060283000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000425"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed; the Financial Secretary made that point.
However, the &#147;little bit&#148; sooner is not the &#163;50
billion that the Chancellor implied; it is &#163;2 billion. That is 1
per cent. of the gross capital formation expected for this year. The
amount being brought forward at the margin is very marginal, but it is
being done at a cost of &#163;1.6 billion. It seems quite a large
amount of tax relief to give for the relatively small return of
bringing forward that additional investment.</div>
<a name="09060283000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intention
may have been to give further support to business to invest during a
downturn in the knowledge that it would not trigger additional
investment but was there simply to cushion the cost. That would be a
different explanation. That is the one that the Financial Secretary has
given this afternoon. I understand it, and I am content with it. It is
a much clearer and more robust rationale than the one given by the
Chancellor at the time of the Budget, when the measure was
announced.</div><a name="09060283000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

scheme that the Government guarantee? Is it on the &#163;42 billion?
Is it on the 10 per cent.? What happens if RBS writes off debts outside
the APS pool? Will those losses be available for offset against future
profits? Are they covered by the agreement? The situation is not clear.
An agreement has been reached between the Government and RBS on the
losses, but there is no transparency for the House or other taxpayers
regarding which losses have been forgone by
RBS.</div><a name="09060283000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is equally unclear whether it is just RBS that is subject to the

because I know it will pay more corporation tax in the future, but
Lloyds appears still able to take advantage of the losses on assets
guaranteed by the asset protection scheme without having given up those
losses.&#148; Will the Minister provide some clarity on the losses
that are covered by the scheme, and on whether Lloyds bank is in or out

which would have to be established in advance in terms of regulation.
Is there not a very real danger that that information could be highly
market-sensitive, if unrelieved tax assets were abused or there was

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000430"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point; it is
one that we wrestled with during consideration of the Banking Bill.
Where do we draw the line between, on the one hand, transparency and
accountability to this House on tax matters, especially when Government
support is being used to bail out business and, on the other hand, what
we allow to be shielded from that accountability by virtue of market
confidentiality? The Chancellor&#146;s statement on 25 February,
which might be all that we have to go on, was too much in favour of
market confidentiality and paid insufficient regard to
taxpayers&#146; interests. We could have a little more information 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column203" />Column number: 203</div>without breaching market confidentiality. We could be much clearer about
whether the provision applies only to the asset protection scheme or to
other losses as well. The taxpayer is giving significant support to
RBS. That is in the public domain, so why is the other side of the
bargain not also in the public
domain?</div><a name="09060283000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000431"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> I can see the point that the hon. Gentleman is
trying to make about transparency, but let us return to the initial
discussions with RBS on the APS. I suspect that the use of unrelieved
tax assets versus cash, bonds or preference shares was the most
market-sensitive piece of information available in the entire banking
sector at that time. Had that entered the public domain, would there
not have been a very real risk of a further collapse in banks&#146;
share
prices?</div><a name="09060283000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000432"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am not sure that I agree; this takes us back to
what is covered by the deal. The losses that RBS will forgo might
simply relate to assets covered by the asset protection scheme, but
that information is in the public domain. One can see where the
contract would be between RBS receiving public support from the
taxpayer and the losses that it forgoes as a consequence. If the deal
is otherwise, and if the losses forgone go beyond those in the asset
protection scheme, there might be an argument about market
confidentiality.</div>
<a name="09060283000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would have
thought, however, that any deferred losses no longer available because
RBS has given them up&#151;if that is material&#151;would be
disclosed in the company accounts anyway. I am therefore sceptical
about the market confidentiality argument. It is a very easy argument
for the Government to hide behind. That is why we need a bit more
transparency now about the nature of the losses covered. If the
Minister says that only losses arising in relation to assets within the
asset protection scheme are covered, that will be fine and I can leave
the matter there. However, a proper debate is required, and my
amendments 38 and 39 give us the opportunity to have that debate on
future agreements. I tabled the amendments to enable proper
parliamentary scrutiny of future agreements.</div>
<a name="09060283000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
think very carefully about the sorts of arrangement covered by clause
25. In subsection (2), the Government have set out a series of
arrangements that could give rise to an agreement between the
Government and P to forgo tax losses. Those arrangements include where
the Government</div>
<a name="09060283000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;guarantees or
assumes a loss or other liability of P or another person...insures
or indemnifies P or another person against a loss or other
liability...agrees to make a payment to P or another person in
respect of a loss or other liability...whether or not the person
to whom the payment is to be made...or...gives other
financial support of assistance to P or another
person&#148;.</div><a name="09060283000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a wide range of circumstances.</div>
<a name="09060283000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the economic crisis, the Government have introduced a number of
schemes to help businesses by giving some form of support. For example,
under the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, there is a Government
guarantee in place for loans made to small and medium-sized
enterprises, so that the Government guarantee a proportion of the
losses. I do not believe that there is any indication from the
Government that  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column204" />Column number: 204</div>the banks taking part in the enterprise finance guarantee scheme have to
forgo any losses as a consequence of taking part in the scheme.
However, it is another scheme whereby a guarantee has been issued and
it could fall within the scope of clause 25.</div>
<a name="09060283000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have issued guarantees for money borrowed via the European
Investment Bank. Again, that type of transaction would fall within the
scope of the clause. The Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform has said that there may be some financial support
available to the purchaser of General Motors in Europe. That financial
support could fall within subsection (4). Would that be part of the
deal?</div>
<a name="09060283000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
needs some clarity about the use of the clause and about how the use of
the powers outlined in the clause will be scrutinised. The Minister
might argue that we should be very grateful if a business decides to
give up some of its losses in return for one of these deals and that
that arrangement reduces the cost to the taxpayer of those deals.
However, it would be helpful if we knew that the losses that are to be
forgone bear a reasonable relationship to the amount of support that we
give and that a proper deal is being done.</div>
<a name="09060283000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25 is
wide ranging. Most of my remarks have been made in the context of the
agreement reached between the Government and RBS, but the clause has
wider application. There is not sufficient parliamentary scrutiny built
in to the arrangements as set out in the clause, so we should be very
careful about how we enact this measure.</div>
<a name="09060283000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
one of the drives behind the clause is that a company automatically
qualifies for loss relief; it does not elect to qualify for it. The
Government therefore need to have the measure in place to tidy up the
arrangements; I understand that part of it. However, the Government
could go a little further than they have in terms of ensuring that
there is parliamentary scrutiny of the
arrangements.</div>

that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman about the nature of the clause
and about the inappropriate effect that his amendment would have on
it.</div>
<a name="09060283000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 25
ensures that any agreement reached between a company and the Treasury
or other arm of Government under which the company gives up the right
to tax losses or reliefs in order to access Government financial
assistance will be effective for tax purposes. The clause will
initially apply to the asset protection scheme, but it could apply to
other circumstances where Government assistance is required to maintain
financial stability and restore confidence.</div>
<a name="09060283000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
therefore essential that the parties to the agreement, in particular
the Government, know that when an agreement is reached, it will have
the effect that is intended, so that the agreement will not need to be
revisited if it transpires that any agreement reached on relinquishing
tax losses is not actually effective in tax law. The hon. Member for
Hoban is
right&#151;</div><a name="09060283000148"></a>

Fareham.</div><a name="09060283000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000435"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Sorry, the hon. Member for Fareham.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> I knew what I meant. The two go
together.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column205" />Column number: 205</div><a name="09060283000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000436"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The right hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls) made
the same mistake in a Committee several years ago. I suggested that I
might refer to him by his surname rather than by his constituency. He
soon learned not to make that mistake
again.</div>
<a name="09060283000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000437"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I do not have quite that embarrassment with my
surname.</div>
<a name="09060283000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions will apply automatically to any agreement designated by the
Treasury. They simply enable companies to enter into tax undertakings
with the Treasury in order to access Government assistance in a way
that the existing legislation precludes. Accountability to Parliament
for such contractual undertakings will take effect in the normal
way.</div>
<a name="09060283000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
amendment seeks to make each operation of the clause subject to a
statutory instrument, with the result that the terms of such Government
assistance would remain uncertain until a statutory instrument was
enacted. That could have the perverse effect of reducing rather than
boosting market confidence. That was the point made by the hon. Member
for Dundee, East in his intervention on the hon. Member for
Fareham.</div><a name="09060283000342"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="09060283000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the agreement to give up losses were contingent on subsequent
parliamentary approval of a statutory instrument, there would need to
be provision in the agreement to revisit terms if such approval was not
given or amended. Such a term in the agreement would mean that it could
not achieve its aim of restoring confidence and stability in the
market. In summary, the clause will apply only when a company has
agreed to relinquish its losses and only when that agreement is
pursuant to the company accessing financial assistance from the
Government. We are not legislating to force tax undertakings on anyone,
so a further layer of scrutiny is unnecessary and potentially
destabilising, because such deals may need to be struck with absolute
certainty and in a very short time scale.</div>
<a name="09060283000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000438"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> But a host of deals have been subject to the
affirmative procedure that have flowed from the Banking (Special
Provisions) Act 2008 and the Banking Act 2009. The Exchequer
Secretary&#146;s argument about uncertainty does not really hold,
given that experience has shown that when an agreement has been
reached, it has passed on to the statute without causing
uncertainty.</div>
<a name="09060283000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000439"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> In the case of the asset protection scheme, the
agreement on losses will be part of a wider agreement covering
accession to, and the operation of, the scheme, the terms of which will
be set out before Parliament after the agreement has been made. A
similar process would apply for any other such designated
agreement.</div><a name="09060283000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman asked about Lloyds. Clearly, RBS has at least entered
into an agreement in principle to forgo the offsets in tax losses, but
Lloyds has not. Those are the only two banks that have accessed the
asset protection scheme as it is currently set out. As to whether
Lloyds is involved as well as RBS, the answer is that the former is
not; it decided that it wishes to pay for its access to the scheme in a
different way. RBS has made an agreement concerning its UK tax losses
at 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column206" />Column number: 206</div>2008 and for a certain number of years thereafter. The agreement will be
finalised in the ongoing negotiations with the bank. There has been
agreement in principle, but the detail and the due diligence is in the
middle of being done. Although the agreement in principle involves
surrendering the losses, the details have not yet been finalised and
the work is still
ongoing.</div><a name="09060283000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000440"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for that explanation, but will the
Exchequer Secretary say when the agreement will be
finalised?</div>
<a name="09060283000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000441"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> We hope that the two banks will have signed up to
the asset protection scheme in detail by the end of the summer. There
is a great deal of work going on, not least on due diligence on the
assets in the scheme and on getting state aid clearance. As I said,
Lloyds has not entered into an arrangement to forgo tax losses. It is
paying for access to the scheme by paying &#163;15.6 billion for
participation, which will be satisfied through the issuance of B
shares. That does not prejudice agreements with other banks, which
might prefer to settle their fees differently.</div>
<a name="09060283000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Any bank that
wishes to access the asset protection scheme, by definition I suspect,
will have a different agreement&#151;the agreement is not a template
for every bank. Every agreement for every bank that wishes to enter the
scheme will be bespoke and relevant to that bank&#146;s
circumstances. Of the two banks that are in the scheme at the moment,
one&#151;RBS&#151;has agreed to forgo tax losses and reliefs.
Lloyds has not; it is paying for access in a different way. Therefore,
I hope the hon. Gentleman will agree that his amendments would
destabilise the negotiations because of the uncertainty that they would
create. I hope he will not press them to a
vote.</div>
<a name="09060283000161"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000442"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Exchequer Secretary give
way?</div>
<a name="09060283000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000443"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> In a minute.</div>
<a name="09060283000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
spend some time talking about clause 25, because the debate has rolled
into that, but before I do so, I would be happy to give
way&#151;</div><a name="09060283000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000444"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> That is fine.</div>
<a name="09060283000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000445"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Clause 25 is part of a package of measures designed
to stabilise high street banks and boost the amount of money available
for lending. The asset protection scheme has been offered, and the aim
of that scheme was to restore confidence in the banks and get credit
flowing again by dealing with the losses associated with impaired
assets. Under the scheme, the details of which were published on 26
February, the Government will provide protection against future credit
losses on certain assets in exchange for a fee. Each bank that wishes
to receive support under the asset protection scheme will enter into a
contractual agreement with HM
Treasury.</div><a name="09060283000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the fee, banks may separately enter into several other
undertakings in return for Government protection, including, but not
limited to, undertakings to forgo tax reliefs for losses and
allowances, which is where clause 25 comes in. Those undertakings would
be under bilateral agreements between the two parties and would
therefore not override tax law. We are bringing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column207" />Column number: 207</div>forward clause 25, therefore, to ensure that any such agreements or
undertakings entered into by a company to forgo tax reliefs or losses
are actually effective in tax
law.</div><a name="09060283000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09060283000446"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): Would that agreement relate
only to UK tax losses and reliefs? The Royal Bank of Scotland, for
example, straddles several continents. Would the clause have a perverse
affect on the bank if it ever got back to profitability, as one hopes
it will, so that it will shelter those profits outside the UK simply
because part of the agreement is that it will have to pay tax at an
earlier stage under the arrangements the hon. Lady
described?</div><a name="09060283000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000447"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> No bank can avoid paying tax liabilities legally by
sheltering profits in a way that is against UK tax law. The agreement
is really a recognition that, in order to pay for access to the asset
protection scheme, a bank, such as RBS in this case, has agreed to
forgo any tax arrangements that might allow it to offset profits. It
will begin to pay tax much sooner in the process when it comes back
into profitability, which is a good deal for the taxpayer, a point to
which the hon. Member for Fareham was kind enough to refer in his
contribution.</div>
<a name="09060283000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the answer effectively is that the bank could do nothing that would be
illegal under normal tax law to avoid paying what was due, and nor
could it use some of its reliefs on losses, which it would normally
have access to, because it has agreed to forgo those reliefs as part of
payment for access to the protection available for some of its impaired
assets. Clause 25 merely ensures that that agreement, voluntarily
entered into bilaterally between the company and the Treasury, is
effective in tax law and that it cannot be overridden by more general
provisions in tax law. Although the immediate focus of the clause is to
deal with the tax consequences of the asset protection scheme, it is
prudent to ensure that those provisions could, if needed, be applied
more generally in future. The clause could therefore be applied to a
Treasury-designated arrangement whereby Government financial support is
granted to a
company.</div><a name="09060283000170"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000448"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the hon. Lady give
way?</div><a name="09060283000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000449"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Before the hon. Gentleman leaps to his feet, I will
deal with the point that he might wish to make. I can assure the
Committee that clause 25 will only have effect when the company has
given an undertaking to surrender its right to benefit from tax losses
and other reliefs under arrangements entered into with HM Treasury, or
any other public body, and when the Government are providing financial
support. The clause will only become relevant in those narrow and
particular
circumstances.</div><a name="09060283000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000450"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right that the clause
relates to those circumstances, but as I indicated in my remarks, the
Government have supported several schemes in which they give financial
support to see businesses through this time. We are talking about
European Investment Bank guarantees, and there are 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column208" />Column number: 208</div>other schemes. What criteria will be used by the Treasury to determine
whether the agreements it has reached or the support it has given to
businesses should lead to those companies forgoing their tax
losses?</div><a name="09060283000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000451"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> This is not a general approach that we are going to
apply across the piece. The hon. Gentleman knows that we have not
applied it to Lloyds in its access to the asset protection scheme, even
though we have agreed with RBS that it should forgo some of the tax
reliefs and losses.</div>
<a name="09060283000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000452"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will the Minister give
way?</div>
<a name="09060283000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000453"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I will in a minute when I have finished what I am
trying to say.</div>
<a name="09060283000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore,
the approach will apply only when it is explicitly part of an agreement
that is made between the particular company and HM Treasury. It will
not be applied retrospectively to a range of general agreements that
have already been reached. This is about having access to particular
assistance, in this case from the asset protection scheme, through an
arrangement made between HM Treasury and the company concerned. I hope
that will reassure the hon. Gentleman that this is not just a general
sweeping power that we intend to apply across the piece to help and
assistance that the Government may wish to give to industry in general.
It is much more specific and narrow than
that.</div><a name="09060283000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000454"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s point about it
being specific. She drew a distinction between the treatment of Lloyds
and RBS. But once this power is in the Bill, and given the breadth of
the power and the range of circumstances it could cover, businesses
will ask whether they want to accept this help from the Government in
return for forgoing tax losses and in what circumstances the Government
would ask them to forgo those tax losses. Although the Minister says
that it refers to a particular historical event, the breadth of the
clause makes it more widely applicable in future to agreements reached
between the Government and particular businesses. Those businesses
might want some clarity about when the Government might seek to take
advantage of this clause.</div>
<a name="09060283000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000455"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The asset protection scheme is not one of those
things that comes into existence every day of the week. We are not
likely, hopefully, to need schemes such as that regularly in future. It
is a response to a critical situation that has arisen in the global
financial markets and the credit crunch. I hope the hon. Gentleman will
accept
that.</div><a name="09060283000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000456"></a>Stewart
Hosie:</b> The Minister is right about the asset protection
scheme: there are one or two banks involved and there may be one or two
more. In terms of the potential scale, there is also the working
capital scheme, the enterprise finance guarantee scheme, the capital
for enterprise fund, the asset purchase scheme, the direct assistance
to the automotive industry and &#163;1.3 billion of EU additional
funding. That could cover a large number of companies receiving aid in
one form or another that might be invited to surrender tax reliefs as
well. Should we not have some concerns that the proposal might grow
arms and legs unnecessarily?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column209" />Column number: 209</div><a name="09060283000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000457"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Although Opposition Members have said that this is
a wide-ranging clause, they have also acknowledged that it would be
applied in a very narrow range of circumstances in which a bilateral
agreement has been reached between HMT and a particular company in
order to pay for access to Government support. Effectively, we are
talking about getting good value for taxpayers&#146; money, if we are
essentially acting as insurers of last resort to companies who have got
themselves into difficulties. That is one of the ways that access to
such support might be paid for in certain circumstances. In those
circumstances, there must be a bilateral arrangement as part of an
application to get Government
support.</div><a name="09060283000181"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: center;">[<span class="SmallCaps">Mr
Jim Hood</span> <i class="I">in the
Chair</i>]</div> <a name="09060283000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
we propose is not a general principle to be applied across the board. I
hope I have made that clear and I hope that offers some reassurance to
Opposition Members. In addition, subsection (3) ensures that giving up
tax reliefs in return for Government assistance under such designated
arrangements does not create any new tax relief either to a company
that has given up reliefs or to any other person. For example, no tax
relief will be due when one company in a group that has benefited
directly from the asset protection scheme compensates another company
for forgoing tax relief. In that circumstance, the clause denies any
relief for the compensation payment. I therefore move that it should
stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09060283000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000458"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> We are debating amendments, Mr. Hood,
although it has transformed into a wider debate about the clause. I
would not have spent so much time on this matter if it had been
restricted purely to the one transaction of RBS and the asset
protection scheme. I understand why the legislative underpinning needs
to be in place to enable RBS to surrender its losses. If there had been
a way of drafting the measure to restrict it, I think that it would
have gone through on the nod without much debate, other than my asking
when the APS might be signed off.</div>
<a name="09060283000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6
pm</div><a name="09060283000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that the clause is much more widely drafted. It relates to
particular companies and financial support, but it can also be used to
enable an agreement to be reached with a company to forgo its losses in
return for financial support. In the Minister&#146;s statement, there
is no clarity as to the future circumstances in which the measure will
be used. That is where I have a problem, as it is a wide-ranging clause
that could be used in the future.</div>
<a name="09060283000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us return
to the example of Vauxhall, or let us suppose, for example, that a rail
franchise collapsed. If the Department for Transport wanted to bail out
the company, the Government could say that in return for that support,
they wanted the company to surrender its tax losses. That might be
restricted to the losses made on that franchise, or could be related to
the wider business. I am not comfortable with the breadth of the
clause.</div>
<a name="09060283000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000459"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The hon. Gentleman should at least acknowledge that
for tax losses to be surrendered in that way, there would need to be a
bilateral agreement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div>between the company and the Treasury. That is true whatever company it
is&#151;I do not wish to speculate on which companies might be
involved in that. That is a part payment for the support given, which
obtains value for the taxpayer. Surrendering tax losses is merely one
option. The clause makes it certain that any such bilateral agreement
between a company and HM Treasury would be effective in tax law. To
that extent, it is a technicality.</div>
<a name="09060283000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
hon. Gentleman is reassured that for other support&#151;of which
there is a great deal at the moment, with a number of schemes that
support various parts of industry&#151;we have not insisted on tax
losses being relinquished as part of the structure or payment that we
expect for that support. This is a narrow provision and must be agreed
between the company that is asking for support and HMT. Although it is
potentially wide, paradoxically it is also narrow at the same
time.</div>
<a name="09060283000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000460"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I take that point and that is why in my remarks to
wind up the debate I said that if the provision had been entirely
related to the narrow example of RBS, it would have gone through on the
nod. The fact is that it could be used more widely in the
future.</div>
<a name="09060283000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
talks about the RBS scheme, which is potentially a huge financial cost
to the taxpayer and a big event. We have seen other examples in which
seemingly innocuous clauses in Bills have been used with a wider impact
at a later stage, in ways that had not been envisaged at the time. Yes,
a bilateral agreement must be reached with the company, but there is
sometimes an asymmetrical relationship between the Government and a
company in terms of the power that each has and how one might be
prepared to do the other&#146;s bidding because of the circumstances
at the time.</div>
<a name="09060283000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
that there are sufficient safeguards for the use of this power in the
future, and I would be happier if it had been restricted to
implementing what is seen as a one-off deal in the context of RBS and
the asset protection scheme. What has happened before provides some
comfort, but not total confidence, about how the power will be used in
future.</div>
<a name="09060283000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
Minister has made points about the uncertainty that might arise as a
consequence of waiting for parliamentary scrutiny, I am not minded to
press the amendment this evening, although I am not sure how robust her
argument is. I will reflect on a different approach to tackling clause
25 on Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000461"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I wish to explore some of the background to land
remediation relief in the Bill. The Government have tabled a number of
amendments to schedule 7. As I understand it, land remediation relief
is given at 150 per cent. of the actual cost of remediation.
Remediation costs include labour and materials incurred directly or
through a contractor. When a business is profitable, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>relief can be used to reduce the corporation tax payable. When a
business is not profitable, it can claim a repayment capped at 16 per
cent. of the lower cost of the qualifying expenditure or unrelieved
losses.</div><a name="09060283000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the objective of the relief is to bring forward
brownfield sites for development, particularly ones that have been
contaminated. The draft statutory instruments that have been published
alongside the clause discuss three aspects of contamination: radon,
arsenic and Japanese knotweed. I will return to Japanese knotweed in a
moment.</div><a name="09060283000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have put great pressure on brownfield developments. A long
time ago, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister set a target that 60
per cent. of new developments should be built on brownfield sites.
However, the definition of a brownfield site is quite elastic. Many
houses have been built in my constituency on brownfield sites that
other people might know as back gardens and former nursing homes. On
brownfield sites previously used as industrial sites, chemicals may be
left behind that have to be eradicated before the site is
developed.</div><a name="09060283000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
pressure to build on brownfield sites meant that their value was pushed
up until the recent property crash, particularly when there was a
relatively low cost of remediation. The cost of remediation is a
barrier to sites being used for development. It is therefore
understandable that relief is made available to help mitigate the cost
of remediation of the land. That is such an obvious point that it is
difficult to understand why it has taken so long to get to the point in
legislation where we try to improve the availability of the
relief.</div><a name="09060283000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Rogers&#146;s urban task force, which reported in 1999, suggested
that additional relief should be given to developers to decontaminate
land. That did not include long-term derelict land. The Barker review
of 2004 cited decontamination of brownfield sites as one of the
principal barriers to redevelopment of such areas. Two years later,
Professor Barker carried out another review. The Chancellor in those
days was keen to commission a review in every Budget on all sorts of
subjects. Professor Barker got good work out of that. Her review of
land use and planning in 2006 said that the Government should consult
on the reform of remediation relief to encourage new
developments.</div><a name="09060283000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2007, there was a consultation on tax incentives for the development of
brownfield land that looked at better targeting of land remediation
relief and increasing certainty and publicity for the relief. The
Government concluded:</div>
<a name="09060283000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
light of the responses to the consultation the Government is minded to
take a number of steps to improve the certainty of this relief. In
particular, HMRC will be considering how to improve guidance and what
mechanisms could be used to ensure that the relief is better
publicised. This should help to ensure that financial planning takes
full account of the relief from the
start.&#148;</div><a name="09060283000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
seem to have spent an awfully long time talking about and consulting on
this, to get to the process before us today. Even after that long
gestation period, the Government are still minded to table two
amendments. I should have thought this would be a textbook bit of
legislation after so much consultation, and that it would pop, fully
formed, into the Bill, without needing to be amended at this
stage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div><a name="09060283000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">An important
issue that I have noted from my constituency is that the relief should
be extended to Japanese knotweed. The draft statutory instrument refers
specifically to the three botanical types of Japanese knotweed, which
apparently holds the title as Britain&#146;s most invasive plant.
According to the BBC, its removal from the Olympic site in east London
could cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Apparently, it has
bamboo-like stems and clusters of creamy flowers. It sounds exotic, but
it is very expensive to remove. It can flourish in any soil, so hon.
Members with poor soil in their garden might consider that it would
provide an attractive plant, but it overwhelms other plants and damages
ecosystems. It has the ability to grow through walls, tarmac and
concrete.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000463"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Indeed. Experts say that a new plant can grow from
a piece of root the size of a garden pea. It is clearly a problem, and
I know that from my experience, because there was a development plan
for my constituency to build the final stage of a road through a site
that is known locally as Warsash motors.</div>
<a name="09060283000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000464"></a>Mr.
Todd:</b> I used to live down

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000465"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I know. The road was planned when I was elected in
2001, and has been completed only recently. The reason why it has taken
so long to complete is that the county council looked at the cost of
removing the knotweed, and thought it easier to poison it and allow it
to die naturally rather than try to dig it out. So, I think that people
will welcome the fact that Japanese knotweed is covered by the measure,
although they might regret the fact that it has taken rather longer
than expected to get to this point.</div>
<a name="09060283000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
raise with the Minister a few points that emerged from the regulatory
impact assessment. The cost of the measure is about &#163;30 million
to &#163;40 million a year over a five-to-10 year period, so there is
an aggregate cost of somewhere between &#163;150 million and
&#163;400 million, but in the RIA, there is no monetised
amount for the benefit of that cost. Will the Minister indicate how
much land she thinks will be brought forward for development as a
consequence of the measure? Alternatively, have the Government been
waiting so long that the measure will not bring forward any land at
all? I am interested to know what work they have done to understand the
benefits and the sort of sites that would come forward for development
that have not been coming forward, so we can protect some of our
greenfield sites and allow these contaminated brownfield sites to be
developed.</div><a name="09060283000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">According
to the RIA, very few people would be disadvantaged by the measure, but
one group that will be disadvantaged are those who deal with knotweed
currently and send it to landfill sites. Are there many contractors who
just take it to landfill sites? What will be the impact on the landfill
levy of the introduction of this remediation relief, which will reduce
the number of people taking knotweed to landfill sites? I presume that
the cost has been netted off, or factored in, to the
RIA.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000466"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Hood. I note
that the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham has fled at the thought
of Japanese knotweed, probably to check that there is none in his
garden. It is not a plant that one would want to find flourishing
anywhere near anything that the members of this Committee
value.</div>
<a name="09060283000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Land
remediation relief was introduced in 2001 to encourage owners and
investors to bring contaminated land back into use by providing
enhanced tax relief. The Government are committed to increasing housing
supply and to maintaining a high proportion of development on
brownfield sites. The 2004 Barker review of housing supply and the 2006
review of land use and planning recommended that land remediation
relief be extended to derelict land. In the light of those
recommendations, the clause and schedule will extend land remediation
relief to provide enhanced tax relief for the costs of dealing with
specific forms of dereliction, which, up until now, have prevented
sites from being brought back into
use.</div><a name="09060283000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
scope of the legislation is based on a consultation carried out by the
Treasury in 2007 and subsequent discussions with a broad range of
stakeholders, including representatives from the Government, local
government, industry, development agencies and the charitable sector.
We recognise that the responses to the consultation show that a lack of
certainty about what qualifies under the existing relief may have
reduced the effectiveness of land remediation relief. That lack of
certainty has meant that industry has not factored the relief into
costings, with the result that the existing relief did not exert as
much influence on investment decisions as we would have liked. The
changes in the Bill are intended to give companies greater certainty,
enabling the industry to include the relief fully in their projected
costings.</div><a name="09060283000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
recent years, companies have exploited the relief by claiming for work
on greenfield sites or brownfield sites not contaminated by previous
industrial use, which is contrary to the policy intention. Schedule 7
will therefore refocus the existing relief on contaminated brownfield
sites and exclude expenditure on greenfield sites. The hon. Gentleman
was uncharacteristically uncharitable about Government amendments 8 and
9 to schedule 7. They will make minor drafting improvements for the
provisions in the
schedule&#151;</div><a name="09060283000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000471"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I was commenting that the hon. Member for Fareham
was rather less than charitable about the fact that, after consultation
in the sensitive area, two Government amendments have been tabled. They
are very minor in nature, and they have been tabled because the
parliamentary counsel decided that his earlier draft was unsatisfactory
and had to be amended to provide clarity. I suspect that the amendment
is about translating policy intention into legalese, rather than any
major change in policy intention that happened between the printing of
the Bill and amendments being
tabled.</div><a name="09060283000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
8 will make it clear that the land has to have been contaminated when
the major interest in it was acquired, and not when the life assurance
business acquired any other interest in the land, such as a short
lease. It will put the certainty of the meaning beyond doubt and will
clear up points that were not as clear as the parliamentary counsel
would have
wished.</div><a name="09060283000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment 9, a company will be able claim land remediation relief under
cost of qualifying works subcontracted to a connected party. As
drafted, there are differences in the wording of the section that gives
the relief and the section that quantifies the qualifying expenditure,
which could create uncertainty. Amendment 9 removes that uncertainty by
amending the legislation so that the same wording is used in all
sections, which is a good principle to adopt when drafting Finance
Bills, however thick they are and however many clauses they
contain.</div><a name="09060283000222"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000472"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have a quick question. The explanatory notes
state that one of the reasons that the amendments are being made is to
show that land has to be contaminated at the time that a major interest
in the land is acquired for the expenditure to qualify for relief. If
someone has a site that has been invaded by Japanese knotweed, what
relief is available if they want to remove it from the
land?</div><a name="09060283000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000473"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I think the best way to deal with such a specific
question about Japanese knotweed would be for me to write to the hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000476"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The tax-based venture capital schemes&#151;the
enterprise investment scheme, venture capital trusts and the corporate
venturing scheme&#151;all contribute to the Government&#146;s
policy of improving the ability of small companies to secure
longer-term support through equity investments. Such investments help
small companies to grow and invest in their business, so that they are
well placed to take advantage of business opportunities. Encouraging
investment is even more important in the light of the economic
challenges that we now face. Investment in the future is crucial if the
UK is to emerge from the recession with a stronger, more prosperous
economy.</div><a name="09060283000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
Budget 2008, the Chancellor lunched a public consultation on the
enterprise investment scheme to investigate how the rules and processes
that govern the scheme could be improved or simplified. As a result of
representations made during that consultation, schedule 8
introduces four changes.</div>
<a name="09060283000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
enterprise investment scheme, the schedule relaxes the time limits in
relation to the employment of money invested; removes the link to other
shares of the same class issued at the same time as qualifying shares;
extends the period for carry-back of relief and allows the full amount
subscribed for to be carried back, subject to the annual investment
limit; and corrects an anomaly regarding the capital gains position of
investors in the event of a share-for-share exchange. On the corporate
venturing and venture capital trusts schemes, the schedule relaxes the
time limits in relation to the employment of money by companies
receiving investment. All four changes simplify the rules of the
schemes and remove current restrictions. The Government amendments
merely make minor
changes.</div><a name="09060283000233"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment
13 agreed to.</i></div>
<a name="09060283000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000477"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 27, in
schedule 8, page 101, line 12, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1B) The
individual may elect for section 135 or section 136 not to apply in
respect of the shares.&#146;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="09060283000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
is straightforward. It would reinstate reliefs that were there in the
first place. It also seeks to address an iniquity in paragraph 9 of
schedule 5B to the Tax and Capital Gains Act 1992. The Government
propose to apply sections 135 and 136 of the 1992 Act to shares to
which deferral relief is attributable. Thus, when an EIS company is
acquired in a share-for-share exchange, the gain that arises on the EIS
deferral relief shares is not taxed, but held over against the shares
received in the exchange. The deferred gain falls back into charge to
tax, as would be expected. Previously, sections 135 and 136 of the 1992
Act were excluded from applying, such that an investor would have to
pay tax on the deferred gain and the deferral relief shares at a time
when they would have received no cash out of which to pay the tax,
because they had received shares and not cash on disposal.</div>
<a name="09060283000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, the
changes that the Government propose have the effect of preventing a
claim for loss relief, which was previously available, if the deferral
relief shares stood at a loss against the subscription price at the
time of the share-for-share exchange. That loss could be relieved
against the deferral gain, which falls into charge to capital gains tax
or against income by making a claim under section 131 of the Income
Taxes Act 2007. In general in tax law, it is a principle that the
taxpayer should not have to pay tax on a gain at a time when they have
no cash to pay the tax. Under the Bill, if amendment 27 is not made,
the investor will have a deferred gain falling into charge to tax when
they have no cash at their disposal out of which to pay the tax and
they will not be able to reduce that liability by any loss on the
shares.</div>
<a name="09060283000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
I have proposed a fairly straightforward change, to reinstate a relief
that existed before the Government proposed their
amendments.</div>
<a name="09060283000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000478"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> It may be helpful if I explain briefly the problem
that we were trying to address in paragraph 1 of schedule 8, before
setting out why amendment 27 is unnecessary and undesirable.</div>
<a name="09060283000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the
enterprise investment scheme, an investor may take the proceeds from
the sale of an asset and invest them in shares. Any capital gains tax
payable on gains from those proceeds is then deferred, but not
cancelled. If the shares are exchanged for new shares, the deferred
gain is brought back into charge. That was always intended. However,
capital gains tax can also arise on the exchanged shares at the same
time as the deferred gain comes into charge, which was not intended.
That would happen for an EIS shareholder but not for a non-EIS
shareholder exchanging their shares. The result could be a gain with
tax to pay or a loss that could be set against other gains or against
income. Therefore, EIS shareholders could be placed at either an
advantage or a disadvantage compared with other shareholders.</div>
<a name="09060283000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman seems to be concerned that if a loss cannot be crystallised
immediately, it is gone forever, but that is not the case. I hope that
I can reassure him by saying that any loss arising from subsequent
disposal of the new shares received in the exchange will be able to be
set against other gains. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that
what I suspect was the reason for the amendment in the first place is
actually mitigated by the current arrangements.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="09060283000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Allowing
enterprise investment scheme investors to choose to disapply a part of
the tax rules, which amendment 27 would do, would be unfair
to other investors, to whom the relevant sections of the 1992
Act&#151;sections 135 and 136&#151;would apply. However, it would
create a fundamentally wrong tax position, with the investor able to
opt out of paying tax on a gain, but able to opt in to obtaining relief
on a loss.</div>
<a name="09060283000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I ask the

<a name="09060283000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the clause has been triggered by the financial crisis
seen in the banking sector in the past 18 months. A ministerial
statement in December last year flagged up the change to group relief
and preference shares, saying
that</div><a name="09060283000331"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
first proposed legislative change will better identify who are the real
equity holders in a business, for group tax purposes. This change to
the group tax rules will apply to all companies. In particular, when
banks and other financial institutions issue certain preference shares
in order to boost their Tier 1 capital base in the form approved by
financial regulators this change will ensure that their existing group
structure, for tax purposes, is not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>broken. These preference shares are shares that carry a right to a fixed
dividend or a dividend at a fixed rate, but in order to satisfy the
regulatory requirements the issuer may have the right to pay a lower
dividend in certain
circumstances.&#148;</div><a name="09060283000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
9 deals with those
circumstances.</div><a name="09060283000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
change will mean that such preference shareholders will no longer be
treated as equity holders for group tax purposes solely because that
regulatory requirement is met. My understanding is that the Government
want to enable groups to claim group relief when banks issue preference
shares to shore up their tier 1 capital, even if those preference
shares do not meet the classic fixed-rate definition. The written
ministerial statement said that the
changes</div><a name="09060283000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will
apply retrospectively for accounting periods beginning on or after 1
January 2008&#148;.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 18

would like to make some more detailed comments on the schedule, but I
would be grateful if the Minister could confirm that that statement is
the genesis of schedule 9 and that the change relates not only to the
financial crisis, but to broader issues around the definition of shared

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000485"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> My amendments are dry and technical. They define
&#147;ordinary share capital&#148; more closely by reference to
another term in the Bill, &#147;relevant preference shares&#148;.
The objective is to ensure that group relief is available when certain
preference shares are issued. The holders of fixed rate preference
shares are not usually treated as equity holders. Schedule 9 changes
that, so holders of relevant preference shares will not be treated as
equity holders. It is important because those determinations affect the
entitlement to group relief from related companies for trading
losses.</div><a name="09060283000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
23 to 26 tidy up the definition of &#147;ordinary share
capital&#148;. The test of a grouping for many tax purposes involves
two parts: an ordinary share capital test and an economic ownership
test based on the provisions of schedule 18 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Ordinary share capital is defined in
section 832(1) of the 1988 Act
as</div><a name="09060283000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;all
the issued share capital (by whatever name called) of the company,
other than capital the holders of which have a right to a dividend at a
fixed rate but have no other right to share in the profits of the
company&#148;.</div>
<a name="09060283000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">According to
the 1988 Act, if the holder does not have a fixed-rate preference
share, they must have an ordinary share. The challenge arises because
the rate on the preference share may vary. Although the definition of
ordinary share capital includes an exclusion for shares that carry a
dividend at a fixed rate and is similar to the definition of fixed rate
preference shares in schedule 18 of the 1988 Act, the two are not the
same. As a result, it is possible for a share to be treated as part of
the ordinary share capital and as a fixed rate preference share for the
purposes of schedule 18. The concern expressed to me is that the
introduction of the definition of &#147;relevant preference
shares&#148; would increase the circumstances that could give rise to
that confusion. Amendments 23 to 26 bring the two definitions into
line, so that an ordinary share is defined as something that is not a
relevant preference
share.</div><a name="09060283000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government beat us to the punch with amendments 10 to 12, in
that we wanted to table amendments with a similar effect. We welcome
the Govt
amendments.</div><a name="09060283000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000486"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> I feel that it would be beneficial to address the
amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary,
as they clarify the legislation. I welcome the fact that they have been
widely welcomed across the Committee. I will then discuss the other
amendments in the
group.</div><a name="09060283000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
three Government amendments address representations made regarding the
draft legislation for schedule 9. The schedule amends rules identifying
how companies are to be regarded as belonging to the same group for tax
purposes. The hon. Member for Fareham may be right to say that this is
a technical and arcane matter, but it is important to a lot of grouped
companies to be able to access the privileges that come with that
status.</div>
<a name="09060283000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">Currently,
where a parent company of a group holds more than 75 per cent. of the
equity in a subsidiary company, the group can benefit from rules that
allow it to surrender or claim losses from companies in the group. A
number of anti-avoidance rules also apply when a company or an asset
leaves a tax group. The 75 per cent. equity rule was originally
a straightforward test in the 1970s when the original tax rules were
formed; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>they were then consolidated in the 1980s and still govern those areas of
taxation. That rule has had to evolve to prevent avoidance, as the
financial affairs of groups of companies have become more complex over
time. Now, the parent company also needs to enjoy the full rights of an
equity holder. Usually, those are rights attached to the ordinary
shares in a company, although they might also be subject to the rights
of other shareholders and certain creditors. The limitations on the
types of preference shares that can be issues to external investors
without threatening the structure of a tax group creates a particular
problem for financial groups that need to raise additional tier 1
regulatory capital.</div>
<a name="09060283000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">The changes
in the schedule resolve that problem, and I think that they have been
welcomed. However, we have received representations stating that,
because the only circumstances in which the rules are being relaxed
relate to either regulatory capital constraints or companies in severe
financial difficulty, that might not cover circumstances in which a
company simply has insufficient retained profits to pay a full dividend
on its preference shares. Therefore, the three Government amendments,
taken together, remove any doubt that the circumstances in which
dividends can be reduced or not paid refer only to the terms on which
the shares are issued. Amendments 10 and 11 therefore refer
specifically to the terms of the share issue. A consequent change is
made by amendment 12, removing a now defunct reference to
the payment of
dividends.</div><a name="09060283000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments clarify that relevant preference shares do not lose that
status simply because the company has insufficient profits to pay the
full dividend. That includes circumstances in which a company has no
profits to distribute, so that any dividend would be ultra vires, and
where a dividend paid by a regulated financial institution would breach
rules on capital adequacy.</div>
<a name="09060283000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 23
to 26, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Fareham, would take the
changes made to the rules for tax groups by schedule 9 outside that
field and into all manner of other areas of the Tax Acts. It might not
have been fully appreciated by the hon. Gentleman when he tabled the
amendments, but section 832 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988 is headed, &#147;Interpretation of the Tax
Acts&#148;. It is a general definition section, whose definitions are
intended to apply to many rules throughout the Acts and in a variety of
different circumstances. The definition of ordinary share capital is
one of those which applies for many purposes throughout the Taxes
Acts.</div>
<a name="09060283000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are two
principal arguments against amendments 23 to 26. First, they
are unnecessary. The objective of schedule 9 is to address specific
problems that some groups have experienced as a result of the turmoil
in the global economy, particularly in the financial sector, over the
past year. Those problems do not relate to section 832 of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act. The groups that lobbied for changes have no
problems with that section: their problems relate purely to schedule 18
to that Act. We have received positive and welcome feedback on the
changes contained in schedule 9, and the amendments I have tabled will
achieve what is needed in that respect.</div>
<a name="09060283000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, as
I have indicated, it seems to me to be dangerous to amend a definition
that affects dozens of separate parts of the Taxes Acts purely to
achieve a change in one part. Analysing the effects
of such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>change would be a large undertaking, and I am pretty sure that it would
throw up some undesirable and unintended consequences. That is not the
right way to achieve a focus on the particular area about which the
hon. Gentleman is worried.</div>
<a name="09060283000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
businesses are experiencing problems with the definition of ordinary
share capital in other specific areas of taxation law, HMRC will be
pleased to receive representations from them about it. Consideration
will then be given to whether changes are necessary to the definition
of ordinary share capital for those specific areas. I hope that the
hon. Gentleman appreciates that undertaking. If other specific problems
are brought to our attention we will certainly try to address them, but
tackling a specific issue by attempting to change a general definition,
which could have undesirable effects throughout the Taxes Acts, is a
recipe for large numbers of unintended consequences that would make
themselves known subsequently. They might have consequences for
avoidance activity or a range of other undesirable outcomes, which I am
sure the hon. Gentleman certainly did not intend when he tabled the
amendments.</div>
<a name="09060283000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45
pm</div><a name="09060283000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
changes brought about by schedule 9 provide companies with greater
flexibility in how they raise capital from external investors, without
compromising their right to the benefits of being part of a tax group.
That will assist a number of banks that are seeking to bolster their
regulatory capital and help to protect depositors. We will achieve our
aim in ways that will not adversely affect any group or detract from
the essential anti-avoidance purpose of the tax rule that is amended. I
therefore urge the Committee to accept the Government amendments and
the hon. Member for Fareham to not press
his.</div><a name="09060283000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000487"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am grateful for that explanation. It reflects
part of the challenge of tax law in this country. To address one issue
we create a new definition, which then throws up anomalies regarding
other definitions. To use an architectural metaphor, we create a
baroque monstrosity of a tax system rather than a classical building. I
do not know if there is much scope to have a tax law in the current
exhibition on the baroque at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It would
be an interesting interpretation of baroque to have tax law exhibited
there. Not wishing to digress too far, there is a tax museum in Siena,
which has remarkable pieces of art depicting the business and commerce
in Siena. I think that that is more renaissance than
baroque.</div><a name="09060283000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">Coming
back to the topic, I understand the Minister&#146;s point. This is a
challenge that we face in trying to amend law. My amendment was
over-ambitious for the occasion, and those who suggested it to me will
have noted the Minister&#146;s undertaking and will reflect on it. On
that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="09060283000281"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000488"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move amendment 22, in

under sub-paragraph (5) must specify that no company may be regarded as
being or having been in severe financial difficulties in any accounting
period during which it agrees or agreed to contribute to, or increases
or increased the value of, the pension arrangements of any director or
former director a sum in excess of &#163;1
million.&#146;.</div><a name="09060283000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is the Fred Goodwin memorial amendment. Schedule 9 talks about a
business reducing or failing to pay the dividend on a preference share
in relevant circumstances, and it goes on to define those relevant
circumstances as being
when</div><a name="09060283000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;at
the time the dividend is or would be payable, the company is in severe
financial
difficulties&#148;.</div><a name="09060283000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule does not define what severe financial difficulties are. I move
the amendment as a probing one, to get the Government to set out more
clearly what they see as severe financial difficulties. I think that
the letter that has been placed in the Library in respect of the
amendment says that the vast majority of businesses may clearly fall
within or without the everyday meaning of that phrase. That is a
perfectly fair thing to say, but we know that RBS was in severe
financial difficulties and needed to be bailed out by the Government,
not just once but twice. However, RBS&#146;s financial difficulties
were not that severe that it could not augment the pension of its chief
executive. That makes it rather difficult to understand what severe
financial difficulties means, and it would help to have some clarity
from the Government. If banks are able to spend significant sums on
discretionary activity, would that not suggest that they are not in
severe financial difficulties? I would be grateful if the Minister
could elaborate a bit more carefully on that phrase before I think
about whether to press the amendment to a
vote.</div><a name="09060283000288"></a>

Eagle:</b> I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on the
opportunistic nature of the amendment. It demonstrates that creativity
lurks everywhere. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> One day, I might ask
him what his secret is.</div>
<a name="09060283000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 22
seeks to address matters that are not directly relevant to schedule 9
but are relevant to the content of regulations that the Treasury could
make under the power contained in the proposed new section of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which is inserted by paragraph 3
of the schedule. The amendment raises a topical issue&#151;that of
so-called rewards for failure, which none of us regard as a good thing.
However, if it is aimed at directors who bear responsibility for the
financial difficulties of a company, particularly directors who no
longer work in the group, it will miss its target. The consequences of
the amendment would fall on the current employees and shareholders of a
business if it was denied the opportunity to have its group structure
recognised by the tax system, rather than on those who had done the
damage and fled bearing the rewards of failure.</div>
<a name="09060283000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
would apply whenever pension benefits in excess of &#163;1 million
were granted to directors, irrespective of whether the company, the
shareholders or anyone else believed that a particular director had
been instrumental in the failure of the company. It would always be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>possible, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman realises, to pay pension
benefits of slightly less than &#163;1 million, in which case the
entire point of the amendment would be lost.</div>
<a name="09060283000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked what constituted &#147;severe financial
difficulties&#148;. The phrase is fairly self-explanatory. It does
not cover companies with temporary cash flow problems, or circumstances
in which they could acquire funds from related companies or other
sources. If there is genuine doubt, however, we are prepared to do
whatever we can to provide companies with certainty of
treatment.</div>
<a name="09060283000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The phrase
does not cover contrived situations. If we were to become aware that
some groups were attempting to use the relaxation provided by the
change to manipulate tax group structures&#151;in effect, to say who
is entitled to claim group relief or some other tax relief&#151;then
we would be prepared to remove any doubt about whether the severe
financial difficulty test was satisfied. In that context, it is
important to apply common sense. Having demonstrated his creativity, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000490"></a>Mr.

more creative, perhaps not limiting it to a sum in excess of &#163;1
million in order to capture all situations.
</div><a name="09060283000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister says that the definition of severe financial difficulties is
common sense. She is right; it is fairly apparent. However, I note that
paragraph 6(6) includes the power for the Treasury to specify such
circumstances by regulation. I hope that the Government&#146;s
intention is not to use the power, and note that draft regulations have
not been drawn up. That is understandable; such regulation should be
made on an ad hoc basis. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

amendment was tabled to elicit clarification. UK Financial Investments
is the holder of the Government&#146;s interests in a number of

not create an opportunity for group relief.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000492"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> Having praised the hon. Gentleman for his
creativity with the last amendment, I am going to disappoint him on his
accuracy with this one. He is wrong to think that UKFI is the holder of
Government shareholdings. It manages the investment, but does not hold
the shares or other securities of any other groups in which the
Government have taken equity stakes. The Government shareholdings are
held by the Treasury through the Treasury Solicitor as nominee and the
need to avoid the tax complications that could have resulted from a
corporate entity holding the shares in otherwise unrelated groups is
one of the reasons why we chose to follow that route when taking the
stakes. So UKFI is  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>not a shareholder and the need for the amendment simply does not arise.

and companies, because it is not a particularly straightforward area.
Clause 29 makes changes to schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2006. There
has, I think, been some consultation with the industry about some of
the unintended consequences of schedule 10 to that
Act.</div>
<a name="09060283000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 10
was introduced to create an income tax charge on the sale of a company
carrying on the qualifying business of leasing plant and machinery. The
Budget note sets out
that:</div><a name="09060283000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Schedule
10 to the Finance Act 2006 prevents a loss of tax when a lessor company
changes hands. It achieves this by calculating a charge and relief
designed to recoup the tax timing advantage gained from a claim to
capital allowances. The legislation ensures that the charge affects the
selling group and the relief benefits the buying
group.&#148;</div><a name="09060283000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">Deloitte
and Touche has said that part of the problem with schedule 10 is that
for leasing
companies&#151;</div><a name="09060283000307"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000496"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000497"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The clause introduces schedule 10 to the Bill. It
makes changes to the anti-avoidance rules for the sale of leasehold
legislation contained in schedule 10 to Finance Act 2006,
ensuring that it operates fairly and does not impede commercially
driven transactions. I therefore move that it stands part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09060283000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000498"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I return to what I was saying on
schedule 10 and what the problem was&#151;leasing
companies that typically show a period of tax loss at the beginning of
the lease. As tax deductions exceed the taxable rental income and this
timing benefit reverses subsequent periods as the tax deductions reduce
compared to the taxable rental income, selling the company to a
loss-making group before the period of taxable profits begins enables
the future, or deferred tax liability that would otherwise arise, to be
avoided. The consequence was that the legislation was not sufficient to
cover complex transactions involving leasing businesses by companies
who are run in partnerships or consortiums. I understand that the
provisions in schedule 10 now address some of those problems. That is
confirmed by the Budget
note:</div><a name="09060283000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Changes
will be made to ensure that companies carrying on a leasing business in
partnership benefit from the full amount of relief due as a consequence
of an increase in their interest in the business and to prevent a
charge being calculated when a partnership is dissolved or ceases to
carry on a leasing business. Where there is an intra-group transfer
involving a lessor company owned by a consortium the measure similarly
prevents the calculation of a
charge.&#148;</div><a name="09060283000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7
pm</div><a name="09060283000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
number of issues have been raised on this. The initial representations
suggest that the new rules proposed in schedule 10 would make it more
difficult to sell a leasing business to a company with no UK tax
capacity, such as an infrastructure fund or a European trader with no
UK operations. Since the proposals in the Bill might impede parts of
the leasing sector in this country, would it not be better to have some
sort of tax avoidance motive test, rather than the proposals set out in
schedule 10? That might help, encourage the leasing industry
and avoid the suggestion that it would be difficult to sell some
leasing companies to companies with no UK tax
capacity.</div><a name="09060283000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09060283000499"></a>Angela
Eagle:</b> The schedule makes changes to schedule
10 of the Finance Act 2006. We have managed to align
schedules&#151;one schedule 10, in the Bill, is replacing another
schedule 10, which is a kind of balance that is rarely achieved in
Finance Bills, but makes things slightly confusing. New schedule 10
replaces old schedule 10 in the same lessor companies
legislation.</div><a name="09060283000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
2006 legislation addressed a long-standing pattern of avoidance
involving the sale of a lessor company at a point when the business was
about to become tax- profitable. It has provided valuable Exchequer
protection since it came into effect in 2005; it has been a highly
effective closure of a major tax loophole. However, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column226" />Column number: 226</div>leasing industry has drawn it to our attention that, in exceptional
circumstances, the legislation may be affecting normal commercial
transactions. Where the relief provided for under schedule 10 of the
Finance Act 2006 cannot be used immediately, its value to the buying
group is reduced potentially in feeding in normal commercially
motivated transactions. Part of the difficulty is that a lot of the
companies are run by banks, and banks are not exactly in profit at the
moment. That is where some of the difficulty has arisen. I suspect that
in 2006, when the arrangements were drawn up, the problems that banks
are having now with their profitability were not anticipated. It is
something that has come out of that circumstance. The schedule makes
changes to preserve the value of the schedule 10 relief when not
utilised immediately. At the moment the non-profitability of some of
the companies that are buying or selling is an issue that has adversely
affected activity in this particular
market.</div><a name="09060283000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule also removes anomalies affecting the treatment of leasing
businesses carried on by companies in partnership and by companies
owned by consortiums, ensuring that the legislation operates fairly in
all circumstances. The hon. Gentleman recognised that in his remarks.
Proposals for change to deal with the issue were presented in a
discussion document published in July 2008. Draft legislation was
published for comment with the
Budget.</div><a name="09060283000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman raised the difficulties of selling to infrastructure
funds. The Bill has no effect on the sale to infrastructure funds. The
issue was known about last year. I can tell him that we are in
discussions with the industry about how we can deal with the issue, so
it is not dealt with in the Bill, but we are aware of it and are
discussing it. I hope that he will acknowledge that the changes in
schedule 10 work for the benefit of the industry in trying to maintain
an important market through these difficult times. Clearly, we shall
also apply such an approach to our review relating to the sale to
infrastructure funds in order to give the assistance that is
appropriate for that particular and important market. I hope that, with
that reassurance, the Committee will agree to make schedule 10 part of
the
Bill.</div><a name="09060283000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question
