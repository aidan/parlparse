							<a name="07052370000301"></a>The
Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil
Woolas):
						</b> I hope that you had the opportunity for a good
lunch, Mr. Cummings. I was able to have only a glass of wine
on the Terrace, I am afraid. It was a very nice glass of wine and very
reasonably priced, but it was only wine and no
sustenance.</div>
					<a name="07052370000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
delighted that my persuasive powers have persuaded my colleagues to
come here and join me.I am, as ever, joined by my
fantastically loyal Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend the
Member for West Ham. I want to place on the record my thanks to her.
She has engaged in the spirit of the Bill with gusto and provided a way
forward.</div>
					<a name="07052370000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked me to clarify the
Government&#146;s intent. I take it from that that he feels that I
did not clarify it, so I intend to do so now. The Government support
part of the intent of clause 5 and new clause 3. It is not the
principle thatwe have a problem with; it is the drafting and
the application. I hope that I have convinced the
Committee that we are a devolutionary and decentralising
Government&#151;the two are different. We believe that decisions,
including funding decisions, should be taken locally wherever
possible.</div>
					<a name="07052370000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put it on
the record for the sake of clarity that I propose to table an amendment
on Report that I believe will cover the intent of clause 5 and
newclause 3. My proposal is that if authorities consider that
the function or functions of one body should be exercised
by another, they should be able to make
representations to that effect under new clauses 5 and 6. However, we
think that, wherever possible, local authorities should seek to use
their powers under the Local Government Acts of 1972 and 2000. We
believe in a consensual and devolutionary approach to these
issues.</div>
					<a name="07052370000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
agreement that the original clause 5 should not stand part of the Bill.
I expect that the hon. Gentleman will wish his new clause 3 to be
included in it. Although I cannot support the detail, I have no problem
with the principle, as I said. Therefore, I do not intend to oppose new
clause 3. I hope that that clarifies the matter. If not, perhaps he or
other hon. Members will say
so.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052370000302"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Oliver Letwin</b> (West Dorset) (Con): I am grateful to the
Minister for his remarks. They do indeed clarify the position, as I
think my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood would agree. They
were a whole heap clearer than his earlier remarks, and I am sure
that we shall await the Minister&#146;s amendment.
However, I want to say something in the spirit of putting into his mind
things that may be helpful when we come to Report and when he comes to
consider the amendments that he will move
then.</div>
					<a name="07052370000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I understood
the Minister aright in his concluding passage, he was suggesting that
his amendmentswould provide for the local authority under some
circumstances to take over the functions in some respects of some
existing other body. I think that it is worth warning him that it is
unlikely, in my view, that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>such an amendment could succeed in achieving the object that we seek,
and I shall explain why, in the hope that he will reflect
further.</div>
					<a name="07052370000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where there
is a current Government agency or devolved agency&#151;a regional
development agency,for example&#151;it will typically have a
remit that is established first in statute, then perhaps in regulation
and thereafter in some kind of ministerial targets or edicts. I may be
wrong, but I suspect that if the Minister attempts to draft a clause
that gives the local authority the right not to seek the ability to
redirect moneys but to seek to take over specific functions, that will
have the effect that we do not want of putting the local authority,
when exercising those functions, under the duty to follow the remit
that the agency
had.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000303"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That is not my intention. The idea of the Bill and
the policy is that the local council, as the democratically elected
body, should be the first among
equals.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000304"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> That is an extremely helpful clarification. If the
Minister&#146;s intention is as he has now described, it may well be
that we can reach a perfect agreement. To take a concrete example, if a
regional development agency runs a business links programme, properly
ordained by a sequence of top-down rules, and the local authority seeks
to use the cash available for something that it thinks a better way of
promoting business in the locality, and if the Secretary of State has
not ruled that the business links are of primarily national
significance, our intention is that the local authority could so direct
the money. If the Minister&#146;s intention is the same, we have
agreement.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000305"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> There is just one caveat, and I hopethat
it does not sound like sour grapes. The strategies and policies of the
business links in that examplecome from consultation, but that
is a side point. Notwithstanding that, if a local area&#146;s
target&#151;for instance, to reduce joblessness&#151;involves the
local authority and other partners saying to the business links,
&#147;We want you to redirect your policy in such a way,&#148; that
should be
achievable.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000306"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> That is extremely helpful, as I think my hon.
Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood would agree. I suspect that
colleagues elsewhere in the Committee would also agree that that
fulfils their intentions. It may well be that the effect of providing
for such a power is that the co-operation that the Minister thinks
often does not apply will emerge, because business links or the people
organising them might say to themselves, &#147;It is not worth not
doing what the local authority wants us to do because, if we
don&#146;t, the local authority will petition the Secretary of State
for the ability to take it over.&#148; That is precisely the dynamic
that we wish to create&#151;one that means that the local authority
is, as the Minister puts it, first among
equals.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000307"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> This is serious stuff. On the point that the hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood made about the co-operation on the
targets, that is important and I hope that he recognises that I do not
wish to preclude 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>further co-operation. But in agreeing the targets, the business links in
the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s example would be under an obligation
to help to meet the targets that had been set locally. In Torbay, for
example, they might be on training, new businesses in hotels and
leisure, or fishery skills, whereas in my constituency they might be on
textile engineering. Precisely that localism will be allowed, as shown
byhis
point.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000308"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> That is true, but, as the Minister says, this is
important and it is worth pursuing a deeper level of detail. As with
any business, it is not a criticism to say that the people running
business links think of the activity that they are engaged in as a
business link-like activity. If you ask them how to spend money, they
may well be willing to spend it in one way rather than another, but
they will always tend to think that the right thing do to is to spend
it on the kind of things that business links
do.</div>
					<a name="07052370000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, a local
authority might feel in a particular case that the general objective of
promoting more sustainable small and growing business would
bebetter achieved by providing people with something
completely different. It would not be natural for the business link
managers to want to do that. Atthe extreme, it might involve
them no longer having the same jobs. One cannot therefore rely on
agreement on targets and how they should be fulfilled in a local area
agreement to achieve what we are seeking to achieve. We want a position
whereby if the business link group does not feel that the local
authority is proposing the right kind of thing, then so long as the
area is not defined as primarily nationally significant the local
authority will have the presumption of getting the Secretary of
State&#146;s approval to take over the
spending.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000309"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I agree and would go slightly further. The best
way of promoting small business in an area might be to provide a youth
club for 19-year-olds at the further education college. Indeed, such
activities are provided at the South Devon further education college,
which is one of the best in the country. As the hon. Member for
Ruislip-Northwood said, the point is the outcome&#151;the
achievement. If the best way of creating small businesses is to build a
youth club so that there is access to young people, which is what I
want to achieve, that is desirable.</div>

							<a name="07052370000310"></a>Mr.

Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): On behalf of the
Committee, I join the Minister in recording our gratitude to the hon.

proceedings she is condemned to sit in silence, which I do not believe
to be her natural state. She left our earlier sitting looking as though
she needed a lot more than the one glass of wine that the Minister
allowed himself on the terrace, and that may have had something to do
with the speech of my right hon. Friend. We are genuinely grateful for
the work that she has done through the usual channels to get us to
where we are.</div>

teased that out with a specific working example, which is a good way of

							<a name="07052370000314"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> We have shown that with discussion and
consideration we can move from clause 6 to 13 in a matter of seconds,
whereas it took a matter of months, if not years, to get to clause
5.</div>
					<a name="07052370000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the spirit of
devolution, Government amendments Nos. 37 and 38 relate to the remit of
the Bill in Scotland and Northern Ireland. To be fair, ours is a
devolutionary Government, although, in respect of Scotland, we might be
regretting that; in respect of Wales, that is yet to be the case. I
suspect that in the long run we will be the beneficiaries, but I shall
not go there, Mr. Cummings, because you will not let
me.</div>
					<a name="07052370000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government
amendment No. 39 relates to the commencement date, on which there is a
disagreement between the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, whose Bill
this is and who wants to get it into legislation straight away, and the
Government, who want to have time to ensure that we do it
properly.For the benefit of hon. Members who might
readour deliberations in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, I shall explain the
amendments.</div>
					<a name="07052370000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Government amendments Nos. 37
and 38 are, of course, related. Amendment No. 38 would leave out clause
13(3), which would extend the provisions to Scotland, as well as clause
13(4), which would extend 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>them to Northern Ireland. Government amendment No. 37 is consequential
on clause 13(2), from which will be deleted cross-references to
subsections (3) and (4), which will remove Scotland and Northern
Ireland from the Bill. As evidenced by the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
amendments to leave out clauses 9 and 10, there seems to be a general
agreement that the Bill ought to apply to England only.</div>
					<a name="07052370000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Straying from my speaking
notes, I would like to add, however, that that does not mean that we
think that the intention of the Bill should not apply to Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. I do not want people there to think that
the UK Parliament believes that they should not be involved, consulted
and informed on decisions, that there should not be appropriate methods
for influencing policy and decisions, or that there should not be
locally based decisions in those nations and regions. However, it is
not for us to say how they should do that&#151;it is a matter for
them. I wanted to make that clear. I am hoping that the transcriber
from Local Works, whose publicity extends to those nations and regions,
has noted that point, which I have made very clearly. Given the tartan
margin in Scotland, I am confident that Her Majesty&#146;s loyal
Opposition and the Liberal Democrats would want to make that clear as
well. I see nods of assent, and so make that point on their
behalf&#151;although, the fact that I said it first might give me a
slight
advantage.</div>
					<a name="07052370000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 39 would replace the provision for the Bill to come into force on
the day on which it is passed. This is a very difficult argument for
any Minister to pursue because the proposition that a Bill should come
into force when the Secretary of State deems so sounds, to the cynical,
if not the sceptical, like weasel words. I can reassure the Committee
that the statement has been normal practice for legislation across
Governments through the ages. There are good reasons for that, and I
hope to use them to persuade the Committee.</div>

							<a name="07052370000318"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> It is not. It is backed up by a powerful
argument.</div>
					<a name="07052370000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment No. 39, commencement would take place through commencement
orders made by the Secretary of State. The justification for that is
simply that the Secretary of State has duties under the Bill, including
duties to consult. These come under new clause 1 in particular, which I
would imagine is likely to be accepted in some form. It is important
that the Secretary of State is not placed under duties that he cannot
meet, to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne. If provisions could be commenced by way of commencement
order, that would ensure that that did not occur, since the Secretary
of State will not commence a provision until 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>she can comply with it. Commencing provisions by way of a commencement
order is in no way unusual and it is usual in situations where the
Secretary of State has duties such as those that the Bill would impose
on her, or on him or her in the future. I hope that my argument is
finding agreement on amendments Nos. 37 and 38.</div>
					<a name="07052370000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment No. 39, I ask the
Committee to consider seriously that we should not have a commencement
date if that date renders it likely&#151;probable, in my
view&#151;that the Secretary of State would not be able to comply
with the duties. One further point, which is more than a debating
point, is that if the Bill is to succeed it will rely on its ability to
strengthen the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill.
The commencement date of the latter Bill is not known, because it is
subject to debate in the House and the other place, and so
Iask the Committee not to push the issue of a commencement
date and to trust the Government in their good intent. Parliament has
many powers to ensure that commencement takes place at a date that is
agreeable to it, should the Secretary of State be unable to comply with
the duties.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hollobone</b> (Kettering) (Con): We all know that the
Government are about to change. Although none of us doubt the personal
integrity of the Minister, in a few weeks there is every likelihood
that he will not be in his post and we will be at the mercy of
officials, however well intentioned, who are not directly accountable
to the House. That is why, I suspect, most of the Committee would want
something from the Minister other than a vague assurance that it will
happen &#147;some date in the future.&#148; We would want it to be
more specific and on the face of the Bill either when it is passed or
at some specified date when other legislation will come into effect.
The Minister will probably not be able to answer our questions in two
months&#146; time.</div>

Parliament has sufficient powers to ensure that commencement dates are
implemented. The idea that Parliament would pass a Bill that the

unlikely and impossible. Parliament would, rightly, insist on that. It
is important that the Secretary of State has the time to consult

						</b> I have a personal experience of this. About eight
years ago I began a small, personal crusade to rearrange matters so
that builders skips, which currently have to be lighted with lights
that often get flat batteries and are hence a danger to the public,
should instead be allowed to have reflective or luminous markings. I
have exchanged rather morethan 200 pieces of correspondence
and numerous parliamentary questions with successive Ministers about
this. There is good will on the part of the Government who have gone to
the trouble&#151;to take the hon. Lady&#146;s point&#151;of
involving the British Standards Institute and consulting on many
fronts.</div>

					<a name="07052370000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Considerable
progress has been made. Unfortunately, eight years later, the
Government have not quite managed to find the legislative time to
engage in what they now say are the appropriate actions to achieve a
result that they accept would be desirable. The reason is that there
are more pressing matters. I can understand that&#151;I do not claim
that builders&#146; skips are the most important thing in the world.
More pressing matters every year seem to demand legislative time from
the committeesof Cabinet, and I fear that the same fate might
befall this Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052370000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
would be an easy matter to solve, as the Minister will have an idea,
from discussions within Government and with his officials, of how long
it could reasonably take. If he would like to add six months or a year
to his estimate of the time it would reasonably take to implement, so
that there was an estimate of one year, but a period of two years in
the Bill, I do not think that any of us would cry deeply about that. We
accept that the Minister needs time, but let it be a date certain, so
that we know where we
are.</div>

absolutely, about a Government Bill perhaps having a different level of
importance in a Minister&#146;s mind than a private Member&#146;s

Communities Bill as currently drafted, one way forward might be for it
to come into force on the same date as the Local Government and Public

valid. The difficulty is that I have no 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>such date, because the House has not yet passed the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Bill&#151;I hope that it will. Let me
reassure him that it is not a date that causes the problem; it is a
given period of three months, for example. I would be more than willing
to come back with a date; in fact I undertake to do so, should my
argument win the day here. My strategy involves the fact that 1 April
2008 is the day when the new regime for local government comes into

							<a name="07052370000344"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> Let me explain&#151;I hope that it will be
helpful for the Committee. Having rapidly moved through the clauses, we
now move to the schedule. New clause 7, which has been tabled by the
hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, is to replace the existing clause 2,
and is countered by Government new clause 5. New clause 6, confusingly,
would replace new clause 3. That is an inevitable consequence of the
way we are proceeding on this matter. I am grateful to you,
Mr. Cummings, for allowing such a
debate.</div>

							<a name="07052370000345"></a>Mr.

the source of the confusion, which may be inevitable with a small Bill.
The right hon. Gentleman is correct. The difficulty that we have here
is new clause 7. Mr. Cummings, are you permitting debate on
that at this

agreement.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000349"></a>Mr.
Hurd:
						</b> Yes, indeed. I had no wine at lunch, but I must say
that I rise with a sense of giddiness at the pace at which we are now
cantering through the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052370000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						We have a
reservation about Government amendment No. 35, because as I understand
it, although we do not oppose the change in wording, a link is made
tonew clause 6, which we do not accept. I support new clause
7, which I tabled along with the hon. Members for Stroud and for
Falmouth and Camborne. In our view it is a slimline and less
prescriptive version of our earlier new clause 2. Just to remind the
Committee of the narrative of the Bill, as we have been jumping around
a little, new clause 2 was the part that drew out the mechanics for the
formulation and delivery of a national action plan to counter the
problem of community decline, which is the driving force of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052370000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to
go through the main points of detail. I believe that the differences
between ourselves and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>Government are not ones of principle, nor are they necessarily ones of
substance, but they are worth airing, just to ensure that we have some
consensus and the two versions can be reconciled.</div>
					<a name="07052370000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our version of new clause 7
starts with the now familiar issue of the timetable. We have softened
our approach by requiring that the</div>
					<a name="07052370000267"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Secretary of State
shall, as soon as is practicable, consult all principal councils in
accordance with this
section&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07052370000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 2
required that to happen within six months, so I think that we have
taken a more practical approach. We much prefer the word
&#147;consult&#148; tothe term &#147;to invite
proposals&#148;&#151;I think that that isthe term in the
Government&#146;s new clause&#151;and the Minister understands that
the word &#147;consult&#148; has a stronger force and a clearer
sense of definition in law than what is in the Government&#146;s
proposals. We therefore remain firm on that point.</div>
					<a name="07052370000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7 would refine the
provisions of new clause 2 by introducing sensible mechanics for the
appointment of the Local Government Association as the selector or
&#147;the advisor&#148;&#151;various expressions have been used.
We understand the role of the LGA tobe that of a filter,
consolidating and prioritising the recommendations that come from the
front line. In the last sitting, the Minister expressed reservations
about the Government requiring anything of the LGA because of its
status, which I think the Committee understood. The provisions satisfy
us that there could be no confusion about which body is favoured to
fill this space and, I think, meet the Minister&#146;s concern about
appearing to require nothing of the
LGA.</div>
					<a name="07052370000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7(4)
would insist on a duty of co-operation between the Secretary of State
and&#147;the advisor&#148;&#151;the LGA, we hope. The
Government&#146;s approach is to try to stay with the language of
consultation. We have insisted that the duty to co-operate should
cascade down the chain of decision making: the Secretary of State would
have a duty to co-operate with the LGA, which would have a duty to
co-operate with local authorities, which in turn would have a duty to
co-operate with the panels and the mechanics of local engagement. We
feel that that duty should be a consistent theme through the
chain.</div>
					<a name="07052370000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new clause
7(5) we have set out the opt-outs for the Secretary of State&#151;we
are sensitive to concernsin the Department regarding a
Secretary of State&#146;s freedom of manoeuvre. Those opt-outs are
clearly linked to any proposals that involve extra money or conflict
with the national Government&#146;s policy objectives. It is worth
emphasising that subsection (8) would require the Secretary of State to
ensure that each
</div>
					<a name="07052370000268"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regional office of
government cooperates with principal councils and
panels&#148;</div>

process.</div>
					<a name="07052370000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
understands that the driving force behind the Bill and the priority of
its sponsors is to make it clear to its audience and the people whom it
will affect, that this is a different process from the normal one. Our
concern about the Government&#146;s proposal in new clause 5 is that
it reads much like a standard consultation. I do not know what other
Committee members&#146; experiences are, but in my constituency
certainly, the words &#147;public consultation&#148; 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>and &#147;sham&#148; have become inextricably linked&#151;there is

						</b> How is it that in the wording of new clause 7,
we have the term &#147;consult all principal councils&#148;, but
clearly in new clause 5 we have the idea that the principal councils
make the proposals? As I understand it, new clause 5 is much stronger
in giving a bottom-up approach than new clause 7. Why does the hon.

reputation that the word &#147;consult&#148; has, better than new
clause
5?</div>

that intervention. I think that the answer lies in how tight the
definitions are legally&#151;for example, in a case in which somebody
feels that the consultation has not been adequate. In such a case, it
would be easier to define &#147;consultation&#148;. It is stronger
and would give more comfort than a simple invitation to make
proposals.</div>

must invite&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052370000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">those
proposals causes a problem. It seems to be in the power of the
Secretary of State to invite them. I understand the point made by the
hon. Member for Llanelli, but do not think that either new clause is
better at dealing with the
issue.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000353"></a>Mr.
Hurd:
						</b> That intervention is extremely helpful. I am not
sure that this is the most important issue that we will deliberate on,
because our intention here is clear. I have been advised that
&#147;consult&#148; is a stronger expression and is preferable
because it lends itself to explicit
definition.</div>
					<a name="07052370000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main
point is that the desire of the Bill&#146;s sponsors, and its many
supporters out there, is for a national action plan to address the
social problems associated with community decline. However, there
cannot be just a standard consultation exercise. The driving force
behind the Bill is the fact that local opinion is what counts on
decisions that affect local communities and their future health and
sustainability; local people know best. There is a desire for, and
there must be seen to be, a genuinely bottom-up process to formulate
the national action
plan.</div>
					<a name="07052370000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The core
elements of new clause 7 are certainly an improvement on old clause 2.
We feel that the new clause would send a stronger signal to the system
that this is not just a standard consultation exercise,
butthat there is a genuine desire for bottom-up local
engagement that will make the national plan as
effective as
possible.</div>

Griffith:
						</b> I will speak about the comparisons between new
clauses 7 and 5. Importantly, we are all trying to pull in the same
direction and we should focus on what is comparable between the two and
how much 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>
						overlap there is. I am extremely lucky in coming
from Wales, where we have a closer relationship with the Assembly
Government than is possible for a wider community such as
England.</div>
					<a name="07052370000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have some
concerns. New clause 5 is explicit in saying that the selector should
be on the side of the principal council and it therefore represents the
bottom-up view. I am not convinced that, under new clause 7, the
LGA&#146;s representation would necessarily put the views of the
principal council&#151;it might, but it might not. I suggest,
therefore, that new clause 5 would give more strength to local councils
and local communities than new clause 7. I ask the Committee carefully
to consider the comparison between the two new clauses and which would
be the more
effective.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000355"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> As the Minister did not oppose the amended
clause 3, I hope that he will not press new clause 6. The debate on
this group is therefore largely about whether the existing clause 2
should be replaced by new clause 7, which I tabled with the hon.
Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Stroud, or by new clause 5, which
stands in the name of the
Minister.</div>
					<a name="07052370000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
not many differences between the two proposals. Often, the difference
is purely in the language used&#151;for example, whether we should
&#147;invite proposals&#148; or &#147;consult&#148;. The
language is also different, although the sentiment is the same, on the
issue of whether there should be an &#147;advisor&#148; or a
&#147;selector&#148;.I think that &#147;selector&#148;
is a bit cumbersome, but ultimately we are trying to achieve the same
thing. When drafting new clause 7, we tried to use the language that
would be most straightforward and easy to
understand.</div>
					<a name="07052370000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
two areas in which I think that the two new clauses differ, on which I
will seek assurances from the Minister. One of the first key issues
concerned the timetable. New clause 7 clearly sets out a time scale for
the consultation and how the Department should respond annually to
explain progress against the proposals that come forward. That is not
present in new clause 5, but it is in new clause 7. I would appreciate
the Minister&#146;s comments on the process that we have talked about
this morning, which is about ensuring that we can tangibly feel that
the issues that have been raised have been responded to, but not just
hoofed into the long grass. I seek his reassurance on
that.</div>
					<a name="07052370000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second key
issue is the fact that new clause 5(5) concerns whether the Secretary
of State must consult, or co-operate. We have had a long debate on
other clauses about the language that compels people to co-operate.
That has been accepted in earlier clauses, so I hope that the Minister
would be able reassure us that the Secretary of State would be prepared
to take on the duty to co-operate that we have discussed at such great
length in respect of local authorities. If he can tell us that
amendments will be tabled and accepted to change that fundamental
sense, we will perhaps be reassured. There are two key issues: time
scale and co-operation, rather than consultation. If we can deal with
them, we will feel a lot happier about new clause
5.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07052370000356"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): Much has been said, so I
do not need to repeat it. Let us start from where we agree. Old clause
2 is overly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>
						bureaucratic, and is clearly in need of being
re-written. That is what the two approaches are trying to do. To be
honest, there is obviously common ground here, so I hope that we do not
make a meal of this; we should get it sorted on Report.</div>
					<a name="07052370000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I want make a narrow
point. I do not like the notion of a selector. To me, a selector means
something sporting, or someone who is not involved in the field of
play, but comes from outside and starts making decisions that may or
may not take account of those who are involved in the discussion. I
prefer the word &#147;advisor&#148;, because clearly, an advisor is
there to make representations and recommendations, and to be part of
the discussion. It is a very narrow point, but if we were to go out to
communities and say that the eventual delineation and arbitration of
what may go forward in terms of their sustainable community plan is
going to be overseen by a selector, they would be somewhat nervous and
would probably not engage. I hope that we can agree, if nothing else,
that &#147;advisor&#148; is a more appropriate term, given that it
is the same person, perhaps doing the same thing. However, as always in
life, titles mean something.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000357"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> To me, the main point of difference between new
clause 7 and new clause 5 is that the words &#147;action plan&#148;
do not appear in new clause 5. However, in new clause 7, they appear
seven times. Given that a large part of the meat of the Bill is about
drawing up an action plan and implementing it,new clause 7
addresses that need far better than the wording in the Government
amendment, which refers to proposals being invited from principal
councils.</div>
					<a name="07052370000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">It has been
said that new clause 5 offers more encouragement to the bottom-up
proposals from local authorities to the Government. I would be amazed
if that were the case given that the promoter of the Bill wants very
much to ensure that that happens. New clause 7 would offer greater
reassurance that that will be encouraged and implemented than
Government new clause 5.</div>

matter. If we take new clause 5 as the Minister&#146;s starting
point, from our point of view there seem to be two very serious
deficiencies in its drafting. However, I suspect that he may not be
unwilling to change them, so let me try to persuade him. I do not think
that subsections (1), (2) and (3) of new clause

a need for some discussion between those on the two Front Benches, it
would be nice if the rest of us also felt that we were part of those
discussions. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could address his remarks
as much to the Committee as to the
Minister.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000361"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> I apologise, Mr. Cummings. I
havea terrible habit of mumbling anyway, and I was mumbling
towards the Minister. I do not know whether members of the Committee
agree, but I do not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div>think that subsections (1), (2) and (3) of new clause 5 cause any
difficulty for those of us who are otherwise in favour of new clause 7.
The bits that cause difficulty are subsections (4) and (5) and, in
particular, two narrow but vital points, one in each of those two
subsections. Unlike new clause 7, subsection (4) does not mandate any
action on the part of the Minister, and my hon. Friend the Member for
Kettering and the hon. Member for Stroud, in different ways, drew
attention to that. There is no mention of an action plan, and under
subsection (4) the Secretary of State does not actually have to do
anything. He could simply sit there and not decide to do
anything.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000362"></a>Mr.

something.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000363"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> Yes, or positively decide not to do something. I
am not trying to draft proposals in Committee, but if the Minister were
to undertake to come back with a version of subsection (4) which
mandated the Secretary of State to draw up an action plan based on
those proposals on the short-list that he deemed should be implemented,
or something of that sort, we would be eight-tenths of the way towards
solving the first of the
problems.</div>
					<a name="07052370000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The
problem in subsection (5), which was also alluded to by other members
of the Committee, is that there is a duty to consult but not to
co-operate with the selector. I know that the hon. Member for Stroud
has an aesthetic objection to the term &#147;selector&#148;, which
I share, but we would not want the Bill to founder on that ground, so
let us forget it for a moment. The Minister came a long way towards us
in subsection (3) by making it clear without naming the Local
Government Association that it was, de facto, the Local Government
Association, and we can live with that.</div>
					<a name="07052370000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						The problem
is that under subsection (5) the Secretary of State does not have to
co-operate with the LGA, merely to consult it and that is a big
difference. If he had to co-operate with it, broadly we would have a
version of new clause 5 under which he had to draw up an action plan in
co-operation with the LGA. If we strip it right down, that is what new
clause 7 is all about.</div>
					<a name="07052370000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know how those who
tabled new clause 7 would feel about it, but I think
there may be a possibility of withdrawing new clause 7 and new clause
5. The Minister could then table a version of new clause 5 on Report
that looked awfully like new clause 5 as drafted but with the two vital
changes of a mandated action plan and a duty of co-operation. I do not
know whether that route is
feasible.</div>

						and replace them with
a reference to &#147;matters referred to&#148; in the section
dealing with proposals by principal councils. I tabled it as a
clarification in defining terms, in order that there would not be
confusion with the national indicator set that is being developed as
part of the work programme related to the local government White Paper
and the Bill that will
follow.</div>
					<a name="07052370000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind hon.
Members that new clause 5 is a proposed replacement for new clause 2,
as indeed is new clause 7. Obviously I shall not speak at length about
the intent of new clause 5, because I believe that the Committee is in
agreement on it. However, let me record why I think that new clause 5
as drafted is a good and effective mechanism that meets the
Bill&#146;s
intent.</div>
					<a name="07052370000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5
requires the Secretary of State to invite principal councils to make
proposals that they consider would contribute to promoting the
sustainability of local communities. Before inviting proposals, the
Secretary of State must appoint a person&#151;the selector&#151;to
consider the proposals and to draw up a shortlist for consideration by
the Secretary of Statein accordance with regulations under
proposed new clause
6.</div>
					<a name="07052370000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I have already
said, the selector must be someone who represents the interests of
principal councils. Clearly, that is the Local Government
Association.On receiving the shortlist, the Secretary of State
must decide which, if any, of the proposals should be implemented, and
give reasons for the decision. Before making a decision, the Secretary
of State must consult the selector and try to reach agreement&#151;a
point to which the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne
referred.</div>
					<a name="07052370000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am aware
of the reasons why some Committee members might feel that new clause 5
falls short of the aspirations behind the Bill. I personally do not
believe that it does, although I do not want to be heavy-handed about
it. Nevertheless, I shall put on record my reasons for that
belief.</div>
					<a name="07052370000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood proposes to require the Secretary of State
to produce an action plan that would be laid before each of the Houses
of Parliament&#151;both initially, and thereafter annually. Under new
clause 5, the Secretary of State will respond publicly to every
proposal that is made, and therefore progress will be regularly
updated. That is a flexible statement of the action that the Secretary
of State intends to take in response to proposals.</div>
					<a name="07052370000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that, when I use the
word &#147;flexible&#148;, the hon. Member for Falmouth and
Camborne will rise and seek to intervene, because she believes that
flexibility will be my excuse for ducking out of a commitment to
prepare an annual report. What I am actually saying, however, is that
it might be desirable to make reports more frequently than on an annual
basis.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000366"></a>Julia
Goldsworthy:
						</b> It is not a question of the regularity of
reporting. The point is that I cannot see anything in new clause 5 that
indicates that the response from the Secretary of State must be in
public.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000367"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> The Secretary of State&#146;s responses are in
public; the hon. Lady must trust me on that. When we are in government
we do not respond to colleagues; we respond to Parliament and to the
press as well. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div>However, I take her point; she wants reassurance that the process will
be public and transparent.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000368"></a>Mr.
Hollobone:
						</b> I am following the Minister&#146;s
explanation closely. Before he moves on too far, can he advise the
Committee why new clause 5(1) states that the Secretary of
State</div>
					<a name="07052370000271"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;must invite
principal councils to make
proposals&#148;?</div>
					<a name="07052370000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely it
should state that the Secretary of State &#147;shall consult all
principal
councils&#148;.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000369"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> That is a fair question. The phrase &#147;must
invite principal councils&#148; is an imperative. What I am seeking
to avoid is a situation in which the legislation compels the principal
council to act. In my view, Parliament can impose a duty on the
Secretary of State but, in this process, not on the principal council.
By saying &#147;she or he must invite the councils&#148;, it gives
the council the flexibility to say, &#147;We do not wish to make any
proposals.&#148; If one were to do it the other way round and insert
&#147;may consult&#148;, the Secretary of State may decide not to
do so. It is, of course, still open to principal councils to make
proposals. If the proposal is in response to an invitation that the
Secretary of State must make, that defines the process and obliges the
Government to follow procedures.</div>
					<a name="07052370000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me stray on one thing,
Mr. Cummings. There is a huge debate raging in the country
about the invitation to propose for unitary authorities. That was an
invitation to propose; it was not a compulsion to propose. Within the
framework of that consultation, it is triggered by the Secretary of
State&#146;s invitation. The idea behind that wording is to allow
Parliament to compel the Secretary of State rather than to allow a
flexible consultation with councils. The hon. Gentleman has picked up
on the crucial wording; he has a tendency to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07052370000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The action plan
being laid before Parliament each year is an important point. Under new
clause 5, all decisions will be made public and any decisions requiring
parliamentary scrutiny will be considered by Parliament. The Secretary
of State will be held to account for her actions in meeting the
requirements of the Bill and for the much wider range of actions that
she takes to promote the sustainability of local communities. The
Secretary of State is bound to act by the Bill, and her
actions&#151;for example, decisions on spending and the making of any
legislation&#151;will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I believe
that there is little to be gained by creating an extra parliamentary
process.</div>
					<a name="07052370000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already covered the point about a dutyto co-operate during our
discussions on the original clause 3. To reiterate, we discussed the
duty to co-operate at length at that time. I explained the meaning and
intent of the duty that is placed on named authorities in clause 82 of
the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill.</div>
					<a name="07052370000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The drafting of new clause 6,
and of new clause 5, is intended to meet this intent in the most
appropriate way. One cannot have a one-sided duty to co-operate; named
parties must co-operate with each other, and they have to co-operate on
something or to do something. That is a helpful point from the intent
of the Bill.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>
					<a name="07052370000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Hon. Members would like all
duties in this clause to be subject to a timetable specified in the
Bill. As I have said, it is desirable to act soon, and the Government
has, I believe, demonstrated that it is committed to achieving progress
through the Bill. However, the detailed implementation of all duties is
subject to consultation, and rightly so. Including timetables in the
Bill may create duties that are impossible to comply with. In addition,
having a duty to do something by a specific date could also have the
unintended effect of making the duty a one-off
exercise.</div>
					<a name="07052370000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said
that new clause 5 is related to newclause 6. I am not saying
that I intend to push this, but I would like to explain my thinking.
New clause 6 is a replacement for the existing clause 3. It requires
the Secretary of State to make regulations about the procedure to be
followed in relation to proposals under the Government&#146;s
proposed new clause 5&#151;so the jigsaw puzzle is coming
together.</div>
					<a name="07052370000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
making the regulations, the Secretary of State must consult the
selector, the LGA, and such other persons as she thinks represent the
interests of principal councils. The regulations may specify
stepsto be taken by a principal council before making
proposals, including a requirement for a principal council to have
regard to the matters specified in the schedule. Secondly, they may
specify steps to be taken by the selector in considering the proposals
and drawing up a shortlist. Thirdly, they may specify criteria to be
applied by the selector in drawing up a shortlist. Fourthly, they may
specify a maximum number of proposals to be included in a shortlist and
require the selector to prepare and give to the Secretary of State a
report on the proposals. Lastly, they may specify the form of, and
information to be included in, the report.</div>
					<a name="07052370000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The regulations, on the other
hand, must require a principal council, if it has not already done so,
to consult representatives of local people before making any proposal.
The principal council is required to tryto reach agreement
with those representatives about proposals and to have regard to any
guidance issued. That is an important point, because the Committee was
unanimous in wanting statutory guidance to ensure that there would be
proper consultation and
involvement.</div>
					<a name="07052370000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Secretary of State may issue guidance to principal councils about
making proposals, which may include the guidance about consulting
representatives of local persons that we have discussed before. Before
issuing or revising guidance, the Secretary of State must consult
principal councils or, again, persons who the Secretary of State
considers represent the interests of principal councils. In other
words, we would not be able to issue statutory guidance on how to
consult without having first consulted the people whom we were going to
compel to consult. That might sound like a pedantic point, but let me
reassure the Committee&#151;I am sure that if the right hon. Member
for Skipton and Ripon (Mr. Curry), who did my job
previously, were here, he would back me up&#151;that such procedures
are subject to detailed examination and sometimes to legal challenge
should they not be followed. There iscase law precedent on the
definition of consultation
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>and the timetables and methods that are required. <i class="I">[Interruption.]
</i>I can see that the Committee wants me to move on, but it is
important to put these matters on the record and I am going as fast as
I can.</div>
					<a name="07052370000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that
it is right to achieve these matters through regulations and guidance
and that the Secretary of State is required to consult widely, because
there has not been an opportunity to involve principal councils and
those representing their interests in our deliberations. That is not a
criticism but a statement of obvious fact. However, the councils are in
the best position to know what will work best.</div>
					<a name="07052370000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that there are a
number of areas in which the Committee might feel that my proposals
fall short of their desired position. I have already explained the
meaning and the intent of the duty to co-operate that is placed on
named authorities in clause 82 of the local government Bill. The
drafting of new clauses 5 and 6 is intended to reflect that intent in
the most appropriate way, namely by requiring the council and the
Secretary of State to try to reach agreement with, respectively, local
representatives and the selector. I should stress that that is a
far-reaching duty. It carries more meaning and goes further than the
wording proposed by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. There cannot
be a one-sided duty to co-operate. Named parties must co-operate with
each other, and they have to co-operate on something or in doing
something. This is a strong measure that meets the aspirations of hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee.</div>
					<a name="07052370000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">If I could just repeat the
specific reference to disadvantaged groups, I fully agree that
councilsshould make every effort to empower and engage
disadvantaged groups. I have explained that this is the intent of
clause 108 of the local government Bill and of the wider range of
measures that we are putting into place. I have also said that we fully
intend to cover this issue in the statutory guidance that will
accompanythe
Bill.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07052370000280"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07052370000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">Referring to
disadvantaged groups on the face of the Bill would have an unintended
adverse impact on clause 108 of the local government Bill. I am keen to
avoid that, which the hon. Member for Kettering will recognise as he
has been following the debate. Amendment No. 33 requires principal
councils to set up residents panels. New clause 6 requires principal
councils, if they have not already done so, to consult representatives
of local people before making any proposal. The difference is simply
the word &#147;panel&#148;. Let me explain why new clause 6 does
not include specific reference to a panel.</div>
					<a name="07052370000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the effect of the
requirement in new clause 6 is broadly equivalent to that of amendment
No. 33. The term &#147;panel&#148; has very little meaning. For
example, how many people should sit on it? The Opposition raised this
question when we debated the public involvement in health parts of the
Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill. Should it be
the same number in all places? Should the panel meet to make decisions?
How should panels take decisions? Those are not insurmountable
problems, and they are fairly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div>small and technical. I am simply putting on record the sorts of
questions that the Government would have to
answer.</div>
					<a name="07052370000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
making specific reference to panels inthe Sustainable
Communities Bill could have an unintended adverse consequence on clause
108 of the local government Bill. As I have said, our proposed new
clause 6 includes a guidance-making power, and I am happy that the
guidance that will accompany this Bill should include reference to
panels.</div>
					<a name="07052370000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood proposes that if a council fails in its
duty to involve its citizens effectively, then citizens should be able
to seek redress through the Secretary of State. There are a number of
mechanisms in existence and planned in the local government Bill, such
as the community call for action, which provide redress short of legal
challenge or direct referral to the Secretary of State. Ultimately if
the Secretary of State is satisfied that an authority is failing to
meet its duty to involve local representatives her intervention powers
under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999 could
apply.</div>
					<a name="07052370000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
exercising such powers, however, the Secretary of State would generally
expect to work with the authority to give it an opportunity to address
the issues before taking such action. If, following that opportunity,
the Secretary of State was still of the view that the authority was
failing to meet its duty she would need to be able to present clear
evidence to support that view. Taken as a whole, I think that those
powers are sufficient and, in particular, I do not believe it is
appropriate to involve the Secretary of State every time an individual
feels their council has not acted
appropriately.</div>
					<a name="07052370000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood would like to
require principal councils to consider parish plans and to involve
parish and community councils. Again, I agree that this would be
desirable. In practice it will, of course, happen. Thereis a
danger that it would be too restricting and prescriptive to make this a
requirement on the face of the Bill. One of the big areas that we have
debated is the voluntary sector involvement and the requirement
for principal councils to include voluntary
organisations among the bodies that they must consult. Again, that is
desirable and it is the consequence of the local government Bill, and
section 108 in particular. In practice, councils do involve voluntary
organisations. There is a range of activities to build voluntary and
community sector involvement and empowerment.</div>
					<a name="07052370000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not propose to describe
the difficulties that I have with new clause 7 because I have achieved

middle way between the Government&#146;s new clauses 5 and 6, and new

						</b> To help my hon. Friend, new clause 6 is dependent
on other matters. What matters here is new clause 7 and new clause 5.
We need a clause; I would prefer it to be new clause 5, and the hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood would prefer new clause 7. I said that I
am happy not to press new clause 5 to a Division, and I put my
arguments forward in the best way I could and as comprehensively as
possible. I will leave it to the Committee to decide how to
proceed.</div>

							<a name="07052370000380"></a>Mr.
Hurd:
						</b> I thank the Minister for the way in which he has
conducted the debate. He clearly had some things to get off his chest
and I hope that he feels better for it. I said that the differences
were not major ones, but we have two different versions of a clause and
we have to decide which one to proceed
with.</div>
					<a name="07052370000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.
Friend the Member for West Dorset highlighted our two major concerns
about Government new clause 5: the failure to include a duty to
co-operate and a national action plan, a point also raised by my hon.
Friend the Member for Kettering. Government new
clause 5 creates a framework whereby the Secretary of State must
respond to a series of proposals coming from the front line, but with
no timetable attached to that we are worried that there is a
possibility that it could be a rather fragmented, scatter-gun approach.
The desire and responsibility need to be drawn together into a coherent
national action plan. Those are the two key deficiencies of new clause
5.</div>
					<a name="07052370000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Minister
said, new clause 6 is linked to new clause 5 and contains the added
complication that there is an overlap between new clause 6 and our
earlier deliberations on clause 3. The balance of judgment is that we
should accept the Minister&#146;s offer not to press Government new
clauses 5 and 6 and proceed to a decision on new clause 7, with a clear
message to the Minister that our minds are open to amending it on
Report. It is clear from this helpful debate that our views are pretty
close.</div>

					<a name="07052370000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a simple amendment to a
planning subsection to add affordable housing to the matters that any
group considering the sustainability of their area should bear in mind.
No area can be sustainable if it is impossible for people to live
there. Anyone who represents a constituency like mine&#151;several
members of the Committee represent areas that are not
dissimilar&#151;knows that the biggest single dividing factor in
whether a community is sustainable is the inability of certain types of
people to live in those communities, usually because they are excluded
by their inability to buy, rent or even to live with others in the area
because of the lack of
accommodation.</div>
					<a name="07052370000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
adding the amendment, I had hoped to be far more radical and to go into
all sorts of ideas about community land trusts, only to find that no
such idea exists in law. Therefore, the next time Ron Bailey has
nothing better to do, he can bring forward a wonderful Bill on
community land trusts for number one so that we can put it in law. That
is notwithstanding what we can do here.</div>
					<a name="07052370000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want communities to engender
their own solutions. They have to be responsible for the people who
live there and for those who would like to live there. The wording of
the amendment is very simple and, I hope, without controversy, so we
will all nod it
through.</div>

Goldsworthy:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I would like to endorse everything
that the hon. Member for Stroud has just said and I would like to speak
very briefly to amendment No. 36, which follows representations from
the Law Society about the need to ensure that legal services are also
included in definitions outlined in the schedule. The Law Society wants
to ensure that local legal services can provide a valuable role in
producing thriving sustainable local communities. It wants to register
its concern that providers of such services are also suffering from the
phenomenon of ghost-town Britain, which is a familiar theme to all
those who have participated in the debate on the Bill. It wants to
underline the fact that&#151;along with the local post
office, the shops and the pubs&#151;local, often
independent, providers of legal services also feel the threat of
exactly the same kind of pressures and want to be recognised in a
similar way.</div>
					<a name="07052370000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw
the Committee&#146;s attention to a Law Society survey about the
developments in local legal services and their relationship with local
communities. The 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>
						overwhelming majority wanted to highlight their
concern about the current level of provision. Puttingit into
the context of the Bill, 100 per cent. of the respondents regard
adequate access to locally provided legal services as important to the
sustainability oflocal communities. By definition, that is a
unanimous response.</div>
					<a name="07052370000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to quote some of the comments that were made. We need to
consider them in the context of the changes being made to legal aid,
which many local people feel could threaten access to such services by
the most vulnerable people in society. One person
said:</div>
					<a name="07052370000272"></a><div class="hs_brev">In my area,
there used to be over 20 solicitors, now there are just
four.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052370000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another referred
to competition from outside, which has reduced the availability of
locally provided services. Another one stated:</div>
					<a name="07052370000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;More people are
appearing at court unrepresented and completely without access to legal
advice or assistance. This leaves people feeling disenfranchised and
disaffected.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07052370000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the key points that
local people wanted to underline is that access to such services,
especially at a very early stage, is massively important to members of
the communities that we want to ensure remain sustainable. If people do
not access legal services at an early stage, it can lead to them
requiring access to other, more costly services. Ultimately, it will be
beneficial to the community in that way.</div>
					<a name="07052370000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">That reminds me of an important
service that the citizens advice bureau provides in my constituency. It
has an agreement with the local courts that all mortgage repossession
hearings be held on the same day, so that the legal specialists can go
there and give advice to people. The vast majority of people still turn
up at court having sought no advice. Dozens of people who would have
lost their houses keep them as a result of that advice. If they had
not, just think of the extra knock-on costs that it would have
represented to local authorities through having to try to find them
temporary accommodation. It is about not just protecting services but
ensuring that other services provided do not have additional financial
burdens.</div>
					<a name="07052370000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law
Society, among other organisations, welcomes the opportunity that the
Bill provides to help counter many of the difficulties facing
communities. With the inclusion of local legal services, it feels that
the Bill will help to reverse the effects of ghost-town Britain, which
we have been
debating.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000389"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I rise briefly to clarify the fact that the
Government have no problem with the amendments.It is clearly
desirable that the schedule include the relevant
matters&#151;affordable housing, which is in amendment No. 21, and
legal services, in amendment No. 36&#151;in its definitions. But one
would not wantto raise false expectations. The hon.
Lady&#146;s survey reported a 100 per cent. affirmative response to
the question whether there should be legal services. It does not take
Sherlock Holmes to work out that the response to that will be 100 per
cent. We cannot kid ourselves that, by including things in a Bill, we
make them happen in the real world. We are facilitating local
communities to argue that they
should.</div>
					<a name="07052370000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I could give a
strong defence of the fact that the Government are the author of the
affordable housing policy, and I could give a strong historic lesson as
to how we got legal aid and community services. I will

							<a name="07052370000392"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> We are making progress, Mr. Cummings,
and I am grateful to you for that. The new clause contains the
Government&#146;s proposals for the resource mapping process. I
believe that there is broad agreement on its framework, which we
discussed in our sitting on 2 May. Amendments have been tabled to the
new clause, and we might wish to debate them briefly, but I do not want
to detain the
Committee.</div>
					
					<a name="07052370000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
local spending reports covered in the new clause come from a power of
the Secretary of State to make such arrangements and could effectively
cover all public expenditure in each local authority area, both current
and future spending. That is an important point. I am giving away
birthday cakes here, and Opposition Members are
not&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.] </i>They are pleased; I thought that they
were not writing it down. The Committee discussed on 2 May the
difficulties of defining local and not local spending, and I reported
back on the consultation across government on some of the
issues.</div>
					<a name="07052370000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment
that I have tabled includes a dutyto consult interested
parties so that we do not simply impose a process from Whitehall. The
costs of producing the local spending report must be limited. However,
the power should contain the flexibility to allow the report to focus
on proposed expenditure within county areas or, alternatively, a break
down for counties and a break down for districts, or simply a break
down for each district. In two-tier areas, that it important.</div>
					<a name="07052370000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The outcome might be a simple
report that identifies how much money is to be spent in each area by
partner authorities and if they do not spend it themselves, which is
increasingly the case, who
does.</div>
					<a name="07052370000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">The original
clause distinguishes between funding for primarily national or for
local priorities. Much expenditure could legitimately be said to be
either. We think that it is more powerful to be able to identify the
totality of funding that may be spent in each area. That exercise would
be based largely on existing&#151;and possibly on currently
available&#151;information. The aim of the task would be to quantify
expenditure that can easily be identified as relating to a particular
local authority area. The intent would be to understand in broad terms
how much money local partners and communities are responsible for. The
intent would be not to create an artificial split as to what funding
might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>go where, but to identify as well as possible what is to be allocated to
where. The purpose would be to help local authorities, their partner
agencies and their residents and community groups to plan
better.</div>

Woolas:
						</b> Very well, Mr. Cummings. The amendments
reflect an earlier discussion in this Committee. Amendment (c) reflects
the Committee&#146;s wish that the Secretary of State should be under
a duty to make arrangements for the production of local spending
reports. It replaces the word &#147;may&#148; with the word
&#147;must&#148;.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000394"></a>Mr.
Letwin:
						</b> Why will the Minister not move amendment (b),
which seems to be entirely in line with his amendments (c), (d) and
(e)? Does he object to (b), or did he just happen not to move
it?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07052370000395"></a>Mr.
Woolas:
						</b> I am coming on to that; I should have explained.
Let me first finish my argument on amendment (c). I hope that there is
agreement on replacing in subsection (1) of new clause 1 the word
&#147;may&#148; with the word &#147;must&#148;. Amendments (d)
and (e) reflect a similar wish. They amend subsection (4) of new clause
1 and require that the areas covered by the report should be one or
more local authority areas, one or more parts of a local authority area
or any combination of
those.</div>
					<a name="07052370000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me explain
my difficulty with amendments (b), (g) and (f). New clause 1 provides a
degree of flexibility&#151;that is not to allow the Government to
back out of their obligations. I repeat: we have tabled new clause 1
because we believe that a clear benefit can be gained from identifying
what public expenditure is spent in each area. It will make the
planning and decision-making process more transparent and accountable
and will help partners to make better informed decisions. The
flexibility is there because nobody yet knows how to achieve that.
There is a requirement in the new clause for the Secretary of State to
consult the people who will benefit from it. That means that we can
design a process that is fit for purpose. It seems strange to me to
design out such flexibility and to circumscribe the consultation even
before it takes
place.</div>

					<a name="07052370000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also have a
slight concern about taking a list of authorities agreed for the
purposes of one piece of legislation and simply copying it into another
pieceof legislation. For example, it is unnecessary
toname authorities. The intent to include appropriate
authorities is already provided for. It will be confirmed by
consultation and written into arrangements. There is no need to name
authorities in the Bill. It is also potentially onerous to do so. Not
all named authorities allocate funding according to local authority
boundaries and, as I explained earlier, there is often a perfectly
legitimate business case for not doing so.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>
					<a name="07052370000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our aim is not to create an
artificial split in what funding might go from which agency to which
area, but to create transparency for the funding that can be influenced
in a local area. Listing partner authorities could incur substantial
effort for no gain. As I have also said before, in this case
&#147;may&#148; implies &#147;must&#148;, so this is not a
simple list of suggestions. As I have already made clear, it is
important that we consult and make the production of local spending
reports as useful and efficient as possible. As nobody knows how best
todo this yet, I believe that it is wrong to write into the
Bill specific requirements which may undermine, unintentionally, the
usefulness of the reports.</div>
					<a name="07052370000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short&#151;[<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] I hear a &#147;Hear,
hear.&#148; Having looked at this, and we have had some time now to
consult in Whitehall, we believe that this is the best way to do it.
This will be one of the main benefits of the Bill, because it will put
in the public domain what the spending is. Kent county council have
done so. Other councils, including my own, have done so. It will show
the public what the spending is and generate significant debate and
disagreement in local areas. We have the confidence in this process to
say that we should put that information out there because it will
result in better involvement, higher turn-outs in elections and
efficiencies in public spending. This is a key part of the Bill.
However, I do not want to prescribe in too much detail before we ask
local authorities to do
so.</div>

Hurd:
						</b> I am delighted that the Minister shares the
Committee&#146;s enthusiasm for this clause. There may even be a
feeling in the Committee that the full ramifications of the clause have
yet to be fully understood outside the Committee Room. It could be the
catalyst for some very vigorous debate. It is therefore essential that
we get it right. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on
getting to the right place after a disappointing start. The right place
is one word, a &#147;must&#148; in line 2. That is the crucial
change. Everything else is secondary, in our
view.</div>
					<a name="07052370000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have followed
the Minister&#146;s arguments carefully. He has had a solid afternoon
and I am delighted to tell him that he is likely to end on a victory
because the main achievement has been banked, which is the change to
line 2. I should explain amendments (f) and (g) very briefly. They are
designed to remove any doubt from the process and to show to an
external audience exactly who we mean in this process. That explains
the long list of authorities that are parties to local areas agreements
and listed in the existing legislation. I am persuaded by the
Minister&#146;s arguments for possibly the first time this afternoon,
but I am more than happy to leave it open to members of the Committee
to express their
views.</div>
