<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 74, leave out lines 18 and 19.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 112, in clause 122, page 75, leave out lines 10 and 11.
<P>
No. 115, in clause 123, page 77, leave out lines 34 and 35.
<P>
No. 118, in clause 124, page 78, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
No. 119, in clause 125, page 79, leave out lines 43 to 45.
<P>
No. 120, in clause 126, page 80, leave out lines 4 and 5.
<P>
No. 121, in clause 127, page 80, leave out lines 11 and 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I feel rather like the prosecutor in a case in which I once appeared-I was not the prosecutor, I might add-who, arriving at the Old Bailey and having been handed his brief, stood up and said, ``Members of the jury, I have before me a piece of paper surrounded by some pink ribbon. I am not sure what is in it but I suggest that we open it together.'' He then proceeded to open his case. I am not quite in that position, but I should like to take the opportunity this morning to look at a series of amendments, on which I shall seek some clarification from the Minister.
<P>
Amendment No. 111 raises an interesting and fundamental issue which is within my remit, as I sometimes act as the party spokesman on Scottish matters. It is in some ways a rather delicate issue but one that the Committee should consider. The clause starts with some consequential amendments to the Representation of the People Act 1983 that repay close scrutiny. They amend the section that controls donations to candidates, but have no effect on local government elections in Scotland.-I find that a curious anomaly. As the Minister will realise, I would not have embarked upon an amendment like this without consulting those who are involved in politics north of the border, and they find it a strange state of affairs too. I expect he will argue that responsibility for local government has been devolved under the Scotland Act 1998. I do not disagree in any way about that, but it is curious that we are seeking to set up a United Kingdom-wide framework within the Bill, which certainly impinges upon the way in which Scottish parliamentary elections are conducted, yet Scottish local government elections will be completely unaffected.
<P>
I must be circumspect as I am conscious that I am dealing with a matter that is part devolved. Although this has obviously happened throughout the UK, disquiet has been expressed on quite a few occasions about the manner in which local elections have been conducted north of the border. It, therefore, did not come as a total surprise, when I canvassed this point in Scotland last Friday, to find that, far from people saying that this was a Scottish issue and would I try not to tread on people's toes-I always try to be tactful on such issues-it was of some concern to them. I do not know whether it is proposed to introduce a similar measure north of the border that mirrors ours. Perhaps the Minister, with his links through the Government with the Scottish Executive, can say. Such a proposal would give considerable reassurance because it strikes me that it would be most unsatisfactory to operate two systems. The Minister looks as if he is about to leap to his feet, and I am happy to encourage him.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping):</B> Just as the hon. Gentleman has consulted colleagues and people in Scotland, we have had discussions with the Scottish Executive. This is a devolved matter, but the Scottish Parliament will be asked in due course to consider similar parallel measures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am obliged to the Minister who has given me at least some reassurance.
<P>
Of course, a mechanism has already been used whereby if legislative proposals are identical to those that the Scottish Parliament wishes to pass, we can legislate on its behalf, with its consent. Have the Government inquired whether that would be desirable?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am happy to talk to colleagues in Scotland, but I know that the desire there is to pursue their own course, which they are entitled to do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Indeed they are. But I am pleased to have raised the matter because unless some conformity is introduced there will be some surprise among people in the next two to three years, and all the more so because we have determined entirely the structures for the Scottish Parliament. Although many aspects of local election practice and the boundaries issue seem to me to be entirely devolved issues, the question of the basic framework and law applying to elections north and south of the border appears to make compelling grounds for having identical systems, otherwise there will be problems. But, with the Minister's assurance, I will turn to other somewhat different amendments relating to the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> They are all the same.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> So they are. I thought for a moment that amendment No. 113 had been taken with amendment No. 111.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Quite properly, amendment No. 113 has been listed under clause 122 and, as the Minister rightly said, amendments tabled under clause 121 properly relate to references to Scotland.
<P>
I am grateful for the Minister's comments, although I shall listen carefully to such further replies as he offers. This is a matter that the Committee should bear in mind. I encourage the Minister to use existing channels to the Scottish Executive to ensure that we do not have two differing sets of rules for Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) has come to Committee, opened his bundle, made his case and arrived at the right conclusions. All the amendments cover the same ground. As to why local government in Scotland is excluded from the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman said, the Scotland Act 1998 makes this a devolved matter, and the Sewell convention reinforces the mechanics of it. Discussions have taken place with the Scottish Executive and it would, of course, have been possible to use these proposals when enacted. I understand that the Scottish Parliament wishes to consider the matter, together with other matters, and will find a vehicle for legislation. I also understand that no Scottish local government elections will take place until 2003, so there is an opportunity to produce legislation. It is, of course, a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I accept the Minister's comments. In the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

candidates' election expenses

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`knowingly'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now return to a traditional matter-the addition of the word ``knowingly''. Subsection (2)(a) should include that word so that those who incur excess expenses would be guilty of an offence only if they did so knowingly. I should be grateful to hear the Minister's comments on that probing amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As the hon. Gentleman has said, the Committee is familiar with this ground. I am grateful to him for his probing amendment. I believe that he knows that I am anxious to include defence clauses in the Bill. Perhaps the Bill has been misread. I draw his attention to subsection (2)(b), which states that any candidate or election agent who incurs election expenses is guilty of an offence if he or she
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``knew or ought reasonably to have known that the expenses would be incurred in excess of that maximum amount''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The use of the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``knew or ought reasonably to have known''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will take account of the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I was aware of paragraph (b) in tabling the amendment, but a distinction can be drawn-albeit one that might take the matter further than the Minister would want. People could incur expenses when they knew or ought reasonably to have known that the expenses would be incurred in excess of that maximum amount, but that is different from knowingly incurring expenses. It is at least arguable that it is possible to unknowingly incur expenses. The amendment would provide an extra defence in addition to the reasonableness requirement in paragraph (b). One defence is not rendered unnecessary by the other. That is why I tabled the amendment, but I accept that it might provide people with excessive protection in those circumstances; it might take the defence too far.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I have listened to what the hon. Gentleman has said. He has pursued this issue in Committee before. I ask him to let me consider the matter, because we use the phrase ``knew or ought reasonably to have known'' as a defence in clause 72(4)(a) and it is important to have a similar definition throughout the Bill. There is no argument about the substance of the amendment; it is a drafting matter. If the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, we will consider the matter, as we intend to ensure that defence arguments are drafted consistently throughout the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his reassuring reply. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 75, line 9, leave out `£100,000' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`£75,000'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This probing amendment deals with the funding of parliamentary by-elections, and I should like to know the Minister's thinking on some of the figures. I took advice from the Library on the increases in parliamentary by-election spending limits over the past few years. They are somewhat startling, even for those of us who have participated in by-elections and have been involved in the spending of the permitted amounts of money.
<P>
According to the information from the Library, until September 1989 by-election spending limits were the same as those for general elections. At that time, spending limits were emphatically increased, so that the total permitted spending for a constituency of 70,000 electors went from around £8,000 to £26,000 per election. Successive upratings now mean that the spending limit for a constituency of that size in a parliamentary by-election is £31,800-which contrasts with around £9,000 in a parliamentary election at a general election. I do not want to comment on why that was done, who agreed to it, why it was thought a good idea and so on. However, the Bill changes that £31,800 to £100,000-an increase of more than 300 per cent. It would enable a great deal of money to be spent on each elector, out of all proportion to the limited spending allowed in a general election and to the current limits for a parliamentary by-election.
<P>
It has been said before that one of the main aims of the Bill is to restrict the election arms race by curbing the accelerating expenditure by all parties. I go along with that; it seems a sensible aim. Yet here we have a proposal to more than triple the amount that can be spent on a single parliamentary by-election, which seems completely out of synchronisation with the declared aims and objectives of the Bill and of the Minister.
<P>
I am aware of some of the reasons why it might have been thought appropriate to increase the limit from £31,000. They include the fact that very professional machinery is often brought in to fight parliamentary by-elections these days-and professional machinery costs money. The electorate can be apathetic, so it is thought that they need a great deal of stimulus to get them to vote. Parliamentary by-elections are increasingly taken as micro-general elections-as some sort of poll on the popularity or otherwise of the Government or Opposition, or whatever parties are in the national frame at that moment. Those are good reasons for professionals to want to spend money on a by-election. It is extremely debatable, however, whether they are good reasons for introducing legislation on that.
<P>
The Minister was stout in his resistance to any suggestion from Conservative Members that the national campaign limits should be removed or increased beyond the limits in the Bill. I refer the Minister to his own remarks on why it is desirable to have that limit on national campaigns during general elections. Practically all his arguments about general elections also apply to parliamentary by-elections. In all conscience, there is no justification for trebling the by-election spending limit for parliamentary elections. There is only the professional argument that it would be nice if we had the freedom to spend the money without having to look over our shoulders.
<P>
I note some similarities with the much fought-over clause 63, which deals with elections in Northern Ireland. The implication of that clause is that it is impossible to control the situation, so different rules are suggested but they are effectively given up. Our debate over clause 122 has some similar aspects. Indeed, in some ways it applies to the Bill as a whole.
<P>
As I have said, the amendment is a probing one, designed to test the Minister's intent. It effectively says, ``Hang on a minute; let us multiply not by three and a bit, but by two and a bit, and have a limit of £75,000''. That could embrace all the imaginable circumstances that develop. I have been a candidate aide, a Member of Parliament designated as minder, and I have been all around the by-election circuit on behalf of my party at different times over the past 20 years. I know how easy it is to spend money if it is there. I know how tempting it is to find new ways of spending money in by-elections. But I ask the Minister, ``Please have another look at this matter''. This part of the Bill is for professional spenders, not for the good governance of the United Kingdom.

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Miller </B>(Ellesmere Port and Neston): Let me take the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) back over his past 20 years to illustrate why it is so important to distinguish between by-elections and general elections. We all accept that by-elections have become a national event. They act as large-scale opinion polls of the popularity of the Government or of the particular policy objectives of an Opposition candidate. They are increasingly viewed on a national stage as a result of increasing accessibility of information through the media.
<P>
It is vital that the Bill distinguishes between general elections and by-elections. I want to be neutral, as I could point fingers at all three main parties. Let us consider the Warrington by-election of 1981 in which Lord Hoyle was first elected. I was at the centre of that election and was surprised at the extraordinary expenditure of what I believe was the party of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove at that time-the Social Democrats. For the first time, computers were introduced into by-elections. On one occasion, I slipped into SDP headquarters to have a look around and was astonished at the wonderful array of technology around me, none of which was referred to in the election returns at the time. In the same year at Croydon, Bill Pitt was elected and similar levels of expenditure were incurred. More recently in the previous Parliament, the Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election saw innovative descriptions in the election returns. I do not blame the parties for that. It is simply that the focus on by-elections has changed dramatically since that time.
<P>
To bring us right up to date, the last by-election in which I was involved full time was Eddisbury, when the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien) was elected. Incidentally, given all the nasty things that we said about him during the by-election, he has turned out to be a very nice chap. I claim credit for inventing the slogan, ``Vote Labour or the fox gets it'', which almost got us there. My original version was, ``For fox sake, vote Labour''.
<P>
We all recognise that the constraints on elections from existing legislation lead to a lack of transparency. Given the nature of by-elections today, we need to put a serious figure on expenditure while demanding that new legislation be applied rigorously. Perhaps that will soften the concerns that were expressed by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He and I have both seen some interesting practices over the years. The way to overcome them is to use the provisions to create much more transparency, but within the framework of a figure that seriously reflects the expenditure that can be incurred during a local event that is nevertheless also national.
<P>
<B>Mr. Robert Walter </B>(North Dorset): I suspect that there may be a danger of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove being isolated by the force of opinion on this issue on both sides of the Committee. I was delighted to hear from the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) that by-election candidates, even those from the Conservative party, are nice chaps.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> I said that with hindsight.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> It is gratifying to know that that is the opinion of a Labour Member.
<P>
The clause reflects reality: a by-election is often conducted in the glare of national publicity, so the criteria are somewhat different from those that apply to a general election campaign, especially in relation to the Bill and its provisions on national campaign expenditure for a general election and the local expenditure of individual candidates. Obviously, in a by-election that is held more than a year before a general election, the concept of national campaign expenditure for a general election does not apply. However, it is entirely reasonable that there should be a larger limit for individual by-election campaigns.
<P>
There are also practical considerations. In general elections, candidates of the same party are likely to enjoy economies of scale in terms of the production of election literature. In my general election literature I and probably several hundred other Conservative candidates used the same printer and the same format so that the same colours went through the print run, enabling us to spend our meagre allowance on other election material during the campaign. One does not have those economies of scale in by-elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Martin Linton </B>(Battersea): The hon. Gentleman will remember that, to save on posters, the Conservative party had candidates called Evans in three successive by-elections. That finally resulted in the election of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans).
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I suspect that the selection committees were not geared solely to that criterion, but it reminds me of when I stood as a local government candidate in 1975. The Member of Parliament for the constituency was Sir Dennis Walters and, quite legitimately, we paid for the posters but used those from his general election by crossing out the last letter of his name. That enabled me to fight quite a decent local government election campaign. I hasten to add that I lost by one vote, so it did not do me that much good.
<P>
I should return to the amendment and the subsection. We are talking about an upper limit to which parties do not need to spend. The most recent by-election that I have been involved with was in Ceredigion. The Conservative party spent barely more on it than it would normally spend for a candidate in a general election, but our candidate still managed to come higher in the poll than Labour's did. There may have been special circumstances for that in Wales during the past week. That subject is not a million miles from the reason why I was a little late this morning: I was up all night taking part in radio programmes about it. There are economies of scale in a general election, and the clause would reflect the reality of by-elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I find myself in the happy state of agreeing with the comments made by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, which has not always been the case in Committee. I also think that the figure for by-elections is reasonable.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove is right that it is undesirable that political parties spend too much at by-elections. We certainly do not want by-elections turned into an opportunity for unlimited sums to be spent, although I share my hon. Friend's view that excessive expenditure by political parties is likely to be counterproductive in any event.
<P>
I fail to see any major difference between the sum proposed in the Bill and the sum suggested by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. Once the existing threshold is crossed, rounding the figure up as the Bill suggests is acceptable for the reasons that we discussed about providing a margin inside which political parties can spend. We must also try to ensure that we do not quickly have to tinker with figures once they are in the Bill. I am wholly comfortable with the figure proposed. I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, but I think that the Government have it about right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I was interested in the discussion of electoral posters, especially the experience of the hon. Member for North Dorset (Mr. Walter). I remember a general election campaign in Bristol where the choice was between candidates called Cocks and Balls. I must be careful as one of them is now in the other place.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove for saying that his amendment is a probing one. However, I am not so grateful to him for saying that it was designed to test my thinking skills. I fear that I may not do very well early on a Thursday morning. The hon. Gentleman said that the figures were surprising, even for those on the inside of a by-election. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and I have been there. It is no secret that returns are sometimes higher than those given to the returning officer, which do not have much to do with reality. The Bill provides an opportunity to review the matter and come up with a more suitable figure. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove got a figure of £31,000 from the Library which, however, is likely to vary from seat to seat. The Neill committee identified an average spend of £34,000.
<P>
The hon. Member for Hazel Grove said that earlier arguments I had made in Committee could be used against me. One such argument was that the Neill committee recommended £100,000. There is no special significance in that figure. We simple need some stability so that avoidance mechanisms are not used. The figure was widely consulted on and was included in the draft Bill. I remind the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that, at that point, his party did not respond to the matter, although the Scottish National party did raise it on Second Reading.
<P>
The figure of £100,000 has been included because it was recommend by the Neill committee and is intended to bring clarity and viability. The Electoral Commission will examine the matter and monitor the position. In the light of experience, it will be possible to recommend another figure. I suspect that the commission will examine by-elections closely-that will be a good learning experience-and that another Committee discussing another Bill will have an opportunity to review the figure. I know that the hon. Gentleman will not be satisfied with that. However, on this occasion, £100,000 is as good as £75,000. If we are honest, there is no real rationale. One simply has to take a stab at the matter and I invite my hon. Friends to take a stab at what is in the Bill,
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I am pleased with our debate, which more or less confirms what I said about our motivation. There is an area of expenditure in which professionals, on several occasions, have gained an advantage from the system. The Bill is an attempt to regularise what happens comparatively often, as we might acknowledge outside the Committee. I may have given the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston a slightly misleading nod during his speech when he suggested that I was a member of the SDP at the time of the Warrington by-election. As the leader of the Alliance group on Cheshire county council I was certainly an active participant in that election, however I was a member of the Liberal party. I did not even see the computers. I was probably not sufficiently senior to be admitted into the holy of holies, which he evidently penetrated.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset suggested that I was somewhat isolated in this Committee. I would not want it to be thought that I was not isolated elsewhere, too. I am well aware that my party did not produce any counter arguments. I am not making a case against any particular party's approach, but one that goes back to first principles. I am quite sure that my party professionals would be disgusted as Labour or Conservative party professionals that I am moving an amendment of this sort. However, it is important for the Committee and the House to give some consideration to the issues that I have raised.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Dorset referred to economies of scale and, in an intervention, the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) referred to the use of the name Evans. I have never been able to benefit from any economies of scale with my surname, which has been mis-spelt even by my own side on posters. One can achieve economies of scale by printing for several different constituencies and by other activities that were mentioned in relation to a general election, but one cannot get a thousandfold economy of scale from the £9,000 that can be spent in a general election in one constituency to the £100,000 that can be spent in a by-election.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for North Dorset will not mind if I pick him up on a few points. He said that I should remember that it was an upper limit. It would be an interesting concept if we were to build a lower limit into the Bill. Of course it is an upper limit, but that is precisely my point. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that it was fair enough to round it up, but that is Beaconsfield rounding up whereby £34,000 can be rounded up to £100,000. It is not my experience of rounding up. Perhaps I should have been a lawyer.
<P>
We have all been able to have fun at each other's expense on this and it is clear that the professionals in all parties win the argument. However, I raised a serious issue that should be in the public domain. I welcome the Minister's statement that it is a matter to which the Electoral Commission will be invited to return, and it is proper that it should do so. The essence of the argument has been put to the Committee. It has been discussed and if it is to be revisited on another occasion, perhaps with the benefit of slightly more detailed research, I would welcome it. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> As you can tell, Mr. Maxton, I am in Scrooge mode today. The amendment probes an issue relating to something that we have explored on a number of occasions. How should services that are donated be judged and valued? The amendment explores another dimension of that in relation to property, goods, services or facilities that are provided for the use of the candidate and what the lower exemption limit should be. Clearly that is connected to how donated goods and services will be valued and the links between the value that is attributed them and the exemption limit.
<P>
I shall not spend too long on the amendment as it was table some time ago and we have had several discussions on the issue that it raises. I simply want to draw the Minister's attention to the mass of difficulties that surround the valuation of property, goods, services and facilities. I have given some examples in the past and plenty of others could be adduced. In one sense it is arbitrary whether the exemption limit is higher or lower, but I wanted to see the point explored and developed in a separate part of the Bill and in relation to materials that are given to a candidate in particular, rather than the campaign in general.

The provision is based, as is much of the Bill, on the Representation of the People Act 1983, under section 73 of which the de minimis figure is set at £20. The view was that moving from £20 to £100 would allow significant leeway. It is a matter of judgment whether a figure of £100 or £200''-<P>

the figure in our amendment on that occasion-

which is what we are talking about. He concluded:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``I am inclined to stick with £100, but as I have said frequently, there are no magical right answers; it is a matter of judgment and, on balance, the judgment is right.''-[Official Report, Standing Committee G, 8 February 2000; c. 330.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We think that his judgment was right and that £100 is an appropriate figure. Things have moved on since the 1983 Act and £100 would seem a reasonable figure to use when dealing with expenses of candidates and those who provide their goods and services free of charge.
<P>
The figure should be changed from £20 to £100 for the sake of consistency. The argument was adequately made not only by us but by the Minister in our discussions on third party expenditure. The arguments are the same here. We are dealing with something that is not necessarily easy to identify or quantify: during an election campaign people provide their services free of charge, allow the use of their telephone or a room and give people a lift somewhere. It is reasonable to say that £20 in the year 2000 is too low a de minimis figure and that £100 would be a much more realistic limit, There may be arguments for making the limit more than £100, but I am conscious of the fact that the Minister has homed in on £100 after he and his colleagues made a judgment, albeit a subjective one. Therefore, I would stick with £100. I seriously suggest that the Minister should accept amendment No. 114.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Perhaps I shall run the risk of using more Beaconsfield anecdotes. My constituency seems to have been elevated to an example of a place where people put their hands into their pockets and produce £50 at the drop of a hat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> It was £50 that went into the Conservative party's pockets at the drop of a hat.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am happy to say that my constituency has one of the largest Conservative associations in the country and that it is very active. Apart from giving money to the Conservative party, many of my constituents dig deeply into their pockets for charitable causes. Although the political associations of the other parties are smaller, they are not necessarily underfunded because it is a wealthy area. I am not sure about the position of the Labour party, but several Liberal Democrat supporters are people of considerable substance. They are happy to assist their own candidate. Those associations are not starved of funds.
<P>
The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset have considerable force. It is difficult to consider such matters in abstract; concrete examples can be helpful. I shall use a straightforward example: a candidate is lent a car for the afternoon because his has broken down. The commercial value of the loan is likely to be more than £20, but less than £100. However, it would never cross the mind of the lender that he had become involved in the processes of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. The lender would probably think that he was simply doing a personal favour-I use the phrase in no pejorative sense-for someone who might be friend. If we agree with the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, I suspect that the Bill would cover that loan and that it would have to be declared.
<P>
It is the likely informality of such arrangements that causes me anxiety. I can imagine such things happening and it never crossing the candidate's mind, or that of the person who provided the benefit in kind, that they come within the declaration limits. The agent, who is likely to be responsible for making a return, may never hear about what has happened, but someone might see the candidate driving around in the car and say, ``You never declared it.''
<P>
I know that a line has to be drawn somewhere, but I am troubled about the £20 limit because it may be difficult to carry out sensible valuations using such a low figure, whereas £100 may be better. I do not want to open a door so big that it can be ruthlessly exploited-people will try to pass more expensive goods or services under the £100 limit. Another compromise figure might be better-perhaps £50-but whatever it is, it should be workable. Nowadays, £20 would not cover much. Acts that the donor regarded as innocent could cause the candidate to exceed the limit of declarable expenses and people might try to use the rules to their best advantage, not maliciously, to criticise a candidate and to overturn an election result. That is undesirable, which is why we should try to fix the limit at a reasonable level.
<P>
I should be glad to hear the Minister's view of what that level should be, particularly in the light of what my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset said in his earlier comments on £100-a sum that has featured elsewhere in our debates.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> One of the joys of this Committee is that we go from large issues to small, and from large sums to small. The previous group of amendments would have changed £100,000 to £75,000. Amendment No. 82, moved by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, would change £20 to £10. The difference is less than the cost of the Bill. I shall address most of my remarks to amendment No. 114, which has rather more substance to it, because I do not want to go back along the valuation path. I suspect that we shall return to that question later in the Bill's passage through Parliament.
<P>
I must tell the hon. Member for North Dorset that there is no magic in the de minimis figure of £20. He said that one of the joys of a Committee that sits for some weeks is that one's words come back to haunt one. He asked me why we had decided on £20 and suggested £100, a figure that is mentioned in clauses 84 and 85. He drew my attention to remarks that I had made about consistency between the Bill and the Representation of the People Act 1983. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to section 73 of the 1983 Act. It provides for the production of invoices for candidates or agents, and imposes a de minimis limit for donated and free material. That limit is £20, which is why we put that limit in the Bill. Another consideration was that we wanted to provide different limits for parties and candidates-£100 for a party and £20 for a candidate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Presumably, the £20 limit has been in place since the 1983 Act was introduced. I am sure that the Minister would agree that the value of money changed somewhat between 1983 and 2000. As we are engaged in altering the 1983 Act, might we not now reconsider those limits and put them on a footing that will not need to be revised for some time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman anticipates my next point. I was about to acknowledge that the figures in the 1983 Act have not been updated since 1985, and to suggest that the Electoral Commission might be asked to amend them by regulation. I was struck by the hon. Gentleman's example about the hire of a car for an afternoon. He made a fair point the strength of which was that we bear in mind such examples. If the hon. Member for North Dorset were minded to withdraw the amendment, we shall reconsider increasing the figure of £20.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> Given that, I am not sure why I am trying to be so helpful.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I must inform the Committee that there is a mistake on the selection list. Schedule 15 should have been discussed after clause 121. I hope that it will be convenient to discuss it now.
<H4><center>Schedule 15</center></H4>
<H4><center>CONTROL OF DONATIONS TO CANDIDATES:</center></H4>
NEW SCHEDULE 2A TO THE REPRESENTATION OF THE PEOPLE ACT 1983
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Fifteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> What I am about to say is almost a continuation of our previous discussion about whether certain expenses should be £20, £100 or £10. Paragraph 3(2) of the schedule deals with payments that are not to be regarded as donations and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There shall also be disregarded any donation whose value (determined in accordance with paragraph 4) is less than £50.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There is an element of inconsistency in the Bill. The figure of £50 is roughly between £20 and £100, but it does not relate to the £20 worth of expenditure to which we referred when debating clause 123. Election agents and others will be confused when deciding what should be included in election returns, how such items should be included and for what they will need invoices and receipts. The Minister will have to consider seriously the figure of £50.
<P>
Paragraph 3(1)(c) makes provision for:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any interest accruing to a candidate or his election agent in respect of any donation''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Generally, donations to an election campaign are small, but it is conceivable that they might be made at an early stage and that interest may accrue during the campaign if that money is not spent. That is a minor point, however, compared with my more important point about consistency and the fact that the figure of £50 flies in the face of our discussion on clause 123.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. I have a question about schedule 15. I believe that I know the answer, but I should be grateful for ministerial confirmation. Under schedule 15(3), a payment is not to be regarded as a donation when it is a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``provision by an individual of his own services which he provides voluntarily in his own time and free of charge''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Let us return to the example of the car. We debated earlier the circumstances in which someone lends me a car for the afternoon because my own car has broken down. There is another case in which someone says, ``Well, your car has broken down, but don't worry because I will drive you to your three afternoon meetings in my car.'' I think that that would be interpreted in terms of the services of the friend being free, but the car being declarable if in excess of £20. I hope that the Minister will forgive me for making the point again, but that is another illustration of the importance of making the de minimis rule reasonable. In that example, I doubt whether it would cross anyone's mind that they were incurring election expenses that should be declared.
<P>
I hesitate to return to the first set of amendments that were debated this morning. The provisions are detailed and desirable, but none of them will apply to local elections in Scotland, as they are not linked in with previous clauses. I must reiterate to the Minister that I anticipate problems unless there is rapid convergence between what happens north and south of the border. I fully acknowledge that these are devolved matters, but I must point out the curiosity that we are legislating for many issues north of the border, but not for Scottish local elections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> On this occasion I rise to support the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, which may be a surprise in today's context. It is common for a car to be used to drive a candidate around a constituency. I guess that in the past when election returns were compiled, it was viewed in terms of the net use of petrol. There is a paradox in that when a supporter drives 20 miles to deliver a pile of leaflets, the cost of the transport does not appear, but when the candidate drives a car, it does. We may need to examine the issues more closely to clarify the implications.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Members for Beaconsfield and for Hazel Grove. The hon. Gentlemen are correct that the services-personal services, dare I call them-of the driver are free, but that the hire of a car has to be reflected in the expenditure. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove raised the issue of whether that is reflected now in the returns. It is important that the Bill provides for expenditure to be added up in a fair and proper way.
<P>
Let me turn to the question of Scotland. I acknowledge, as does the Scottish Executive, the need for legislation to deal with Scotland. As I said to the hon. Member for Beaconsfield earlier, the Scottish Executive are minded to act. One of the consequences of devolution is that such questions as how and when they act is entirely a matter for them. The figures in paragraph (3) relate to donations, and £50 was chosen to reflect the fact that candidates have a lower expenses limit than parties. As I said, I will consider the proposed figure of £100 and will write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> Can the Minister assure the Committee that, in the interests of consistency, the limit for those who give their goods and services free or at a discount-which is, in effect, donation-will be identical to the limit on payments that are not to be regarded as donations, which is £50? The figure should be the same for both.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> There should be consistency in the Bill and I shall pick up that point. It must be the case-there is no argument about this-that services that party members give during election campaigning should be free.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If amounts up to £49 are not to be regarded as donations, what will happen when someone says, ``Right, I'll give you a donation of £49 and then you can hire the car from me for the afternoon.'' What should be declared in such a situation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> As I have said consistently in Committee, there is nothing magical about the figures. There will be a pattern of avoidance. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove has drawn our attention to the existence of people he calls professionals. People will consult the regulations, but the Bill is important in that it lays down a set of rules. It introduces transparency and the need for a declaration, which will, over time, affect the behaviour of political parties, candidates and agents. If the hon. Member is asking me why the figure of £49 has been set-rather than £49.50 or £50-he knows the answer to that as well as I do.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 15 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 124</center></H4>
<H4><center>Meaning of ``candidate''</center></H4>
1983 c. 2
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 116, in page 77, line 41, leave out from `election', to end of line 45.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 117, in page 77, line 48, leave out from `election' to end of line 2 on page 78.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> We return to clause 124; I apologise for having moved away from it to look at schedule 15. The clause raises an interesting question about the changes we are making to the Representation of the People Act 1983 in terms of when someone becomes a candidate. I emphasise to the Minister that this is a probing amendment. I would like us to think through the consequences of what we are doing so that we are certain that we are creating a fair system.
<P>
As I understand the way things worked in the past, expenses were previously counted as election expenses from the time someone's nomination papers had been handed in. Expenses can run from the time that someone is declared a candidate on or after the date of issue of the writ for election. That could give rise to some interesting anomalies. With some hesitation, I return to the circumstances in which I was elected to Parliament at the last general election. As I was elected so late-[laughter.]-I apologise, selected so late­although I was also elected rather late, because the count was the slowest that I have ever attended. It was about 5.45 am before the declaration was made, and it had been expected at 1 o'clock in the morning. That was the consequence of holding county council elections on the same day as the general election, which caused chaos for the people counting the votes.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
To return to selection, I was selected rather a long way into the election campaign, and I am fairly certain that the association had incurred previous expenses in the belief that someone else would stand. That can happen. A candidate might die or be forced to withdraw at the last minute. Such circumstances raise an interesting question about the rights of individual candidates, as opposed to those of political parties. I cannot be considered to have started my period as a candidate until I have been selected and have declared myself. On the other hand, the political party that backs me may have started the campaign sometime earlier, in the belief that it was backing someone else as the candidate. In such circumstances, how would aggregate election expenses be calculated? There may be a simple answer that I have not understood on reading the clause, but I am slightly uncertain.
<P>
The clause raises an interesting question about candidates who are nominally independent, but may in practice be linked. Will their status be different? Will one candidate be able to incur great expense, only to drop out and let someone else take over? How will the Electoral Commission decide whether there is a continuity of expenditure in relation to a political party or individuals? I realise that that point may seem slightly abstruse, but as such circumstances arose in my constituency, and as I can imagine them occasionally arising in others, too, I should be grateful to discover the possible implications of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises some important issues, and I hope that I can satisfy him. The clause amends the definition of a candidate that appears in section 118 of the 1983 Act. As he acknowledged, the definition of a candidate is relevant in determining the date on which restrictions on election expenses apply. The revised definitions make two substantive changes, both for the better.
<P>
In section 118(a) of the 1983 Act, a distinction is drawn between candidates and someone
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who is elected to serve in Parliament at the election''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A distinction is therefore drawn between all candidates and the one who is elected. The clause gets rid of that distinction. It also brings some certainty to the position of local government candidates. In the past it has not been clear when a local government candidate's election expenditure starts.
<P>
The second change is that the definition of a local candidate now includes a starting time for that person's candidature, which is the last day for the publication of the notice of election, that is, 25 working days before the date of the election. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is important that there is clarity on that. It is one of the issues on which the recent trial of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Mrs. Jones) focused. If the hon. Gentleman read the transcript of that trial, he would see that the judge commented on the lack of precision regarding when election expenses start.

<P>

<B>Mr. Linton:</B> Would it assist my hon. Friend to recall our debate on the integration of national and local limits? Candidates can have a real problem in not knowing when their candidacy starts and perhaps inadvertently forgetting to use the word ``prospective''. If we combined the 12p per voter limit on candidates' expenditure with the 35p per voter limit that is proposed as a national spending limit to make a limit of 47p, which would be the expenditure for the promotion of both candidates and political parties, all the complexities in respect of candidates and parties would disappear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am not sure whether that is as helpful a suggestion as it might first appear. When we discussed it earlier, I drew a distinction between building on what we had and adding a new, parallel structure. My view was, and remains, that in the interests of handling elections now and in the immediate future, the two parallel processes should continue. If, however, my hon. Friend looks back at the record, he will see that I did not rule out the prospect of the two systems coming together at some point in the future. As he said, there are clear advantages in such an approach. The Commission will want to do some more work on that and talk to the political parties.
<P>
In essence, the hon. Member for Beaconsfield was asking for what this part of the Bill is designed to achieve: precision about when someone becomes a candidate. As I said, that issue came up in the trial of my hon. Friend the Member for Newark. If we accepted the amendments, which would have the same effect in respect of parliamentary and the local government candidates, it would be possible for a political party to have chosen its candidate and for the election to have started before the closing date for nominations. If we accepted the amendments, then conceptually and in practice it would be possible for the candidate and the party to spend substantial sums before the nomination papers went to the returning officer. Clause 124 defines more precisely when election expenses should start. The only substantive change in the wording between section 118 of the 1983 Act and this part of the Bill is that the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``who is elected to serve in Parliament''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are taken out. There seems to be no logical reason why a distinction should be drawn between successful and unsuccessful candidates. The issue here is to define more closely when the clock starts ticking. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I accept that my comments probably reflect a previous lack of knowledge of the 1983 Act more than they represent the amendment.
<P>
I will make my position clear. I am not at all concerned about the fact that the time from which expenses run is being clarified. I have read the transcript of the judgment in the case of the hon. Member for Newark. I could see that there was a grey area in her case; so grey, in fact, that she was-properly-subsequently exonerated in the Court of Appeal. I have no dispute with that, and therefore no dispute with any attempt to tighten the rules.
<P>
What struck me as unusual in the clause, although it may simply replicate what was in the 1983 Act, was the question of the candidate's nomination date. Clearly, when nominations close nobody else can be put on to the list of candidates. Prior to that, a particular political party may have a candidate that everybody has proclaimed as candidate, and whose campaign may already have incurred some expenditure. Much of that money may in reality have been spent on promoting the party as much as the individual candidate in that constituency. Although the candidate's name may appear on it, the promotional material may also have general political content. If the candidate suddenly backs out for some reason, and a new candidate is selected, will the sum available start again for that person?
<P>
Few political parties would want to take advantage of such a situation to spend more by having one candidate until the date before the close of nominations and then deliberately introducing another. Most parties would find that problematic. I would like to know how the system would work, although I dare say that it was provided for under the 1983 Act, and I apologise if I have touched on a matter that someone should probably have touched on in 1983.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> The point that the hon. Gentleman makes is correct. The only way in which it would be advantageous to have a succession of candidates would be, to use the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea earlier, to call them all ``Evans''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I agree with the Minister, and I see that that might be regarded as highly ingenious. However, it is certainly not my purpose to follow the methods of someone who was, I believe, the last independent member for the university of Oxford. In his book about misleading cases, which I commend to the Minister for his bedtime reading, he came up with all sorts of ingenious ways by which the law could be circumvented. He writes, for example, about how to make a return to the Inland Revenue by dropping a bottle over Hammersmith bridge and floating it down on the tide. There are a whole series of extremely interesting examples of how the law may be complied with in ways not intended by those who drafted the legislation. However, I am now much better informed, and also grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Corrupt and illegal practices: consequences for persons convicted of such practices</center></H4>
<P>
Question, proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am concerned by the clause, which seeks to tidy up-indeed is more precise than-section 173 of the 1983 Act, taking up nearly two pages, compared with the one third of a page that it takes up in the original Act.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
What concerns me is what is not included in the clause. It lists the incapacities on conviction for corrupt or illegal practices, and states that a person convicted
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``shall, during the relevant period . . . be incapable of<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) being registered as an elector or voting at any parliamentary election in the United Kingdom or any local government election in Great Britain''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What happens at an Assembly election in Wales, a European Parliament election or a local government election in Northern Ireland? I shall come to that in a moment. It then states that such a person shall be incapable of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(ii) being elected to the House of Commons, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (iii) holding any elective office''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, it makes no reference to other bodies such as the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly or the European Parliament? Are we suggesting that it is perfectly okay for someone who has been convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice to stand for election to those bodies? The 1983 Act was passed long before we decided to have devolved assemblies in Wales and Northern Ireland and a devolved Parliament in Scotland. Interestingly,-there were elections to the European Parliament at that time. However, the section of the RPA that we are amending makes no reference to any other bodies.
<P>
What is even more disturbing is what is contained of section 173(8) which relates to Northern Ireland and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Without prejudice to the generality of section 205(2) below, nothing in this section affects matters relating to the Northern Ireland Assembly or local elections or holding office in Northern Ireland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So, it is perfectly okay for a person who has been convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice in Northern Ireland or elsewhere to stand for the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is clearly considered reasonable that someone might have been convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice in Northern Ireland and still want to stand. Some years ago, the motto of one Northern Ireland party-I cannot remember which and it would be defamatory to suggest something that is purely anecdotal and hearsay-after a visit to the graveyards to look at the recently-erected tombstones, was said to be ``Vote early and vote often''. That does give me some concern. We said earlier that all sorts of exemptions from provisions in the legislation would have to be sought in connection with Northern Ireland, and this amendment to the Representation of the People Act would be included.
<P>
Clause 125(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The amendment made by subsection (1) does not have effect in relation to persons convicted or corrupt or illegal practices at local governmental elections in Scotland''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We discussed Scotland earlier and the Minister told us what the Scottish Executive might be minded to do. However, it is incredible that we should embody in legislation that the provision has no effect in relation to persons convicted of corrupt or illegal practices at local government elections in Scotland. A person could be convicted of a corrupt or illegal practice at a local government election in Scotland and then stand as a candidate for the House of Commons in England, which seems totally illogical.
<P>
The clause is disturbing. Had I been more alert, I might have tabled several amendments. Will the Parliamentary Secretary consider bringing the clause up to date so that, in relation to the Representation of the People Act 1983, it applies to elections to the House of Commons, the European Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly-the latter being specifically excluded from the clause?
<P>
Will the subsections be renumbered, as the current numbering contains an error, albeit typographical? Will the Parliamentary Secretary re-examine the exemption for Northern Ireland and the glaring exemption concerning someone who has been convicted of an offence in Scotland being allowed to stand for election in England?

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I do not to want to repeat what my hon. Friend was saying. The issue is serious and likely to be revisited in future if not resolved satisfactorily in Committee. It is very strange that Northern Ireland is exempted from the provisions. Why is that? I may have to slip away in five minutes, so I may not hear what the Parliamentary Secretary says and will have to read the transcript later, I apologise. No discourtesy is intended: I merely have to be absent for a period.

The provision is odd. What justification does it have, other than the suspicions voiced by my hon. Friend the Member for North Dorset? The House is failing in its duty if it facilitates a clause which is intended to recognise that an awful lot of people in Northern Ireland convicted of corrupt practices should be allowed to stand. I find the matter incomprehensible, although there may be some technical reason for it. It is difficult to see what that is, in view of the general purpose of the Bill.
<P>
Additionally, from a Scottish point of view, the effect is odd. The provision may have been included for the reasons that we touched on earlier concerning a different regime for Scotland. However, in such circumstances, it is peculiar that people who have been convicted in Scotland can stand with impunity and not suffer consequences if they come south of the border. Will the Parliamentary Secretary clarify that? If he cannot provide reassurance, I am sure that the matter will be revisited later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> This is a serious issue. First, let me tackle the not-so-serious matter of the two subsections (8). Of course, that will be amended and I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Dorset for improving the Bill yet again.
<P>
The clause has a clear purpose. The trial of the hon. Member for Newark demonstrated the need for a provision allowing a chance for appeal after conviction. The hon. Gentleman did not dispute the purpose of the clause, but objected to what is not in the clause. Sins of omission, rather than commission, are involved. The 1983 Act deals only with parliamentary and local government elections in Great Britain. Disqualification from the Scottish Parliament is dealt with by subordinate legislation under the Scotland Act 1998, and I understand that similar provisions apply to the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly. The hon. Gentleman asked me to consider those matters again. I confess that I have not diligently read the Scotland Act 1998, the subordinate Welsh legislation or the Northern Ireland legislation. None the less, the hon. Gentleman has raised important points that I will not dismiss. I understand that the technicality is covered in subordinate legislation. I will examine it and write to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. However, what disturbs me is that although the Bill's main purpose is to give some muscle to the Electoral Commission, which we will charge with various tasks, we are being referred to other legislation. If we simply want to tidy up the Representation of the People Act 1983, let us tidy it up and put it all in one pot, so that people can find all rules easily. It is a great mistake to have separate rules relating to disqualifications or incapacities as a result of an offence under the Government of Wales Act 1998, or even subordinate legislation arising from that Act, or under the Scotland Act. If we want fair and transparent elections, we must play by a set of rules that people can find easily and simply, and to which the Electoral Commission can point and say, ``That's what we're using.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am not dismissing the hon. Gentleman's points out of hand. I told him in a straightforward way that I would go and read the subordinate legislation. I confessed that I did not read it last night, and I cannot remember when I last read it. We are often criticised for introducing too much legislation. If provisions elsewhere can do the job, that may be satisfactory. As I said, I will re-read the subordinate legislation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Beaconsfield made a point about the position on disqualification in Scotland. The Bill is amending legislation. Under the existing legislation, a person disqualified in Scotland cannot stand, and that will remain the case unless the Scottish Parliament decides otherwise. The balance of views in that Parliament suggests that the position will not be altered.
<P>
I hope that that explains the situation, apart from the issues of the Welsh Assembly and of bringing the material together, about which I shall write to the hon. Member for North Dorset.
<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> If, for some reason, the Scottish Parliament took a different view-which it is fully entitled to do-would the Minister agree that to protect our position, we would be entitled to review the matter to ensure that disqualification would apply here, even if it did not apply north of the border?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> That would of course be the case. The issue of devolution is very live and at the top of many hon. Members' minds as we speak.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Question proposed, That this schedule be the Sixteenth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I merely seek information from the Minister on schedule 16 and the amendments relating to election petitions. Paragraph 13 says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `elective office' means any office to which a local government election is held in England or Wales''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister reassure me that there is similar provision in Scottish and Northern Ireland legislation, so that we have consistency?
<P>
I also seek guidance on why paragraph 13(b) exists. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the definition of `public office' shall be omitted.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hasten to add that I am not sure how ``public office'' was defined in the original legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I am not in a position to give much guidance today. When the Bill went out to consultation, there was a view that one should get rid of election petitions as part of the modernisation process. However, there was no consensus on that. Schedule 16 seeks to tidy up the situation, although I fear that it may not have done enough tidying up. If the hon. Gentleman will permit me, I will write to him and to other members of the Committee on the points that he made.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<B>Dr. Julian Lewis </B>(New Forest, East) I beg to move amendment No. 18, in page 158, line 43, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`8A-(1) Section 106 (false statements as to candidates) shall be amended as follows.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
(2) In subsection (1) after the words ``character or conduct'' there shall be inserted the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or fails to take reasonable steps to withdraw from circulation and public availability a false statement previously made or published''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
(3) After subsection (1) there shall be inserted-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(1A) `For the avoidance of doubt, a person who makes or publishes a statement on the Internet or by other electronic means, or who causes a statement to be so made or published, makes or publishes a statement for the purposes of this subsection; and a person who fails to remove or cause the removal of a statement from the Internet shall be regarded as having failed, for the purposes of this subsection, to take reasonable steps to withdraw that statement from circulation and public availability'.''.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I declare a direct interest in the matter as a result of my experience of being seriously libelled on the internet by someone who intended to damage my prospects of re-election at the general election.
<P>
Part of the Bill's purview is the conduct of elections in the 21st century, and the Bill must take modern technology into account. The internet is as big a revolution in communications as was the invention of the television. Anyone can, for a negligible outlay, become a broadcaster to the entire world. In talking about the problem, I have sometimes used the analogy of the drunken down-and-out whom one occasionally encounters in the street and who yells obscenities and profanities at innocent passers-by. The internet allows such obscenities and calumnies to be yelled out into cyberspace and to be accessed by anybody in the entire world.
<P>
What makes matters even worse is that one of the strengths of the internet when it is properly used-the search engine-adds immensely to its potency when it is abused. When one types, in all innocence, a candidate's name in the box provided on the search engine, one is unwittingly led to legitimate and illegitimate sites that mention the candidate. That can mean, for example, that sixth formers who wish to discover something about the people standing for election in their constituency and who search, in good faith, for the candidate's name, will unwitting be led to sites that breach section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and that damage the candidate's prospects of election by deliberately lying about him or her. It is not a question of someone going out of his way to seek out a scurrilous publication and find out something nasty about one of its victims; this intrudes on people who genuinely search for bona fide information about candidates and dumps this filth in their laps.
<P>
I have expressed a hope to move such an amendment in two previous Second Reading debates-not only on this Bill, but on the Representation of the People Bill, on 30 November 1999, when I set out in some detail what had happened. I do not, therefore, propose to go over all that again. At that time, I received guidance, which I greatly appreciated, from the Government and from officers of the House of Commons as to which of the two Bills it would be better to amend, and, eventually, it was decided that this was the appropriate Bill and that this was the appropriate schedule.
<P>
At almost every stage, I have received sympathy, support and encouragement from all parts of the House, including, in particular, from Labour Members, such as the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche) and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) in their ministerial capacities. I hope that their kind appreciation of the problem will lead to their support for a solution, in the form of the Government accepting the amendment, or undertaking to table a similar amendment at a suitable stage later in the proceedings. I am particularly obliged to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, who has kindly agreed to table the amendment jointly with me. The hon. Gentleman has suffered abuse via the internet during his political career, and I know that he feels as strongly as I do on the subject.
<P>
Section 106(1) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``A person who, or any director of any body or association corporate which-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) before or during an election,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>makes or publishes any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct shall be guilty of an illegal practice, unless he can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing, and did believe, the statement to be true.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It can be seen from that that the requirements for a conviction of the criminal offence laid down are very high. In particular, the prosecution must show that the defendant deliberately lied about the candidate. It is not enough to show that what he said was wrong. The prosecution must also show that the defendant had no reasonable cause honestly to believe that what he said might be true. The prosecution must also show that the defendant published the lies about the candidate to damage the candidate's prospects of being elected.
<P>
Concern has been expressed in official quarters about the danger that the amendment may catch secondary publishers, such as printers, distributors or internet service providers. That is absolutely incorrect, because it would also have to be shown, under section 106(1), that they, too, knew that they were disseminating lies, and, nevertheless, decided to do so to damage the candidate's vote. The amendment would, therefore, not normally bring an internet service provider or other secondary publisher into the realm of the criminal law embodied in the Representation of the People Act 1983.
<P>
The loophole that the amendment is designed to close was exposed by my case against the editor of the now defunct Scallywag magazine, which was then put on the internet. The magazine had been forced to close, as a result of successful libel actions that I had taken against its printers, six distributors and two sample retailers in 1995. By 1997, it existed only as one man and a website. That man uploaded scurrilous lies about me on to the internet, and was duly convicted of seven offences under section 106, after a four-day trial in 1998.
<P>
Essentially, the lies concerned a claim that I was a secret and promiscuous homosexual, and that I had used women from escort agencies to accompany me to a parliamentary selection contest when I was trying to get selected to stand as a parliamentary candidate. To show that what was said was fantasy, I shall give just one quote, which might lighten the atmosphere a little. It is from a message posted on the internet by the individual who was running the Scallywag website at a time when he was threatening to stand against me as a candidate in the election. He admitted that he would not get in, but, he said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``he could just create enough diversion and mayhem to help keep Lewis out.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He went on to say,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Because there are likely to be so few Conservatives in the next parliament, it is highly likely that Lewis will get an important political appointment if he gets in. That will line him up for a cabinet position if the Tories ever get back into power.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Laughter.] I laughed about that as well. What he went on to say is relevant to the requirement to show that the intention was to damage my vote. The sentence on the internet in capital letters was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``HE HAS TO BE DISCREDITED BEFORE HE IS GIVEN REAL POWER.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Then it said,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If you want to help discredit him, please donate to the Scallywag fighting fund.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
After the election was over, in June 1997, again showing the intention behind this campaign, an edition of the internet Scallywag asked the question,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Did Scallywag have anything . . . to do with the election result?''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although the answer to that question began
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is virtually impossible to say''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it went on to note,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Many of our own stories came back to us in rumour and gossip, sometimes from the most unlikely of sources. We managed at least to spread some seeds of doubt.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
People with the acuity of hon. Members present will not need me to point out that that amounted to an admission that these stories were made up, because otherwise when they came back there would have been no reason for the perpetrator and inventor of them to have supposed that they came from him rather than from some objective factual source in the real world.
<P>
During the four-day trial under section 106, the lawyer who represented the editor of the Scallywag website did not produce a single witness to back up his client's outrageous claims. The lawyer also admitted, on the last day of the trial, that there was, and I quote, ``no evidence'' for any of the allegations made about my sexuality. However, the lawyer sought to claim that his client was not responsible for the website because he did not physically upload the material himself.
<P>
Amendment No. 18 makes it clear that if someone writes such material and does nothing to prevent it from being published on a website, he cannot seek to escape responsibility just because somebody else physically processed the data for publication on the website. In June 1999, the seven criminal convictions of this man were overturned on a legal technicality relating to section 106. The judge held that the material could not be said under the existing state of the law to have been ``published'' on the website during the election campaign-I emphasise that point-as required by the 1983 Act. That was because the material had been uploaded prior to the start of the election campaign. Crucially, the judge held that the material remaining on a website during an election campaign-even if it could be shown to be lies and intended to damage the candidate's vote could not be regarded as constituting an act of publication during the vital period of the election. That was the judgment despite the fact that someone must have paid for the site to stay open during the campaign.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The judge was quoted verbatim in the legal report of Press Association News as saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Failure of the defendant to act to shut down the site cannot be properly described as publication in the context of this Act.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware that our decision means that there is a situation which is unsatisfactory if Section 106 (of the Act) is to continue to be effective legislation.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are not entitled to remedy any defect the wording of the section may have in the light of more modern conditions.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the nub of the amendment. We are trying to clean up conditions that have developed from new technology so that section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 is restored to efficacy for elections in the 21st century.
<P>
The amendment is meant to show, first, that the author of material posted on a website remains responsible for it even if he did not upload that material; secondly, that uploading material on to a website counts as publication of it, which is already the case but the amendment would clarify that beyond doubt; and thirdly, that continuing to keep such material on a website amounts to a continuing process of republication for the purposes of the 1983 Act. Uploading lies on to the internet to damage a candidate's vote probably amounts to an act of publication already. The amendment simply closes the loophole whereby a defendant can successfully claim that because the material was uploaded before the start of the election campaign, its continuing to remain on the internet does not amount to publication.
<P>
It has been suggested that at least one case in the High Court shows that the result of my case could have gone the other way. Having consulted the barrister who brought the prosecution for the Crown Prosecution Service against the man who libelled me, I suggest that that case is not adequate to fulfil the purposes of section 106 of the 1983 Act.
<P>
The amendment in no way criminalises the activities of internet service providers beyond the confines of section 106. It merely clarifies the responsibilities of the authors of lies and the meaning of ``publication'', and closes the loophole by which the spirit of section 106 would be frustrated through people posting lies on the internet before the formal opening of the election campaign. In my court case, the judge admitted that the verdict showed that in ``modern conditions'', section 106 might have been rendered ineffective at protecting candidates from lies about their character and conduct. The amendment would restore section 106 as a piece of effective legislation

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Miller:</B> On the face of it, it seems an unholy alliance that the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) and I should work together. He is right to say that I have suffered a certain amount of abuse-usually delivered by my hon. Friends in the Whips Office when I speak at times when they do not want me to.
<P>
In all seriousness, we should examine with care the principle that the hon. Gentleman raises. To show that this alliance-I say this for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)-does not go too far, I say that if the hon. Member for New Forest, East used the photograph that he used in the parliamentary IT briefing in describing the case that has just been published, he would probably be in breach of section 106 because it does not portray the same character that I see here. Perhaps it is merely the age of the photograph.
<P>
The core of the matter, as the hon. Gentleman said, is that we should not try to constrain the role of internet service providers-ISPs-for two separate reasons. First, if we impose unworkable constraints on them, it would slow down Britain's strong role in the development of electronic commerce. I am sure that that would cause concern to my hon. Friends in the Department of Trade and Industry and their Opposition shadow spokesmen. Secondly, ISPs need to be thought of in the same way as the Post Office: they are deliverers of mail. The Post Office Act 1969 lays down that it is a postal worker's duty to deliver mail from the sender to the receiver without knowledge of the contents. One problem is that with an absurd 10 billion pages on the internet, it would be extremely difficult to put a prior requirement on an ISP to vet every page uploaded by providers. That would be an almost impracticable operation and extremely damaging to Britain's role in e-commerce.
<P>
If a postman discovers that package that has come open contains material that is obscene or a dangerous weapon that should not be sent through the post, the Post Office has a duty to act. It seems sensible to bring ISPs within this area, so that when something is brought to their attention as breaching a statute, they are required to take reasonable action. The use generally of the term ``publication'' in a number of statutes needs to be more firmly defined. We need to make it clear that the word-at our previous sitting we discussed the word ``imprints''-also means electronic publication.
<P>
Let me illustrate a point from personal experience, close to that of the hon. Member for New Forest, East. I was the subject of a defamatory statement delivered on the internet by a Texan lawyer who, I discovered, did not have a great deal of money, which-the academic exercise apart-made suing him a waste of effort and would have diverted me from the campaign in which I was engaged. This happened, not during an election period, but during a campaign which I shall describe. Had it happened at election time it would be easy to appreciate the strength of the hon. Gentleman's argument. It happened while I was dealing with the well-publicised Louise Woodward case, which was conducted electronically. Hon. Members would be terrified if it ever happened to them because it resulted in me handling a quarter of a million e-mails. That puts a strain on the resources of parliamentarians with our meagre office costs allowance-simply an aside, but no doubt it meets with universal approval from hon. Members, including you, Mrs. Michie.
<P>
The importance of the web in that campaign in raising awareness of a gross injustice was critically important. We used it to raise funds for the defence case and public awareness of the issue, and to gather expert evidence from all over the world on the difficult subject of injuries to young children. For reasons that have yet to be explained, I was accused by a Texan lawyer of participating only for financial gain. That was a clear-cut, unambiguous libel. My bank manager could easily have demonstrated that my participation cost money because the e-mails could not be funded out of the office costs allowance and I also gave a substantial personal donation to the fund. I shall go no further on that subject because there are some issues that are still sub judice, on which the High Court will rule-in the right way, I am sure-in June or July this year. The accusation was that I was in it for money. During an election period, the instant spreading of such a libel would be extremely damaging and impossible to stop under the terms of current legislation. On the principle that mud sticks, I cannot envisage any legislation that would stop that.
<P>
The only way to deal with such material is to make it crystal clear in appropriate legislation that there are circumstances in which ISPs have to act instantly and that those involved will pay dearly. I share the hon. Gentleman's disappointment at the way in which his case was treated because of the narrow argument about publication, and I am aware that there are other relevant court cases. There can be no doubt in the mind of members of the Committee that in discussing the Bill we mean publication in its fullest sense, including a piece of paper that I stick through someone's door, a poster in my garden, a letter that I send to an individual as distinct from a group of people, an e-mail that I send to an individual or to a group and the content of any website through which I seek to gain the support of the electorate.
<P>
If we put responsibility on ourselves as candidates, surely it is only fair to protect candidates from abuses by third parties not covered in the Bill who seek to defame them. 
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All sorts of difficulties surround such matters. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the strength of some search engines. I discussed them with a couple of colleagues the other day. The hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) asked which search engine I used. I sometimes use Alta Vista. I also use Metacrawler, which is freely available and has the power to cross-reference 10 or 12 other search engines; it is an immensely powerful tool. Therefore, even putting constraints on the proprietors of search engines would be inadequate. At the press of a button, using an intuitive search name, such as that of any member of the Committee, one can instantly find every publication that includes the surname, and there are billions of pages. In my case, there happen to be several notorious Andrew Millers. A couple of academics, a local councillor in Warrington and a big website in the United State all share my name. That presents other problems, some of which the Government must consider, given the developments in such technology.
<P>
In the defamation case to which the hon. Gentleman referred, the judge was clearly concerned that there had been a deliberate attempt to distort the electorate's views by dishonest means. We must ensure that a protective mechanism exists. The balance must be right: it has to protect candidates, but it must not inhibit reasonable statements made in the spirit of our principles of free speech, nor undermine the role of ISPs, given their important function as vehicles for electronic commerce.
<P>
I urge my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the principle of the amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman is clearly embodied in appropriate legislation, either in the Bill or subsequently. The Government must make it absolutely clear that publication includes not only paper documents but web and e-mail presentations so that no ambiguity can arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I am intrigued by the amendment, and I shall be intrigued by the Parliamentary Secretary's response to it. It deals with an important matter that has not been covered in previous legislation. Those who publish information or make statements on the internet are not necessarily covered by other legislation or other control mechanisms, particularly if they themselves are neither candidates, registered political parties, recognised third parties or permitted participants in a referendum campaign, nor what one might describe as recognised and reputable publishers-those who publish our newspapers and magazines, for example who-would be covered by other legislation.
<P>
I have not had the misfortune of my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East, although I found my name on a website that was produced by a Mr. Gadd. He had got hold of a copy of the Conservative party's candidates list as well as a list of Conservative Members of Parliament and had ranked everyone in terms of whether they were what he described as Europhile or Eurosceptic. I do not know why he did that; he may have had some mischievous purpose.
<P>
<B>Mr. Miller:</B> The hon. Gentleman ought be aware that every single one of us appears on at least one website, although many of us are on considerably more. In preparation for an important debate about the House of Commons Commission, I happen to have with me details of the BBC website, on which we all appear. It describes the qualities of the right hon. Member for Fareham (Sir P. Lloyd) and the reasons why he should remain on the Commission. Every one of us appears on websites, but some of the information is less than 100 per cent. accurate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I was about to say that, based on the information to which I referred which was not always correct, the Democracy Movement, which was mentioned earlier, drew up its campaign and dispatched picture postcards to the constituents of some of the hon. Members who had been incorrectly described, thereby compounding the felony of the misinformation on the website. I did not challenge what was written because I saw what had happened to others who had. If one sent an e-mail, a letter or a solicitor's letter to Mr. Gadd, he published that and then published his response, and any ensuing responses. There was then what one might describe as a surfers' jury deciding who was right as regards the description-the accused Member of Parliament or Conservative candidate, or Mr. Gadd.
<P>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for tabling the amendment and I hope that the Minister will look on it, if not favourably, then constructively. It is an enormous subject. We as Members of Parliament, those who would be candidates and our own party workers are vulnerable to this new medium. It appears to many to be uncontrolled and it is difficult to seek redress, if one is misrepresented there.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tipping:</B> I should tell the hon. Gentleman and, more particularly, the hon. Member for New Forest, East, that I will not be in the Committee this afternoon, so I will not have an opportunity to respond to their remarks. However, I shall ensure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), who has taken a close personal interest in this matter, is aware of this morning's discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Walter:</B> I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his intervention. I do not intend to go on for much longer, but I just want to emphasise the importance of the amendment.
<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, THE CHAIRMAN adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.

Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock.
