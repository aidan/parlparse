<B>The Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning (Mr. Richard Caborn):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 126, in page 10, line 23, leave out subsection (3) and insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(3) A person may only exercise a right under this section to enter any land if at least 28 days’ notice of the intended entry was given to every owner or occupier of the land.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(3A) A notice under subsection (3) shall—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) state the purpose for which entry is required, and<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) inform the person to whom it is given of his rights under this section.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take Government amendments Nos. 127,  128 and 129.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am sure that all members of the Committee will join me in wishing many happy returns to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, whose birthday it is today. I am sure that the champagne will be flowing tonight.<P>
Clause 21 relates to regional development agencies’ rights of entry on to land for the purposes of surveying it, or of estimating its value, in connection with the acquisition of land or the payment of compensation in respect of acquisition. The right to survey land also includes the power to search, bore and remove soil samples.<P>
The provision in the Bill was based on the existing English Partnerships legislation. However, we believe that that can be improved. The earlier legislation did not contain provision for notifying the occupier of the reason for seeking entry. In the interests of greater oppenness—to which we are committed, as all members of the Committee will know—we propose in amendment No. 126 that the reason for entry be included in the notice. However, that would not protect the rights of owners as opposed to occupiers of land, so they too have been included in the requirement to notify the reason for entry. New subsection (3A) (b) requires the notification to explain to the owners and occupiers their rights under the clause, which include the right to compensation where land is damaged.<P>
Subsection (5) as drafted requires that notification of the intention to search, bore and take samples of land be given only to the occupiers of land. Amendment No. 127 requires that notification to search, bore and take samples be given to both owners and occupiers in the case of all land. That will make the provision more equitable.<P>
Amendment No. 128 is a technical improvement to the drafting of subsection (5), and amendment No. 129 adds a definition of “owner” to the clause, using the definition contained in the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. Essentially, the owner is considered to be the freeholder or the leaseholder if he has a minimum of three years left on his lease.<P>
Amendment No. 126 will make the rights of entry fairer to owners of land and their purpose more open.<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Yeo </B>(South Suffolk): I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the amendments,which appear to be of a somewhat technical nature. I shall not delay the Committee by examining them.<P>
Amendment agreed to.<P>
Amendments made: No. 127, in page 10, line 29, leave out<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘In the case of land which is occupied,’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
No. 128, in page 10, line 31, leave out ‘required by’ and insert ‘under’.<P>
No. 129, in page 11, line 2, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(8A) In subsection (3), “owner” has the same meaning as in the Acquisition of Land Act 1981.’.—[Mr. Caborn.]<P>

<P>
<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I beg to move amendment No. 114, in page 36, line 14, after ‘extinguish’, insert ‘or divert’.<P>
I shall be brief because this is a simple amendment. Schedule 6 allows the Secretary of State to extinguish public rights of way and includes the qualifiers that permit that. The amendment would simply add “or divert” to allow greater flexibility so that rights of way could be extinguished or diverted. That would be more consistent with the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> May I express my great surprise that Liberal Democrat Members are in the Committee to move their amendment? That makes a change from last week and it is pleasing that they have been able to spare the time to look in on our proceedings. In case they have not troubled to read Hansard, I can assure them that their amendments are safe in our hands. If their amendments raise points of substance on which the Minister will have a detailed brief from his officials, I am here to step into their shoes and move the amendments.I have some sympathy with amendment No. 114. The Bill confines the Secretary of State’s powers on rights of way to extinguishing them and that seems unnecessarily restrictive. Anyone with experience of such controversies, which can rage heatedly in the countryside, knows that although rights of way are sometimes a problem in relation to developments, the problems can often be overcome by re-routing a right of way. It does not always have to be removed altogether.<P>
The procedure for extinguishing or diverting rights of way is excessively complicated and the arguments may continue not just for weeks or months but for years and can cause serious difficulty for property owners. It would be helpful if the Government, instead of pursuing the myth of a right to roam, devoted their attention and efforts to streamlining the procedure for diverting or extinguishing rights of way. That may be wide of the amendment, but I have sympathy with the aim of the amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): I rise to speak in a rare example of tripartite agreement on the amendment. As the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) said, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 is specific on the matter and it would be worth harmonising the legislation. As an occasional rambler and supporter of the local branch of the Ramblers Assocation, I know how time-consuming, costly and frustrating it can be to divert public rights of way. The amendment would give the Secretary of State greater flexibility, and it would be a worthwhile improvement.<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Clark </B>(Gillingham): We are delighted that the hon. Member for South Suffolk has confirmed that there is a new Tory-Liberal pact in which Liberal amendments are safe in Tory hands.<P>
I support the amendment and urge my hon. Friend the Minister to consider it. We are talking not just about pathways in the countryside but about pathways on the fringe or in urban areas. For example, in my constituency in Kent, the Saxon shore pathway, which is of great significance, is heavily used, but brown-field sites along it could be redeveloped. Without the amendment, that pathway could be extinguished. Bearing in mind the fact that our constituents want to enjoy walking on rights of way—an activity that fits in with better health policies—and that we are a people’s Government, we should consider the amendment in a good light.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I reiterate what the hon. Member for South Suffolk said—Liberal amendments are safe in his hands. Contrary to what was said over the weekend, the countryside is safe in the Government’s hands.<P>
I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for Gillingham (Mr. Clark) and for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor) on making powerful arguments. It is an important amendment. Commitments on access to the countryside were made in our manifesto. I have given serious consideration to what has been said in the debate and to representations made by the Countryside Commission.<P>
The Committee will not be surprised to hear me say that paragraphs 6 and 7 of schedule 6 for extinguishing public rights of way are the same as those put on the statute book by the previous Government and which were included in the legislation that established English Partnerships. I have to keep reminding members of the loyal Opposition that they put similar legislation on to the statute book. They are now desperately trying to change it and scramble out of it, as they did on Radio 4 this morning. But we are here, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham said, to represent the people of the nation, and that is why we take a positive view of legislation.<P>
Powers to extinguish rights of way will rest with the Secretary of State and not the RDAs, as would have been the case in draconian legislation introduced by the Conservatives. Proper provision is made for the publication of the relevant orders and for giving notice to the planning and highway authorities. There is also provision for objections to be made and for the Secretary of State to afford an objector the opportunity of appearing before and being heard by a person appointed for that purpose. There is a power to hold a public inquiry if necessary.<P>
I fully accept the point, however, that the Bill provides only for the extinguishing of the right of way rather than for its diversion. I do not believe that that makes the provision defective because it would always be open to an RDA to dedicate an alternative route as a public right of way. The Secretary of State could refuse to make an order extinguishing the original right of way until such a declaration had been made. Nevertheless, I accept that it would be more satisfactory to give the Secretary of State a power to divert the right of way.<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Many times during discussion of the Bill in Committee, the Government have been accused of intransigence and inflexibility in refusing to accept amendments. That refusal reflects the unworkability of the amendments, rather than the Government’s general attitude, as I have made clear on several occasions. Nevertheless, even I do not believe that the Government have a total monopoly on wisdom; when we recognise good ideas, we are prepared to consider them. This is such a case.<P>
However, taken alone, the amendment is not sufficient to achieve the desired objective. At the very least, a consequential amendment would need to be made to paragraph 6(3), to provide for the Secretary of State to serve notice on the highway authority in cases of diversions as well as of extinguishment.<P>
We also need to consider how to limit the power so that it applies to diversions only over land owned by the RDA, rather than over other people’s land. We must also consider whether an RDA should have a right to object to a diversion order, given that it might not be entirely to its benefit. In addition, we must examine whether we should include a power to require an RDA to pay for or to contribute towards the cost of that diversion.<P>
We shall give further thought to those points; if the hon. Member for Taunton (Mrs. Ballard) will agree to withdraw the amendment, I shall consider it further with the aim of introducing a suitable Government amendment later.<P>

<P>

<B>Mrs. Jackie Ballard </B>(Taunton): I think that I need smelling salts. Perhaps we should stay away from the Committee more often. The Minister obviously missed us so much that he is willing to throw us a small carrot this week to keep us coming.<P>
I am satisfied that the Minister believes that, although it would always be open to RDAs to designate another route, it would be more helpful to include in the Bill power for the Secretary of State to divert. As the hon. Member for South Suffolk said, footpaths and rights of way cause more controversy than most other matters affecting the countryside. I remember one meeting at which the director of the south-west government office for the region said that he had more public representations about proposals to divert footpaths than about almost anything else happening in the south-west. It excites the public interest.<P>
We have on record the Minister’s assurance that the only thing preventing him from accepting the amendment is the technical need for consequential amendments. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Clark:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. The problem of Opposition Members not being present in Committee has been mentioned by several hon. Members this morning and is recorded in column 343 of the Hansard report of our Thursday afternoon sitting. Will you give us some guidance about whether any action was taken to deal with the problem, as Mr. Benton implied that it would be?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I understand that there has been private correspondence between my co-Chairman, Mr. Benton, and some members of the Committee. Although that correspondence is private, I believe that the hon. Gentleman would be quite content with its contents were they to be known to him.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 11, line 27, after ‘(1),’ insert ‘subject to subsection (5) below’.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 139, in page 11, line 27, leave out ‘part of’ and insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘land of one or more of the descriptions mentioned in subsection (1A) in’.—<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
No. 132, in page 11, line 28, after ‘which’, insert ‘is an urban area and which’.<P>
No. 135, in page 11, line 29, leave out ‘or development’.<P>
No. 136, in page 11, line 29, at end insert—<P>

</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have now reached one of the key elements of the Bill and I hope that we can draw some encouragement from the fact that the Government have broken their duck by accepting the need for an amendment other than their own.<P>
Clause 24 causes as much anxiety outside the House as any aspect of the Bill. Together with clause 25, it makes a mockery of the Government’s claims that the Bill is about decentralising power and that they respect the role of democratically elected local authorities. Until the Minister admitted last Thursday morning—at col. 276 of Hanard—that his earlier assurances that the Bill gave RDAs no more powers than those already available to English Partnerships were wrong, I wondered whether he had actually read the Bill.<P>
Paragraph 9.2 on page 43 of the White Paper reads:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The intention is not to take powers or resources away from local authorities”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Unfortunately, the Bill makes it possible for the Secretary of State to take such powers. As we have heard previously, the Government also intend to take resources from local authorities to fund RDA operations. I shall oppose the principle of clause 24 in a later debate if the amendments are not accepted. I shall therefore confine myself now to speaking on the amendments that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) have tabled.<P>
The seven amendments can be considered in four groups. The first contains the crucial amendment No. 135. Clause 24 (1) allows the Secretary of State to issue a designation order in respect of land that is <P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“suitable for regeneration or development.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Amendment No. 135 would omit “or development”. My concern about designation orders would be significantly reduced if the Government would accept that amendment.<P>
English Partnerships has performed the function of regeneration. RDAs will expect to perform that function. There may be circumstances in which regeneration could accelerate if planning delays were eliminated. However, regeneration should apply only to land that has previously been developed. Green-field sites do not need regeneration and are not threatened by any organisation whose aim is confined to regeneration. Green-field sites are, however, threatened by development. That is why amendment No. 135 is so important.<P>
The amendment would confine to land that is suitable for regeneration the Secretary of State’s ability to transfer the planning powers of democratically elected local councils to unelected regional quangos. At a stroke, that would remove a serious threat to green-field sites and countryside all over England. The amendment would remove the possibility that an unelected body whose statutory aims include the furtherance of development and promotion of business investment could exercise planning powers over green-field sites and open countryside. It would keep in place the vital safeguard that local councils represent in the planning system. The Government have done nothing to justify the destruction of that safeguard proposed in clause 24. Regional development agencies could still develop undeveloped land if the amendment were accepted, but they could do so only if they obtained planning permission through the system in the normal way.<P>
Amendment No. 135 would not prevent the Secretary of State from designating regional development agencies as the planning authority for land requiring regeneration. In rare, exceptional and specific cases, such as docklands, the advantages of such a designation have already been demonstrated; I accept that. The Government have made no case, however, for giving regional development agencies sweeping and extensive additional planning powers. If they try to defeat the amendment this morning, their real intentions will start to be exposed.<P>
I hope therefore that the Minister will confirm that the Government share the aim of amendment No. 135 and that the Minister will recommend that it be approved by the Committee.<P>
Amendment No. 136 has a different but equally important purpose, namely to exclude the green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty from those areas that the Secretary of State can designate under clause 24. I will remind the Committee again what designation means. If clause 25 is passed unamended, its effect, combined with that of clause 24, will be to enable an unelected regional quango, the statutory aims of which include furthering development and promoting business investment, to remove planning powers from elected local councils and exercise them in place of those councils. Clause 24 allows for unelected regional quangos to exercise those planning powers in respect of green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the powers vested in EP for urban regeneration were strictly confined to cities, and did not apply to the countryside? If the powers given to the Secretary of State were suitable for urban development—and regarded by the Secretary of State as such—would the hon. Gentleman regard them as a protection for the countryside?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I certainly believe that they would provide much better protection for the countryside then that in the Bill. The object of the 1993 legislation which established English Partnerships was regeneration and not regeneration or development. English Partnerships could exercise its powers either over urban areas or over land that was suitable for urban development.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that the powers vested in English Partnerships—at the direction of the Secretary of State under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993—would have debarred development of green-field sites? Would those powers have stopped development on a green-field site that had been designated for the development of urban projects by the Secretary of State?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I do not believe that the history of English Partnerships since the 1993 Act has provided an opportunity to test the Minister’s point. I do believe, however, that a body that could exercise its powers only over urban areas or land that was suitable for urban development would be restricted in a sway that gave a degree of protection to green-field sites that is absent from the Bill.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman be more precise in his use of terminology? He seems to be vacillating on the specific point that I raised. Did the Secretary of State have powers under the Act which established English Partnerships to designate any area that he believed could be used for urban development? Is that what the rights given to the Secretary of State empowered him to do?<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The phrase “suitable for urban development” appears in the 1993 Act. I am just saying that had the Secretary of State come to the area to which I referred during our debate on Thursday—Dedham Vale, an area of outstanding natural beauty—and decided that the land was suitable for urban development, the protesters who would undoubtedly have come forward could have successfully challenged the Secretary of State’s decision.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If we are painting scenarios, does the hon. Gentleman think that the Secretary of State would have rejected an application by English Partnerships to move into an area of outstanding natural beauty, a green-belt area, a national park or a quarry that had not been worked for more than two years?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister, like the Under-Secretary, is suggesting a theoretical possibility. I should be interested to know whether, after five days, the Government have found a single area anywhere in the whole of England where such a condition exists because the Minister has not referred to one case—it is totally hypothetical. The possibility that one such uncompleted working might exist, and could not be dealt with by negotiation with the operator or present landowner, is a wholly inadequate justification for the sweeping powers that the Bill proposes to confer on the Secretary of State.<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Day </B>(Cheadle): Would it not be better to allow one hypothetical disused quarry to exist rather than threaten existing green-belt and green-field areas and national parks?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend’s question goes to the heart of the matter. We are dealing with only a theoretical possibility and no concrete example, despite all the resources at the Minister’s disposal. If such an area exists, I have no doubt that there are plenty of alternative ways of resolving the problem. to use that theoretical possibility as the reason for granting enormous new powers to unelected quangos over areas of outstanding natural beauty is an interesting illustration of the Government’s approach to protecting the environment.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is defending his amendment and the previous Government’s record, but will he give me a simple answer? Would the powers vested in English Partnerships give the Secretary of State the right to move into a disused quarry, a national park, an area of outstanding natural beauty or the green belt to acquire land? Was that possible under the powers given to the Secretary of State in the legislation introduced by the Conservative Government?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The legislation clearly states the conditions under which English Partnerships can exercise its powers. It must be in pursuit of the aim of regeneration, and the land over which the powers are exercised must be an urban area or suitable for urban development.<P>
If the Minister is happy to amend the Bill so that the legislation is brought into line—as he has constantly claimed—word for word, with the legislation that set up English Partnerships, many of my concerns would be alleviated. The problem is that, on his own admission, dragged out in a painful process, it is clear that the powers are much more extensive. Because of that we now want to amend the Bill to try to preserve some protection over AONBs, national parks and green-belt areas.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I am trying to establish what the legislation that set up English Partnerships provided because the Hon. Member for South Suffolk seems to be vacillating on this point. We have heard him speaking on the radio and read his remarks in the press.<P>
Was English Partnerships given the right to go into green-belt and green-field sites, AONBs and national parks? Did the Secretary of State have the power to decide that urban development should take place in those areas?<P>
<B>Mr Yeo:</B> I have just told the Minister that many of my concerns would go away if he amended the Bill to bring it into line with legislation that was introduced by the previous Government. However, my concern is that he is seeking powers that go far wider than those that are available to English Partnerships. I do not believe that if English Partnerships came up with a proposal for developing Dedham Vale, which is an area of outstanding beauty, it would be able to demonstrate that that area was suitable for urban development. <P>
My concern, which is shared by many people outside the House, has been enormously enhanced by some of the planning decisions that the Government have taken over the past nine months. It is because of those decisions that we seek additional safeguards. Under the previous Government the legislation was in reasonably safe hands—it was not going to be abused. Over the past few months—even over the past few weeks—the Government have shown that they are determined to ride roughshod over local concerns and to start developing areas that had previously been protected.<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Clark:</B> Was it not the previous Tory Government who allowed Kent county council to reduce the size of the green belt to allow for development? Did not the previous Government’s approach to developments on out-of-town shopping centres cause much damage to the environment? The amount of hypocrisy that we hear in this Room and in the Chamber is unbelievable. The situation in Kent and elsewhere was worsened by the previous Government’s decisions.<P>
<B>Mr Yeo:</B> I am not sure, Dr. Clark, how far you want me to pursue the question of out-of-town shopping centres, which the Hon. Gentleman mentioned. It was the previous Government—perhaps when my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Mr Curry) was a Minister—who enormously toughened the conditions that had to be satisfied before an out-of-town shopping centre could be developed.<P>
The Government propose an enormous weakening of the protections that are available to green belts, AONBs and national parks. The clause will allow unelected regional quangos to exercise planning powers over those areas. Once again, the Government have not produced a shred of evidence to justify that unacceptable attack on the democratic process. That attack follows hard on the heels of planning decisions that have caused great alarm about the future protection of green belt. Against that background, the amendment is pivotal to the Government’s planning policy and to the Bill.<P>
Amendment No. 136 would remove a significant new threat to green belts, national parks and AONBs. I hope that the Government will accept amendment No. 135, but amendment No. 136 is needed as well. Only last Thursday the Under-Secretary suggested that national parks could be in need of regeneration, and the Minister did so again today. They did not say which national parks might need regeneration, but the possibility is clearly in the Government’s mind.<P>
Amendment No. 135, which would confine the land that is suitable for designation to land that is suitable for regeneration, should be accepted, but amendment No. 136 is also necessary. If it is accepted, RDAs could still promote regeneration and development in green belts, national parks and AONBs. The only effect of the amendment, which is important, is that it would not allow an RDA to be designated the planning authority in such areas—it—would have to go through the planning process in the normal way. Acceptance of the amendment would greatly strengthen the position of RDAs by preventing any possible conflict of interest. Any development in the green belt, a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty by an RDA, by itself or in partnership, would have to be approved through the normal planning process, which, therefore, would not be subverted by the provisions of the Bill.<P>
If the Government reject amendment No. 136, they will be saying that they think that RDAs should develop the green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. They will also be saying that they fear that RDAs may not be able to persuade existing planning authorities to approve such proposals. The clause creates a new power for the Secretary of State to allow RDAs to cut out planning authorities and overrule objections that might be heard through the democratic process. RDAs will be able to grant themselves planning consent for development in the green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.<P>
The amendment is the litmus test of whether the green noises that have come from the Government over the past few weeks have any meaning. Were those noises just words, dictated by No. 10 Downing street and sent to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions for the Secretary of State to utter in the hope of stemming the rising tide of anger about the Government’s attitude to the planning process?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Have you issued a press release on that?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am quite happy to do so, as the point deserves a wider audience.<P>
I recall the words of G. K. Chesterton, who wrote:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“I tell you naught for your comfort,<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Yea, naught for your desire<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Save that the sky grows darker yet<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>And the sea rises higher.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
That message has come from every utterance that the Government have made on this crucial subject. We began with a denial from the Minister that the Bill’s powers went further than those already available to English Partnerships. When the false nature of that claim was exposed under great pressure from the Opposition, the Committee moved from denial to the soft soaping of a “don’t worry” message that claimed that we were right about the powers, but that the Government would not actually use them. That is not good enough. The Opposition will continue to fight. The Government’s response to amendment No. 136 will be the true indicator of their intentions towards the green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.<P>
Acceptance of amendment No. 136 would be a small step towards giving a modest shred of credibility to the Government’s claims that protection of the green belt will continue. I hope that the Government will accept amendments Nos. 135 and 136, which would achieve distinct and crucially important aims.<P>
Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 would create a two-stage, sequential test. They would limit the areas that the Secretary of State could designate, thus limiting to areas that are urban or<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“contaminated, derelict, neglected or unsightly”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
the land over which planning powers might be granted to RDAs.<P>
Only if the land needed for regeneration or development could not be found in such areas would it be possible for other parts of the countryside to be designated. If amendment No. 135 were accepted, the words “or development” would have to be removed from amendment No. 138.<P>
The advantage of amendments Nos. 137 and 138 is that they would force the Secretary of State to consider alternatives before designating land that is not urban or contaminated, derelict, neglected or unsightly. They provide grounds on which local authorities could resist the removal of their planning powers if the Secretary of State failed to take account of that test.<P>
Once again, there seems to be no reason why the Government should refuse to support those amendments, unless they intend to make it easy for RDAs to take away local authority planning powers over areas of open countryside. The amendments are another litmus test of the Government’s true intentions.<P>
The remaining amendments, Nos. 139 and 140, would confine designation orders to land which falls within the main object of English Partnerships as set out in section 159(1) and (2) of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993.<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the emphasis which Ministers have repeatedly placed on English Partnerships and the legislation which established it, I shall be interested to hear on what grounds they argue against amendments Nos. 139 and 140—if that is their intention.<P>
All the amendments in this group have similar aims: first, to protect the role of elected local councils in the planning process; secondly, to strengthen the protection of specially designated land. Acceptance of the amendments would not prevent regional development agencies from pursuing their statutory purposes, but rejection of the amendments would send a further chilling warning to the millions of people who are already profoundly alarmed at the Government’s cavalier and dismissive approach to planning. When the Minister responds, his answers will be listened to by the Committee and outside in the context of rumours of an imminent change in Government planning policy.<P>
I hope that if such a change is to be made, it will be announced first to the House or to the Committee and that it will not become known by way of a briefing to the press. As the planning Minister is a member of the Committee, it would not be difficult for him to make a statement in Committee. If the Government choose instead to announce the change by way of a press leak, the only conclusion that we could draw would be that the Minister is not in charge of the policy and that decisions are being made over his head by others over whom he has little or no influence.<P>
I warmly commend the amendments to the Committee.<P>

<P>

<B>Mrs. Caroline Spelman </B>(Meriden): It is appropriate that I speak to my amendment, No. 132, in this group because it relates closely to some of the matters to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk has referred. I have learned from his exposition that grouping the amendments together makes for better debate.<P>
It is right to consider clause 24 in the context of clause 25 because that throws into relief the significance of what we are discussing. My amendment would restrict the application of the designation orders to urban areas only. The fundamental motivation for my amendment derives from the anxiety that clauses 24 and 25 have generated in rural and semi-rural areas such as my constituency. That goes to the heart of the Bill and the structures that it will create because the board, which will consist of 12 members, may include only one representative of rural areas. Is the Minister satisfied that the minority representation of rural interests will be adequate to protect those interests? I am certainly unsatisfied on that point.<P>
The second aspect of my amendment concerns the fact that under the Bill much of the Rural Development Commission’s role will be absorbed. It is an important public body and those with rural interests at heart are concerned that the power, scope and sensitivity of the commission will be lost and overwhelmed by a majority urban view.<P>
We have spoken a lot about the precedent created by English Partnerships, that has arisen again in relation to this group of amendments. In seeking to restrict designation orders to urban areas, the amendment is modelled on the Secretary of State’s power to make designation orders which transfer planning powers to English Partnerships. I have looked closely at the leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993. Section 170 says:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“Where, as respects any area in England which is an urban area or which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is suitable for urban development, it appears to the Secretary of State”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
that a designation order may be appropriate. Although that is slightly broader than restrictions which would apply if amendment no. 132 were accepted, it provides a clear precedent for restricting designation orders to the urban area.<P>
Section 159 of the 1993 Act restricts English Partnerships to dealing with the regeneration of<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“land which is vacant or unused . . . situated in an urban area and which is under-used or ineffectively used . . . contaminated, derelict, neglected or unsightly”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Will the hon. Lady complete section 159 by reading subsection (3)? It says:<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“The Agency shall also have the object of securing the development of land in England which the agency . . . having regard to guidance given by the Secretary of State under section 167 . . .  acting in accordance with directions given by the Secretary of State under that section; and . . . with the consent of the Secretary of State, determines to be suitable for development under this Part.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> But, with respect, there is a significant difference between the two. The important logic is that the objectives of English Partnerships are different from those of the RDAs. I did a compare-and-contrast exercise to satisfy myself whether we are right to apply some of the precedents to RDAs. They will have jurisdiction over the whole of England. English Partnerships, however, had restrictions placed on the application of their powers. I have just listed the objectives of English Partnerships. They included the regeneration of areas that have been under-utilised, ineffectively used and contaminated. But the wider objectives of RDAs—<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Is the hon. Lady saying that provisions in the 1993 Act would stop the Secretary of State developing and designating an area for urban development? What would stop a Secretary of State designating any part of England as an urban development area?<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> The Secretary of State would be making that decision in relation to a different set of objectives. That is my point: an RDA’s objectives, as set out in clause 4, are to encourage economic development, to enhance employment skills, to promote business efficiency and to help achieve sustainable development. Those are much wider ranging than the objectives, and therefore the role, of English Partnerships. That is why there is a fundamental anxiety, especially in rural interest groups, that RDAs are to be given the power in relation to a wider set of objectives. That is why I have tried to restrict the provision to urban areas. Ministers have said that there is nothing to fear from RDAs. Why, therefore, are such provisions included in the Bill? We return to my fundamental point.<P>
Rural areas are concerned about the real role of RDAs. I believe that our debate on the clauses will shed light on the motivation to establish RDAs. Paragraph 8.1 of the White Paper includes the ambiguous statement that RDAs<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“will help to deal with growing pressures to bring green-field sites into urban and industrial use.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Reading that in relation to clauses 24 and 25 leaves me with the anxiety that powers are being handed to regional development agencies to act accordingly to wide-ranging objectives, which could result in the erosion of green-field and green-belt sites.<P>
<B>Mr. Colin Breed </B>(South-East Cornwall): I share the anxieties expressed by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). Clearly, planning powers are at the core of regeneration, the issues surrounding regional development agencies and, therefore, the Bill.<P>
The Minister has said that the Bill merely transfers existing powers currently available to English Partnerships, a point that has been repeated in recent speeches. In considering those powers, one wonders why they were not challenged originally before their transfer to regional development agencies. One certain effect is that they will now cover every acre of England, instead of covering only urban areas. Current planning legislation is not perfect, but it has democratic accountability, whereas regional development agencies, in their current form, do not.<P>
As a former chairman of a planning committee, I know only too well how frustrating it is when delays are experienced as a result of the planning system. In trying to create worthwhile new industrial and commercial land, that planning system certainly needs reform. A balance is required to enable RDAs to take forward strategically and economically important projects within a democratically accountable system, which, despite its faults, will at least ensure that the general public and interested bodies can have their legitimate say.<P>
The Bill’s proposals are drawn too wide, yet it could be argued that the amendments are too narrow and might negate the significance of the work of RDAs—in fact, their whole raison d’etre. Rural areas are not simply attractive areas to visit or roam around; they require just as much regeneration as urban areas.<P>
In previous amendments, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and I tried to balance the interests of the environment with those of the rural economy. We certainly would not want to stifle much-needed economic development, but it must be carried out within a system of democratic accountability in partnership with local authorities, not in a mood of hostility and opposition. We have often said that plans for regeneration and economic development must be seen as a partnership of all involved. These powers could give RDAs such a strong hand as to create barriers to such a partnership. We are prepared to support the amendments as they are clearly preferable to the proposals in the Bill, but we believe that the whole clause needs to be considered in an effort to provide the balance necessary for RDAs to undertake regeneration in rural areas.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The amendments expose exactly where the powers given to EP by the previous Government lay. The hon. Member for South Suffolk has not answered the simple question whether EP has the right, under the Secretary of State, to designate any acre of land as an urban area. The answer is yes; he had that right under the 1993 Act. For the hon. Gentleman to go trumpeting around every recording studio and newspaper during the weekend saying that the Conservative party is the great protector of the green belt is an act of hypocrisy that staggers.<P>
A previous Labour Administration introduced the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. That was 50 years ago. A Labour Administration introduced the concepts of national parks and of the green belt. A Labour Administration introduced the concepts of areas of outstanding natural beauty and sites of special scientific interest.<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Every Labour Administration in the past half century have introduced some form of protection of the countryside. We do not require any lectures from Opposition Members about protection of the countryside.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> So why is the amendment not acceptable?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That will come in a moment, slowly but surely. When we started on 15 January to examine the modernisation of our planning system, it was announced to the House in the usual way—<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> Before we get carried away with Labour’s unblotted record of protection of the green belt, I remind the Minister that the Secretary of State had the power to overrule a local government planning decision not to allow the construction of an industrial unit in the green belt, at Peddimore, close to my constituency in the west midlands. Surely that is a reverse example, of Labour in power overruling a local government decision not to develop that part of the green belt?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Not at all. Since 1 May 1997, we have increased the amount of green belt. Indeed, only yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister wrote to Durham county council, increasing its green belt by 12,000 hectares. <P>
If the Committee so desires, we shall analyse the list of the previous Administration. Their record not only on housing but on industrial development is poor.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Never speak ill of the dead.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I never speak ill of the dead, but the facts must be put on the record. The record of the Administration of which Nicholas Ridley was a member was probably one of the worst of the past half century in respect of protection of the countryside. We do not need lectures from Conservative Members.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I appreciate that the Government may have extended the overall number of acres designated statutory green belt. However, that has come about because green belt land near urban areas has been developed, expanding the urban area and moving it out into the countryside. That is not protection of green belt or the extension of it; it is a direct threat to it.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point, although I do not want to be taken too far down that course. There is a green belt around urban areas. One of the criticisms made against my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister by the Leader of the Opposition was about our policies on the development of green-field land outside green belt. Protecting the green belt by ensuring sustainable development, as in Stevenage, makes our very point. The danger, as occurred under the previous Administration, is that interested parties will hop over green belt into green-field, and develop there unsustainably.<P>
Many local authorities, whether they are Conservative-led, Labour-led or Liberal-led, are now sensibly considering how to promote sustainable development. The debate is opening up. The responses to my document on modernising the planning system, examining spatial, national and regional planning and urban development and local plans, bring coherence to that debate and to the problems that we face. Conservative Members deal with the symptoms, not the cause—symptoms that were created by them, not by this Administration.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The Minister may feel that the policy is right for economic development, but if he checks the Official Report tomorrow, he will see that he has conceded the point that green belt land is threatened by the Government’s dedication to economic development in green belt.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I do not know where the hon. Gentleman gets that from. It is interesting that we have had so many litmus tests from the Opposition today; they left so much acid around when they left office that we have needed lots of litmus tests. I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman said. Some time around 23 February my right hon Friend the Deputy Prime Minister will debate in the House the document on household growth that the Conservatives submitted before they left office.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> Does the Minister agree that if everyone goes in for competitive bidding as saviours of the green belt, there is unlikely to be a sensible planning policy? Does he accept that on some occasions there is a case for development in the green belt? For example, near Leeds recently, a new grammar school was constructed in the green belt so that an inner-city site could be liberated for expansion of the universities. That represents a considerable gain and was a sensible decision. We have reached the unfortunate position in Britain that it is almost impossible to have a sensible conversation about tax because all parties are allergic to putting up taxes in a way that people can see. If we cannot have an intelligent conversation about planning, we might as well pack up.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I could not agree more with the right hon. Gentleman, who approaches these matters in a sensible way. I released two documents on 15 January. One considered modernising the planning system, particularly relating to the advice coming from Europe on the European spatial planning perspective. I hope that that can be signed off during our EU presidency, on 8 or 9 June in Glasgow. The previous Government took that up and it has taken five years to bring it to fruition. I shall be proud to sign that document, which will look after our environment.<P>
The hon. Members for South Suffolk and for Cheadle may find it difficult to have a rational debate, but I can tell the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon that we submitted that document to make sure that debate on modernisation of the planning system could take place. We will welcome his comments on our regional strategic planning consultation document and on how to handle blight more effectively. We are trying to create a framework in which debate can take place.<P>
You have given us a lot of licence to wander from clause 24, Dr. Clark. The clause would give the Secretary of State the power to designate areas in which an RDA may act as the local planning authority. The powers are essentially the same as those provided by section 170 of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 in relation to English Partnerships, but with two exceptions. First, in the case of EP, the power was limited to an area<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“which is an urban area or which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is suitable for urban development”, whereas for RDAs the power could be used in any part of an RDA’s area<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, is suitable for regeneration or development”.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
Secondly, EP’s use of the planning powers given to them in this way would be limited by their statutory objects, the main one of which is<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“to secure the regeneration of land in England”,<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
although that may include land which is simply “vacant or unused”. RDA purposes are somewhat broader.<P>
I have a number of points to make about clause 24. first, the power to designate areas would be given to the Secretary of State, not the RDAs themselves. Secondly, the Secretary of State would have to consult every local authority in whose area it was proposed to make a designation. Thirdly, the designation would be made by an order approved by the affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Fourthly, this is very much a reserve power.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister said that the powers would be given to the Secretary of State, not the RDAs. Taking clauses 24 and 25 together, would not the effect of the designation order be that, although the Secretary of State has the power to make the designation order, the order would give planning powers to the RDAs?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> That would have to be given by the Secretary of State. That is the intention of the Bill and that is what will happen.<P>
English Partnerships has never felt the need to seek designation; working in partnership with local authorities has been the route to success. We spent a lot of time finding out exactly how that part of English Partnerships’ powers has operated. While it accepts that it could have intervened unilaterally, it took the view, as did urban development corporations eventually, that partnership was the best road to success. English Partnerships said that it would not have used the powers except in conjunction with local authorities, and that is what we expect to happen. Nevertheless, in drafting the Bill we decided that there would be value in retaining the option for those cases, if any, in which an RDA, the Secretary of State and Parliament believe that it is the only way of making progress with a regeneration initiative of regional importance whose delivery would otherwise be in jeopardy. I shall repeat that: when the RDA, the Secretary of State and Parliament believe that it is the only way of making progress with a regeneration initiative of regional importance whose delivery would otherwise be in jeopardy.<P>
Conservative Members have made much of the fact that the powers in the Bill may be used in any part of an RDA’s area as if it were part of a devilish plot to destroy the green belt and redevelop the whole English countryside. English Partnerships was established as the urban regeneration agency, whereas the RDAs will be a regional development agency. It is therefore reasonable that the Secretary of State’s powers should have wider coverage.<P>
Under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, which established English Partnerships, the Secretary of State has the power to designate not only urban areas but areas which in the opinion of the Secretary of State are suitable for urban development. That is on the statute book now and I shall repeat it: areas which in the opinion of the Secretary of State are suitable for urban development. The previous Government, now in opposition and portraying themselves as the saviours of the countryside, gave the Secretary of State powers in the 1993 Act to designate English Partnerships as a planning authority in any part of England, not just in urban areas, if the Secretary of State believes that an area is suitable for urban development. How did that protect national parks, the green belt or rural areas? Conservative Members have been busy in every studio over the weekend trying to con journalists into putting their case when all the powers are already on the statute book at the designation of a Secretary of State.<P>
All the amendments that we are considering seek in various ways to limit the types of area in which the Secretary of State may use his power to designate RDAs as planning authorities. Some are ingenious and Conservative Members have obviously given the matter a lot of creative thought. It is a pity they did not go in for creative thinking just prior to 1993 when they put the legislation on the statute book. Nevertheless, they come as sinners to repentance.<P>
RDAs are not just urban development agencies, and we have been at pains to stress the regeneration responsibilities that we are giving them. The ultimate safeguard lies not in Parliament limiting the use to which the powers may be put, but in Parliament deciding, if the time ever comes, whether to approve a designation order made by the Secretary of State. The decision will have to be made by Parliament; it lies in the democratic process. The Secretary of State has the power but will have to come to Parliament, which will have the right to overrule a decision if it believes it best to do so.<P>

<P>

<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> I want to check whether I have understood the Minister correctly. He seemed to be criticising the previous Government’s legislation which they put on the statute book in 1993; but he then said that because the previous Government provided a power in that legislation, there is nothing wrong with the present Government continuing that power. I had understood that there was a general election nearly a year ago when people voted for something different. They did not vote for a new Government to say, “Our hands are tied by all the actions of the previous Government.”<P>
<B>Mr Caborn:</B> What I am saying is that protections do exist, but I also want to establish that the previous Administration put English Partnerships  on the statute book. That shows the hypocrisy of some of the amendments. It is not within the powers of RDAs to concrete over national parks and green belts; RDAs, the Secretary of State and Parliament would have to make such decisions. Members of Parliament would have the right to say yes or no to such proposals.<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The loyal Opposition have twisted this debate; they have said “We have repented, we have washed our hands, we are like Pontius Pilate.” They are acting as if they can just walk away from the argument. The shadow spokesperson can do the rounds of all the recording studios and brief all the Sunday newspapers, but the Conservatives are still responsible for putting English Partnerships on the statute book; they cannot walk away from that. All that I am saying is that safeguards are in place in that these decisions have to be referred back to Parliament.<P>
<B>Mr. Anthony D. Wright </B>(Great Yarmouth): I want to place on the record my belief—based on my experience as a former leader of the Great Yarmouth borough council—that RDAs are an important move towards achieving sustainable growth, effectiveness and greater employment prospects for all the regions. <P>
Contrary to what the hon. Member for South Suffolk has said during our consideration of the Bill, East Anglian authorities are looking positively to the future. As with all changes, however, there must be consultation. Some concerns are bound to be expressed and most of them have been answered well by my hon. Friend the Minister. That has been demonstrated by the number of amendments that have been withdrawn.<P>
However, genuine anxiety about the clauses dealing with the planning powers of the RDAs was expressed to me during consultation with my local authority two weeks ago and during discussions with the Local Government Association. Following those discussions, I have looked again at this section of the Bill and believe that we should give further consideration to the desirability of some of its proposals.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to interrupt. We would be interested to learn about his opinion of clause 24, but it would be more appropriate for him to give it during the stand part debate rather than debate on the amendment. He may continue if he restricts his comments to the amendment, but if he wishes to discuss the clause he should wait until the stand part debate.<P>
<B>Mr. Wright:</B> I accept that Opposition Members have reason to table the amendments, but they seem to be claiming that they are whiter than white on these matters. I can remember two or three occasions on which a Conservative Government overturned decisions made by my planning authority on certain development projects that the authority determined to be undesirable. Those projects were out-of-town developments. The Conservative Government decided at that time to overturn democratically controlled local planning decisions and to develop what would have been brown-field sites. It therefore seems to be hypocrisy of the highest level for Opposition Members to put forward amendments that fly in the face of the Government’s intentions.<P>
Although I agree that the amendments have some positive elements, I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to reconsider the clause not in the light of those amendments but in the light of the points that have been made during our debate. The current legislation, which covers the planning powers in relation to simplified planning zones, or SPZs, deals with the points raised by the amendments.<P>
The strongest argument that has been put to me is the fact that the Bill’s proposals are already dealt with in sections 82 to 87 and in schedule 7 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which was modified by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991. As the Opposition explained, those provisions, which relate to SPZs, deal with fast-track planning arrangements.<P>
The basic aim of SPZs is to allow local planning authorities to undertake certain developments in their area. The relevant powers can be given by the Minister of State to any body. For example, an RDA might want to establish an SPZ, and, under current regulations, the Minister could either veto that or accept it. Protections are already available for the Norfolk and Suffolk broads, for example, which are in the constituency of the hon. Member for South Suffolk. I appeal to the Minister to listen to the concerns that have been expressed and to reconsider the Government’s position.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The Minister seems extremely sensitive about the subjects that we have discussed. I am bewildered by the assumption that appears to underlie the argument that he used to reject the amendments. He seems to be arguing that there is no justification for the amendments because they could be interpreted in such a way that goes further, in some respects, than the provisions of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993, although they may have an effect that is more restrictive than that Act.<P>
Let me again try to explain the situation to the Minister. The Bill will give RDAs broader powers than those exercised by English Partnerships, and it is therefore necessary to introduce specific restrictions that were not in previous legislation. That need has been reinforced because the Government have shown on several occasions that they are determined to ride roughshod over existing protections. One such occasion was discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden. The independent planning inspector’s recommendation relating to 150 acres of farmland in the west midlands was overturned. So embarrassed was the Secretary of State about the decision and the likely public reaction that he sat on the relevant papers for three months after coming to office and sneaked out the decision in the first week of the summer recess. That is a sure sign of a Minister who is nervous and who suspects that he may be doing something wrong.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman should read the Official Report of the Adjournment debate in which the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) spoke because it shows how the relevant decision was made. When we came to power on 1 May 1997, there was a large backlog because the previous Administration had been paralysed for the nine months before the general election. When I took office, there was a pile of planning applications on my desk, which needed to be dealt with systematically. I explained the situation, and my explanation seemed to be accepted by the House and in particular by the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield. It does not become the hon. Member for South Suffolk to regurgitate the matter again because it is not germane to our debate.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister’s explanation was received with much enthusiasm by the constituents whom it will affect. I know that he is not much of a one for being worried about such matters. <P>
The background against which we are trying to introduce an improved measure of protection to the Bill is one of a Secretary of State who shows himself willing to overrule not just the views of people in the area affected but the views of an independent planning inspector appointed to consider the issue.<P>
It is not necessary to justify to outside observers whether powers are the same, down to every dot and comma, as those in the Act establishing English Partnerships. But I repeat: if the Minister thinks that the legislation establishing English Partnerships is so wonderful—that it is the gospel—why does he not incorporate its measures into the Bill? That would remove many of my concerns.<P>
The Minister acknowledged that he is insistent on more extensive powers. He wants the Secretary of State to be able to remove from locally elected bodies and give to an unelected quango powers that were not previously available to English Partnerships. He appeared rather reluctant to address the amendments and seemed more interested in debating the 1993 Act. His reluctance to examine the provisions of his Bill may be explained by the fact that until last Thursday, he consistently failed to understand them. Indeed, he failed to describe them accurately to the Committee.<P>
The amendments have seemed to excite, in the Minister’s mind, some attention in the press. I am not sure that he has dealt with my concern that changes are just around the corner. He was careful not to deny the possibility that changes to the policy might be coming up very soon, perhaps as soon as the instructions could be biked over from No. 10.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The hon. Gentleman means walked.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> A bicycle is just as environmentally friendly. [Interruption.] I said bike, not motorbike.<P>
The famous mythical and unsightly quarry, which is stuck in a national park somewhere, has not reappeared in the Minister’s response.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Still there.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> The hon. Gentleman says that it is still there. Let us suppose that we identify it. What is to stop the RDA for that area going to the relevant planning authority—the park authority, local council or whatever—with a proposal to regenerate it? Who in his right mind would expect the local planning authority to resist such an environmentally friendly proposal which, as the Minister keeps saying, the RDAs will want to encourage?<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> The point being made, which the hon. Gentleman missed, was that the 1993 Act is on the statute book. If the Secretary of State, using legislation put on the statute book by the—now—loyal Opposition, wants to intervene today in matters involving land on the green-belt, in areas of outstanding natural beauty or in national parks, he or she already has the right to do so.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If the Minister really believes, and if his officials have really advised him, that the 1993 Act gives sufficient power to do what he describes, why does he want further powers to be granted to the Secretary of State? What are they needed for? If previous legislation is capable of being interpreted in that way, what is the point of putting more extensive powers in the hands of a Secretary of State who, incidentally, introduced the White Paper with the claim that it was a decentralising measure? Why does not the Minister take the clause away and return with one that has the same wording as the 1993 Act? it is because he knows that the 1993 Act would allow a challenge to be made to a regional development agency that marched into a national park, an area of outstanding natural beauty or green belt, and chose a piece of land that would not satisfy the test of being suitable for urban development. That is why the Minister has introduced legislation that contains more sweeping powers, for which he is unable to advance a shred of justification.<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister referred to the fact that the Government have designated some new areas of green-belt, which clearly exposes the Government’s attitude towards green-belt land. The Minister said that they had designated acres more green belt, as though that demonstrated environmentally responsible government. In fact, he is saying to developers, “Here is an important piece of green belt, just outside the town. It is crucial to the protection of the environment and we cannot risk letting the local council take a decision because it might look after the interests of the local community, so we will give the RDA the power to get involved. We will take the council’s planning powers away and give them to a bunch of people who have been hand-picked in advance by the Secretary of State for their pliable views”—[Interruption.] The substance of the point remains. The Minister wants to allow the RDA, an unelected body, to exercise planning powers over a piece of green belt that, perhaps for 50 years, has represented the countryside’s first line of defence around the town.<P>
The Minister will say, “Okay chaps, as long we find a remote bit of countryside, in which no developer in his right mind will be interested for 100 years, we shall designate it as green belt, and that will allow me to jump up in Parliment and say, ‘Aren’t we clever, we have designated so many more acres of green belt than before?’”<P>
That is an absurd distortion of the purpose of the green belt. It shows a deliberate failure to understand the purpose of green belt, which is to protect the ever-increasing expansion of urban areas.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Will my hon. Friend remind the Committee that it was the previous Government who designated statutory green belt and tightened statutory green-belt policy through local development plans, accepted and approved by the Secretary of State after various public inquiries? The Government are putting that recently strengthened status under threat.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My hon. Friend is quite right to draw attention to that. The status of the green belt was not only fully maintained but strengthened under the last Government. That position is now in jeopardy. It is extraordinary to suggest that designating new green belt justifies bulldozing existing green belt. That would completely remove the ability of the green belt to perform its true function, which is to prevent a constant and ever-increasing urban encroachment.<P>
The Minister did not say how the removal of planning powers from democratically elected local councils could be reconciled with claims in the White Paper—first made during election debates before the White paper was published—that the new Government would respect the position of local authorities. Far from respecting them, the Government propose to undermine them.<P>
The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr Wright) made an extraordinary assertion about the attitude of local authorities in East Anglia. I should be grateful if he could name a single planning authority in the whole of the East Anglian region that has gone on record as saying that it supports giving the Secretary of State the power to take away the planning function of the local council. I am not aware that any local council of any political persuasion in East Anglia that is also a planning authority has said that that power should be given without restriction to the Secretary of State.<P>
<B>Mr. Anthony D. Wright:</B> Can the hon. Gentleman name one East Anglian authority that declared itself a simplified planning zone under the previous Government?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman trying to justify the Government’s rejection of amendments that seek to improve the protection of the countryside, the national parks and the AONBs that we have in East Anglia and elsewhere? Is he trying to claim that local councils are happy that the Secretary of Sate will have the power to remove their planning functions. They are not. Councils may take a general view of RDAs, and we covered that territory in our debates on whether consultation had produced unanimous support. On this clause and these amendments, however, I do not believe that a single council that exercises planning responsibilities in East Anglia would go against the amendments.<P>
<B>Mr. Wright:</B> I cannot say that I have visited every local authority as the hon. Gentleman has. However, I have held discussions with the Eastern regional officers support group which was concerned about this matter. I have passed on its concern to my hon. Friend the Minister. I have consulted the local authorities on that score to a greater extent than has the hon. Gentleman. I have also passed on concerns about the previous Government’s decisions on planning issues that took away democratic accountability over out-of-town development.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> If the hon. Gentleman shares the concerns expressed to him, I shall be interested to see how he votes on the amendments, if they come to a vote.<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Angela Eagle):</B> That is up to you.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> It is, I know. However, it depends on what the Minister has to say. I am intrigued by the fact that he has not denied that the Government are about to do a U-turn. Perhaps he has heard that in the one week since the Conservative party launched the Save Our Countryside campaign it has received requests for 100,000 leaflets. That is the measure of public concern outside the portals of his Department.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Does the countryside need to be saved because of eight months of Labour rule or 18 years of Tory rule?<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I see that the Lib-Lab coalition is alive and well. How fortunate for the Government that the Liberals have, for once, turned up. No doubt the hon. Lady will soon be a junior Minister. To answer her question, let me refer to just one decision concerning West Sussex county council. All three parties—the locally elected representatives of the Liberal Democrats and the Labour and Conservative parties—agree that the countryside is under threat from the Government.<P>
There is widespread concern owing to the Government’s attempted denial that the Bill extends the powers currently available, followed by their refusal to answer straight questions on how that can be reconciled with what they claimed in the White Paper. Why are they refusing to deny that there will be a U turn—perhaps it is a hopeful sign—because of the Opposition pressure that we shall maintain? In the House last night, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) presented a petition expressing concern about the countryside. There is accumulating concern and, now that the Minister has finally acknowledged that the RDAs will exercise broader powers than English Partnerships, that concern will quicken. The Minister also claimed that the fact that Parliament would have to approve a designation order that was made by the Secretary of State, through the statutory instrument procedure, meant that it was acceptable to give the Secretary of State huge new powers. I do not recall Labour Members energetically advancing that argument during the 18 years the Conservative party was in government—it is interesting that positions can change so quickly. The Government’s majority and their attitude to the House no doubt have had an influence. I cannot draw much comfort from the fact that a designation order would have to go through the statutory instrument procedure.<P>
I hope that the Minister will see fit to discuss the substance of the amendments. He should not try to re-run battles over legislation that has been on the statute book for five years.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I want to press the Minister further on the protection of green belts, which is an important matter in my constituency of Cheadle. In Cheadle, like so many other areas, a local development plan was approved by the local council, approved after public inquiry and approved by the Secretary of State, and it tightened green-belt policy to such an extent that there was a real chance that, under the previous Government’s policies, we could have protected the green belts in my constituency.<P>
We do not protect the green belt if green belts near urban areas are released for development and new green belts are established further out in the countryside. In order to stop urban developments moving into the countryside, green belts must stay where they are. The Government’s approach is continually to move the urban area into the countryside. The Minister must understand the obvious logic of the need to keep green belts where they are. It is no wonder there is widespread concern across the country—in particular, in my constituency—about the Government’s commitment to protect the green belt.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> May I answer that question, Dr. Clark? I am not sure that it is relevant to the amendment, but it is an important matter.<P>
Protecting the green belt involves ensuring that our cities and towns are reasonable places to live in. One of the greatest pressures on the green belt is household growth, which is a natural growth that most people accept. One of the biggest problems in this regard is the fact that people move out of towns and cities because the previous Administration abrogated their responsibility to ensure regeneration in cities and towns, which involves repairing the physical infrastructure and improving crime rates, education and the quality of life in towns and cities.<P>
The Government are determined to recapture cities and towns and to make them places where people will want to live, work and play. In doing so, we deal with the cause rather than the symptom. One of the Symptoms is people’s desire to move into green-belt areas and green-field sites because they do not want to live in cities or towns.<P>
When I spoke to journalists recently it became clear that people were being driven out of towns and cities because of the lack of educational facilities. People do not want to send their kids to private schools, but they cannot get the education that they want in urban areas. That is why the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), is striving hard to restore pride in education in city centres. The green belts are under pressure because of problems left by the previous Administration.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Is not the Minister admitting the existence of that pressure and conceding that the Government’s policy is to give in to it by moving the green belt? What is his view of the constantly moving green belt, which seems to be the Government’s policy?<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I remind the hon. Gentleman that we have been in office for nine months. I do not know how much of the village keeps moving—and I should like him to quantify that, as it seems to be a relative term. I gave assurances to the House, to which I am responsible, about the only industrial area that we have cleared and the reasons for doing so.<P>
In taking pressure off the green belt and allowing household growth, collectively we must ensure that our towns and cities are reasonable places in which to live. If we can achieve that collectively, with local authorities, housing associations, education authorities, the police and those interested in crime prevention, the quality of life and the environment will be enhanced. The pressures on green belt will consequently be considerably reduced. People will want to live in urban areas, as they used to.<P>
The current predicament is the result of the former Government’s abrogation of responsibility and acceptance of out-of-town shopping. I accept that PPG 6 has made some difference; I accept what the previous Administration did. However, before that, we allowed sprawl to take place, with out-of-town shopping and entertainment; that has done immense damage, not merely to the land on which such developments are built, but to the environment, through pollution generated by increased use of the motor care. There is no sustainability.<P>
This Administration will address those major issues. We shall not be dragged down by the symptoms. We shall address those symptoms in the immediate term, but we shall take a longer-term view, as well, as was clearly outlined in our modernising of planning document that I submitted on 15 January. We shall also analyse how we can encourage more strategic regional planning. We shall address the problems, not the symptoms of those problems.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The Minister asked me to justify what he considered to be an attack on the Government. He asked how I was justified in criticising them for the green belt’s constantly moving outwards when they have been in power for only nine months. My criticism is based on the Minister’s words earlier today, when he justified his position by explaining to the Committee that the Government had acquired lots more green belt land. In response to that, I make the challenge that that is the result of a green belt that is constantly moving outwards from urban areas—a release of pockets of land near urban areas. The Minister has still not responded to that point.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> If we are to debate the entire planning process, I shall do that—<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You will not.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Fine. Local authorities submit urban development and local plans through regional planning conferences to the Government for consideration of whether to remove green belt and of whether that is what the local people want, as in the case of Stevenage. A judgment is then made. The hon. Gentleman is right. That was a recommendation from the council.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I want to take the Minister back to his constant reiteration of the theme that the previous Government walked away from the problems of the inner cities. I am now reading his consultation document on reforming the regeneration programme. That document does not talk about the previous Government’s walking away from problems in the cities. It talks about the need to build on existing programmes and the successes of such initiatives as city challenge. It is a fault in politics always to exaggerate to the point of absurdity—a fault to which the Minister is getting close.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I acknowledge that the right hon. Gentleman was a well respected Minister in the Department of the Environment who tried to effect instruments and policies to redress some of the savage policies followed by previous Administrations. I said that the object and development of the SRB should be commended and developed. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Conservative Government were in power for 18 years. Much of the damage that he was trying to redress when he was a Minister, for which I commend him, was done in that time.<P>
We have had a useful and interesting debate. As I explained in earlier interventions, the powers are included in the Bill because the Government felt that RDAs would benefit, as EP did for the regeneration functions that RDAs will take over, from having access to the special powers in clauses 25 to 27, which the Secretary of State may, with parliamentary consent, give them under clause 24.<P>
We have framed the powers slightly differently to make sure that rural and urban areas are treated exactly the same. However, they are essentially the powers that EP had and which were put on the statute book by the Government of which Opposition Members were members.<P>
Hon. Members on both side of the Committee have argued that the powers are not helpful in the context of RDAs, even thought they are intended as reserve powers. I have explained that use of those powers will be exceptional. Indeed, EP has never used them. I accept that there is strong feeling about whether they should be available to RDAs. The matter has been raised with me more than once. The Local Government Association raised it and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth eloquently said, the LGA remains concerned. It is right to take that concern very seriously.<P>
I noted with interest the comments helpfully made by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth about possible use of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990—as amended—relating to simplified planning zones. The powers are available only to local planning authorities and are designed essentially to assist developers to cut through red tape. Most members of the Committee accept that.<P>
The powers are useful and RDAs might have a role in advising local authorities on when it might be appropriate to use them. My hon. Friend also mentioned regional strategic planning guidance for the Eastern region. That is an important issue, discussed in the consultation paper issued on 15 January on the future of regional planning guidance. The consultation period ends on 17 April. I will give more thought to the matter in light of the views that are expressed. I encourage my hon. Friend and everyone in the Eastern region who has a view to respond to that consultation. That will help us to respond to the concern expressed by the right hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon about the possibility of sensible debate on land use planning. We also want to move into spatial planning, another important area which the Government and Parliament should consider.<P>
Our proposals for modernising regional planning guidance will greatly increase regional ownership and transparency and will considerably increase the relevance of RPGs to the economic strategies of the RDAs. the agencies will make an important contribution to the development of regional planning guidance, which, in turn, will inform their economic strategies. That linkage must be understood as we move towards what we believe to be a more strategic overview at regional level.<P>
Since RPG forms the crucial strategic input to the plan-led system to which planning applications must have regard, it would be sensible to look again at whether the reserve planning powers in the Bill will be needed in practice. <P>
Against that background, and in light of the arguments put by members of the Committee—notably those of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth after his consultations with the LGA—I think that it would be right for me to look again at the effect of the provisions in clauses 24 to 27 and the extent to which they are likely to be useful to the RDAs.<P>
As I said in reply to earlier debates on proposed amendments, I feel very strongly that the success and effectiveness of RDAs will depend in large measure on their ability to build consensus in their regions and to pull people together behind a regional strategy that regional partners can support and help to implement. As one of the key regional partners—local government—feels so strongly that the provisions are undesirable, and if they are unlikely to be needed in practice, it may be best not to proceed with them in the Bill.<P>
In the light of that commitment to review the need for the provisions, I hope that the hon. Member for South Suffolk will feel able to withdraw his amendment.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> We have had a sensational new development in the past few moments.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> The bike made it from No. 10.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> As my hon. Friend suggests, the bike has come round from No. 10. I am glad that the message did not come on foot as it might not have arrived before the end of the debate.<P>
We unreservedly welcome the Minister’s commitment to have a fresh look at whether what he describes as reserve powers are needed in the Bill. If he decides that they are not needed, he will receive our warm support. I should be grateful if he could outline the expected timetable for the reconsideration of the matter. Will it take place while the Committee is sitting, before the Bill’s Report stage or when it reaches another place? It would be helpful to know what he has in mind?<P>
The Minister’s final comments put the debate into a new context. We have taken a significant step forward. However, it is still worth making a couple of specific points. They arise from what he has been saying, although his concession has put the matter in a new light.<P>
The Minister referred to the importance of improving inner cities. I share that view. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon pointed out, even the Government have acknowledged that many of the policies pursued over the past few years have made progress in the regeneration of inner-city areas, progress which I hope will continue. If inner-city improvement addresses the causes rather than the symptoms of a problem, why did the Minister decide to sanction the proposal to develop 2,000 houses in the green belt of Newcastle when the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) explained that there were 4,000 empty homes in his constituency alone? If the Minister prefers to regenerate inner cities, why did he not pay attention to the empty homes in that city centre?<P>
The Minister also spoke about vacant or unused land being suitable for regeneration. Does that mean land which has never been developed—a green-field site—or land which has fallen into disuse? It is an important distinction.<P>
As for my next question, I suppose that the Minister will say that he will consider it as part of his fresh look, but I would be grateful for confirmation of that. If he cannot give me that assurance, will he say why RDAs must have powers over land that is suitable for regeneration and development and not just over land that is suitable for regeneration? Why is it necessary to include the words “or development” in the first sentence of clause 24 (1)?<P>
Finally, I hope that the Minister’s reconsideration of the matter will include whether it is necessary for RDAs to be given the power to take planning decisions that affect, for instance, areas of outstanding natural beauty. Nothing in my amendments would stop an RDA from taking a proposal through the normal planning system if it affected an area of outstanding natural beauty. The Minister has not addressed my point on why additional powers are needed. What projects could be so important to a region that they would get the go-ahead even if the Minister knew that they might not be able to proceed, should planning control remain with the elected local council?<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> We have had discussions with the Local Government Association and local authorities. When EP’s powers were brought to my attention, I thought that safeguards were in place. I believe that that remains the case because Parliament and the democratic process act as safeguards. What convinced us that the powers worked was that EP had never taken action without consulting. EP went further than that and said that it did not want the powers bestowed on it by the Bill because it believed that to intervene without support of the local authority would be contrary to its objective: namely, partnership.<P>
Others have asked why we need to include the powers in the Bill. The answer is because they are reserve powers whose use can always be threatened. But why include them if the RDA must act in concert with the planning authority, which is the local authority? There is the deterrent argument on the one hand and the partnership argument on the other.<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
This argument applies not only to EP but to the urban development corporations, impositions of an ideological Government who introduced quangos to overrule local government. UDCs eventually discovered that it was better for them to go into partnership with local government because they were reasonable institutions delivering what people wanted. There has been a learning curve. It has been argued that those powers can be used as a deterrent, but that they have never been used or would never be used because EP would always want to act in concert with local government. That is the background to the Government’s view.<P>
We shall return on Report to the issue of how best RDAs can deal with the questions in hand. I do not want to go into all the details at this stage but there will be an opportunity to amend the clauses on Report.<P>
Newcastle has nothing to do with the clause, but that project was decided on the basis of sustainability, which underpinned the plan that had been put forward, and we believed that that was necessary. It was sustainable because it included transport and the airport, which was developed to assist that corridor of development. That was the logic behind the Newcastle scheme.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo rose—</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I trust that you will not debate further, Mr. Yeo, a point that the Minister says has nothing to do with the amendment or the clause.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am grateful for that guidance, Dr. Clark. I merely cited it because it was a green-belt size, but I shall not pursue the matter.<P>
We can welcome what is effectively a climbdown by the Government. Whatever the Minister may say about who or what has persuaded him, it is significant that he has chosen to announce it just when we were about to press the amendments to a Division.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> This is a panic reaction.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> My right hon. Friend—[Interruption.]<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I regret to say that I cannot hear Mr. Yeo and, as the Committee will appreciate, I very much wish to hear him.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> You may be one of the few who do, Dr. Clark, but it is comforting to know that.<P>
I do not wish to cause my right hon. Friend any embarrassment, but he summed up what has just happened more eloquently than I could have. His remark was made from a sedentary position and you may not have caught it, Dr. Clark, but it deserves a wider hearing. He said,<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>“This is a panic reaction.”<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
With all his experience in these matters, my right hon. Friend put his finger on it. But panic reaction or not, I am prepared to be charitable; we have always taken a constructive view. I am glad that the consequence of tabling and arguing in favour of the amendments, and the consequence of the Conservative Opposition having identified a groundswell of public concern about these matters, is that the Minister has now agreed to reconsider these important clauses. That is a big step forward and we welcome it unreservedly.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> I wonder whether my hon. Friend is as confused as I am by the welcome change in the Government’s position at the end of this morning’s debate. It is in total contradiction to the tenor of the debate and the position that the Minister advocated during the earlier part of our proceedings.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I would be confused were it not for the pattern of contradictory arguments that we have listened to for the past three weeks. We often hear in the same breath, and certainly in consecutive paragraphs, directly opposite arguments advanced in an attempt to justify the rejection of Opposition amendments. This is a historic day nevertheless, as the Committee may have achieved something that future generations of residents of the green belt, national parks and areas of outstanding beauty will have cause to thank us for. That is something to celebrate.<P>
We shall examine closely the new clauses or amendments that the Minister may table on Report, and I hope that reasonable notice of them will be given to hon. Members. Such notice was given of the Bill, which was published before Christmas, so although the recess intervened we had a week or so of parliamentary sitting time to examine the Bill. I hope that we will not be given the minimum notice of any Government amendments. I reiterate that the Minister was reluctant to say exactly which aspects would be reconsidered. I will seek to debate all the matters that I raised this morning, all of which are important. <P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> When the hon. member of Cheadle reads the Official Report of the first part of this morning’s debate, he will find that it clearly outlines what is on the statute book today. The previous Administration allowed the powers of English Partnerships to extend across the whole of England—areas of outstanding natural beauty, nationalparks, green belt, green field, urban areas, the lot. English Partnerships could have exercised its powers anywhere it wanted to, at the direction of the Secretary of State. That was clearly put on the statute book by the Conservative Government. We will give more than the requisite time for consideration of any new clauses or Government amendments; it is unfortunate that Conservative Members judge everyone by the standards that their party had in office. When we were in opposition, the then Government gave us the minimum amount of time to consider statements, but we are an open Government, we are proud of that, and we will continue to act in a sensible way to ensure that all Opposition Members can scrutinise legislation and Government statements. We will never be fearful of coming to Committee or to the Dispatch Box to answer for our actions. We do not have to hide behind all sorts of constitutional niceties—as the previous Administration used to do—to stop the truth coming out.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman’s last remarks come into the category that he described as a civilised, helpful debate. He may have slipped below those standards. If the powers available to English Partnerships were so unrestricted, the Minister has still not explained why it was necessary to seek even broader powers under the Bill. In a spirit of celebration, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. <P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 130, in <P>
clause 24, page 11, line 30, after ‘(2)’, insert ‘Subject to subsection (4) below’.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> On a point of order, Dr. Clark. I seek your guidance, on whether there is any point in discussing amendments to clauses 24 to 27, which the Minister said that he would reconsider.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It is best that we discuss this group of amendments but, bearing in mind what the Minister has said, it would be sensible if that debate were short.<P>
<B>Mr. Day:</B> Further to the point of order, Dr. Clark. The significance of what the Minister said has dramatically altered the overall position of the Committee’s deliberations. It might be wise for the Committee to adjourn to allow consultations to take place through the usual channels.<P>
The Chairman: Thank you, Mr. Day. I shall take any other points of order, but if it is the wish of the Committee, I would allow a dilatory motion, perhaps moved by the Minister, to be debated.<P>
I invite the Minister to make a point of order and to state whether he will seek a dilatory motion. In that point of order he might wish to advise Mrs. Ballard on whether she should move her amendment.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Further to the point of order, Dr. Clark. The Committee should proceed. I have said that I shall withdraw clauses 24 to 27.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> You may withdraw the clauses at a later stage, but you cannot withdraw them now. If you want to remove the clauses now, they must go forward to a vote on stand part and be allowed to be defeated. Otherwise, they will stand part of the Bill for the time being and can be withdrawn on Report.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Further to the point of order, Dr. Clark. I suggest that the hon. Lady not move her amendment. I shall reflect on clauses 24, 25, 26 and 27 and return to them on Report.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Further to the point of order, Dr. Clark. In the light of this turn of events, there seems little purpose in discussing amendments Nos. 134, 141 or 142 because that discussion may be rendered irrelevant by the possible reconsideration of the clauses to which they refer.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> Further to that point of order, Dr. Clark. I suggest that it would be sensible to move to stand part debates on clauses 24, 25, 26 and 27. They can then be left in the Bill and I will come back to the House on Report with the result of the Government’s reflection on those clauses.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> Further to that point of order, Dr. Clark. We are in territory that I have not previously experienced.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> New Government!<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I am glad that the Government have recognised, in the light of Opposition amendments, that the clauses need improvement.<P>
If we forgo the opportunity of debating amendments to the clauses, it is important to have an assurance that when we return to the Bill on Report we shall have the opportunity to examine the arguments that would otherwise have been debated in the Committee.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Yeo, you are correct in your point of order. If Mrs. Ballard’s amendment is not moved, you will be denied the opportunity of debating the amendments that are grouped with it, but you will not be denied the opportunity of a short stand part debate if the Committee wants to discuss the clause.<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>

<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> I have been in this position in a Standing Committee before.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have not.<P>
<B>Mr. Curry:</B> When the Housing Bill was in Committee there were some technical difficulties and the Committee decided to suspend consideration of the clauses concerned until a later stage to allow repairs to be made to them. That may be one option available to us. The Minister has referred to withdrawing and reflecting upon the clauses so I am not sure what procedure is envisaged, but my suggestion might be a third way—which I understand the Prime Minister is frightfully keen on.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr Curry. There are three ways in which we may proceed. I can call Mrs. Ballard and she will decide whether to move her amendment. The second option is to move the dilatory motion to which I referred, which would enable us to debate the clauses to be reviewed by the Minister. The third option is, as Mr. Curry suggested, to agree to postpone discussion of the clauses. I would prefer that we dispose of the clauses now with a short debate on stand part so that the words that need to be said can be said.<P>
<B>Mr. David Clelland </B>(Tyne Bridge): On a point of order, Dr. Clark. Would it be in order, subject to the agreement of those who tabled the amendments, to move that discussion of clauses 24, 25, 26 and 27 be suspended until a later date?<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Although it is only quarter to one, I suspend the Committee for five minutes while I talk to the Minister and his Whip, the Opposition spokesman and his Whip, and Mrs. Ballard.<P>
<H5>12.47 pm</H5>

Sitting suspended. <P>

On resuming—<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We now come to amendment No. 130, in page 11, line 30, after ‘(2)’, insert<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘Subject to subsection (4) below’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Not moved.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mrs. Ballard. The amendment is not moved. We now come to amendment No. 134, in page 11, leave out lines 32 and 33.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> I want to place it on record that this important amendment goes to the heart of the clause’s effects. I would have intended to press it and to seek the opportunity to debate it at length because it raises important issues of principle. However, in light of what the Minister has said, the value of such a debate would be limited, so I will not move the amendment.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Thank you, Mr. Yeo, That is much appreciated. The amendment is not moved.<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.<P>
<B>Mr. Yeo:</B> To continue along the lines of my previous remarks, the Opposition have serious objections to the clause. Had our earlier debates resulted in the rejection of the amendments that I had tabled, we would have argued that the clause was wrong and should be excluded from the Bill. I should reserve our position by making it clear that we will press for debate on clause 24 as it stands because it is not acceptable. However, I hope that the Minister can assure us that his reconsideration of clauses 24 to 27 will be completed in time to allow new clauses and amendments to be tabled at least a week before they are debated on Report.<P>
<B>Mrs. Ballard:</B> Liberal Democrats, too, have serious reservations about the clause, but I look forward to the Minister’s comments.<P>
<B>Mr. Caborn:</B> I assure the Committee that we shall reflect on the matter. I hope that Government amendments to the Bill will be drafted at least seven days before the Bill is debated on the Floor of the House. As soon as we clarify the Government’s position on the matters that are consequential to the clause and to clauses 25, 26 and 27, I shall write to Committee members. That might be before the revised Bill is published. I shall ensure that all Committee members have plenty of time to reflect on the Government’s position.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We have to abide by the rules of the House. We cannot withdraw clause 24 for later debate; we have to take a decision on it now.<P>

</FONT><B>The Chairman:</B>  We now come to amendment No. 133, in page 12, line 16, at end insert—<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>‘(1A) A designation order making provision as is mentioned in subsection (1) shall provide that the relevant agency shall have regard to any further regional planning guidance and local authority development plans for the agency’s area.’.<P>
</UL></FONT><P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am a little unsure about the procedure. I want to make a few brief points about the amendment.<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> If you make a few remarks it means that you are moving the amendment. If you do not want to move the amendment, you would be wise not to make too many comments about it.<P>
<B>Mrs. Spelman:</B> I am concerned about planning powers, although many of my concerns have been allayed by our debate on the clause. The matter is now subject to further consideration, so I shall simply outline my fundamental objection to giving these planning powers to RDAs. That move contravenes paragraph 8.2 of the White Paper, which states:<P>
