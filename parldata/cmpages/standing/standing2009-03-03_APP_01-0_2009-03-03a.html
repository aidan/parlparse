<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000526"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have a few preliminary announcements. I
apologise that we are in a less spacious room than we would wish. That
is due to the pressure on space. The Speaker&#146;s Committee is
sitting today and it has priority for the larger room for which we made
a bid. Hon. Members may remove their jackets during sittings if they
wish. Mobile phones, pagers and so on must be turned
off.</div><a name="09030342000008"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
remind the Committee that there are money and ways and means
resolutions in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available
in the room. Adequate notice must be given of amendments for them to be
eligible for selection. For Tuesday sittings, amendments must be tabled
by the rise of the House the previous Thursday. For Thursday sittings,
amendments must be tabled by the previous Monday. As a general rule,
neither I nor my co-Chairman, Mrs. Humble, will accept
starred
amendments.</div><a name="09030342000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
everyone is familiar with the process of taking oral evidence in Public
Bill Committees so I shall explain how we will proceed. We will first
consider the programme motion. That debate is limited to half an hour.
We will proceed to a motion to report written evidence and a motion to
permit the Committee to deliberate in private in advance of oral
evidence sessions. I hope that those motions will be taken formally.
Assuming that the motion to sit in private is agreed to, the Committee
will move into private session. Once we have deliberated, witnesses and
members of the public will be invited back into the room and the oral
evidence session will commence. We estimate that that will happen at
about 11
o&#146;clock.</div><a name="09030342000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Committee agrees to the programme motion, the Committee will hear
oral evidence today, on Thursday and on next Tuesday morning before
reverting to the more familiar clause-by-clause scrutiny next
week.</div><a name="09030342000011"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000533"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Before calling the first member of the Committee
to ask a question, I remind everybody that questions should be limited
to matters within the scope of the Bill. We must stick strictly to the
timings in the programme motion agreed by the Committee. I hope that I
do not have to interrupt mid-sentence to achieve our objective of
bringing this section of questioning to a close just before 12 noon.
Bearing it in mind that there are four of you, would witnesses please
make their responses brief because otherwise we will not cover the
range of subject matter that we have before us? I call John Hayes to
ask the first
question.</div><a name="09030342000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
1</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000534"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My question is for the British Chambers of Commerce
in particular. Are the changes in the management and funding of skills
likely to bring greater organisational efficiency? Not that I want to
lead the witness in any way, but in your submission you describe those
changes as
bizarre.</div><a name="09030342000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> Absolutely. We are very uncomfortable with the
state of play of the reform, particularly with the dissolution of the
Learning and Skills Council and the introduction of the Skills Funding
Agency. We believe that the changes are too bureaucratic and do not
address the underlying issues and problems of the education system. Too
much management time will be drawn in to oversee the changes, and that
will cause serious disruption to long-term relationships and processes
that have been established. There were obviously problems with the LSC,
but our preference would have been for organisational change to have
happened within the existing structures rather than through a complete
overhaul.</div><a name="09030342000041"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
2</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000535"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I recall the very welcome support that the CBI
gave to raising the participation age to 18. What is the CBI&#146;s
view on the need for local authorities to have at their disposal the
tools to make raising the participation age a success by
2013&#151;the time scale set out in legislation? Is that not a good
reason for the delegation of 16-19 commissioning to local
authorities?</div><a name="09030342000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> I am from the
BCC.</div><a name="09030342000043"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000536"></a>Jim
Knight:</b>
Sorry.</div><a name="09030342000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> That is okay. In relation to the raising of
the participation age, I understand why transfer of funding has
happened, but in terms of business engagement it will be very difficult
for businesses and employer bodies to engage with the system set out in
the Bill. Basically, we believe that the Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency will have to intervene so often that that will bring into
question the use of transferring funding directly to local authorities,
and the point of dissolving the LSC may also be brought into question
if the systems stay fairly similar and the national agency has to keep
stepping in.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div><a name="09030342000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
3</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000537"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Why do you think the YPLA will have to step in all
the time when most of the arrangements for post-16 learning are set for
most people? They will either carry on at school or go to college;
those are well-established arrangements that are pretty much
learner-led.</div><a name="09030342000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> In terms of funding and its distribution, I do
not think that local authorities have a track record of employer
engagement and of ensuring that the system post-16 is focused towards
equipping young people coming out of the system with skills and
vocational qualifications that enable them to work. They certainly do
not have a track record of successfully engaging with business, and I
think that this will cause an awful lot of bureaucratic change for what
I see as little tangible
benefit.</div><a name="09030342000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
4</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000538"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My question is for the CBI, on that subject. When
the Select Committee looked at the draft Apprenticeships Bill, you were
asked by one of its members what you felt about local authority
involvement and whether you thought that the model would be too
prescriptive, and you said that it was a concern. Why did you say
that?</div><a name="09030342000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Moving responsibility to local authorities is
about ensuring that they take into account local and regional business
views and demands. Our members are primarily concerned about ensuring
that they get a good-quality apprenticeship programme, so as long as
local authorities adequately consult and work with local employers in
ensuring that they are putting on the sort of apprenticeship programmes
that are in demand, I think that our members will be generally
happy.</div><a name="09030342000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
5</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000539"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Would you therefore welcome greater emphasis in the
Bill on the quality and standard of
apprenticeships?</div><a name="09030342000050"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Apprenticeship quality is a very important
issue and businesses generally see high-quality apprenticeships as
coming from strong employer involvement. So, the priority for our
members is to ensure that the apprenticeship programme encourages
strong employer involvement and that the programme is more fit for
purpose&#151;delivering the sort of skills that are in demand by
businesses.</div><a name="09030342000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
6</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000540"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Do you think that the Bill goes far enough in
involving employers in that process? We are going to have a very
complex new structure&#151;we have mentioned local authority
involvement already&#151;and the Bill does not specify much about the
issue of quality that you
described.</div><a name="09030342000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> No, I think that the Bill is silent on local
authorities and the YPLA consulting employers. There is a concern about
ensuring that local authorities are required to work with local
businesses.</div>
<a name="09030342000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
7</b><a name="09030342000541"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): The Minister has just
mentioned raising the participation age in education and training to 17
in 2013 and 18 in 2015, but the sector skills councils have to move
first. The Bill says that apprenticeships should be offered to all
young people who want one, which is a hard-to-quantify
figure.  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>Do you think that the sector is up for it? Is there enough capacity
among employers to offer sufficient apprenticeships to young
people?</div><a name="09030342000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> That is the element that concerns us. An
apprenticeship is not an apprenticeship unless it includes learning in
the workplace on the job, and you can do that only if you have
employers. Although I understand that we need to think about coming out
of the recession, with the way that the economy is going and the
challenges there, the biggest challenge in the commitment is ensuring
that there are enough employers, and in that I return to the issue that
has just been spoken about and our real fear that, to hit the targets,
quality will be lowered. For us, the maintenance of apprenticeships as
a high-standard, valued programme and qualification is absolutely key.
We would rather see redefined targets, but maintained
quality.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
8</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000542"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Are the 25 sector skills councils that you
represent all adapting their thinking to prepare for the challenge that
lies ahead?</div>
<a name="09030342000056"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> Yes, indeed, we are in the middle of
working through a programme that we can bring forward to deal with this
specifically.</div>

takes us away from the sterile debate about whether there should be
compulsory training measures. It will be a useful compromise. It
certainly goes with the grain of what the vast majority of CBI members

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
18</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000552"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I would be interested to hear from all the
witnesses how they think we should balance what I hope everyone agrees
is the importance of sustaining high quality in apprenticeships with
setting standards. Concerns have been expressed that those standards
become too high an obstacle. How do we balance sustaining quality and
standards?</div><a name="09030342000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> We understand the desire to ensure that
apprenticeships are high quality. How do we think that should be best
delivered? Well, that is through strong employer involvement and
allowing employers the flexibility to ensure that their apprenticeship
programmes meet their individual
needs.</div><a name="09030342000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
do not see high quality and flexibility as being mutually exclusive. If
you ensure that apprenticeship programmes best meet the needs of
employers, they will be more encouraged to get involved and that will
drive up quality. I do not think that top-down conditions on minimum
periods of time off work for training are a good way to do that.
Employers already have to ensure that their apprentices have adequate
time and resources to undertake the qualifications that are part of

minimum periods of time

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
19</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000553"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Do you agree that apprenticeships need to be
mobile so that apprentices can work for more than one employer? In
which case, how do you think it is best to regulate the transferability
of the quality of an apprenticeship within that flexible
framework?</div><a name="09030342000080"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Standards are fine. It is just specific
standards for minimum periods of time off that are not needed. Each
framework has to ensure that it accords to the blueprint at the moment.
There are recognised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div>qualifications within each apprenticeship framework. There are other
factors relevant to apprenticeships too. That is the way that you will
ensure
mobility.</div><a name="09030342000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> I would like to add that we were very positive
about the planned increase in apprenticeships. We think it is a
long-term, positive thing for business and for the economy. I would
very much agree with what Richard said. We think that apprenticeships
need to be employer led and employer focused. Obviously there has to be
a high-quality programme element to them too. We would like to see
solid growth and development in making sure that apprentices have
transferable skills as much as work-specific skills. That must all be
within an employer-led
framework.</div><a name="09030342000082"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> For 150 years, unions have been campaigning
for apprenticeships. One of the biggest problems has always been the
pressure on quality. During the recession, that pressure will become
more acute. The reason we applaud the Bill particularly is because it
sets in statute both the framework and the standards that will apply to
all apprenticeships. That is new and important. It is important because
it sets a bulwark against the inevitable pressure, which is always
there and is particularly acute in a recession, for some dilution in
quality.</div><a name="09030342000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
my colleagues have said&#151;we would support this&#151;a large
part of the content of the framework and the standards will come from
employers through sector skills councils and their trade union
colleagues. That is as it should be. They will vary and will need to be
adapted to particular sectors. The importance of the Bill is in setting
things in a statutory framework, which gives the protection and
fall-back that apprentices
need.</div><a name="09030342000084"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> The key to this is the framework. If we get
the framework right, it will ensure that the quality is maintained.
From the point of view of sector skills councils, that is what we do.
We work with employers to identify what the framework
is.</div><a name="09030342000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have a slight hesitancy around this flexibility issue because one
person&#146;s flexibility is another person&#146;s anarchy. While
you need the ability to take account of slightly different
circumstances, a young person, or even an adult, will carry this
qualification with them throughout their working life, and the
apprenticeship must be just as relevant to their second or third
employer as it was to the first. The Bill, as I read it, encapsulates
what is already happening in many sector skills councils and will
ensure that good practice exists and that we share
it.</div><a name="09030342000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
slight concern of mine is that the Bill does not address sector skills
councils enough. Unfortunately, councils that were set up to work with
and represent employers, and to identify the apprenticeship frameworks
that everyone is working towards, do not rate a mention. Returning to
the earlier points on splitting up the LSC and how we are to square off
the sectoral special dimension, sector skills councils are very
important because if you cut the regional elements and make them too
small, you lose a lot of the
benefit.</div><a name="09030342000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my own sector, plumbers and electricians working on the Olympics site
live in Leicester and travel to work every day. I am not sure whether
that is a London or a Leicester skills problem, but it is definitely a
plumbers and electricians skills problem, so the sectoral dimension is
very important. We must not lose it and must ensure that it pulls in
the clear responsibility of the sector skills councils on framework
development.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
20</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000554"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Often, Government targets in one sector have a
skewing or displacement effect&#151;sometimes even an adverse
one&#151;on another sector. Given that the Bill places a duty on the
chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency to find an apprenticeship
place for every young person who wants one, is there not a danger that
that target might be at the expense of post-19 adult apprenticeships?
Employers might skew their offer to young people in order to please the
Government and funding agencies and so
on.</div><a name="09030342000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> I do not think that that will be foremost in
employers&#146; minds when they decide how to best address their
skills needs. Adult apprenticeships have been very successful, because
employers see real value in putting their older employees through those
particular schemes, so we certainly welcome Government moves in that
direction. But no, I do not think that employers really worry about
Government targets when looking at their individual skills
requirements.</div><a name="09030342000090"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> Although I recognise the point that you
make, the fact is that we are running out of young people. It is
essential, considering the way that work patterns are changing, that we
are able to pull adults&#151;people who are moving from one sector of
the economy that is in decline into another that is not&#151;into
apprenticeships. Certainly, when I talk to employers in my sector, they
say that they are keen to take on adults, so it is important that that
element works
well.</div><a name="09030342000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
21</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000555"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> May I challenge Mr. Marshall&#146;s
assertion that we are running out of young people? I guess that that is
a reference to demographic change over the next decade with the number
of teenagers broadly falling, but that differs depending on the social
sector. Broadly speaking, the number of working-class young people will
fall, but the middle-class numbers will remain fairly flat, so
university applications may not be affected. Is it implicit in what you
are saying that apprenticeships may not be attractive to people from
middle-class backgrounds, and is that not the challenge facing the
sector? You have to ensure that an apprenticeship is a quality
qualification that will appeal to all social
categories.</div><a name="09030342000092"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> Yes and no. You are absolutely right: we
must raise the profile of apprenticeships and recognise them as a
mechanism for people of all ages right across the social spectrum. I
would suggest that there are some quite poor undergraduates who would
make very good apprentices, and that is the area on which we need to
concentrate very hard indeed. We need to raise the status and the
profile, and this sort of legislation will certainly help
that.</div><a name="09030342000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
22</b><a name="09030342000556"></a><b class="B">Emily
Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): On the
subject of apprenticeships, what is the TUC&#146;s response to the
CBI, which states that apprenticeships should not be
prescriptive?</div><a name="09030342000094"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> I am not quite sure what the CBI means by
that, really. Our view is that the great virtue of this Bill is
precisely that it is pretty prescriptive that there should be a clear
national framework and clear national standards. As I said before, we
think that that is very important.</div>
<a name="09030342000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
there is a prescription that, to count as an apprentice, there is an
employment contract and the apprenticeship is not programme-led or just
a college-based  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>thing. All of that is very important for quality. As the Committee has
been discussing so far, there is this enormous emphasis on quality and
that is quite right.</div>
<a name="09030342000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure
that Richard can speak for himself in a second, but I would guess that
what the CBI means is that the Bill should not be too prescriptive and
too top-down, and that is right; we would echo that. I think that there
is much consensus about the need for there to be considerable
flexibility here, so that the content of the programme and what counts
towards the standard is developed jointly by each SSC, as my colleague
has just said. It depends very much on the sector. On SSCs, I think
that you will find that employers and their union colleagues are
working well, developing those standards to provide precisely that kind
of sectoral flexibility.</div>
<a name="09030342000097"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> I certainly do not think that we are arguing
for a free-for-all.</div>
<a name="09030342000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000557"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> I am glad to hear
it.</div><a name="09030342000099"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> There should be some form of framework that
employers work towards, because there must be some consistency about
what an apprenticeship should be delivering. However, our members feel
very strongly that the current arrangements, with the frameworks that
the SSCs provide, offer adequate consistency, so that everyone knows
what an apprenticeship will deliver and what it
contains.</div><a name="09030342000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
23</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000558"></a>Emily
Thornberry:</b> Are you so much in agreement therefore that
you feel that the regulations that might be established by this Bill
would satisfy both of
you?</div><a name="09030342000101"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> No. We feel that introducing the standards is
an issue. If you look at the consultation document that is out at the
moment, you see that a huge part of what those standards will include
is minimum periods of time off for training. We think that that is
going too far to the other side. It is too prescriptive in outlining
how employers will have to deliver their apprenticeship
training.</div>
<a name="09030342000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
24</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000559"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> So we have heard from Mr. Marshall that
there is not a sufficient role for SSCs, and we have heard from the CBI
and the BCC that there is inadequate concentration on employers.
Indeed, the BCC briefing says that</div>
<a name="09030342000495"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;there have been
constant changes to the further education public funding system during
the previous 20 years. The shifting complexity of the further education
system has served to disengage employers. Time should be spent on
improving and reforming existing structures rather than creating new
ones.&#148;</div><a name="09030342000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
there is an insufficient role for both employers and SSCs, and yet
Mr. Wilson says that this is a good Bill.</div>
<a name="09030342000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">Should SSCs
have a bigger structural role and should employers be mentioned in more
than two clauses in the Bill, which, as far as I can see, is the only
mention that they
get?</div><a name="09030342000105"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> Certainly our comments, which Mr.
Hayes has just read out, focus very much on the machinery of government
changes. Regarding apprenticeships, we are broadly supportive of what
the Government have outlined here. I agree with Mr. Wainer
that there should not be too much prescription of the minutiae and
detail of how much time off there should be for employees to train;
that becomes counter-productive. However, the broad structure for
apprenticeships is the way forward.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="09030342000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
25</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000560"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Can the entitlement to an apprenticeship, which I
think is what you are referring to, be delivered, in terms of the
availability of apprenticeships, without a system that is built from
the bottom up and that engages small and medium-sized enterprises?
Also, on that specific point, should we see an equalisation of funding
between adult apprenticeships and other apprenticeships, which is
further to the point that Mr. Marshall made? Furthermore,
should employers receive a direct cash bonus for every apprentice that
they take on?</div>
<a name="09030342000107"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> It is fair to say that if funding, financial
incentives and financial support for employers were equalised across
the whole apprenticeship programme, both pre-19 apprenticeships and
post-19 adult apprenticeships, employers would be happier. However, it
is also fair to say that the raising of the participation age will
provide a pool of people who will hopefully take on apprenticeships and
take on some of these new routes that are being
provided.</div>
<a name="09030342000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
26</b><a name="09030342000561"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): I have several questions and
would like to begin with Tom Wilson of the TUC. What difference is the
ability to request time off, time to learn, going to make? In
particular, how do your members, who have been very proactive in
introducing union learning representatives, think that it will change
things? I have seen some of the work that has happened in my
constituency and it is transformational, so are there any plans afoot
for
members?</div><a name="09030342000109"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> There certainly are and thank you very much
for that endorsement of union learning representatives; we are very
proud of them. There are now 22,000&#151;an astonishing achievement
given that we started from something like only 2,000 at the
millennium.</div>
<a name="09030342000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Yes, we have
plans to equip and train ULRs to accompany people exercising their
right to request. I was at a meeting of ULRs last week where we
outlined the likely nature of the right to request and the kinds of
things that they could do to help people to formulate a request in
terms that would, perhaps, be more accessible to an employer and would
be something in tune with the criteria that are likely to be in the
Bill. People were very enthusiastic&#151;they could see that this is
a tremendous role for ULRs. It is the next step up for many ULRs, and
they are enthusiastic, keen and tuned in to the kind of training that
both the employer and their members want. So, we see the potential for
this part of the Bill as enormous, possibly far greater than the other
right to request, for flexible
working.</div><a name="09030342000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
27</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000562"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> Richard, you talked about time off. It is not time
off: these people are not going off to sit and smoke cigarettes and
read newspapers; they are going off to study. Do you think that the
employer attitude to young people&#146;s time off for study will
change as a result of the Bill? What steps are you as an organisation
taking to encourage employers in non-traditional apprenticeship sectors
to offer apprenticeships? Fifty per cent. of the vacancies in the
Wakefield constituency today are in the care sector, which, as far as I
am aware, has no apprenticeships, no training pattern, and no skills
and qualifications&#151;though there are level 3 and 4 qualifications
in that area. What are your employers doing, particularly on new growth
in non-traditional apprenticeship sectors?</div>

specifically talking about the right to request

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000563"></a>Mary

Train.</div><a name="09030342000114"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> The vast majority of CBI members train. They
have training plans and, as I have said, this regulation really does go
with the grain of what is already happening in the vast majority of
cases. That is exactly what happened with the flexible working
regulations; there were lots of good employers doing that and they felt
that they could cope with
it.</div><a name="09030342000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the issue of non-traditional apprenticeship sectors, the issue for
companies is primarily to ensure that young people of all abilities are
encouraged to see an apprenticeship as a good opportunity. Careers
advice needs to improve to ensure that young people are not just
presented with the GCSE to A-level to university route without hearing
about the other side as well. There is a clause in the Bill on careers
advice which, we feel, does not go far enough. We think that it will
still allow teachers and careers advice professionals the discretion to
decide whether it is in the best interests of a young person to hear
about the benefits that an apprenticeship can deliver. We think that it
should be a requirement that all young people, of all abilities, should
understand the opportunities available in terms of
apprenticeships.</div><a name="09030342000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
28</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000564"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b><b class="B"> </b>To follow up those questions on the right to
request and Time to Train. We have heard from the CBI that they are
fairly relaxed about the proposal and that, not to paraphrase too much,
this is already practised by most of their members. In your experience,
is it practised among employers? How big an impact do you think it will
have on firms, in terms of the numbers of people who will take up
training in the future?</div>
<a name="09030342000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> I think that it is true that it is probably
good practice in some good firms. I would not say that it is
widespread, frankly; it is hard to tell. Certainly, our impression from
our members is that many feel a bit hesitant about asking for training
if they are not quite sure exactly how it is done, whether it is okay
to ask, how the employer will react, who they should ask and what kind
of criteria there might be. All those things dissuade people from
asking. That is understandable if you put yourselves in their shoes. We
think that this measure will make a big
difference.</div><a name="09030342000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
29</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000565"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> This is a tough question, but what increase do you
think the proposals will lead to in the numbers of people who ask for
time off to train and have that permission
granted?</div><a name="09030342000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> It is impossible to put a figure on that, but
we think that millions of people could exercise the right to request
and take up training who would not otherwise have had the
opportunity.</div><a name="09030342000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
30</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000566"></a>Mr.

employment or will it be something that helps them to move
on?</div><a name="09030342000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> Very often, training is both. When people
exercise such a request, they typically look at training in areas such
as IT. That benefits not only them, but their employers, enormously.
Similarly, customer care training often improves people&#146;s soft
skills in communication and relationships. That directly helps the
employer.</div>

this part of the
Bill.</div><a name="09030342000123"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> Obviously, employers are behind training.
Skills are key to employers and their employees are their biggest
resource. We think that the proposals seek to formalise a process that
already takes place constantly. We question the need for legislation
and the use of parliamentary time to push forward an intrusion into
normal business practices and normal relationships between businesses
and their employees. There is also a philosophical question about
regulation and the degree to which the Government should intervene in
normal relationships through legislation. We think that this is a step
too
far.</div><a name="09030342000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
32</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000568"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you think that the measures will simply be a
waste of time because they will ratify something that already happens,
or do you agree with Mr. Wilson that a lot of employees will
ask their employers for the right to train and take up training, making
life more difficult for employers? Will the proposals have a dramatic
impact on employers or will they just bureaucratise what happens
already?</div><a name="09030342000125"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> I think that they will just bureaucratise and
formalise what happens already. I do not foresee an upsurge in training
because of these proposals. Lots of training happens already. It is in
the interests of employers to invest in training. When we surveyed our
members in 2007, about 83 per cent. said that they invested in external
training and had training
budgets.</div><a name="09030342000126"></a>

there are different expectations of what this right means? We have
heard increasingly about Mr. Wilson&#146;s staff, who are
trying to improve the skills of the work force. With their
encouragement, will there be a big upsurge in the demand for training?

Wainer:</b></i> First, we must remember that we are
discussing a right to request, not a right to have. If the right to
request training encourages more employees to have informed and
considered discussions with their employers about their skills needs,
that can be only a good thing. The legislation is drafted so that if
the training will not improve the business or the employee&#146;s
productivity, the employer is within its rights to reject the request.

employers the right to refuse those training
opportunities?</div><a name="09030342000133"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> In an ideal world, we would have preferred
narrower grounds for refusing a request and we would have liked a right
to paid time off. However, we live in the real world and accept that
the Government need to make a judgment about balancing employer needs
against employee desires. We are comfortable with the judgment that the
Government have come to, even if it is not ideal. The same sort of
balance was struck with the other right to flexible working and that
has worked pretty well. It has shown that with a bit of common sense
and sensible judgment, people can work a way through. There are always
exceptional cases and requests that cannot be anticipated, but it
provides a framework for a serious conversation. That is the important
part. Once you have the framework, the serious conversation can
accommodate all sorts of requests.</div>
<a name="09030342000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> No one can deny that the grounds to refuse are
fairly comprehensive. We are broadly happy with that within the terms
of the Bill. It would perhaps have been useful to have more provision
for employers about the grounds for withdrawing permission once
granted. I think there was a conscious decision&#151;I hope that I am
right in saying this&#151;not to include that in the Bill. If the
Government are set on pursuing this policy it would be good to let
employers know where they stand and how they could withdraw that right
once a request has been granted. I am sure that there will be instances
where employers may want to withdraw that right&#151;out of business
necessity, because of a breakdown of the relationship with the employee
or because an employee leaves&#151;and I do not think that the Bill
sets that out properly.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
37</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000573"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Supplementary to what Sharon was asking, the
last Education and Skills Bill that we considered was about raising the
participation age of young people. Suppose an employer refuses a
request for time off for learning. Does that not put the young person
in a catch-22?</div>
<a name="09030342000136"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> We are talking about people who are over the
compulsory age. As an organisation, we are positive about raising the
participation age, as Mr. Knight suggested. With this, we
are talking about employees above that
age.</div><a name="09030342000137"></a>

38</b><a name="09030342000574"></a><b class="B">Ms

employers. What about the employers who are not as good? How would you
suggest that we try to disseminate good practices to
them?</div><a name="09030342000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> There are obviously employers who do not
train, for whatever reason. The Government have worked hard on Train to
Gain during the past three or four months and, as a network, we have
seen an increase in uptake. If that sort of scheme is made efficient,
easy to access and, more importantly, if the further education skills
system is simple and stable&#151;which I do not think Government
changes are providing for&#151;employers will train, if it is an
easier process to undertake.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
39</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000575"></a>Ms
Butler:</b> Do you think that the Bill will not encourage
those employers, who are not doing as well as the good ones you talked
about, to participate in Train to Gain and to look at it more
favourably than they do
now?</div><a name="09030342000140"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> It is undeniable that those two conditions of
simplification and stability are not being met by the Bill. There is an
awful lot of change. We do not see some of the bureaucratic processes
that were endemic in the Learning and Skills Council being addressed. I
hope that once the SFA has been established we can work with Government
Departments to try to iron out those
processes.</div>
<a name="09030342000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
40</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000576"></a>Ms
Butler:</b> My last question is, which of you and Tom Wilson
has most contact with
employees?</div><a name="09030342000142"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> It is a mixture. Obviously, we represent
employers but that is 100,000 businesses with about 5
million employees across the chamber network. So we have a lot of
contact with employees. Employees are a key resource for business. It
is vital for business that we have a skilled work force&#151;nobody
can deny that. I just do not believe that some of the provisions in the
Bill are the right way to go about
that.</div><a name="09030342000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
41</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000577"></a>Ms
Butler:</b> May I ask Tom the same
question?</div><a name="09030342000144"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> We have 58 affiliates who represent
6.4 million employees, with whom we have a great deal of
contact virtually every day in all sorts of ways. On the point about
the reasons for denying the request and whether it would be sensible to
tighten those up the other way, the TUC would find that extremely
difficult. A kind of settlement has been reached, and were we to go
down the kind of road that the BCC has suggested and, for example,
tighten up the provisions and be more prescriptive&#151;it is
interesting how on this occasion you referred to more
prescription&#151;that would be a major problem for us and would not
be sensible at all. It would also lead to complication&#151;too much
detail and complexity, and over-bureaucratisation of the whole
thing&#151;which is counter to what the BCC has said it wants. So it
is important to keep it relatively
simple.</div><a name="09030342000145"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> Going back to my point about the philosophy of
how much Government should intervene, once it has gone past a certain
point&#151;I think that this really is going past a certain point
with Time to Train&#151;the rules and the state of play have to be
set out, otherwise you enter a wholly bureaucratic system, which can
become acrimonious and difficult. We need to avoid that if at all
possible.</div><a name="09030342000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
42</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000578"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Sir Michael Rake, chairman of the Commission for
Employment and Skills, and of BT, recently
said:</div><a name="09030342000496"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;There
is no one I&#146;ve met who doesn&#146;t think the current
system&#148;&#151;</div><a name="09030342000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">for
the management of the funding of
skills&#151;</div><a name="09030342000497"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;isn&#146;t
incredibly
overcomplex.&#148;</div><a name="09030342000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
went on to say that the
system</div><a name="09030342000498"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
ridiculous, both in cost of delivering, effectiveness of delivering and
so
on.&#148;</div><a name="09030342000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is
he right? Presumably, Mr. Wilson, you are not a person whom
he has met, as he has said that he has met no one who does not think
that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="09030342000150"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> To a large extent we would agree with him. I
have met him. The three trade union commissioners on the UK commission
who work with Sir Michael endorsed the commission&#146;s recent
simplification proposals, which adopted the approach of hiding the
wiring as it were, rather than trying to rearrange lots of the
agencies, which is complex. That approach is probably right, and what
has been proposed by Sir Michael and the commission is that Train to
Gain should become the new all-encompassing brand and the single portal
through which people, particularly employers but also other
stakeholders including unions, could access the system. Behind that
wiring the approach has done the job of the agencies to route people to
the correct part of the sector. Employers and agencies should not
themselves necessarily have to know every detail of how it all works,
because it is
complex.</div><a name="09030342000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">But,
to some extent the system is necessarily complex. These are very large
sums and it is important that they are allocated fairly and that
taxpayers secure good value for their money. The economy is a complex
place; there are 25 different sectors, with different needs and
different skill levels, and so it is not sensible to expect that you
could have a simple all-encompassing system. We need something that is
simple to access and for which there is adequate guidance. That is the
important approach and the right approach, and the one that the
commission has
taken.</div><a name="09030342000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
43</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000579"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Is not the point that the Bill does not do that job
of simplifying the structure? I accept that the economy is complex, but
Sir Michael said that the system for the management of the funding of
skills was over-complex. So, does the Bill simplify the system, making
it less bureaucratic and more employer-friendly, or does it reinforce
some of the complexities that Sir Michael complained about
regarding the old
regime?</div><a name="09030342000153"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> There is a lot more work to do to achieve
that aim than just what is in the Bill, but we support the move to the
Skills Funding Agency, and the desire for it to be more demand-led. I
think that that will be in the medium to long term. There will be
disruption over the next year or so, and our concern is to ensure that
the front-line delivery that employers experience remains good. There
is a lot more to do to ensure that the system is in place than just
getting rid of the LSC and creating the Skills Funding Agency, but this
is a step in the right
direction.</div><a name="09030342000154"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
46</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000582"></a>Mr.

Bill.</div><a name="09030342000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> This is a key time for employers. Let us face
it; the economy is not going very well. To disrupt normal relationships
between LSCs, businesses and learning providers is not going to be a
positive thing. Mr. Knight said in some of his speeches
recently that companies that train are two and half times more likely
to survive the recession. I do not think that we are going to see an
increase in training at this key time because of these changes. We are
disrupting a whole system. That is
problematic.</div>

our network. I do not have any in my paperwork here. We are certainly
concerned that some of the processes about setting up the YPLA and the
transition of funding to local authorities have not been taking place
properly on the ground. For example, we know that colleges in many
areas have not been contacted at all by local authorities. The
relationships that are going to be the key underpinning of the early
part of the system are not being established. That is a real

the theme of the change in agencies and the abolition of the

support employers&#146; training, such as through Train to Gain,
really need to fit the bill. There is still a way to go to ensure that
that programme meets what employers are looking for in terms of their
skills need for their employees. Perhaps that is a discussion for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
50</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000587"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> My second, more specific, question is directed
initially to Mr. Wilson. One innovation in the workplace in
the last 10 years or so has been the introduction of trade union
learning representatives. They have played an enormous role in getting
people to undertake national vocational qualifications for the first
time. How do you see the Bill enhancing the role of trade union
learning representatives under the new
structure?</div><a name="09030342000168"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> Primarily, it will give ULRs a clear role in
accompanying people who make their request or even accompanying groups
of people. Many employers might find it more sensible and convenient to
handle training for a group of people. A ULR could help the group come
together to formulate a request like that. That is the first way.
Secondly, there is the added emphasis that it will put on training more
generally. That will help ULRs to boost their role and profile in the
workplace, and help to encourage employees to be aware of the help that
ULRs can give
them.</div><a name="09030342000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
take apprenticeships as an example, as a union movement we are trying
very hard to persuade employers to do more to back apprenticeships, and
with a great deal of success. We are pushing at an open door. That in
turn will also help ULRs and Union Learn to provide the wherewithal to
employers to help to explain the world of apprenticeships. It is very
much a partnership
approach.</div><a name="09030342000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to return to your previous question, which is relevant.
I am aware of the existing concern of a possible displacement of adult
learners by the emphasis on apprenticeships, but, to be honest, that
concern is not shared by the TUC. Certainly, we strongly welcome and
support the enormous emphasis on, and importance attached to,
apprenticeships. It is perhaps rather unfortunate that, at the same
time, there has also been a decline in some courses for adult learners,
but I do not think that the emphasis on apprenticeships has anything to
do with that. It is not as if there is a zero-sum game and one exists
at the expense of the other&#151;far from
it.</div><a name="09030342000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
very much support equal emphasis being placed on adult learners, which
I think the Government are doing. We would like to see more attention
being paid to English for speakers of other languages, and those things
will be caught up and brought forward by the
Bill.</div><a name="09030342000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
51</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000588"></a>Jeff
Ennis:</b> I wonder whether the CBI and BCC representatives
have something to say about the role that ULRs can play in the
workplace in promoting suitable training opportunities for the
businesses that they
represent.</div><a name="09030342000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Most employers with ULRs on site are
generally positive about the effect they have had. On the basic skills
agenda in particular, ULRs have often done a great job in making
employers aware that they may have literacy and numeracy problems in
their work force. There is clearly a big stigma attached to illiteracy
and innumeracy, and I think that ULRs have done a pretty good job on
that particular
issue.</div><a name="09030342000174"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> We would certainly agree with what
Mr. Wainer has
said.</div><a name="09030342000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
52</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000589"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Following on from the question on ULRs, when I
was on the same Select Committee as Jeff, I was impressed by the
evidence given by ULRs with large employers. But small businesses, of
course, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div>do not often have unions, nor are they obliged to recognise them.
Mr. Wilson, might not the duty, or the ability, for an
employee to be accompanied by a union representative be too onerous for
small businesses? Perhaps they should be exempted from that
obligation.</div><a name="09030342000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> On the contrary, it is our experience that
employers generally find it helpful to have a ULR, perhaps to
articulate a case a bit more
effectively.</div><a name="09030342000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
53</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000590"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> In small
businesses?</div><a name="09030342000178"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> Even in small businesses. When a small
business, due to time pressures, has only an hour or so to hear an
employee&#146;s request, that hour will be much more effectively used
if the employee is accompanied. I can see that this might seem rather
bureaucratic on the face of it, but I think that small businesses that
experience it will see that, on the contrary, it makes a lot more
sense.</div><a name="09030342000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000591"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> For the record, the Federation of Small
Businesses is not here to give evidence itself, but that answer is
directly contrary to what the FSB provided in its
evidence.</div><a name="09030342000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
54</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000592"></a>Mrs.

the LSC&#146;s strength and
weaknesses?</div><a name="09030342000181"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> That is a difficult question. Perhaps we can
frame it in terms of the way the Government are moving towards the new
situation and identify where change is needed. On the adult side, the
move towards a more demand-led system, which will offer more
flexibility for providers to deliver to the needs of their local
regional employers, will certainly be of benefit from the current
situation, although it will take time for us to achieve that. As I said
to Mr. Hayes, it is important that focus is maintained on
ensuring that Train to Gain apprenticeships and similar programmes
continue to meet business
needs.</div><a name="09030342000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
55</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000593"></a>Mrs.
Hodgson:</b> Do you support the idea of a wholly integrated
education and training system for all children and young people aged
from naught to 19? Also, do you support the idea of a post-19 training
system that is demand-led and that creates a one-stop shop of support
for
employers?</div><a name="09030342000183"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Clearly, you have to ensure that those are
not seen as two distinct systems and that young people do not fall off
a cliff when they get to 19 because the next system has not picked them
up. But, as long as the Government maintain focus on ensuring that that
does not happen, yes,
absolutely.</div><a name="09030342000184"></a>

56</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000595"></a>Mr.

did not think that the decline in adult learning was related to the

Government have placed on accredited level
2?</div><a name="09030342000186"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> Part of it may be. It is very complex and
many of our members would be the first to say that they like
accreditation and value the opportunity to gain qualifications. There
are mixed views and I am not sure that we can provide simple
answers.</div>

<a name="09030342000188"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom

to say that. A fairly extreme example is someone who I know recently
attended a salsa dancing class and said that that had got her back into
education and learning&#151;bizarre as it might sound&#151;and
helped her back into learning at work. I am not saying that that is a
reason for the taxpayer to fund all salsa classes. It is more
complicated than that.</div>

Hayes:</b> Should sector skills councils have a bigger
structural role than they are given in the Bill?</div>
<a name="09030342000190"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> Yes. I can amplify that. We have links with
employers right across the piece, whether or not they are members of
membership bodies. We are required to consult and engage with them all
and develop frameworks, which satisfy the employers&#146; needs in
England and UK wide. To my mind, the sector skills councils are key to
apprenticeships in general and the way that the Bill is intending to
move in
particular.</div><a name="09030342000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
59</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000598"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I have several questions; one is supplementary to
that last question. As opposed to the liberal mention in the
explanatory notes about the importance of sector skills councils in the
delivery of apprenticeships and how we effect the legislation, how do
you want us to legislate on sector skills
councils?</div><a name="09030342000192"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> The areas in which I think the sector
skills councils are particularly important are development, publication
and implementation of
frameworks.</div><a name="09030342000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
60</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000599"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> And should we mention that in primary
legislation?</div>
<a name="09030342000194"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> You specifically mentioned other
organisations and agencies in other parts of the overall system, but
not there.</div>
<a name="09030342000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
61</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000600"></a>Jim
Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>And you would like us
to?</div><a name="09030342000196"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> I would,
yes.</div><a name="09030342000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
62</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000601"></a>Jim
Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>My first general question expands that
asked by Sharon to try to bottom this out in terms of the LSC reforms.
Do the witnesses support the general principle of an adult learning
agency in the form of a post-19, demand-led skills funding agency and a
naught to 19 structure? Having moved from a divide at 16, wherever the
divide is you need to ensure that the arrangements bridging it are
smooth.</div><a name="09030342000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> I will start with a supplementary to my
previous answer, which goes back to previous comments that it is fine
to have a separate naught to 19 agency, but clearly when young people
are looking to move into the workplace, whether that is through an
apprenticeship or otherwise, it is important that local authorities or
the national agency take into account what local employers and
businesses are looking for.</div>
<a name="09030342000199"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> The tenor of our problems with this has been
the primary position given to local authorities. We are also worried
about the possible split and impact on colleges that are sixth forms as
well as further education centres. We want to ensure that colleges are
not split and that their valuable work is not damaged.</div>
<a name="09030342000200"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> To go back to the original question about the
pros and cons of the LSC, one of its great advantages over the Further
Education Funding Council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>is that it is wider and embraces a wider conception of adult learning
than just FE. While it provided a lot of clarity and consistency in
funding allocations and so on, it was a very large agency. To their
credit, the Government have tackled
that.</div><a name="09030342000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
division between the funding of youth and adult skills makes sense to
us, and I am not sure that it makes the situation much more complicated
to split the body in two. We welcome the inclusion of the National
Apprenticeship Service in the SFA because it gives a clear focus. We
welcome the statutory requirement on the chief executive to be
responsible for certain elements of the apprenticeship service. We
warmly welcome those elements of the
Bill.</div><a name="09030342000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
devolution to local authorities in the YPLA proposals is sensible. One
criticism of the LSC was that it was not sufficiently responsive to
localities and regions. Many local authorities complained that it was
too bureaucratic because it did not pay them enough attention. These
proposals give them a bigger slice of the action, with more latitude
and freedom to develop programmes and funding patterns that suit their
circumstances.</div><a name="09030342000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
transitional period will be messy, but once things have settled down
the situation should be a lot better. It will not be perfect, but it
will be
better.</div><a name="09030342000204"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> The element that concerns us most is the
transition.</div><a name="09030342000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000602"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I want to talk about that in a second. This
question is about the principle. I will ask you about transition
afterwards.</div><a name="09030342000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> As far as we are concerned, the benefit of
the LSC is that we have a single organisation with which to engage. We
recognise the regional and local structure, but I am talking about the
sectoral and spatial balance. We can talk to the LSC nationally about
sectoral issues, which will then apply across the piece. Our concern is
that once the LSC is dissolved, we will end up having not one sectoral
conversation, but dozens of them with different local
authorities.</div><a name="09030342000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
63</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000603"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> On the transition, I am interested in whether you
have any evidence to contradict my impression that, despite all the
upheaval, LSC staff are doing a good job of sticking to task. They
continue to deliver good outputs in their jobs. The period of
transition and upheaval will continue as the Bill goes through
Parliament this year and through its implementation next year. There
will obviously be a relationship between that and the economic problems
we are going through. People have different predictions about how long
those problems will continue, but the implementation phase will go on
at the same time. Have you any evidence of a disruption to the service
because of the
changes?</div><a name="09030342000208"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> I do not think that there is any evidence of
that at the moment, but that does not mean that our concerns are any
less valid. It is important that the Government prioritise ensuring
that they do not neglect front-line delivery when the minds of staff
might be on other things. I cannot point to any evidence at the moment,
but these are big changes. Our membership includes a lot of further
education colleges and private training providers that are nervous
about how local authorities will group
together.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div><a name="09030342000209"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> There is certainly nervousness within the LSC.
I am afraid that I do not have any evidence, but it would be
interesting to see the retention figures for LSC staff in various
posts. Those would show whether the uncertainty and change have caused
a loss of staff in key areas. It would be interesting to find that out.
However, I have not put in any freedom of information requests to do
that
yet.</div><a name="09030342000210"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> I would like to put on the record the
TUC&#146;s warm support. I appreciate the Minister&#146;s words of
praise for LSC staff, who not just through this transition, but through
previous transitions, have performed remarkably well and done a
terrific
job.</div><a name="09030342000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
TUC has held two meetings between the representatives of the Public and
Commercial Services Union and Unison, which are the main unions
involved in local authorities and the LSC. Officials from various
Departments have come along. Those meetings have proved helpful in
fostering good exchanges and relationships. I know that the PCS in
particular, which represents the majority of LSC staff, has worked
pretty well through this process with managers. I am not saying that it
has been perfect; these things are always difficult. Having said that,
the process is proceeding pretty much as well as could have been
reasonably expected.</div>
<a name="09030342000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> Some LSC colleagues might smile when they
hear me say that there has been no impact of that sort at all. In fact,
the key issues for us continue to progress as they should. We are
already talking in detail to the National Apprenticeship Service about
how we will work with it as the rest of the system gets rearranged
around it. The NAS is already there and clearly it is going to be a key
agency for us. We are already talking to it at a variety of levels to
do what we can to ease that
transition.</div><a name="09030342000213"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
64</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000604"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> I want to come back to you, Mr. Wilson,
about the practicalities of the right to time off. As I think you
indicated earlier, some employers may not be as enthusiastic as others
about training opportunities. Also, as Mr. Lucas indicated,
clause 39, which gives &#147;permissible grounds for refusal&#148;
of the time off to train, is pretty sweeping and pretty subjective and
general. What will you and your learning reps do if you have one of
these meetings with an employer about training and the employer says,
&#147;Sorry, we will have to turn this down,&#148; under one of
those many categories&#151;for example, &#147;detrimental impact on
quality&#148;, &#147;detrimental impact on performance&#148;,
&#147;burden of additional costs&#148; or &#147;inability to
re-organise work&#148;? What happens if people just stick two fingers
up, basically?</div>
<a name="09030342000214"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> Given the way that the Bill is framed, I do
not think that they can just &#147;stick two fingers up&#148;. They
must give a written rationale of some kind and they must root it in one
of those reasons. So, they could not just say, &#147;Sorry.&#148;
They would have to explain a little more about why it was not
appropriate.</div><a name="09030342000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
65</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000605"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> What if they cite two or three of these fairly
subjective
categories?</div><a name="09030342000216"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> They would have to provide a bit of evidence
under each category; it would not be enough just to cite a one-line
defence and say, &#147;No.&#148; That has been our experience with
the other right-to-request flexibility. The point about a learning rep
is that they can then engage an employer and say, &#147;Look, you say

<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>that this may not be practicable&#148;&#151;let us take that
example&#151;&#147;but actually here are 101 ways in which we could
perhaps think about rearranging the way that this work is done,&#148;
and they can then enter a conversation that would explain and show to
that employer that it was practicable in a way that the employer had
perhaps not thought
of.</div><a name="09030342000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just
to complete this point, our experience of the other right-to-request is
that this was very much the type of anxiety and concern that employers
had before that right-to-request was implemented, but the practice has
been that concerns of that sort were unfounded. The latest figures show
that about 75 per cent. of all requests were granted immediately and of
the other 25 per cent., the great majority were also granted
after further
discussion.</div><a name="09030342000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
66</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000606"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> So you do not anticipate that you will need to take
any action through tribunals or other
methods?</div><a name="09030342000219"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> We would certainly hope
not.</div><a name="09030342000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000607"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> You are optimistic or
pessimistic?</div><a name="09030342000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Tom
Wilson:</b></i> We are optimistic. We always believe in the
goodness of British employers. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Laughter.</i><i class="I">]</i> We are
also quite sure that our learning reps have the capacity to persuade
them to see the error of their ways if they do not see it themselves
the first time
round.</div><a name="09030342000222"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> The evidence, in terms of tribunal claims on
the flexible working side, shows that the system is working well. Our
survey results also show that the vast majority of requests are
accepted. About 95 per cent. of requests are accepted, either, as Tom
said, immediately or through a compromise being agreed. There are very
few tribunal claims. So, if we can replicate that success with this
legislation and if it is generally framed in the same terms, I cannot
foresee too many
problems.</div><a name="09030342000223"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
67</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000608"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> John, from your position of somewhat greater
scepticism or distinct lack of enthusiasm, can you envisage a large
number of claims against the judgments of employers that will be made
under the &#147;permissible grounds for refusal&#148;? Do you think
that this will be an area of dispute between employers and
employees?</div><a name="09030342000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">John
Lucas:</b></i> I do not think that there will be a massive
tribunal process related to this and I think that that reflects what is
perhaps the needlessness of this legislation as part of the Bill.
Employers are very committed to training and it is important for them
to have a skilled work force; I underline that point. As I said before,
I do not think that this is the right way to go about achieving that.
As a result, I do not think that there will be a large number of
appeals going through because of this piece of
legislation.</div><a name="09030342000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
68</b><a name="09030342000609"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I apologise for being
late; I was in a Delegated Legislation Committee. If these questions
have already been asked, please disregard
them.</div><a name="09030342000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
first question relates to the Select Committee report on the draft
Apprenticeships Bill, which commented that the relationship between
diplomas and apprenticeships 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>was not entirely clear. Do you have a view on whether that situation has
changed as a result of this legislation, or do you think that there
needs to be further
amendment?</div><a name="09030342000227"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i> The situation with regard to fitting
diplomas and apprenticeships together is improving because of how the
frameworks are being developed, taking into account the fact that
people now have a better understanding&#151;where diplomas are in
place&#151;of what they look like and the progress they are making. I
am not necessarily certain that it is an issue for this particular
legislation; I think that it is happening
anyway.</div><a name="09030342000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are six skills councils very heavily involved in the development and
implementation of diplomas and they are developing frameworks with
detailed knowledge of what the diplomas look like and the direction of
travel, so it makes sense to ensure that they fit
together.</div><a name="09030342000229"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
69</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000610"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> So, you see the linkages moving forward
positively?</div><a name="09030342000230"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Keith
Marshall:</b></i>
Absolutely.</div><a name="09030342000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
70</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000611"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> Would employers have any views on
that?</div><a name="09030342000232"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> Clearly, progression between diplomas and
apprenticeships is important. The issue is ensuring that
apprenticeships are designed with diplomas in
mind.</div><a name="09030342000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
71</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000612"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> May I come back to the capacity for assessing a
significant number of new apprentices? Are there sectors where there
are capacity issues in terms of the assessment of a significantly
larger number of apprentices coming into the
system?</div><a name="09030342000234"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> The frameworks, as they stand and are likely
to be in future, consist of a number of different qualifications. The
assessment of those individual qualifications tends to be done by the
awarding bodies. There are issues around assessment, but this goes
wider than that, with the changes in the qualification frameworks that
are happening at the same time adding to the complexity. However, I do
not think that there is necessarily an issue simply because of the
number of apprentices. No, there are issues, but that is not the
reason.</div><a name="09030342000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000613"></a>The
Chairman:</b> We have time for a very quick last question.
Does the Minister want to have the last
word?</div><a name="09030342000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
72</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000614"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Richard, the new SFA will consist of Train to Gain,
which is all about the National Apprenticeship Service making
apprenticeships work for employers. The SFA design seems to me to be a
really business-friendly, business-focused organisation, which is
intended to work for business and will be demand led and employer led.
What do you
think?</div><a name="09030342000237"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Richard
Wainer:</b></i> In principle, that is right. The issue for
employers will be how Train to Gain, the NAS and the national employer
service work together to ensure that employers are not receiving phone
calls from different agencies about different
things.</div><a name="09030342000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue for employers is to make sure that, wherever they go within the
system, they are either dealt with or directed to someone who can help.
It does not really matter what the SFA is doing behind the scenes or
what the wiring looks like.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div><a name="09030342000239"></a>

question.</div><a name="09030342000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
74</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000618"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My question is aimed at Graham and Julian. Do you
welcome the new involvement of local authorities in dealing with
colleges and directing them to some
degree?</div><a name="09030342000249"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> The colleges that we represent see many
positives in the involvement of local authorities, particularly if it
gets us towards a common system of 16-to-19 funding and performance
management so that every young person in an area gets the same
resources and the same treatment, regardless of where they study. We
have some concerns about the 300,000 young people who travel across
local authority borders to a college or a school in different areas.
The important thing is the structure that sits above local authorities
to make sure that we do not get a form of nimbyism into 16-to-19
education, because there have been some positives in the national
funding of the planning system. We are concerned to make sure that
there is an appropriate balance.</div>
<a name="09030342000250"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> There is quite a lot common ground there with
the AOC. Our concern is whether local authorities will be able to
co-operate in the model that has been set up for sub-regional groups.
It is important for colleges&#151;sixth-form colleges and general FE
colleges&#151;which recruit over quite a wide area, that we do not
revert to the situation pre-incorporation when every local authority
had to have every bell and whistle. I am 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column27" />Column number: 27</div>not yet confident that that structure is meaningfully established. Local
authority politicians quite rightly feel very strongly that it is their
area and their decision to commission. That issue has not been
resolved. It certainly adds considerable complexity to the way in which
colleges have to operate. If the prize of consistency at the local
level can be achieved, maybe that is a price worth paying. But I think
that we need to be convinced
yet.</div><a name="09030342000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
75</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000619"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The operation of FE colleges will surely be
complicated by the statutory rights of local education authorities to
fund and plan education and to direct colleges to accept particular
students. Indeed, the AOC brief, reinforced by the 157 Group brief,
makes it clear that that is a concern. You talk about not confusing the
role of LEAs with the leadership of colleges. Clearly, there are
profound concerns about that. What is your estimate of the number of
local authorities a college would have to deal with? Will that not be a
bureaucratic
muddle?</div><a name="09030342000252"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> Just about every single college, apart from
a couple in Cumbria and one on the Isle of Wight, recruits people from
elsewhere. Every college in a sense has to pay attention to other local
authorities. The system will be that the college will deal with its own
local authority. We think that that is right, given the decision to
have the funding. We have worked hard in the last year to ensure that
colleges and local authorities understand each other and that there is
a stronger relationship. Our concerns on the Bill are that some of the
demarcations between colleges and local authorities are not that clear
and there are quite a few things that we would like to have had
clarified; for example, the contractual relationships, the audit
relationships and so on, which are not in the Bill. That is something
that we will have to
discuss.</div><a name="09030342000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
76</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000620"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Delivering funding for further education and
sixth-form colleges through local authorities and the Young
People&#146;s Learning Agency is likely to create greater confusion,
is it not? How can it be reconciled with the model of self-regulation
which Andrew Foster recommended and both the AOC and the 157 Group
endorsed?</div><a name="09030342000254"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> We suggested in our response to the White
Paper that there should be one rather than two national agencies. We
also suggested that the Government were not ambitious enough in the
savings that they were making through the process. There are 3,300
staff in the Learning and Skills Council and we understand that all
will be transferred somewhere else. It might have made sense to look at
a more streamlined structure.</div>
<a name="09030342000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
self-regulation agenda, a key thing would be how these different
agencies and the local authorities behave in the future. We do not
think that the argument is lost but, in the short term, there will be a
slightly more complex structure that will be difficult to
navigate.</div>
<a name="09030342000256"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> The independence of academies is strongly
guarded. The Government have been discussing that recently. In a sense,
the great strength of colleges is their independence&#151;their
ability to look at the situation locally. I welcome in the Bill the
commitment to economic and social well-being, which is absolutely what
we are all about. So, we are not about to turn people away, but 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column28" />Column number: 28</div>there is a great difference between instructing people to do something
and working in partnership with them and other providers locally to
make certain that the area gets the education that it wants. Whether
that is because we are all controlled by the local authority or whether
it would happen anyway is a moot point. We feel, as I am sure most
colleges feel, very involved in the local community already,
irrespective of the fact that we are not part of the local authority
structure.</div>

get into trouble with the Chairman, I will ask you to be brief with
your replies. What do you most dislike in the Bill and what would you
most like to be amended by us? Feel free to be as critical as you
like.</div><a name="09030342000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000622"></a>Jim

like.</div><a name="09030342000259"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Serwotka:</b></i> We have concerns about different elements
of the Bill. I have been in correspondence with Jim and Si&#244;n
about schedule 7 which, as a trade union, is our No. 1 concern. It
would legislate for the transfer of LSC staff into other organisations.
Our advice is that the schedule has either been badly drafted or, for
whatever reason, removes certain employment rights, which is clearly
something that we are concerned
about.</div><a name="09030342000260"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Igoe:</b></i> In our submission, sixth-form colleges are
broadly supportive of the new arrangements because we think that there
is more coherence in having local authorities, which are primarily
responsible for the strategic direction of schools, also having major
responsibility for the strategic direction of colleges. We share
concerns about losing our independence because we think one reason for
the success of sixth-form colleges is that they have been able to
direct their own progress in a way that is now well documented. It is
the old adage of the devil is in the detail.</div>
<a name="09030342000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
particularly concerned about the performance management arrangements.
We are not convinced that Framework for Excellence is, at the moment,
an instrument that is particularly fit for purpose in helping
commissioners&#151;the local authority&#151;to make judgments about
the institutions that they have to fund. There has to be an awful lot
more work on that.</div>
<a name="09030342000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">Notwithstanding
that, there is a lot here that will make sense of the 14-to-19
landscape in this country, and we welcome that coming together as
envisaged in the
Bill.</div><a name="09030342000263"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> Clause 43 replaces a clause that has not
been used since 1992 because it was not necessary due to disability
discrimination legislation, and we therefore feel that it has the
potential to be misused. This is the clause that allows the local
authority to name an individual and require the governing body to admit
them. It is not necessary, and we have explained why in our
evidence.</div><a name="09030342000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> We broadly welcome the moves for sixth-form
colleges in the same way that the Sixth Form Colleges Forum does. I
would cite, and hope to have an opportunity later to expand on, some of
the possible unintended consequences of the move of sixth-form colleges
to a greater homeland with local authorities. There are possible
dangers among the
opportunities.</div><a name="09030342000265"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> Our principal feeling about the Bill is
frustration at a missed opportunity. As with the split into the two
Departments, it works well in terms of coherence for children, but it
moves the incoherence to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>elsewhere in the system, for adults. My serious concern about the Bill
is that the recession has made a significant difference to the
employment focus and the employment-driven nature of Government
investment post-19, and very large numbers of people will not be able
to benefit directly from that. At the same time, with an ageing
demographic very large numbers of people will be managing significant
periods of their life beyond the conventional labour market, whether
they are working or
not.</div><a name="09030342000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since
we are revisiting the division between rights and obligations in
relation to young people and adults, this seems like a missed
opportunity to take a fresh look at that and provide a redefinition. In
that context, the timing of the separation of the LSC into two agencies
at a national level compounds the challenge to be responsive enough to
rapidly changing external economic and social circumstances. So, our
concern is that coherence for 14-to-19-years-olds might be bought in
terms of loss of coherence and opportunity for adults. There are things
that we like in the Bill, but that is our main
concern.</div><a name="09030342000267"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> The most worrying issue is how the Skills
Funding Agency has been established. The Young People&#146;s Learning
Agency and the Higher Education Funding Council are two relatively slim
organisations, and we have this very large SFA, which is broadly
transferring more staff than are actually employed by the LSC. So, it
will be a big, chunky structure. It will not be the slimline funding
agency that we were originally promised. It seems that it will perhaps
have all the disadvantages that the big, bureaucratic LSC has brought
to the scene, and I would like a serious rethink
there.</div><a name="09030342000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
it is going to be an interventionist structure&#151;and it looks like
one&#151;I do not think it appropriate that it is run from within the
Department. If it is going to operate, I would be happier to see it
with a board, being accountable to the sector and the providers. So,
the structure of the SFA is a missed opportunity, and I would like to
see much more power and action at local level, between local
authorities, providers, employers groups and so on, which is where the
difference has to be
made.</div><a name="09030342000269"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Serwotka:</b></i> I want to come back on a couple of points
that have been raised on the size of the Learning and Skills Council
and on whether this is a missed opportunity to make people redundant
and so on. The LSC is actually a very slimline organisation. Its
running costs&#151;its admin budget against its turnover&#151;are
very low compared with those of similar organisations. The idea that
the new agencies could be run with fewer staff than the LSC is
unrealistic.</div><a name="09030342000270"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
78</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000623"></a>Mr.
Laws:</b> Do you think that it will take more
staff?</div><a name="09030342000271"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Serwotka:</b></i> The full-time posts are replicated in the
new structures and that is the right approach in the current
circumstances. As Ann said, we have an economic crisis on our hands,
and the SFA and the YPLA need to be organisations that can respond
rapidly to redundancies and the like. This is not the time to cut
people who have skills and an understanding of the types of
interventions that are
needed.</div><a name="09030342000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000624"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Which of the two Ministers wants to
speak?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div><a name="09030342000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000625"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I shall of course give way to
Si&#244;n.</div><a name="09030342000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
79</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000626"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I will carry on questioning Ruth. On the adult
side, there will be new structures and the same number of people will
be dealing with several things that the LSC does not deal with such as
the National Apprenticeship Service, the expansion of Train to Gain,
the Adult Advancement and Careers Service and the skills accounts. Do
you agree therefore that the administrative, regulatory and
prescriptive side of what the LSC does will effectively be slimmed down
and streamlined because the headcount will be the
same?</div><a name="09030342000275"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Serwotka:</b></i> I agree that the new organisation will take
on new work. The LSC is taking on new work within its current
headcount, while it has a 17 per cent. vacancy rate. Before you think
about losing staff, you have to think about setting up the National
Apprenticeship Service, which will be established using the staff of
the LSC. You either jeopardise that service, or you have to run it
within the current headcount. I agree that it is important to ensure
that the staff who have the skills for the current system are retained
for the future. There have been discussions about the importance of
that between Si&#244;n and Jim and the PCS and within the
LSC.</div><a name="09030342000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may say so Si&#244;n, we are concerned about the locations of the
SFA. We have been told that there will be between 18 and 24 locations.
I do not know if the Committee is aware that the LSC has 47 locations,
which allows for partnership working and relationship management with
local authorities. Those important relationships could easily be lost
in the new structures. Given the economic climate, it is important for
the Ministers and the Committee to consider whether the locations of
the SFA should be increased, especially when there is a possibility of
offices sitting vacant with no staff. We could have local, flexible and
responsive staff in those
locations.</div><a name="09030342000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
80</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000627"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I wanted to ask Julian something else, but does he
want to say something briefly on that
issue?</div><a name="09030342000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> I have to agree that the SFA will do a
different job from the LSC and that it needs to be appropriately
staffed. Our concern is that there seem to be a lot of staff,
especially when compared to the equivalent agencies in Scotland and for
higher education. We accept that those have a narrower range of duties.
Colleges will have to make redundancies this year because of changes in
demand for adult learning and the changes in Government funding. There
is a difficult climate, but this seems to us to be a missed opportunity
in the
changes.</div><a name="09030342000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
81</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000628"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The previous group of witnesses said that we should
not do this now, that the current staff will not be able to cope in the
economic climate and that the strains and stresses are too much. You
are effectively saying the opposite, which is that the problem is that
we are leaving too many staff and not making the organisation slim
enough. Do you think that the truth might lie somewhere in the middle,
where we have located
it?</div><a name="09030342000280"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> This is a complicated change. It is the
biggest change in the funding and regulation of colleges for nine years
and there must be enough time to ensure that it is done properly and
that people are placed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>correctly. We think that it is possible to put a change through in 2010.
We are nervous about the change across to local government, but I am
confident that the colleges will make it
work.</div><a name="09030342000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
82</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000629"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> There has been a ballyhoo about how complicated it
is going to be and how colleges will be unable to cope with that.
However, the new Skills Funding Agency will have a single account
management structure and a single funding conversation for colleges on
the adult side. Do your members not tell you that that is positive
compared with the multiple conversations that they currently have with
the LSC and other funding bodies, and that they look forward to
it?</div><a name="09030342000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> The complication comes from the split at
19.</div><a name="09030342000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
83</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000630"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> But on the adult
side?</div><a name="09030342000284"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> The main issue on the adult side is that the
Skills Funding Agency works in a joined-up way with the YPLA and local
authorities, so we are particularly keen that clause 119, which allows
it to share data, will actually require it to work in concert as
well.</div><a name="09030342000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
84</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000631"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> But is a single account structure for colleges a
positive
thing?</div><a name="09030342000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> Yes it is, with the proviso that it is only
for the adult area and that colleges have more of their work in the
16-to-19 area for both education and
apprenticeships.</div><a name="09030342000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
85</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000632"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> May I ask Graham about the single account point? We
are trying to make it
easier.</div><a name="09030342000288"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> There are two things to remember. A single
account is clearly a good idea; I do not think that anybody would
dispute that. It is what the account and its complexity are all about.
You have to remember that the SFA does not actually deliver anything.
The delivery has to be done through the provider network with employers
and so on, which is where you want to put most resources to ensure that
you can do the maximum to help the
nation.</div><a name="09030342000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
you look at the complexity behind that single voice from the SFA, you
will see that it is about its funding methodology and its rules and
regulations on what you can and cannot do. You are not actually saying,
&#147;We want to make a difference. These are the issues in your
community, and the employers say this and the local authorities say
that.&#148; You try to come to an agreement on how to address the
Government&#146;s priorities in your local area, and I stress that
that is where the difference needs to be made, and not on a national
level. The strategy is quite clear and we all know what needs to be
done. You need a relatively simple, unbureaucratic system, and I am not
certain that with 1,800 people you will actually get
that.</div><a name="09030342000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000633"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Mr. Tuckett wants to join
in.</div><a name="09030342000291"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> There will inevitably be quite a lot of
transitional traction for people who do not chronologically grow at the
rate that our legislative arrangements plan for them: adults with
learning difficulties at 26 whose needs are no different from those of
24-year-olds, for example, or young offenders aged 18 to 24, rather
than 16 to 18. The issues relating to negotiation between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column32" />Column number: 32</div>young people&#146;s funding agencies, the SFA and local authorities to
ensure that individuals do not get lost along the way seem to be as
significant as the coherence issue for institutions, since the devil is
always in the detail for post-compulsory participation,
Si&#244;n.</div><a name="09030342000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
previous group that gave evidence was asked about the business-friendly
side of SFA, which I am sure is right. But the risk is that the wider
economic and social well-being and responsibility, which are very
clearly located in young people&#146;s work, will be harder to secure
as a coherent dialogue between the different funding agencies to enable
institutions to operate in a holistic
way.</div><a name="09030342000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
86</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000634"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> The London Apprenticeship Company was recently
established, and the Federation of Small Businesses states that the
company has been particularly useful in helping small and medium-sized
enterprises in London to find apprenticeship places and match them up
with small employers. The AOC&#146;s evidence seems to encourage
group training associations, which are largely the same. Do you think
that the Bill goes far enough in facilitating group training
arrangements?</div><a name="09030342000294"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> It is not necessary to legislate on every
area of activity that you want to achieve. Sometimes, the main issue is
ensuring that legislation does not have unintended consequences and
does not make it more difficult to achieve certain things. I do not
know the details of the London apprenticeship arrangements, but I
certainly know that colleges are working across the country on
arrangements with small employers to develop apprenticeships. Our
concern is about the restriction that the apprentice must be employed
at all stages. In some cases and in group arrangements with small
employers, it might cover the risks if, for example, the colleges or a
third party employed apprentices and they are placed in different
places. So our concern is to ensure that there are not unintended
consequences from how the Bill is
phrased.</div><a name="09030342000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
87</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000635"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> To be clear about that, the Association of
Colleges would welcome the opportunity&#151;perhaps the 157 Group
might want to comment on this too&#151;for colleges to be the formal
employer of an apprentice in a programme-led apprenticeship
programme.</div>
<a name="09030342000296"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> Colleges already are the
formal employer of a couple of thousand apprentices and we have
plans to encourage that further, for example, through our contractors,
such as those constructing college buildings, so that they can
employ apprentices. Our concern is to ensure that the way that the Bill
is phrased and then implemented does not create an unintended
obstacle.</div>

88</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000636"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> In response to the first question, we heard from
the Local Government Association that there are anxieties about working
across local authority borders. Clearly, there are an awful lot of new
responsibilities for local authorities in the Bill. So my first
question is, broadly, how do you think that some of the transition
preparation work is going, from a local government
perspective?</div>
<a name="09030342000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">My second
question is specifically related to clauses 47 to 50, which
are about young offenders. I know that the numbers are relatively
small; we are talking about 3,000 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>young people here who would become the responsibility of the local
authority. How confident are you that the transition and the care that
those young people receive will be handled smoothly and well? I ask
that because the last thing we want is those young people, who in some
cases are already struggling with education provision, again falling
between two stools of local authorities arguing about funding or
anything
else.</div><a name="09030342000299"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> There is a lot of good will at local authority
level, and I have been party to some negotiations at local level,
although I am sure that negotiations are different across the country.
So officers clearly want to work together to try to make this system
work. The issue is about the politicians, their role and their loyalty,
if you like, to their community, which makes it a little difficult for
officers to give up some authority to neighbouring local authorities
when sometimes local authorities have fought very hard to gain their
independence and control. That is an area of
concern.</div><a name="09030342000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were also particularly concerned with the relatively small number of
young offenders that you are talking about. Again, that is an added
complexity for local authorities, which, it seems to me, do not need
those added complexities at the moment. If we can see that more as part
of a national scheme that we are supporting, local authorities&#146;
responsibility comes when the young offenders have to be placed back in
the community and in the normal education system. That is where I would
like to see the local authorities focus their attention. They should
make certain that there are proper transitional arrangements, so that
when somebody comes out of an institution, they are properly looked
after and there is proper funding attached to them, so that they can
have the right sort of education to come back into the community, and
get the skills that will make them a full part of the community rather
than an outcast.</div>
<a name="09030342000301"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
89</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000637"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I want to ask Alan Tuckett a question. How far do
you think the Bill will go in reversing the serious decline in the
number of adult and community learning places? There has been a decline
of 1.4 million in the last few years, according to the National
Institute of Careers Education and Counselling.</div>
<a name="09030342000302"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> I do not think that the Bill, in its current
form, addresses the issues that the Government will address through the
informal adult learning White Paper, which is around the corner. So it
is the articulation of that policy, which is soon to be announced, that
will help us to be in a position to make a judgment about the net
effect
overall.</div><a name="09030342000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we have concerns about the current framing of the legislative weight
attached post-19 to educational opportunities, that is the definitions
in the Bill. You asked a question earlier about the extent to which, in
our proper concern to get a skilled and educated work force, routes
other than formal qualifications help towards that end. We have real
concerns that a demand-led system, driven in the way that the White
Paper illustrated and the Bill backs up, will not allow adequately for
individuals to be trusted to find their own routes towards
learning.</div>
<a name="09030342000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although Tom
Wilson said very firmly that we do not have to see education and
training as a zero-sum game, in practice what happens is a transfer of
resources from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div>relatively intensive investment in a smaller number of people away from
extensive engagement with very large numbers of people and, frankly, we
need both in a learning society. We need to help people to put their
toe in the water, and I do not see that encouragement here. The
arrangements for stimulating and encouraging people are not permissive
enough for people who did not enjoy education and training the first
time around. We need to encourage them to be effective learners if they
are to re-engage with&#151;and sustain realistic sustainable work
in&#151;the labour market.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
90</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000638"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> So a more responsive system might involve a slimmer
system altogether: deregulated colleges, a bottom-up approach, a highly
localised system that placed more emphasis on a diversity of individual
learning requirements&#151;credited, non-accredited, different routes
back into
learning.</div><a name="09030342000306"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> I do not know if it is slimmer, but it is
certainly more locally determined. The dilemma is that there are things
that you need to plan nationally&#151;clear, national strategic
interventions around major skills needs&#151;but for most adults
re-engaging with learning, decision making is made at an extremely
local level and you need to be able to engage there. Providers need to
be able to respond to demands in their immediate patch, and what is
true in Stoke will not be true in
Brighton.</div><a name="09030342000307"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
91</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000639"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> I have one final question. The 157 Group says that
it is concerned about the levels of powers coming to the Skills Funding
Agency in producing draft specifications for apprenticeship framing
standards. Both the Association of Colleges and the 157 Group have
argued that there is not enough about capital funding for further
education in the Bill.</div>
<a name="09030342000308"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> It is a big crisis at the moment. In the
sector we are looking to some progress from the LSC and the Department,
but how many separate capital funding flows should we have for
education? How should we be organising them? Are we looking at them in
a joined-up way? What do we want the education sector to look like?
What do we want our universities, colleges and schools to look like?
Could we not have a joined-up, consistent and properly-funded capital
policy?</div>
<a name="09030342000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
it is not a very good time to say those things, because times are
getting hard, but colleges have been put into a situation where most of
us who want new buildings have put substantial money into the
preliminary process. Some &#163;100 million or so in the sector is at
risk. To have one plan, and now another plan coming forward, is causing
us some disquiet and may put the viability of institutions at
risk&#151;it is significant. Our plea is just that there should be a
joined-up process. Is the Bill an opportunity to chart what a capital
strategy for education might look
like?</div><a name="09030342000310"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> I want to add that of those colleges,
several are sixth-form colleges, so we have the same concerns. Looking
to the future, one suggestion that we have put forward is that there
should be, at least in the transition period of the new machinery, a
common capital fund for all colleges&#151;including sixth-form
colleges&#151;to try to avoid any tying up of sixth-form colleges,
newly, with Building Schools for the Future where they might be behind,
or ahead, of the local authorities that they are
joining.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
92</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000640"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> I shall resist the temptation to start a debate
about the huge growth in capital funding for FE colleges and put my
question in the negative, just to save time. Is there anyone, from the
witnesses here, who disagreed with raising the participation age, and
who therefore disagrees with the consequent shifting of the break in
education from 16 to 19?</div>
<a name="09030342000312"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> We fully supported
it.</div><a name="09030342000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> On the second half of your question, not the
first, the shift from 16 to 19 merely displaces the point at which
people who are not ready, or who drop out and drop back in again, find
the system does not work for them. Our institution&#146;s perspective
is that by 25 pretty much everybody is experiencing the common
experiences of adult life but, for many people up until that age, and
if you include higher education in particular, labour market entry or
preparation for adult life is their co-ordinating
focus.</div><a name="09030342000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not disagree with raising the education participation age in the
legislation, but I think that the temptation is to collect statistics
at 19, which disguises the complexity of later maturing. That is a
problem for us in planning for the long
run.</div>
<a name="09030342000315"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
93</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000641"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> That is helpful. The temptation is around
25.</div><a name="09030342000316"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> You are not raising the school leaving age;
you are raising the participation age, and I think that the Bill has a
significant gap in it. It talks about full-time education and
apprenticeships, but it is very vague about other duties employers
might have that take on 16 to 18-year-olds and are not offering an
apprenticeship. The way the Bill is drafted, they could get away with
almost any sort of training and it might
qualify.</div><a name="09030342000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
also put an onus on the employee to request training, but the duty
should be placed on the employer. If you take on somebody under 19, you
should not have any choice but to provide a proper quality training
programme. It does not have to be an apprenticeship, but the Bill
leaves that wide open to abuse.</div>
<a name="09030342000318"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
94</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000642"></a>Jim
Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>I will resist giving a lecture on what was
in the recently passed Education and Skills Act 2008 and, in view of
the time, ask a second slightly negative question. Given the broad, but
not complete, support for making the break at 19, do any witnesses
think that there is a better way of aggregating local authority
commissioning of post-16 learning to create the single conversation,
rather than the sub-regional grouping brokered by the YPLA route, which
we designed and is reflected in the
legislation?</div><a name="09030342000319"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> The AOC has been very closely involved in
the development of sub-regional groups, which we welcome. It will be
important, with the local government role, to recognise the differences
between different parts of the country. We have slight reservations
about the different 16-to-19 institutions being commissioned at
different levels depending on the details&#151;for example, school
sixth forms and sixth-form colleges being commissioned by the home
local authority, FE colleges by the sub-regional group, and certain,
not yet known, national providers being commissioned at national
level.</div><a name="09030342000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
suggested early on that it might have made more sense for it all to be
done by the sub-regional group in places, such as London and
Manchester, where there is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div>lots of trouble across boundaries, for example, and for it all to be
done by the county in other parts of the country&#151;often the shire
counties&#151;where there is not much movement outside. It is not
something specifically covered in the Bill and there is always the
opportunity to see how it
works.</div><a name="09030342000321"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
95</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000643"></a>Jim

structure in the Bill, but with some implementation
issues.</div><a name="09030342000322"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> Yes, and it remains to be seen exactly how
it will work. There will also be areas, such as where unitary councils
have been created, where working together may cause
problems.</div><a name="09030342000323"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000644"></a>Jim
Knight:</b><b class="B"> </b>Ruth, then David and then Ann, if that is
all right, Mr.
Chope.</div><a name="09030342000324"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ruth
Serwotka:</b></i> I do not think that I have an answer for
Jim about a better way of doing it, but we have concerns about the
proposals. Taking London as an example, you have, I think, 33
authorities that will combine in a single sub-regional group and are
then supposed to commission learning across boundaries, but have no
statutory implement or authority to do so. They are supposed to be
commissioning and planning on quite an informal
basis.</div><a name="09030342000325"></a><div class="hs_Para">Trying
to get 33 local authorities to agree on priorities and on the
complexity of the cross-boundary travel-to-learn patterns and so on is
going to be very challenging indeed. One of our previous proposals,
which I doubt everyone on this panel would accept, is that instead of
arrangements being made around sub-regional groupings and staff being
transferred to local authorities to set up those commissioning
relationships, there should be more centralism with regard to the YPLA
and Governments should have a closer relationship with the
commissioning, especially when, in the current climate, bogus
providers, as <i class="I">The Observer </i>recently reported, are setting
themselves up and pretending to deliver courses to the unemployed. That
could be abused in the current system, so we need to think about the
current climate and maybe review some of those structures, because they
are very
informal.</div><a name="09030342000326"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Igoe:</b></i> Julian implied that the arrangements for
sixth-form colleges and schools will be different from those for FE
colleges because they will be commissioned by the local authority while
FE will be commissioned by the sub-regional group. I do not think that
that is quite right, because it has been shown that sixth-form
colleges, with regard to cross-border recruitment, are at least as
complex as FE, so sixth-form colleges will certainly want to be part of
the sub-regional conversation and feature in it. Of course, work will
need to be done on the detail of exactly how the two will
interrelate.</div><a name="09030342000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I,
too, am a sixth-form college principal, and I find that in
conversations on the ground we do not really mind who comes and has the
conversation with sixth-form colleges about how much money we will
have, so long as the amount is right and fair. We are getting bogged
down in that process. Whatever the arrangements, they have to be fair
and be seen to be fair, which relates to my first point, and that will
depend on the instruments used to judge where funding is
placed.</div><a name="09030342000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
that will be the primary responsibility of the YPLA, or whether local
authorities will have to take on board a national scheme of performance
management so that they are confident that they are commissioning
places in the right way, is where that particular process 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>will stand or fall. How many processes and levels it goes through,
whether local, regional or sub-regional, is much less of a concern than
how and by what means the pot is divvied up, and we need that to be a
transparent
process.</div><a name="09030342000329"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> I agree with David entirely about that but
worry about unintended consequences, because although I do not suppose
that you could commission without taking the sixth-form college
perspective into account&#151;it is a sort of chicken and egg
situation&#151;it is possible that some local authorities will limit
student choice by seeing sixth-form colleges as very much more
local than they currently are in their recruitment. We hope that local
authorities will in no way become proprietorial about their sixth-form
colleges and try to limit their places to students within
their boundaries.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
96</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000645"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> Do you think that the duty to give impartial
advice, as set out in the Education and Skills Act 2008, is pertinent
to
that?</div><a name="09030342000331"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> I think that it is and that the intention
is absolutely right. It is just how it is managed in practice that
worries me, because there is almost exactly the same recruitment across
borough boundaries for sixth-form colleges as there is for general FE
colleges. That is one of their great strengths: they recruit students
from areas where sometimes there is no good sixth-form provision and
take them into a large community that is, by research and reputation,
often mixed to a degree that their local area is not. That provides
opportunities for students from deprived areas to get high-quality
education outside their own boroughs where necessary, and we would be
very unwise to lose that strength when making new arrangements for
sixth-form
colleges.</div><a name="09030342000332"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> I believe that there is another way. If we
genuinely believe in demand-led funding and that funding should follow
the learner, which we have talked an awful lot about, a sum of money
should be attached to every individual, and having been given good
advice and guidance, they should be able to chose which institution
best suits their needs, and the funding should
follow.</div><a name="09030342000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
are committed to funding those individuals anyway, although you do not
have to have commissioning in the same way. You focus local authorities
on the quality of the providers on their patch and the gaps in
provision. You then work by exception, which is a much lighter load for
local authorities. They are not interfering all the time; they are
simply intervening when they and their community are short-changed. If
you embrace demand-led funding, attach money to individuals and let
those individuals choose where they go, so that whichever institution
they go to, you get the same sum of money. That gets rid of some of the
problems about differential funding for different institutions, which
cause us a lot of angst, and means that those individuals will have a
good
choice.</div><a name="09030342000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will all be out there offering our wares, trying to make them as
attractive and relevant as possible. It is a less planned approach, but
a fairer and more sensible one. It will lead to some decline and some
expansion, but that is what the system should
do.</div><a name="09030342000335"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> The danger is for people who cannot make
those choices independently or who drop out of the system. They need
somebody&#146;s active intervention to look after their interests and
needs.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
97</b><a name="09030342000647"></a><b class="B">Annette
Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I want to change
track and look at the new duties to co-operate with relevant partners
and to promote well-being, which some of you have already touched
on.</div><a name="09030342000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some
institutions have made the point that the duty to co-operate will
affect their independence. I am interested in how positively or
negatively you see those new
duties.</div><a name="09030342000340"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> When the AOC was consulted about the duty to
co-operate, as in clause 184, we said that on balance we thought it the
right thing to do, but that it should also cover academies,
universities and further education. So, we are glad that the Government
listened to what we and the LGA said. We have some nervousness about
another potential set of meetings for college leaders, but we see that
colleges make a vital contribution to the wider agenda of the
children&#146;s trusts and that it is better to be within that
alongside schools, rather than without
it.</div><a name="09030342000341"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> We are wholly in favour of it. We think that
the reification of the independence of institutions at the expense of
people who drop through the hoops in a system where there is not enough
resource to go round makes the duty to co-operate really
welcome.</div><a name="09030342000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
98</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000648"></a>Annette
Brooke:</b> Thank you. Another duty you will have relates to
when force is used on students. Do you see that as onerous? Do you feel
there is sufficient training in the use of force and in the reporting,
which will be quite
significant?</div><a name="09030342000343"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> We would welcome it&#151;to be used
carefully and with training for people to understand what it means and
how to exercise powers. We should take on those responsibilities very
seriously as part of the pastoral care of the student body and of
individuals.</div>
<a name="09030342000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
99</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000649"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Is there great likelihood of local authorities
becoming proprietorial? Are they more or less likely to do so? Would
any of you, if you had started with a blank sheet of paper, have
constructed a management and funding regime of the type in the Bill,
particularly with local authority
involvement?</div><a name="09030342000345"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Igoe:</b></i> From a sixth-form college perspective, as I
said at the outset, we are relatively relaxed about not going back to
where we were&#151;everyone recognises there is no going
back&#151;but having stronger involvement with local authorities. It
makes sense in terms of planning the local provision, which has to
include schools, colleges and, increasingly, FE colleges. It is a lot
more complicated than people understood. It was not well understood how
many young people were in FE
generally.</div><a name="09030342000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">Birmingham
is an interesting example. I was dealing with some figures on it last
week and 57 per cent. of  16 to 18-year-olds still in education
are in FE colleges. That does not include those in sixth-form colleges
because they make up another 15 per cent. Only 23 per cent. of
Birmingham&#146;s 16 to 18-year-olds are in schools. Looking at how
that cohort of young people is educated demonstrates that this is a
complex picture.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div><a name="09030342000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">There should
be a single authority to look at that, otherwise there will be the
endless see-saw that we have experienced over the last few years. We
need and want to co-operate with all the providers in our patch, but
find ourselves in an intensely competitive environment. That is almost
impossible to manage and we would like some relief from
it.</div><a name="09030342000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
go back to whether the local authority will interfere with our
independence and our ability to recruit in the way that we want, we do
not think that it will, provided that the fundamental principles
underlying the Bill are followed. We will see how that works in
practice. The principle is that the funding must follow the learner. We
must be vigilant so that restrictive practice is not allowed to creep
in, either by the removal of transport subsidy or influence on
particular schools. It must not interfere with the young
person&#146;s ability to make a free and unfettered choice about
where they would best be educated. The advice that they get must be
genuinely independent. These are all question marks because we are
going into a new
environment.</div><a name="09030342000349"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000650"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can you keep your remarks brief as I would like
to get two more colleagues
in?</div><a name="09030342000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> We would like local authorities to feel
proprietorial about their colleges and to see them as important
institutions in the area. David mentioned the large number of 16 to
18-year-olds who are in colleges and the work that they do. The
important thing is to respect the boundaries between the
responsibilities of different organisations. We suggested early on that
it might have made sense for the cash not to go through local
authorities, but for them to have a role just in the dialogue and the
commissioning. Some of the complexity of the Bill comes from the
structure of direct funding relationships for local
authorities.</div><a name="09030342000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
100</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000651"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> This is not about direct funding. The Bill gives
them a direct role of the kind you say is not helpful. This is not
about being friends with your local
authority.</div><a name="09030342000352"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Julian
Gravatt:</b></i> No. When it works well, that is fine. Our
concern is about what protections the Bill has for colleges, their
learners and their staff when it does not work
well.</div><a name="09030342000353"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> For adults, we think it a good idea to split
the departments as long as there is a single funding agency to ensure
that their separate decisions are made coherent in the middle. Once
they are separated, it is even more important that someone takes an
overarching view of what is going
on.</div><a name="09030342000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
government has a wider responsibility for the welfare of communities
than merely the delivery of their education and training systems. The
catalytic function of adult participation in education and training
makes an enormous difference to health policy, community cohesion,
crime reduction and so on. It is very difficult to see how you can
avoid local government being engaged at the centre of the system. That
is a price we have been paying for the last 10
years.</div><a name="09030342000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
101</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000652"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I have a penultimate question and a final
question. First, advice and guidance have been mentioned several times.
The Bill will place a duty on those providing advice to consider the
best interests 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>of the pupil, but not necessarily to put forward all options to them.
Are you concerned about whether advisers will be sufficiently
independent of the setting in which they give the advice, which is
likely to be a school in the early stages, to be truly objective about
what path a young person should
follow?</div><a name="09030342000356"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> That is a perennial problem that we have
lived with for a long time. We are not entirely confident about that.
Earlier today, the advice about apprenticeships was mentioned. We
certainly want to ensure that it is strengthened. There is a slight
question mark over people who are commissioning and giving advice and
who are also providers. They are perhaps a little tied up, a little
entwined.</div><a name="09030342000357"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000653"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Can we come on to your next question and then I
hope we can get the Minister
involved?</div><a name="09030342000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
102</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000654"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> My final question&#151;Alan might want to
comment on the advice to adults&#151;is on the funding and policy
direction. Might it be better to have a single adult funding council,
bringing together higher education, further education and skills, so
that there is policy coherence and funding coherence, and everyone can
look to one quango, non-departmental public body or whatever it would
be?</div><a name="09030342000359"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Alan
Tuckett:</b></i> The answer to the question you directly
asked is yes. In the long run in Britain, the artificial distinctions
between further and higher cannot be sustained. I know that there is a
political set of challenges in finding a fiscal system that makes that
work. You look at Wisconsin and the transitional barriers to taking
learning further are much lighter where you have one
system.</div><a name="09030342000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I can come back to advice, we would really like to see&#151;we hope
we might persuade you to look at this as the Bill goes
through&#151;the Adult Advancement and Careers Service being put on
to a statutory basis comparable to the young people&#146;s one. We
think the move has been really positive, giving for the first time a
coherent tension to the issue, but, after 30 years&#146; experience
of almost jumping on the bandwagon of adult advice and then running
away from it, the long-term risk is that if you do not put it on a
statutory basis, that will happen
again.</div><a name="09030342000361"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
103</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000655"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> It would be remiss not to take the last four
minutes to ask Ann and David in particular how the sixth-form college
sector differs from GFE colleges. Is it right that they should be able
to self-determine under the Bill which they want to be? What benefit
does a separate distinction offer, if
any?</div><a name="09030342000362"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> Minister, I think I heard you saying at the
AOC conference recently that the distinction is in performance
management by the local authority. That is the one that we are still
seeing as the
key.</div><a name="09030342000363"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">
104</b><b class="B"><a name="09030342000656"></a>Jim
Knight:</b> But how are they different
now?</div><a name="09030342000364"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Ann
Robinson:</b></i> Some are not very different. There is more
difference in character among sixth-form colleges since incorporation
than there is among GFEs. Some sixth-form colleges are more like GFEs
than they are like other sixth-form colleges. The success of this
legislation will be affected by that.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 41</div><a name="09030342000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where a
sixth-form college is like a GFE, and in the context where that is
going to be very significant for commissioning, there may be some
difficulty with the sub-regional partnerships or sub-regional groupings
not taking everybody up together. Where a sixth-form college is very
like a sixth form, it will perhaps sit more easily into the new local
authority arrangements. It is a difficult one to
call.</div><a name="09030342000366"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Igoe:</b></i> I want to highlight the muddiness of the
waters. We compartmentalise institutions and sectors. That is wrong.
Sixth-form colleges have a reasonably single focus on progression
issues for young people into higher education and employment in a way
that is fairly consistent and much more coherent with what is happening
in the schools sector. Also, what distinguishes sixth-form colleges is
their consistent high quality. That is what has been a feature of the
sector since incorporation. That is what we want to try to
retain.</div><a name="09030342000367"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">Q</b><b class="B">

care?</div><a name="09030342000368"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">David
Igoe:</b></i> Again, there is a lot of mythology about this.
Good pastoral care is a feature of sixth-form colleges, but that is not
to say that it does not exist in good proportion in lots of FE
colleges&#151;certainly in tertiary colleges and in schools. You are
forcing us into making invidious comparisons.</div>

Gravatt:</b></i> Several 16-to-18 schools will have the
benefit of getting sixth-form college status. There are great
advantages in the incorporated status, which sixth-form colleges and FE
colleges have
had.</div><a name="09030342000370"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09030342000658"></a>The

word.</div><a name="09030342000371"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I"><b class="B">Graham
Moore:</b></i> Sixth-form colleges are not evenly distributed
over the country. In many parts of the country, a GFE college would
have a very strong focus on 16-to-18. Tertiary colleges often do that.
When you look at it on the ground, the differences between the
institutions are very marginal. It is horses for courses wherever you
are in the
country.</div><a name="09030342000372"></a>
