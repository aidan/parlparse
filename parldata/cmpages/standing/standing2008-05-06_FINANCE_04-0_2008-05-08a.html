							<b class="B">Stewart
Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): It is a pleasure to see you in
the Chair, Mr. Cook. Before we adjourned, I was describing
the talk of winners and losers that had taken place in respect of
capital gains tax changes and those who sold shares and were due to pay
capital gains tax on them. One of the issues that has not been
addressed before relates to people who hold share options. As I have
said, those options might have been granted as bonuses or rewards for
loyalty over time from a company. People might have intended to keep
them and exercise them as options; to buy and sell when it was
beneficial to them perhaps in large part to fund a special holiday or
their retirement. I am not talking about rich people or those in senior
management. I remember from my past when ordinary employees of a large
plc were routinely granted share options as part of its loyalty and
bonus payment system. However, in the case of a takeover, particularly
of one plc by another plc, the options have to be crystallised to
facilitate the sale or buy-out of the company. The holder of the
options may not necessarily want to crystallise the options into
shares, but has to as a result of a buy-out or takeover by another
company. The employee is then left with an option. They may no longer
be employed by the new company, but be surplus to requirements, or may
not feel the same loyalty to the new company that they had to the old
company, and consider that it was time to sell up. Again, I can think
of ordinary workers from my background with that
experience.</div>
					<a name="0805093000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
consideration has the Treasury given to that particular group of
people? I doubt whether it is a large group. With the market being what
it is, there is not a lot of takeover activity. None the less, people
might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>have options that are required to be crystallised when they otherwise
would not have, but might then choose for a variety of reasons to sell
them. They would be liable to capital gains tax under the new regime. I
accept that my point is technical and that it has not been raised
before, but I should be grateful to know whether the Minister intends
to look at that group of people sympathetically or simply say that,
once the options are crystallised and the shares are sold, capital
gains tax will be paid as it would had the share been held as a share,
not as an option.</div>
					<a name="0805093000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000372"></a>The
Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Jane Kennedy):
						</b>
Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Cook. We said this morning how
grateful we were for the licence given to us this afternoon. It was of
enormous benefit to those of us who were able to join you at Gwyneth
Dunwoody&#146;s
funeral.</div>
					<a name="0805093000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule
2 delivers the central elements of the capital gains tax reform
programme that was announced in the 2007 pre-Budget report,
with the changes taking effect from 6 April 2008. Taper relief operated
by reducing the amount of a gain before it was charged to tax. That
reduced the effective rate of tax paid on the gain in question. The
amount of reduction depended on whether the asset being
disposed of qualified as a business asset or a non-business asset, and
the length of time for which the asset had been owned before its
disposal.</div>
					<a name="0805093000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
introduction of taper relief in 1998, as we have discussed, was an
important part of the Government&#146;s drive to promote investment
and reward enterprise. A decade on, we have now delivered an
unprecedented period of macro-stability and have established the United
Kingdom as one of the best environments for business in the world. We
believe therefore that it is now right to reform capital gains tax. The
regime remains highly competitive, with a headline rate less than half
that in force in 1997. Equally important, the change represents a major
simplification of what had become one of the most complex parts of the
code.</div>
					<a name="0805093000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reformed
capital gains tax regime removes distortions and will be more
sustainable and straightforward for taxpayers, helping everyone to plan
for the future. Extending taper relief in the way that a number of hon.
Members have suggested would not enable the major simplification that
we have delivered. We believe that the 18 per cent. headline rate and
the 10 per cent. special rate available through
entrepreneurs relief represents one of the most simple and competitive
regimes of any major economy. That compares very favourably with our
competitors in the G7, based on the figures for those countries in
2007. Only Italy has a marginally lower rate of 17.2 per cent. The
spread goes as far as the USA, where the rate is 35 per
cent., and Japan, where it is 40 per cent. and in both countries
capital gains are taxed as personal income. Our preferential CGT rates
also bear comparison with international
competitors.</div>
					<a name="0805093000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
asked a number of questions about indexation allowance, and we
discussed it partly when considering the amendments. Because indexation
allowance was frozen in 1998, only a minority of disposals still
qualify. I was asked if I had an estimate of the number. The data
published by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs show that about
17 per cent. of disposals are of assets that have been owned for longer
than 10 years.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>
					<a name="0805093000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a wide-ranging speech, but one
which raised a number of sensible questions, the hon. Member for
Fareham probed whether there was any way of predicting how the decline
of costs would occur. He acknowledges that there is no question but
that there will be a decline. I invite him to look at table A3.1 in the
Red Book. We do not have a profile that predicts ahead because we do
not carry out that type of prediction for future years for this type of
measure.</div>
					<a name="0805093000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805093000373"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I am intrigued. The Government
have been able to project the additional tax that will be raised by the
CGT reforms. Presumably, to do that they needed to project the revenue
that they would gain from the abolition of the indexation
allowance.</div>
					<a name="0805093000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000374"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I will look into the point that the hon.
Gentleman raises. The information that I have has already been
published, but I will see if there is more that I can share with the
Committee in the spirit of being
helpful.</div>
					<a name="0805093000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Dundee, East raised concerns about people holding share
options. He feared that they might face different capital gains tax
rules. We are focusing new relief on entrepreneurs, as we will discuss
shortly. The tax paid by people with options will depend on their
personal circumstances. It could have been as high as 40 per cent.
under the previous regime. The highest that it could now be is 18 per
cent. We think that it is right for someone with large share options to
pay some capital gains
tax.</div>
					<a name="0805093000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805093000375"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Hammond</b> (Runnymede and Weybridge) (Con): I am
interested in what the Financial Secretary has just said because by
implication, there could be circumstances in which people with share
options will pay less than 18 per cent. and will be eligible for
entrepreneurs relief. Will she confirm that, because I have not been
able to identify such a
possibility?</div>
					<a name="0805093000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000376"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> Based on the advice that I have, the logic of
what he is saying is right. It will depend on the circumstances of the
individual.</div>
					<a name="0805093000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000377"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> This is very interesting. I confirm that the same
rules for options will then apply, so that if one held options to
purchase more than 5 per cent. of stock, they would be eligible for the
entrepreneurs allowance on crystallisation of the sale in the same way
as if they have more than 5 per cent. of the stock in actual shares? Is
that
correct?</div>
					<a name="0805093000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000378"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I hope
so&#151;<i class="I">[</i>
						<i class="I">Laughter.</i>
						<i class="I">]</i>
						<i class="I"> </i>I will look at this
matter. I believe that my answer is accurate, but I want to double
check it in the light of the debate. Let me say one or two more things
about share schemes. For the two large all-employee share schemes, the
share incentive plan rules include a special provision for shares to be
rebased to their current market value when someone leaves the scheme,
so that there are no outstanding gains for capital gains tax purposes
at that point. Tax returns from companies offering save-as-you-earn
schemes show that in 2005-06, the average gain per employee was
&#163;2,300&#151;well within the tax-free 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>annual exempt amount. That is why we believe that the vast majority of
people who sell shares acquired through tax-advantaged share schemes
will not be liable to capital gains tax on those gains. Most gains made
will fall within the generous tax-free annual exempt amount of
&#163;9,600.</div>
					<a name="0805093000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
seen the evidence that the hon. Gentleman presented from ifs ProShare.
We do not believe that that evidence is a proper issue&#151;most
people do not come anywhere near HMRC because they fall below the
threshold, so there are no figures to demonstrate that what we are
saying is accurate. However, because we know what the general value
is&#151;as I have said, most gains fall within the generous tax-free
annual exempt amount&#151;we are confident that the vast majority of
people selling shares in that way are not liable to capital gains tax.
It is not something that we have not looked at. We have given
it some consideration.</div>
					<a name="0805093000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">We continue to support employee
share schemes, which continue to offer significant tax advantages for
those employees who participate in an improved scheme, as well as for
those employers who offer such a scheme.</div>
					<a name="0805093000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us turn to the questions
about sections 77-79 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. At
the time, those sections were introduced as anti-avoidance measures.
They were designed to counter tax-avoidance schemes that sheltered
individuals&#146; assets in a trust, so that a lower rate of capital
gains tax could be paid. Those sections stop that avoidance, by taxing
the trust&#146;s gains on the settlor, at the settlor&#146;s rate
of capital gains tax.</div>
					<a name="0805093000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">With a single rate of capital
gains tax of 18 per cent., for both trustees and individuals, trustees
cannot get a lower rate of CGT and so there is no reason to retain
those anti-avoidance rules. The hon. Member for Fareham also asked
about particular trusts that were set up to assist vulnerable people,
and that is a useful point for me to respond to.</div>
					<a name="0805093000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a consequence of abolishing
those rules, a trust or vulnerable beneficiary will
no longer be able to set off any personal losses of the vulnerable
beneficiary against gains made by the trustees. However, I inform the
Committee that I took advantage of the break to ask HMRC to look into
that issue, because I had some concerns based on the representations
made. It advised me that capital gains tax does not seem to have been
an issue for any of the approximately 500 trusts that have elected into
the vulnerable trust regime. That is to be expected. Bearing in mind
what such trusts are set up for, we expect that trustees will take a
cautious investment approach, which is unlikely to yield significant,
if any, capital gains. While I am sympathetic to the point, in practice
it does not seem to be an issue. However, if the hon. Gentleman, or any
other member of the Committee, has any evidence that this is a problem,
I would be happy to consider it further.</div>
					<a name="0805093000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000379"></a>Mr.
Hoban:
						</b> I thank the Minister for her response to the issue
about a trust set up for vulnerable persons. However, the same issue
about the application of personal losses against the gains of a trust
also applies to a situation in which a settlor has an interest in the
trust. That was the other part. I understand why 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>sections 77-79 were introduced in the first place, but the point made by
the Law Society is that if they are repealed, a settlor cannot offset
his personal losses against those
gains.</div>
					<a name="0805093000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000380"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> As I have said, I want to look carefully at this
matter to reassure myself that what I have been advised is accurate. I
am grateful for the opportunity to discuss that.</div>
					<a name="0805093000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Abolishing
those sections was in fact originally suggested by representative
bodies during the consultations that HMRC held after the pre-Budget
report. Abolition was supported by various representative bodies and
accountancy firms, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland,
the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Law Society of Scotland and
the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners. Their view was that the
losses issue was a small price to pay for the greater simplification
that abolition would bring. As a Government, we were guided by those
representations, so I am somewhat surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman
say that the Law Society feels differently. We have sought to listen to
the representations that we
received.</div>
					<a name="0805093000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of
hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Fareham, asked about
halving relief. It is available where a gain has been deferred, rolled
over or held over on the disposal of an asset between 1 April 1982 and
5 April 1988 inclusive, and where the person who made that disposal
acquired the asset before 31 March. In such a case, where the
computation of a gain on a later occasion has the effect of bringing
the deferred gain into charge, only one half of the deferred gain is
taken into account in that computation.</div>
					<a name="0805093000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">Claims for halving relief are
rare because the circumstances in which the relief is due are limited.
Given that fact and the complexity inherent in applying relief,
removing it from the capital gains tax rules seemed a sensible element

					<a name="0805093000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall say a
bit more about people with share options and entrepreneurs relief,
although we will perhaps have an opportunity to explore that further.
Shares sold after exercising an option can qualify for entrepreneurs
relief if all the qualifying conditions are met, including the 5 per
cent. holding
test.</div>

							<a name="0805093000381"></a>Mr.

						</b> In an earlier exchange, I asked whether options
were eligible for entrepreneurs relief. That is quite a different
question from whether shares acquired as a result of exercising options
are eligible for relief. One of the qualifying tests is that
the shares must have been held for one year and therefore the person
exercising the option would have to fund the acquisition of the shares
and be able to continue that funding for a year before he could dispose
of them and take the benefit of entrepreneurs
relief.</div>

Hoban:
						</b> May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr. Cook. There seem to be
new constitutional standards being set, as it appears
that blogs can now be prayed in aid to justify a Government tax
measure. The comments from Mr. Bannatyne, and the Financial
Secretary&#146;s endorsement of them, lead one to question why the
Government introduced the taper relief in the first place if all that
businesses need is the satisfaction and enjoyment of building
themselves up. Clearly, the Government thought that there was a need
back in 1998 to set up taper relief. The Minister says that the reason
for the abolition is the macro-economic stability over the last 10
years. I am not sure that that is an explanation for the
Government&#146;s significant U-turn when they scrapped a relief that
was designed in 1988 to encourage long-term investment in economically
productive assets. The Government seem to have set themselves against
that in these reforms, and the Minister has yet to produce a convincing
explanation for
that.</div>

77 to 79, I take note of her comments about the number of
representative bodies that supported that abolition, and said that the
fact that those losses would not be available to reduce chargeable
gains was a small price to pay for abolition. Did the Treasury not
investigate whether it was possible to institute those reforms without
scrapping that aspect of those sections? When the Minister revisits the
issue and addresses the concerns about vulnerable people, she might
consider before Report whether there is a way of protecting the use of
those losses, consistent with the scrapping of those three
sections.</div>

					<a name="0805093000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 4, 8, 9 and 10 are a response to a number of representations that
we have received expressing concern that the Government&#146;s
&#163;1 million lifetime limit on entrepreneurs&#146; relief will
discourage investment and reinvestment by serial entrepreneurs in new
businesses. My party and, I am sure, many hon. Members in the Committee

No. 4 asks the Government to undertake a review of the new proposal to
assess the impact on serial entrepreneurs of the measures that they are
introducing. Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 refer to a slightly different
topic, and would index the &#163;1 million limit. This morning, we
discussed how inflation can erode amounts over time, so the amendments
suggest a mechanism by which to allow the &#163;1 million to rise in
line with inflation, rounded to a practical figure so that it does not
become difficult for people to
remember.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your

Cook.</div>
					<a name="0805093000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7
introduces the concept of entrepreneurs relief, about which there will
be a fair bit to say as we go through schedule 3. I should perhaps
place on record that we remain unconvinced by the Government&#146;s
approach of using entrepreneurs relief as a response to the outburst of
anger in the business community at both the substance and the manner of
the abrupt abandonment of taper relief. However, in the context of our
work in the Committee, we will focus on probing some of the more
obvious weaknesses in how entrepreneurs relief has been cobbled
together.</div>
					<a name="0805093000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approach
is clearly modelled on retirement relief, which was a feature of the
capital gains taxation system prior to the taper relief system.
Retirement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div>relief was causing practical difficulties when it was scrapped. There
are concerns that some of the problem areas of retirement relief have
been imported to entrepreneurs
relief.</div>
					<a name="0805093000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
starting point for our approach to the clause and to schedule 3 is that
entrepreneurs relief&#151;it is subject to the &#163;1 million cap,
which is a big caveat&#151;should seek to restore as much as possible
of the beneficial effect of taper relief. Where the Government have
tightened up the availability of entrepreneurs relief so that it is
more restrictive than taper relief&#151;the case in almost every
area&#151;we will want to highlight that, and explore with the
Government why they have chosen to do so, apart from the obvious reason
that they do not want to spend any money. This was a concession
extracted under duress. In particular, and to echo the words of the
hon. Member for Taunton, we will want to explore the likely effects of
that restrictive application of entrepreneurs relief on the
economy.</div>
					<a name="0805093000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">The context is
that taper relief was the Labour party&#146;s great claim to
business-friendliness. Whenever anybody asked about the Labour
party&#146;s relationship with business, taper relief was wheeled out
and waved around as an example of how the party understood and
empathised with the aspirations of business people. So the scrapping in
the pre-Budget report of taper relief, without any consultation or
advance warning, caused a shock wave to run through the business
community. A hugely negative signal was sent and huge anger
provoked.</div>
					<a name="0805093000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
quoted a couple of entrepreneurs who spoke favourably of the process.
She could have attended a number of large meetings where she would have
heard a vocal view to the contrary. I do not doubt that the measure was
popular among the second-home-owning community and the buy-to-let
landlord community. However, I think that privately she would
acknowledge that the views that she expressed represent a tiny minority
among the entrepreneur community, not just because of the material
consequences of the change but because of the perception that a signal
was being sent that the Government and business were parting ways and
that the Government were no longer interested in courting and
supporting the business
community.</div>
					<a name="0805093000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government chose to deal with their private equity problem, which they
were under pressure, including from the unions, to address. They chose,
perhaps chiming with the moves made in the Budget of 2007 in relation
to income tax, to send a signal to middle England&#151;to
middle-income taxpayers who are typically the second-home-owners and
buy-to-let landlords who will be the great beneficiaries of the change.
Then, of course, they were forced into a U-turn in response to the
united front presented by business. I well remember meetings with the
representative business organisations, including the CBI, EEF,
Federation of Small Businesses and British Chambers of Commerce. It is
extremely unusual for them to be united, but they sat at the same table
with exactly the same agendas.</div>
					<a name="0805093000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s
introduction of entrepreneurs relief is a cynical response. They have
looked at the organisations that led the charge and at how many voters
each of them represents and decided to address the problems of the very
small businesses&#151;those represented by the Federation of Small
Businesses&#151;because it involves lots of voters, including the
families and friends of small business people.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>
					<a name="0805093000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We welcome the concessions that
have been made in entrepreneurs relief to small, mainly
lifestyle, businesses. The move will greatly reduce the impact on many
small business people&#146;s retirement funding plans. However, we
question whether it is based on sound economics or knee-jerk politics.
Contrary to what the Financial Secretary said&#151;I am willing to
take her on at any level in any forum on this&#151;the entrepreneurs
relief does nothing whatever for serial entrepreneurs. It is a perverse
arrangement because, in fact, it rewards those who are moderately
successful, but nothing for those who are spectacularly,
mind-bogglingly successful in creating high-risk, high-success
businesses that go on to create jobs and wealth, and to become the
scalable companies that will provide the backbone of the British
economy in the next generation.</div>

							<b class="B">Emily
Thornberry</b> (Islington, South and Finsbury) (Lab): Is the
hon. Gentleman seriously saying that such highly motivated
entrepreneurs will give up their work because they will need to pay a
higher rate of CGT? Surely the entrepreneurs relief is simply to ensure
that small business people are protected so that, when they retire,
they will not pay a higher rate. The clue is in the clause title, which
is &#147;Entrepreneurs&#146; relief&#148;, not &#147;Serial
entrepreneurs&#146; relief&#148;, which would mean a completely
different group of people. Is he saying that they will stop
work?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000397"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> That was an interesting intervention from the
hon. Lady. I do not know how much idea she has about how entrepreneurs
obtain financing. The problem to which we will repeatedly return is not
the hard-working entrepreneur who sets up the small business, but the
people to whom they turn to fund their businesses as they go from the
first to the next stage of growth. The Minister rightly observed that
they will now face an 18 per cent. CGT rate and not a 40 or 10 per
cent. rate. The important point that she missed, which the Committee
needs to understand, is that the differential of the tax rate on gains
from investing in high-risk, illiquid situations, and unquoted
businesses at an early stage of growth, and the tax rate on gains from
investing in much lower-risk asset classes such as second homes,
buy-to-let properties or quoted companies, is precisely zero.</div>
					<a name="0805093000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">That sends a powerful message to
those who we need if we have a dynamic economy. They need to be out
there taking risks and losses, which must happen when they make
high-risk investments that are trying to scale up. I predict that that
is the group of people whose disenchantment with the system will cost
the British economy as a result of this change to the taxation
regime.</div>

						</b> But is this right? I heard today for the first

							<a name="0805093000399"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Lady completely misses the point. When a
potential business angel looks where to invest his money, he looks at
the risk he is going to take, the reward he might gain and the taxation
on that reward. He does not wonder whether to pop off to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div>Italy and invest in a small business there. He thinks, &#147;Shall I
put it in something safer? Shall I buy gold or quoted stocks and
shares? Shall I buy a second home or invest in buy-to-let
property?&#148; He compares high-risk investments.</div>
					<a name="0805093000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">We can all make comments about
short-term movements in the market, but I hope that the hon. Lady and
the Minister will see my point. If we seek&#151;as the Government
did, to their credit, with taper relief&#151;to encourage a culture
in which people with asset wealth will take large risks by investing
that wealth in areas in which some of them will lose money for sure, in
the hope of making large rewards and having those rewards taxed
favourably, that will deliver an innovative and entrepreneurial
culture. Such a culture underpins the growth in wealth and living
standards in our economy that the Conservatives aspire to maintain as
an essential part of the UK&#146;s economic
culture.</div>

						</b> May I offer the hon. Gentleman a trade from the
Back Benches? Some of us on the Back Benches might recognise that there
is an element of truth in what he says about there being a perverse
incentive, at times, in investment terms, but does he accept that he
overstates his case considerably? I take his point, which is fair, but
the changes do not  mean the end of investment and the death of
entrepreneurship in
Britain.</div>
					<a name="0805093000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000401"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> Now it is the hon. Gentleman who is guilty of
overstating his case. I have never suggested that not a further penny
will be invested in the UK economy. Clearly, that is not the case. I
have spoken to entrepreneurs who have succeeded, and have listened to
them explain how their businesses went from being small-scale firms
with half a dozen employees and a good idea to the next level, where
they were seriously in the game. It is about borrowing money from
family and friends, and cobbling together networks of informal
investors.</div>
					<a name="0805093000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give the
Government credit, taper relief has played a huge role in giving people
an incentive to invest, including people who might never have invested
before, and certainly people who do not think of themselves as private
equity investors. It has encouraged such people to take risks by
investing in someone whom they know or in a local business enterprise
such as a new restaurant or a factory where a new widget that has been
invented is to be made. It has been very successful and has helped to
create an entrepreneurial culture in this country that has helped our
economy hugely in the past few years. We should be extremely proud in
this country, as I am, that we have&#151;until now&#151;had a more
innovative business culture than any other nation outside the United
States that I can think of. I genuinely fear that we are putting that
at risk.</div>
					<a name="0805093000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We could argue
all day about whether I am exaggerating the case. Indeed, I hope that I
am and that history will prove me wrong, but I fear that it will not.
Obviously, we will have to wait and see what happens. The
Conservatives&#146; intention this afternoon is to probe the
Government not on the principle of entrepreneurs relief&#151;I have
said my piece on that&#151;but on the details. It is restrictive, but
let us see whether there are areas in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>which it is too restrictive or more restrictive than the Government
intended. Let us see whether it could be made less restrictive in order
to apply it to areas in which the hon. Members for Birmingham,
Erdington or for Islington, South and Finsbury might think that it
applies, but in which we might discover, when we look closely at the
fine print of the measure, that it does
not.</div>

Efford</b> (Eltham) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman has been fulsome

pm</div>
					<a name="0805093000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will return to
the amendments in hand. Amendment No. 4, tabled by the Liberal
Democrats, and amendment No. 32, which I tabled,
focus on the risk of damaging the incentives to serial entrepreneurs.
As I have already said, serial entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of an
innovative economy. They take risks and establish businesses, which, if
successful are floated or absorbed by larger players in the sector. It
is often easier to innovate in a new, small business. It is often safer
for larger companies to acquire proven, established new technologies
that have been got to that first stage of development, rather than try
to develop them themselves in their own rather more bureaucratic
environments. Whether they are establishing new technologies, ideas or
marketing approaches, small, innovative companies established with the
intention of growth are the lifeblood of our economy. They are the
oxygen that feeds it with new ideas and new processes. They are also
mobile because they are essentially based on talented
individuals.</div>
					<a name="0805093000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington jumps up and accuses me of
exaggerating, I am not suggesting that no entrepreneur will ever open a
factory in Britain again or that they will all desert. However, it is
noticeable to those of us who have had discussions since the pre-Budget
report with groups representing entrepreneurs that a significant
minority intend to exercise their mobility. Some of those people do not
originate from the UK, but are foreigners who came here because the
economic climate was attractive. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton
(Mr. Osborne) and I spoke to a Canadian who had established
either two or three successful businesses, all of which had been sold.
He intended to return immediately to Canada to establish his next
venture.</div>
					<a name="0805093000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="0805093000406"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Peter Bone</b> (Wellingborough) (Con): My
experience of building up a new innovative company is that we had the
support of the Americans. They look round to see which is the best
country for entrepreneurs. It is the signals that we send to such
people that are important. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>Those signals are as much as anything about the practicalities. We want
to capture those people and get them
here.</div>
					<a name="0805093000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000407"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> My hon. Friend is right. It is not just about the
money. It is about the signals. Taper relief sent a signal that
entrepreneurs were valued. I am not making a party political point, but
there was a time in the history of the Labour party when those who
created wealth and made huge profits were denigrated. It was hugely
reassuring to potential entrepreneurs to see the party that had
traditionally denigrated wealth creation celebrating it. That sent a
very powerful message. The pre-Budget report last autumn reversed that
message in double-quick time. As my hon. Friend says, that is part of
the problem.</div>
					<a name="0805093000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
made my point already about the 18 per cent. rate. The point is not
whether it is competitive with other jurisdictions, but whether it is
competitive against less risky forms of investment within this
jurisdiction. There is a very real concern about the signal that is
being sent.</div>
					<a name="0805093000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We share
with the Liberal Democrats the concern about the impact that this
measure will have. As the hon. Member for Taunton said, the proposal to
require a report is simply a probing device to address these issues
with the Government. The Government will no doubt say that they will
monitor carefully what happens and that they will look closely at the
behaviour of entrepreneurs. I say to the Financial Secretary that at
the level of Government, she will detect the problem only long after it
has occurred. These people are invisible until they come to realise
their gains. They are not registered on any HMRC database or picked up
by any Government questionnaire. They are going about their daily
business quietly all over the country. The investment networks are
highly informal&#151;investors clubs, informal networks within
neighbourhoods and between family and friends. She will discover that
there is a problem only two, three or four years down the line when it
has already occurred and the system of financial support for
entrepreneurs is broken. That is our concern, and that is why we seek
to place in the Bill a requirement to assess the effect of increasing
the tax rate from 10 per cent. to 18 per cent. for all but the smallest
companies. In particular, that will mean looking at the effect on
serial entrepreneurs and business angels. Such a report would inform
potential future changes of policy by a future Government, and it would
be good to have it under way and presented in good time.</div>
					<a name="0805093000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taper relief was not perfect; no
one would suggest that. Clearly, some of the flaws in it, particularly
in relation to its use in private equity, had been extensively
identified and debated and could have been addressed without removing
the entire system. We could have had a system that addressed those
problems but left a recognition of genuine medium-term entrepreneurial
success.</div>
					<a name="0805093000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Opposition will now want to look again at the whole system of business
capital taxation. In the meantime, it is essential that we monitor the
effect of, what I must say is a very silly, short-term and economically
inept move. Amendments Nos. 4 and 32 have the same purpose. If the hon.
Member for Taunton decides to press his amendment to a Division, my
hon. Friends and I will be happy to support him.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>
					<a name="0805093000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The remaining amendments in the
group address the level of entrepreneurs relief. We have the same
intentions as the Liberal Democrats&#151;that of probing the
Government&#146;s intentions. There is no mechanism for indexing the
relief. I know that &#163;1 million is a temptingly round number, but
it would be sensible to send some form of signal about the
Government&#146;s future intentions. The Liberal Democrats have
chosen to index it by the formula used to index allowances and
thresholds. We have taken a slightly different approach and provided
for the Treasury to vary the &#163;1 million limit by order, so that
it can be done as quickly as necessary. We think that that is just as
good, but we would not fall out with the hon. Member for Taunton over
that point.</div>
					<a name="0805093000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point
is this. If my predictions, and those of other hon. Members on this
side of the Committee, are right; if the niggling and the just about
concern of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington turns out to be
for real&#151;none of us know hether it will &#151;the Government
must be able to respond quickly. If we find that hon. Members of all
parties are picking up signs from talking to people in their
communities, professional accountancy firms, lawyers and so on that the
system is breaking down, the Government must be able to respond. They
should not necessarily wait for the next Finance Bill to go through
Parliament, and the power to vary the limit by order would be a
worthwhile weapon in their armoury. Rather unusually, I find myself
arguing in favour of greater power for the Government to intervene
without the need for primary legislation, because I feel that in this
case, the need to act very quickly may
arise.</div>
					<a name="0805093000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000408"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> As we have been discussing, clause 7 introduces
schedule 3, which contains the provisions related to the proposed
capital gains tax entrepreneurs relief. Broadly speaking, the relief is
available on the disposal of a trading business, or shares in a trading
company, provided that the person making the disposal is an officer or
employee of the company and has a minimum 5 per cent. stake in the
business. The relief reduces the effective capital gains tax rate from
18 per cent. to 10 per cent. for up to the first &#163;1 million of
qualifying gains made over a
lifetime.</div>
					<a name="0805093000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
conditions are designed to help focus the relief on individuals who
play an active role in a business, and have a material capital stake in
that business. The &#163;1 million lifetime limit for the relief
strikes a balance between providing flexibility for individuals and
ensuring that valuable tax reliefs are targeted in a fair and efficient
manner. We recognise that in some cases investors may not meet those
criteria. However, we believe that the rules that we have announced are
a reasonable way to determine eligibility for the new relief.</div>
					<a name="0805093000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We estimate that around 80,000
business owners and investors will benefit from entrepreneurs relief
next year alone; 90 per cent. of that group will pay capital gains tax
at an effective rate of 10 per cent. on their entire gain. That
includes people who are selling their business and retiring, who will
continue to benefit from a 10 per cent. rate on the first &#163;1
million of gains, and 18 per cent. on the excess over &#163;1
million. The Government consider that a limit on relief for the first
&#163;1 million strikes the right balance between supporting 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>entrepreneurs and taking a fair amount of tax from people with large
capital gains. Even where gains exceed the &#163;1 million limit, the
individual will keep 82 per cent. of whatever gains they
make, which remains highly competitive, as I argued
earlier.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000409"></a>Mr.

						</b> The hon. Lady said that the Government estimate
that 80,000 people will benefit in the first year alone from
entrepreneurs&#146; relief. To put that into context, can she tell
the Committee how many people benefited from taper relief in the last
year for which it was available? If she does not have the answer, could
she perhaps obtain it and advise the Committee later so that we can
understand the context of her remarks?</div>

context.</div>

It is concerned:</div>
					<a name="0805093000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the entrepreneurs&#146; relief does not appear to be available
for:</div>
					<a name="0805093000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">Certain

shareholdings.&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805093000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that those are technical points that I have raised late, but
if it is not possible to answer them immediately, I would be grateful
if they could be dealt with in some
way.</div>
					<a name="0805093000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000412"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> I will obviously seek to respond. We discussed
employee share schemes in the earlier debate&#151;I think that the
hon. Gentleman was present. If they were not covered then, I shall seek
to answer the points that he quite properly raises. There is no need
for an order to increase the &#163;1 million limit. If an immediate
increase were desirable, it could be announced with immediate effect
and then included in the Finance Bill. However, I will come to that in
greater detail in a moment.</div>
					<a name="0805093000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Runnymede
and Weybridge argued that the Government were failing to support
risk-taking in business investment. We believe that the new regime
makes it easier to understand the capital gains tax position. Being
able to understand tax liabilities is helpful to businesses considering
investment. A number of sources of relief remain to support risk-taking
and enterprise: losses can be offset against future capital gains;
business asset rollover relief means that gains can be reinvested and
tax deferred; venture capital trusts, which I shall return to in a
moment, and enterprise investment schemes also continue and have been
enhanced. Entrepreneurs relief is focused on people with a material
stake in a business.
</div>
					<a name="0805093000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for
Dundee, East asked questions in the previous debate about share options
as opposed to shares. The relief is focused on people with an actual
material stake. That means people who own businesses 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>or company shares. It is not available on options themselves. However,
if the options are exercised and shares are required, relief will be
given if the conditions under schedule 3 are
met.</div>

so?</div>

matter has generated some interest in the Committee, I will check to
make sure that what I have said to hon. Members is accurate. I believe
that it is.</div>
					<a name="0805093000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group
of amendments considers both the impact of the entrepreneurs relief on
serial entrepreneurs and the &#163;1 million lifetime limit for
access to relief. Amendments Nos. 4 and 32 would require the Treasury
to report on the impact of the new entrepreneurs relief on serial
entrepreneurs and to do so within the next year or two. Neither
amendment is necessary. As with any new aspect of the tax regime, we
will keep the operation of the new entrepreneurs relief under review as
a matter of course. I accept that that form of words is used regularly.
but, because of the importance of the relief to Britain and British
business, we will want to be sure that the arrangements that we have
put in place will do exactly what we hope. On a practical level,
requiring the Treasury to report back within a one or two-year window
is not a realistic time in which to evaluate the long-term impact of a
policy change
properly.</div>
					<a name="0805093000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 8 to 10 deal with the &#163;1 million lifetime limit, and would
introduce an automatic annual uprating in line with the retail prices
index. Amendments Nos. 29 to 31 would introduce a power to alter the
limit by a Treasury order. I am quite interested in that proposal,
particularly as it comes from the hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge. Again, the amendments are unnecessary. The Government have
said that the &#163;1 million lifetime limit will be kept under
review. We will follow through on that commitment accordingly. If and
when the time comes to alter the limit, it will be done in a future
Finance Bill but, if necessary, we have powers to do it anyway with the
opportunity for Parliament, under the Finance Bill, to debate the
matter further.</div>
					<a name="0805093000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want
to say a further sentence or two about our commitment to monitor the
relief and how it is working. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham,
Erdington is right that we heard the concerns that were expressed
following the PBR, which is why we introduced the relief. It was
welcome, but clearly we shall want to monitor its impact. That is not
just the usual thing that Ministers say to get over a point. In this
case, it is important to us to do
so.</div>
					<a name="0805093000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee would
be interested to know that the number of small and medium enterprises
has risen by an estimated 17.2 per cent. since 1997. There are now 4.3
million small and medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, which is
99.9 per cent. of all UK businesses, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>employing 58.5 per cent. of the private sector work force and generating

						</b> Well, those figures are reliable and in the
public domain, and are worthy of drawing to the Committee&#146;s
attention. The enterprise investment scheme, for example, has raised
more than &#163;5.5 billion since its inception, and invested in more
than 13,000 smaller high-risk companies. That scheme remains in place
and the venture capital trusts have invested more than &#163;3
billion in more than 1,400 companies. That is also supported and
encouraged by the Government. As I have said before, the 23,000 claims
for R and D tax credits&#151;20,000 of them made under the small and
medium enterprise scheme&#151;made since the scheme&#146;s
introduction in 2000 are encouraging indications that the UK remains a

number of small company incorporations and quoted it again, may I ask
again a question which I asked her, or perhaps it was her colleague,
during a debate in the House a couple of weeks ago and which was not
answered then? Yes, the number of incorporations has increased, largely
driven by tax incentives to incorporate, but is not the figure about
which she should be concerned the fall in the number of companies
reaching &#163;1 million turnover within three years? So we have more
companies and more lifestyle businesses being
incorporated&#151;whether that is a good thing is not an issue. The
key thing is that we are not getting them to that critical &#163;1
million turnover level from which they can grow and become generators
of employment and real wealth in the

believe that there is a still a great deal of healthy indication in the
figures. I will want to look at the point that he has raised. He asked
me to set the context by saying how many people benefited from taper

enterprise investment scheme is under quite a lot of pressure. Perhaps
the Treasury could have another look at how it could give more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>support to that. The R and D tax credits, for instance, are not
available to wholly private equity-funded companies because of the
control roles. Given that the Treasury is going to do this rather
counterintuitive thing, it should have a serious, across-the-board look
at how it can support investment in businesses with a turnover below
&#163;1 million, which are so crucial in areas like the west midlands
and the
north-west.</div>

Lady said in response to the proposals in the amendments that the
Government had the power to alter the &#163;1 million level, and that
they would keep matters under review. That may well be the case; I do
not dispute that. However, both the hon. Member for Taunton and I said
that this was a probing amendment. We hoped to get from the Financial
Secretary a clear signal to entrepreneurs as to the Government&#146;s
intentions regarding the &#163;1 million limit. If there is not an
utter disaster and it needs to be trebled, and if it is not a raging
success and 500,000 people claim it in the first year, but if it just
ticks along normally, what are entrepreneurs to understand? Is it
expected to increase in line with inflation? This was a concession
grudgingly made after the pre-Budget report. The Government, even the
right hon. Lady with her best hat on, will not be able to pretend that
it was part of the original plan. It is necessary to send a signal
that, although grudgingly made, it will not be allowed to wither on the
vine but will be uprated in line with
inflation.</div>

							<a name="0805093000426"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> We were convinced by the representations made
following the pre-Budget report of the need to assist entrepreneurs and
investors. That is why we introduced the relief. If the relief does its
job, we will want to keep the limit. We will keep the limit under
review. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an absolute commitment that we
will set an automatic revision rate, or a time at which we would
further consider the limit. However, we look at all taxes as we go
through the normal processes of considering policy, through the
pre-Budget report programme of work and in preparing for future
Budgets. Therefore, I cannot give him an absolute guarantee that we
will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>always raise the rate in line with inflation or at a particular time,
but we will keep it actively under review. We are keen to ensure that
it is working and encouraging investment as we have described and as we
expect.</div>
					<a name="0805093000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I therefore
hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for Taunton to withdraw the
amendment, in the spirit of probing amendments. I hope that, if he does
not, the Committee will resist
it.</div>

							<a name="0805093000427"></a>Mr.
Browne:
						</b> This concession, the entrepreneurs relief, is a
model of how the Government, and the Treasury in particular, should not
conduct their affairs. It came, of course, after the main event, as a
concession made when the Government realised that they had made a
serious miscalculation and thus sought to adjust the policy to diffuse
the frustration, anger even, in many parts of the business community.
However, I will readily concede that this is not an issue that the
average member of the public detains himself or herself with on a daily
basis. There is unlikely to be a public clamour for the Government to
uprate entrepreneurs relief in line with inflation or any other
measure, in the way there is on the doubling of the 10p
rate.</div>
					<a name="0805093000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fear that
I&#151;and I suspect many people who are entrepreneurially minded in
the business sector&#151;have is that the mechanism has bought off
anger and frustration in the short term and may be allowed to wither on
the vine. The Financial Secretary, in rejecting both the Conservative
proposal and the less flexible but more specific proposal in the
amendment tabled by me and my hon. Friends, did not rule out cutting
the &#163;1 million figure at some point, were it to prove
too expensive to the Treasury. One million pounds is a suspiciously
round number, and many of the general public might be persuaded that
that is a large enough amount of money for nobody to worry too much
about whether it needs to go up in line with inflation or the overall
growth of the economy. In addition to that, she showed some uncertainty
when she rose to defend the policy, and kept saying that the Government
would keep it under review. That made it sound as though it was a
policy built on shifting sands. That reinforces all the more our
inclination to pin the Government  to something more specific,
certainly a meaningful Treasury review of the impact of the proposal.
Many who take a close interest in these matters, and will read our
deliberations at a later date or even later today, will be keen that
Opposition parties hold the Government to account on this matter. For
that reason, I am keen to push amendment No. 4 to a vote.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> I would just like to say a few words before we
agree this clause, which introduces schedule 3. I hate to say this to
the Minister, but I detect a degree of complacency in her remarks. I
honestly do not think that Ministers understand what they have done;
perhaps Labour Members have a better idea. I say that openly. If we on
the Conservative Benches had wanted to devise a strategy for the
Government that would help us in securing the maximum number of
business voters for the Conservative cause, we could scarcely have done
better than to ask them to abolish capital gains tax taper relief
without consultation or warning. It created an anger in the business
community that I do not think anybody can remember the like
of.</div>
					<a name="0805093000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister said
that the entrepreneurs relief had been welcomed. If she thinks back,
she will remember that it was welcomed by the Federation of Small
Businesses, quite properly representing the smallest scale of
businesses&#151;those that are most likely to benefit from it. The
CBI, the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation and the
representatives of larger-scale businesses, which are so important to
the economy, described it as wholly inadequate. It is the economic
consequences that we are particularly concerned
about.</div>
					<a name="0805093000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is a hastily
cobbled together measure and before the Committee agrees clause 7 it
needs to think one more time about this. In order to mitigate the
damaging effects of the
abolition&#151;</div>

							<a name="0805093000457"></a>Mr.

						</b> Mr. Cook, I would not dream of
rerunning a discussion that has already gone on and I shall not go on
for very much longer. I merely want to ensure that before members of
the Committee&#151;particularly Labour Members&#151;take this step,
they consider the politically damaging effect of abolishing what was
Labour&#146;s flagship pro-business
policy.</div>
					<a name="0805093000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">If any Labour
Members are wondering why the anger of low-income earners who were hit
by the abolition of the 10p rate has been mirrored by the anger of
business owners who are hit by the abolition of the 10p long-term
capital gains tax rate, I say to them that it is for the same reasons
in both cases. Those were both long-term Labour objectives. Both were
introduced with great fanfare. Both were trailed as symbols of
Labour&#146;s commitment on the one hand to those on low incomes and
on the other to long-term investors. Both were withdrawn without
warning or 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>consultation for cynical political reasons and both represent a denial
of the Prime Minister&#146;s statement that when the Government make
promises, they keep them. For those reasons, they have incurred the
wrath of the business community, the low paid and all who believe that
our tax system should be fair and balanced. I urge Labour Members to
think very carefully before agreeing to the
clause.</div>

						</b> I have been provoked and I promise that I will
respond very briefly, Mr. Cook. I feel that it is necessary
to defend the Government&#146;s proposals. When I say that I will
keep the matter under active review, I am accused of complacency. I
understand that the Conservative party is reviewing its manufacturing
strategy and has embedded some of its policy staff in Rolls-Royce to
understand some of the issues that that company faces. These criticisms
are a bit rich when, on two occasions that the Conservatives were in
control of the economy and had an effect on the way that businesses
made decisions, interest rates hit 15 per cent. and 3 million people
were unemployed.</div>

a right hon. or hon. Member is addressing the Chamber through the Chair

unchallenged on the record. I allowed the hon. Gentleman to make the
points, almost ad nauseum, that he had already made on the amendments,
so there was a stand part debate, a response to it, and it was

make the point that a large number of amendments have been tabled to
the schedule and a large number of outside bodies have raised further
issues with it&#151;all members of the Committee will be aware of
that because they will have received the briefings. A number of issues
have not been covered by the amendments tabled so far, because the
observations from professional outside bodies arrived too late for
amendments to be tabled. It might be possible, depending on the
progress of today&#146;s debate, for further amendments to be tabled.
If it is not, it would be helpful to the Committee if we were able to
cover some of the areas raised by the Law Society, in particular, in a
stand part debate at the end. My point is that I will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>resist the temptation to go wider than the amendments to try to sweep up
some of the other issues in the hope that we will be able to come to
them in a stand part

					<a name="0805093000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">This large
group of amendments deals with the scope of disposals eligible for
entrepreneurs relief. As we have already said&#151;perhaps ad
nauseum&#151;it is much narrower than the scope of taper relief. In
principle, we are seeking to establish why the scope of taper relief is
not being applied within the &#163;1 million limit that the
entrepreneurs relief regime proposes. All the amendments in the group
relate to new section 169I. As the Committee will understand, schedule
3 inserts a number of new sections into the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992, so the structure of the schedule is a series
of new sections to that Act. Section 169I deals with the
disposal of shares or of assets used in an unincorporated
business.</div>
					<a name="0805093000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
separate issues are raised by the amendments.
Amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 seek to redefine a
disposal of business assets under new section 169I(2)(b),
which deals with the disposal of assets that are used for the business
but that are not owned by it. An example would be the disposal of a
factory building at the time the business operating that building is
closed down. There may be various circumstances in which that structure
is used in the financing of a small business, and where the individuals
involved may personally own assets that are deployed in that business.
That may be because there is difficulty in raising capital for the
business, or because capital can be raised only by giving personal
guarantees or security over personal property&#151;typically
residential property&#151;and it is thought to be safer for the
individual to own the asset personally and allow it to be used in the
business. The subsection seeks to deal with the situation where an
asset is disposed of at the same time as the disposal of the
business.</div>
					<a name="0805093000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div>
					<a name="0805093000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As drafted, the
Bill only allows eligibility for entrepreneurs relief in the disposal
of an asset used in a business, if that business ceases to be carried
on by the individual. The broader issue is the contrast between the
treatment of sole traders&#151;individuals who carry on
businesses&#151;and the treatment of partnerships. As many of the
professional bodies have pointed out, one of the effects of picking up
the old retirement relief regime and using it as the skeleton for the
model of entrepreneurs relief, is that it does not seem well fitted to
the world of limited liability partnerships as a new business form that
is becoming increasingly used. Because of that, we have a situation
where partners in limited liability partnerships will receive different
treatment from individuals who are sole traders. By virtue of new
section 169I(8), assets disposed of by partnerships where the business
does not cease to be carried on, will be eligible for entrepreneurs
relief. That seems somewhat iniquitous. If someone sells a factory
while continuing the business, they will have no eligibility for
entrepreneurs relief in respect of the gain on the sale of the
factory.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 123</div>
					<a name="0805093000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once again,
that is economic nonsense. It discourages people from renewing assets
and it encourages them to hold on to assets used in conjunction with
the business until such time as the business is disposed of. They do
that rather than renewing those assets on a timely basis that is
dictated by normal economic considerations rather than driven by tax
considerations. That is generally not the best way to plan and run a
business and, from the point of view of the economy, it is not the way
to achieve the optimum outcome.</div>
					<a name="0805093000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments seek to inject
into the structure of the Bill the characteristics of the taper relief
regime, where all disposals of business assets were eligible. That was
one of the key characteristics of the taper relief regime as far as
smaller businesses were concerned, and it was very helpful to them. The
amendment deletes the words on page 120, line 20, so that there would
be no reference to the business ceasing. Instead, it inserts a
requirement for the asset to have been in use for the purposes of the
business for at least two years at the date of disposal. Two years was
picked to represent what would have been the qualifying period for full
taper relief under the previous taper relief regime.</div>
					<a name="0805093000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government&#146;s drafting
creates what I would call an artificial concept of ceasing the business
as a qualification. We will return to the question of what cessation of
carrying on the business actually means&#151;it is very woolly
drafting and we will come back to it in about 300 amendments&#146;
time. It is a term borrowed from the retirement relief legislation,
where there was clearly an unambiguous intention that retirement was to
take place. Reading this schedule, it is not clear whether there is an
intention for retirement to take place. In some places it looks as
though that is what is in the draftsman&#146;s mind, and in other
places it looks as though that interpretation has been modified. There
is a lack of clarity about what is intended. Given the lifetime cap of
&#163;1 million, we suggest that there is no need for the restriction
on the disposal of assets used in a business at any time as it would
simply mean that somebody got to their lifetime cap more quickly. By
introducing that additional hurdle, the Government are creating a
complex and potentially damaging restriction that could actually be
removed without any significant consequences. That is what amendments
Nos. 14 and 15 address; amendment No. 16 is purely
consequential.</div>
					<a name="0805093000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each of
these little clusters or sub-groups of amendments stand separately.
What I am about to say in relation to amendments Nos. 17 to 20 does not
assume that amendments Nos. 14, 15 and 16 have been
accepted. Amendments Nos. 17 to 20 assume as their
context the continuation of a requirement for cessation of involvement
in the business and they relate to  the restriction concerning
the time of ownership of the business. The amendments come principally
from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales,
although others have made similar observations. Nobody has any problem
with the one-year period of ownership, but as the current wording of
the Bill is restrictive it is suggested that the qualifying period
should be defined in the same way as the qualifying period for the
substantial shareholding exemption&#151;any 12-month period in the
previous 24 months.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 124</div>
					<a name="0805093000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment paper contains four
identical amendments and I have explained the concept behind them. On
reflection, substituting</div>
					<a name="0805093000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a 12 month period beginning not
more than two years before&#148;</div>
					<a name="0805093000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">for the words in the
Bill, which refer to a period of one year ending with the date of
disposal, does not have any material effect and is arguably unworkable
in relation to new sections 169I(3) and (4). I accept, before the
Minister gets there, that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are inappropriate.
In other words, the suggested changes have been inserted in four places
where they should have been inserted only in two places. Amendments
Nos. 19 and 20 are the substantive proposals that I want to speak to
and I will accept a slap on the wrist in respect of amendments Nos. 17
and 18.</div>
					<a name="0805093000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
19 and 20 would create greater flexibility around the time at which it
is necessary for an individual to comply with the requirements, first,
to own 5 per cent. of the shares in the company and, secondly, to be an
officer or employee of the company. Amendment No. 19 would allow a
qualification for entrepreneurs relief where the shareholding fell
below 5 per cent. at the point of disposal, or where the
individual ceased to be an employee or officer of the company, so long
as he held the 5 per cent. and was an officer or employee for a period
of 12 months in the last 24 months.</div>
					<a name="0805093000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">That aims to give some
flexibility to accommodate real-world scenarios of managed exits from
small businesses. It is quite possible, for example, that the exit of
an individual from a business might involve a structured reduction in
his holding, such that he disposed of some of his shares, leaving him
with 2.5 or 3 per cent. at one point in the process, and he then
disposed of the remainder at his final exit. It is also likely that he
may cease to be an employee or officer of the company before finally
disposing of his shareholding. The tax regime in the Bill will drive
structures for exits from businesses and that is undesirable. We think
that the tax regime should not drive behaviour that otherwise would
optimise the smooth transition of a business from one ownership to
another.</div>

						<a name="0805093000471"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Mark Field</b> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con): I
rise briefly to clarify my hon. Friend&#146;s comments. Would the
12-month period out of the previous 24 months have to be unbroken to
avoid the sleight of hand and other concerns that he has rightly raised
about the tax tail wagging the corporate
dog?</div>
					<a name="0805093000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000472"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> My hon. Friend raises a good
point. The intention, as I said earlier, is to replicate the
requirements of the substantial shareholding exemption. My
understanding is that that requires an unbroken 12-month period
beginning not earlier than the period of 24 months from the date of the
disposal in question.</div>
					<a name="0805093000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 20 allows the same
flexibility around the timing of the qualifying period where a company
has ceased to be a trading company prior to disposal. That will quite
often happen, such as when a business is being run down and is being
turned into a cash and asset-holding shell and the balance between the
holding of assets and the trading activity becomes such that the
company is no longer treated as a trading 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 125</div>company by HMRC. That is not an atypical situation in the winding up of
a small business when someone is seeking to
retire.</div>
					<a name="0805093000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (7)
of the new section signals that the draftsman understood that sometimes
an exit will be structured so as to wind a business down and turn it
into a non-trading shell, but did not understand the possibility of a
managed exit by the individual, where the company will continue trading
as he reduces and finally relinquishes his shareholding and at some
point ceases to hold office. Our challenge to the Government is whether
these arrangements are economically sensible and whether they encourage
a degree of tax planning in the management of small businesses which
will be detrimental to the most efficient functioning of those
businesses and thus of the economy
overall.</div>
					<a name="0805093000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 23 to 25 address a slightly different issue. Amendment No. 23
challenges the requirement for an individual to be an officer or an
employee of the company in question. That was not a requirement under
the taper relief regime and it is not obvious why that requirement has
been inserted now. The Minister earlier said that the relief was
targeted at owner-managers: I think she used that phrase, but she
certainly talked about active involvement. I urge the Government not to
slip back into the pre-1994 Labour party thinking that only the people
who work on the shop floor are contributing. The investors who risk
their capital are also a vital part of the equation.</div>
					<a name="0805093000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister may say that that
is not a problem because it is perfectly possible for
the business angel investor to become a director of the company. Then
he will qualify, but more and more responsibilities and liabilities are
being placed on directors of companies, for example, in relation to
health and safety with corporate manslaughter provisions coming in. We
should not encourage phantom directorships where for tax purposes
people who have no control or involvement in the day-to-day running of
a business become directors simply so that they qualify for a certain
tax treatment. That would be a detrimental move. We should aim for an
environment in which the directors of a company are the people who are
in control of that business and can therefore be properly held to
account for the conduct of that business on a day-to-day basis. That
requirement will encourage people who are not actively involved in the
business to seek nominal directorships, while having no engagement in
the running of the business. I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s take on that scenario and whether she believes that
there is an issue of concern there. That concludes the group of
amendments. Amendments Nos. 24 and 25 are consequential to amendment
No.

Standing Committee&#151;on the National Lottery Bill&#151;our dear
hon. Friend Gwyneth Dunwoody was in the Chair. Within my first three
sentences she had leaned across the lectern and, as only she could do,
whispered loud enough for the whole of the Committee to hear,
&#147;For goodness sake, Jane, speak up&#148;. I hear what you say
and I will do my best to remember it.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>
					<a name="0805093000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
the taper relief rules, business asset taper relief was potentially
available on the disposal of any business assets, provided that there
was a qualifying period of ownership of at least one year.
Entrepreneurs relief, on the other hand, is available where disposal of
assets is part of the disposal of all or part of the business, or where
disposal takes place of assets used up to the time the business ceased.
I confess that I missed which of his amendments the hon. Gentleman felt
were unnecessary, but I heard him say that amendments Nos. 19 and 20
were the two key
amendments.</div>
					<a name="0805093000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">

							<a name="0805093000475"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 17 and 18. Some business asset
taper relief was available in respect of disposals of shares, if the
company had been a trading company or a holding company of a trading
group at any time in the 10 years preceding the disposal. Entrepreneurs
relief is available only if conditions are satisfied throughout the
year immediately preceding the disposal, or the cessation of the
company&#146;s business, if
earlier.</div>
					<a name="0805093000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will take
first one of the last points that the hon. Gentleman made. He invited
us to consider seriously whether it is sensible to create what he
believed might be described as phantom directorships for tax purposes.
That is not a partisan point; it is a sensible point and I will
consider whether that is one of the matters arising from this set of
reforms that we need to keep closely under review. We will listen to
representations on that
point.</div>
					<a name="0805093000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The differences
that I have described between the taper relief rules and those for
entrepreneurs relief mean that entrepreneurs relief is not available on
many disposals that would have qualified for taper relief. That is an
effect of the different targeting of the two reliefs. The effect of
amendments Nos. 14 to 16 would be that an asset that had been used for
business purposes for two years would qualify for entrepreneurs relief,
without the requirement that it be a disposal on cessation of
business.</div>
					<a name="0805093000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 17 to 20 would make it possible for assets that had changed use
before disposal to be eligible for entrepreneurs relief, and shares
could qualify even if the conditions of connection to the claimant and
the activities of the company had ceased to be satisfied before the
disposal. That group of amendments comes out of representations made by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, an
organisation with which I have&#151;I hope&#151;a healthy and
lively relationship. The amendments suggest that the change in the
qualifying period would be consistent with the conditions for the
exemption from tax on gains realised by companies on disposals of
substantial shareholdings. However, the effect of the amendments would
be a significant relaxation in the targeting of entrepreneurs
relief on people withdrawing from business.</div>
					<a name="0805093000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether the lack of
entrepreneurs relief discouraged renewal of business assets. Where a
continuing business replaces business assets, rollover relief is
available, and that has not changed. We do not believe, therefore, that
entrepreneurs relief is needed in those circumstances. It is aimed at
disposals of business and includes closing a business
down.</div>

Hammond:
						</b> Does the Financial Secretary accept that in the
absence of amendments Nos. 19 and 20, there is an artificial
restriction? She is right in what she says, but can she not envisage a
situation in which, in the course of winding down or selling a
business, the qualifying requirements that one holds a minimum of
5 per cent. of the shares and is an office holder or
employee will cease before the final disposal is made? What she is
doing is denying relief in those cases. It seems to us from a
common-sense point of view that in such cases the Government would not
want to deny relief, other than for money-saving considerations. The
measure will invite people to structure deals and transactions purely
for tax purposes. Her predecessor, with whom I used to have interesting
discussions, felt very strongly that that was not the way to go
forward.</div>

tax-driven deal that is created as a result of these proposals is that
in 12 or 24 months&#146; time we will face another Finance Bill and
it will contain clause upon clause of anti-avoidance measures. That is
what has happened in the past because the Treasury has constantly and
understandably been playing catch-up with professional advisers who are
able to create artificial mechanisms. We are concerned that a future
Finance Bill Committee will have to consider such measures to
alleviate, from the Treasury&#146;s point of view, problems that
arise with artificial creations that come as a result of
ill-thought-through measures such as this. All that we are asking the
Financial Secretary is that, for once, we be wise before the

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000479"></a>Jane
Kennedy:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. There are many
occasions when behaviour changes as a result of changes in the tax
regime. That was the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and
Weybridge on the way in which decisions relating to the disposal of
assets might be influenced by the application of entrepreneurs relief.
With even the best structured tax regime for capital gains tax and
given the most detailed thought, there will still be tax advisers whose
whole purpose is to advise businesses on how to manage their investment
decisions and their decisions on the disposal of assets to their
advantage in tax
terms.</div>
					<a name="0805093000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are talking
not about people evading tax but about businesses making decisions
based on the tax regime within which they function. I accept the point
that the hon. Gentleman is making, but we believe that,
by introducing much-desired simplicity by making
changes to capital gains tax, we will reap benefits for businesses in
the coming months and years. Even if we had changed the regime as
suggested by the Conservative party in its amendments, tax advisers
would still be working hard to find ways of minimising the tax
liabilities for their clients. While the hon. Gentleman has made a
point 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>worth making, it is not relevant. I suspect that we shall be doing what
he suggests that we shall be doing anyway.
<i class="I">[Laughter.]</i>
					</div>
					<a name="0805093000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Businesses
will continue to be set up for a variety of commercial reasons. The
hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked why there were
differences for sole traders and partnerships. Tax, including the
possible availability of entrepreneurs relief, will be just one factor
that people might want to take into account when deciding the business
structure that is right for them. I acknowledge that the tax regime
does influence decision making, but it is not the only
factor.</div>

							<a name="0805093000480"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> Of course, the Minister is right, but let us
suppose that I am a sole trader setting up a new small business. I
expect to have business assets that I might like to sell and on which I
shall receive entrepreneurs relief. Why would I not set up the business
as a limited liability partnership with my wife rather than as a sole
trader, knowing that if I just take the simple step of establishing it
as a limited liability partnership&#151;or even an ordinary
partnership&#151;I would be able to sell business assets and gain the
benefit of entrepreneurs relief without having to cease the business?
That seems a perverse signal to send; it would cause people to
structure their businesses in an unnatural way simply for tax
advantages.</div>

edges. I accepted the point about how the regime might influence
behaviour, and the hon. Gentleman has now described more than one way
in which it may be perverse. We believe that the rules, as drafted,
strike a reasonable balance with clear conditions, but I have said that
I shall keep the relief under close
review.</div>
					<a name="0805093000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
14 to 16 would have the effect that I have described. They would allow
disposals to qualify for relief, even if the individual was not
withdrawing from business. Amendment Nos. 17 to 20 would allow the
assets to be switched away from businesses, but to continue to qualify
for relief. Amendment No. 15, perhaps unintentionally, would prevent
some disposals following the cessation of a business from qualifying
for relief as, in certain cases, assets would not meet the new test of
having been in business use up until the point of
disposal.</div>

the answer to the points that have been made, but will she think about
what she is saying? Let us consider the example of the factory and its
disposal. The right hon. Lady said that, if an asset becomes used for a
non-business purpose, it ceases to be eligible for entrepreneurs
relief. In the course of disposing of a business, it would be unsafe to
switch the business to new premises and then dispose of the old
premises that were held outside the business as assets of the
individual because they would then be disqualified from eligibility for
entrepreneurs relief. It is that sort of micro-management and how the
decision process is taken that we consider will be so debilitating,
unnatural and inhibitive of the way in which people would normally
handle such matters.</div>

per cent. effective tax rate will be of most value for business owners
and material investors at the point of disposal. Broadening the scope
of the relief in the way proposed, to allow a wider range of assets or
looser connections to the business activity to qualify, would
necessarily dilute this
focus.</div>

							<a name="0805093000484"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I am disappointed by the right hon.
Lady&#146;s response because I do not feel that she has engaged with
the specific issues raised. She talked about simplification; surely it
must be obvious to anyone on the Committee listening to the debate and
reading schedule 3 that this is not a simplifying measure. This late
amendment, the entrepreneurs relief, has hugely complicated the
Government&#146;s proposals on capital gains tax. In fact, it has
removed the only benefit of the original package, which was so abruptly
introduced but, in its favour, did simplify the system. Grafting
entrepreneurs relief on top of the proposals makes them hugely
complex.</div>
					<a name="0805093000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial
Secretary talked about the incentive for tax advisers to develop all
sorts of planning scenarios. In the real world, where the maximum tax
savings will be &#163;80,000, only the simplest planning strategies
will be implementable. People will not be able to go to large firms of
accountants and have them establish very complex tax planning
strategies, because the amount of tax to be saved simply will not
justify it. I am pleased, but alarmed, by the number of matters that
she has agreed to keep under review. I can see that the Government are
going to have to appoint a new person to the Treasury Front-Bench
team&#151;the under-secretary for reviews of the Finance Act 2008. If
the hon. Lady keeps all these matters under review, she is going to be
very busy.</div>
					<a name="0805093000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
tabled these amendments to be helpful and to probe the
Government&#146;s intentions. There is still a lot of uncertainly out
there about what this regime will mean in practice. I had hoped that
the Financial Secretary would clarify at least the Government&#146;s
intention today. Our fear and our belief is that this was done in a
great hurry in response to pressure from business organisations and
particularly from the Federation of Small Businesses, which should get
a mention for its success in getting this huge climbdown for small
businesses.</div>

hastily drafted legislation. We were hoping that the Minister would do
more than undertake to keep under review some of these issues,
particularly the requirement for employment or office holding. Later we
shall come to the requirement for a 5 per cent. share
holding. I had hoped that she would undertake to review such issues
before Report. I sense that the mood of the Committee is that we have a
great deal to get through and we want to discuss many other areas in

							<a name="0805093000487"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> Again, I intend to address the issues
raised in this group separately, but they all deal
with the circumstances in which a sale of shares is a qualifying
disposal for entrepreneurs relief. Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 challenge
the requirement for a 5 per cent. holding of shares. There was no such
requirement in relation to taper relief or in relation to the share in
a limited liability partnership. Limited liability partnerships are an
alternative form of business structure and are comparable to
incorporation for a smaller business. That rule seems to have been
lifted from retirement relief and not updated to reflect the emergence
of limited liability partnerships, as I said earlier. That is onerous
for those in high-tech industries, for example.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>
					<a name="0805093000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Dundee, East
raised some points raised by the BioIndustry Association. It has drawn
attention to the fact that in capital-intensive start-up areas to which
highly skilled employees need to be attracted, it is not unusual to
give employees shares or share options in the business. It would be
unlikely that anyone but the most lucky employee or one of a group of
founders&#151;perhaps those who came out of a university and set up a
high-tech business&#151;would hold more than 5 per cent. of the
shares each after they had suffered a number of dilutions during the
capital-raising process of taking their business forward. That is a
function of the fact that significant equity needs to be released in
order to attract the capital.</div>
					<a name="0805093000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Therefore, I
invite the Financial Secretary to think about the example of five
brilliant bioscientists leaving a university and setting up a business
on the Cambridge University science park. Over the years, they first
raise &#163;500,000, and then another &#163;500,000, but on each
occasion they will have to give away part of the equity in the business
until they come to the point at which they are reasonably successful.
They would be ready to dispose of their company by perhaps floating it
on the stock market or selling out to a much larger company, but by
that stage the five of them would have between them only 24 per cent.
of the original equity. They will not qualify for entrepreneurs relief,
and to me that is a bizarre situation.</div>
					<a name="0805093000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the greatest respect to
small businesses, many people go into business and establish small
companies, not with the intention of creating a large business,
employing lots of people, floating it on the stock market and creating
millions of pounds of wealth, but simply with a view to having a
comfortable lifestyle and engaging in useful and remunerative activity,
which is very worthy. Such small businesses are the backbone of our
society, and I applaud them. However, in economic terms, we should
focus on those who start businesses with a view to turning them into
the Googles, the Microsofts and the major biotech companies of the
future. It is on those businesses that the Government should focus
their
attention.</div>
					<a name="0805093000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000488"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> I think that I have just discovered a double
whammy. I had not considered the dilution of shares at the back end in
the way that the hon. Gentleman has. The dilution of shares will be
intensified by this measure precisely because the outside investor, if
they want the same cash return with the new tax regime, might demand
more from the pot. Therefore, the scenario described is now more likely
under the new rules than it was
before.</div>
					<a name="0805093000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000489"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is giving me more credit than
I deserve, because I had not discovered that, but the logic of what he
says is absolutely right. I am sure that risk-taking investors, faced
with alternative asset classes with similar tax treatment and perhaps
with other opportunities elsewhere in the world, will certainly look
for compensation for the reduction in post-tax return that they will
receive. Why should high-tech, high-capital requirement business be
disadvantaged as compared to low-tech, low-capital requirement
business? That does 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>not look like the forward-looking, technological
focus that I would expect from a Government who were thinking about
this country&#146;s future.</div>
					<a name="0805093000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000490"></a>Emily
Thornberry:
						</b> Will the hon. Gentleman help with this point?
Would not amendment No. 21 simply allow the tax relief that the
Government wish to give to entrepreneurs to be given to the stock
exchange? That tax relief would therefore be available only to
investors, not to entrepreneurs. It turns the whole idea of the tax
relief on its
head.</div>
				
					<a name="0805093000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000491"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The relief would be available to investors in
unlisted shares. The hon. Lady used the term stock exchange. It would
not be available to investors in stocks quoted on a stock exchange.
That is the point of inserting the term &#147;unlisted&#148;. It
reflects the taper relief regime where unlisted shares&#151;and under
the terms of that regime, also shares quoted on the alternative
investment market&#151;were, in most cases, treated as unlisted
investments. Unlisted investments were eligible for taper
relief.</div>
					<a name="0805093000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be
delighted if the Minister said that she could not accept the amendment
in the terms in which it is phrased, but that she accepted the point
behind it and would address it in another way. The point we are trying
to get to is about the 5 per cent. threshold. Let me be frank with her.
I have a vision of the person drafting the measure. In his mind, he has
a small factory&#151;perhaps in Birmingham, Erdington&#151;that is
bashing something out. There are boxes going out the door and there is
a hard-working entrepreneur who owns 100, 50 or 33 per cent. of the
business. That is the business that the draftsman has in mind, and when
thinking about that type of relatively low-capital business, I can
understand his insertion of the 5 per cent. limit. However, when we
look at the kind of high-tech, high-capital businesses&#151;perhaps
those growing up around our universities&#151;which we so desperately
need to promote and foster, the 5 per cent. threshold starts to look
like wishful thinking and an absurdly high bar that we are asking
people to clear.</div>
					<a name="0805093000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
said on Second Reading, it seems bizarre for  the Government to
reward investors in buy-to-let properties and owners of second homes
with a lower tax rate, to give owners of small, low-capital lifestyle
businesses a lower tax rate, but to say to those who risk their capital
and earning potential by working, founding and investing in high-tech,
potential high-growth businesses, which form the British winners of
tomorrow, that they must pay a relatively high rate of tax. It is a
bizarre signal to send, and I cannot believe that the Government wanted
to send that message to those people. That is why I would be delighted
were the Minister to accept, or at least recognise, our concerns, even
if she cannot accept the amendments in the precise terms in which they
are drafted.</div>
					<a name="0805093000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos. 21 and 22
replace the definition of a personal company with the phrase
&#147;unlisted&#148; company. I have deliberately not defined
unlisted company. There are various ways in which it could be done. As
I said earlier, under taper relief it included companies listed on the
alternative investment market, although that is not essential. Why
should the relief be more restrictive than it was under taper relief,
when everything under the entrepreneurs relief is subject to the
overall &#163;1 million cap?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>
					<a name="0805093000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I sit down, I want to
return to a specific point relating to enterprise management initiative
options, which was raised earlier by the hon. Member for Dundee, East.
In high-tech industries, such measures will almost always result in
holdings of less than 1 per cent. on exercise. I have a question for
the Minister. The enterprise management initiative was created by the
Government to encourage these people. They are now going to be
penalised. They make a conscious choice to take risk and to be
remunerated by capital gain rather than going to work for a big company
and being remunerated through income.</div>
					<a name="0805093000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">A concern being expressed by
professional bodies is that the way in which EMI options are treated by
the schedule suggests that the Government have lost interest in them,
have had a change of heart and are signalling that they should no
longer be used as the preferred route to incentivise employees in these
businesses. I should be grateful if the Minister answered that
challenge and, if I have got it wrong, gave a categorical assurance
that the Government remain committed to the EMI
regime.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000492"></a>Stewart
Hosie:
						</b> The way in which it has worked historically is that
the banks would facilitate the purchase of the shares for a day or so
to allow them to be sold. Given that they now need to be sold for a
year, given that there is a very tight credit squeeze and given the
market uncertainty, far from being an incentive, it might be that
someone simply cannot raise the money to crystallise and make the
profit and they would be landed with a
liability.</div>
					<a name="0805093000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="0805093000493"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is right and I wonder whether
the Minister and her colleagues have thought this through. The point
about an option is optionality. One sits on it and hopes that it will
have value but it does not have a downside. If it does not have any
value, one has not lost anything. One turns around and walks away from
it. As soon as anyone exercises that option, as they will be required
to do to gain the benefit of entrepreneurs relief, and acquire the
underlying shares, they will be exposed to risk. They could collapse in
value. The company could become insolvent. They could reduce to zero in
value. It is not about a bank lending for a couple of days. It is about
a bank lending for a year and being prepared to take the full risk of
something happening to that business during that time. Options and
shares are not interchangeable in that way. Shares represent a capital
risk. Options represent an opportunity with no downside risk.</div>
					<a name="0805093000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was amendments Nos. 21 and
22. There are lots more amendments in the group. Amendment No. 38
explores a different approach to the same problem and one which would
simplify and introduce consistency within the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act 1992, which this schedule amends. Amendment No. 38
substitutes in new section 169S at page 127 line 37 for the existing
definition of a personal company as a trading company in which an
individual holds at least 5 per cent. and is an officer or
employee, a definition that is already in section 165(8) of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act. That definition is 5 per cent. of the
voting rights. It is not as loose as I would like, but it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 134</div>is a looser definition than the one which has been imported from the old
retirement relief into the entrepreneurs relief
schedule.</div>
					<a name="0805093000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the Bill
is enacted we will have a situation where the Taxation of Chargeable
Gains Act will define a personal company in two different ways. It will
define it at section 165(8), as amended, as being a company in which an
individual holds 5 per cent. of the voting rights, with no obligation
whatsoever to own 5 per cent. of the ordinary shares, and it will
define it in respect of new section 169S as a requirement to hold both
5 per cent. of the ordinary share capital and 5 per cent. of the voting
rights. It is a reduction in flexibility, an unhelpful complication in
the Act and an additional impediment in the raising of capital having
to have 5 per cent. both of the ordinary share
capital&#151;that is to say the beneficial economic interest in the
business&#151;as well as 5 per cent. of the voting
rights.</div>
					<a name="0805093000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments Nos.
39 and 40 represent yet another approach, which I hope will tempt the
Minister. The point here is to show her that there are a number of ways
of tackling the problem. Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 would accept the
Government&#146;s architecture of a minimum percentage requirement
for voting and ordinary shareholding, but make it less of a threshold
by replacing 5 per cent. with 1 per cent. If the Government insist on
having a threshold, we can at least make it a level that is unlikely to
trip up
entrepreneurs.</div>
					<a name="0805093000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">So far,
we have heard no explanation whatsoever of the purpose of a 5 per cent.
threshold. We have not heard any rationale for it being set at 5 per
cent. We know very well that there is no rationale. It was just lifted
from the provisions on retirement relief. Whether the threshold is
abolished, reduced to 1 per cent. or limited to voting rights only and
made consistent with the rest of the TCGA, will the Minister explain
why the requirement is in the Bill and why it has been set at that
level?</div>
					<a name="0805093000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 41
takes us back to the debate that we had in relation to schedule 2. One
group of losers from the restructuring of capital gains tax is holders
of shares in approved employee share schemes. I heard the Minister say
earlier that she doubts the figures provided by ifs ProShare, which
suggest that 270,000 employee shareholders&#151;quite a small
percentage of the total; I think that it is 16 per cent. or a little
less&#151;would have gains that exceeded the annual exemption limit.
Of course, the vast majority of them will not. Most people who are
members of the Tesco employee share plan will have a relatively small
holding and will make gains that are comfortably within the annual
exemption limit. I accept
that.</div>
					<a name="0805093000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the greatest
of respect to the right hon. Lady, while I think that we all welcome
employee share ownership in large and small companies, I do not think
any of us would argue that employee share owners in Tesco are as
necessary and vital a driving force to the future expansion of business
as employee shareholders in small start-up high-tech businesses, where
the incentive of owning shares is a key part of the package that drives
the business forward. Those are the kind of businesses that double in
size every year. Although it may sometimes seem to

					<a name="0805093000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I am sure has
been discussed under the previous schedule, the old CGT regime meant
that basic rate taxpayers who held shares in their employer for at
least two years were subject to only a 5 per cent. CGT charge, or 10
per cent. for higher-rate taxpayers. They face an additional 13 per
cent. tax on any gain above &#163;9,600 because they are not eligible
for entrepreneurs relief. It does not seem likely that the Government
would wish to argue for
that.</div>

and in which that shareholding will therefore become worth
significantly more than the annual exemption limit, let them say so
clearly. I would hope that that is not the Government&#146;s position

requirement. That allows for sale of the options, rather than having to
exercise them, addressing the point that the hon. Member for Dundee,
East made in an intervention. Allowing the options to be realised with
eligibility for entrepreneurs relief, avoids the need to raise the
finance and to take the risk of holding a capital asset and possibly
seeing it depreciate over a year&#151;getting the timing wrong. That
would send a powerful signal in favour of the EMI regime.</div>
					<a name="0805093000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister should not
underestimate the concern among professional bodies that the
Government&#146;s apparent abandonment of EMI in the set of
provisions is sending a signal that the Government are no longer
committed to it. I am not an expert in those areas, but I understand
that professional bodies have already picked up signals from the
Government that they may no longer be as keen on the EMI scheme. If
that is not the case, it would be helpful if the Minister could make an
unambiguous statement of the Government&#146;s commitment to the EMI
scheme. The amendment adds a provision that options under EMI qualify
the individual under the entrepreneurs relief regime, and it inserts
into the relevant section the definition of EMI taken from the Income
Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act. I look forward to her
comments.</div>

						</b> The group of amendments seeks in one way or
another to relax the conditions under which disposals of shares and
securities can qualify for entrepreneurs relief. Amendments Nos. 21 and
22 would remove the 5 per cent. shareholding requirement and extend the
relief to any holding of shares or securities in an unlisted company.
Amendment No. 38 also seeks to remove the 5 per cent. shareholding
requirement. Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 seek to dilute the 5 per cent.
shareholding and voting rights requirements to 1 per cent. Amendments
Nos. 5 and 41 to 43 seek to extend relief to shares acquired under
employee share schemes or the enterprise management incentive scheme.
Again, all those amendments are
unnecessary.</div>

					<a name="0805093000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">In constructing
schedule 3, we have deliberately focused entrepreneurs relief on
individuals who own their own business or a material stake in a
company. The relief is designed to promote and reward substantial
investment and involvement in a business. We consider the 5 per cent.
shareholding test to be a suitable benchmark for that purpose. The hon.
Gentleman has spoken at length about why he thinks that we arrived at 5
per cent. However, entrepreneurs relief is targeted at those with a
material stake in a company and those who play an active role in it.
The right to vote is an important part of defining that activity. The
rules, therefore, require the qualifying 5
per cent. material stake in the company to be accompanied by the same
minimum percentage of voting rights. We are striking a balance between
focusing relief on material investors and allowing many people to
benefit from the relief and the cost of the relief. The hon. Gentleman
has heard explanations for the 5 per cent. He just does not agree with
the explanations that have been offered.</div>

question. May I offer him an absolute commitment to the EMI as a
valuable aid to help small companies in riskier areas to recruit and
retain the staff that they need to grow? Our commitment to EMI is shown
by the increase in the individual limit from &#163;100,000 to
&#163;120,000, which took effect from 6 April 2008. The impact on
individual investors will depend on their personal
circumstances.</div>

						</b> In defining what we mean by interest and a
material stake in the business, we drew the line at 5 per cent. We
believe that that was the right balance to strike. I accept the example
that the hon. Gentleman gave of five young students coming out of
university and investing in the way in which he described. If the
capital gain were split between the five equally, they would not
receive the relief. In seeking to define what we meant, we have arrived
at the definition that I have described. We believe that it strikes the
right balance.</div>
					<a name="0805093000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of
the amendments in this group make reference to employee share schemes.
Some of the schemes, such as the share incentive plans, and capital
gains tax relief, remain in place, while the vast majority of
participants, including the save-as-you earn schemes, have capital
gains well below the tax-free annual exempt amount. In all cases, the
income tax and national insurance benefits of scheme membership remain
in place. We do not believe that it

						</b> I do not have that figure immediately in front of
me. If we have a figure for it, I will supply it to the
Committee. It is not material to the consideration of the amendments
themselves. We do not believe that the amendments are necessary in
principle. It is not necessary or desirable to connect the

							<a name="0805093000501"></a>Mr.
Hammond:
						</b> I am, once again, disappointed. I do not get the
impression from the Minister&#146;s response to that group of
amendments, as I did from her response to the previous group of
amendments, that she was even listening to the issues. There was no
sense of a thoughtful response or even a concession that there might be
a grain of something that needs to be &#147;kept under
review&#148;&#151;to use her
phrase.</div>
					<a name="0805093000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to labour the point, but I sometimes wonder whether Ministers and those
who advise them understand at all how small and medium businesses work
and what motivates the people who get involved in them. The message
going out from here is very negative. It is sending the wrong signal to
all sorts of people. We have heard that the Government are now in
&#147;listening mode&#148;&#151;they switched to listening mode
on Sunday morning. I would have thought that in the spirit of that
listening mode the Minister would have wanted to look at some of these
issues again because the 5 per cent. limit is a problem; it will
exclude people who should not be excluded and it will preferentially
treat lifestyle businesses while penalising those in
high-capital-requirement, high-growth businesses that really are
important to the economy.</div>
					<a name="0805093000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I noted the result of the last
Division, and because of the arithmetic in the room I am not going to
detain the Committee by pressing the amendment to the vote. Those
outside will have heard that we have made the case, they will have
heard that the Minister has failed to respond to it and that the
listening Government are not listening as far as entrepreneurs,
high-growth businesses, holders of share options in those businesses
and holders of employee shareholdings are concerned. They will draw
their own conclusions. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>
