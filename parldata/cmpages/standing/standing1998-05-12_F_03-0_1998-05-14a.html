The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry 
(Mrs. Barbara Roche): I beg to move amendment
No. 9, in page 3, line 4, after "debt"	 insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or (where that amount is unascertained) the sum which the supplier 
claims is the amount of the debt'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I begin this sitting by warmly welcoming you,
Mr. Cook, to the Chair of the Committee, which is 
considering this very important Bill? You are well known 
for your experience in such matters and for the firm but 
fair way in which you deal with Committee proceedings.
<P>
<P>
This technical amendment will improve the 
transparency of the text. It makes it clear from when 
interest will run, where the contract did not stipulate a 
price and the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or the Supply of 
Goods and Services Act 1982 provide a duty to pay a 
reasonable price. An example of such a contract would be 
where someone was called out to fix a boiler no price 
would be agreed before the service was rendered, but 
there would be a duty on the customer to pay a 
reasonable price.
<P>
The amendment provides that the default credit period 
should start to run from when the debtor has notice of the 
amount the creditor claims. That is so that, even if the 
debtor has good cause to dispute the amount, clause 5 on 
remission of statutory interest could be used by the debtor 
to remit any undeserved interest.
<P>
As I have said, this is a technical amendment. It is 
intended to aid both the good passage of the Bill and its 
use when, as I hope, it is enacted. I commend it to the 
Committee.
<P>
<B></B><P>
 <P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth (Bromley an Chislehurst):</B> May I, too, 
welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook? I am reassured to 
see you in the Chair; you will keep us all in good order 
and pointing in the right direction.
<P>
My first thought on hearing what the Minister said was 
rather uncharitable and ungracious. I have been a Member 
of Parliament long enough to know that, when a Minister 
introduces an amendment as being merely technical, my 
ears should prick up and I should wonder whether that is 
so. It is an old, well-worm device it often works, but 
sometimes it does not. Whether or not an amendment is technical could be the subject of an interesting debate 
not in this Committee, Mr. Cook, because you would not 
encourage it. One of these days we should have a 
debate perhaps an Adjournment debate on at what 
stage the description "technical"	 can or cannot be applied 
to an amendment.
<P>
The term sounds bland enough, does it not? However, 
my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), 
with whom I had the pleasure to serve for a period in the 
European Parliament, will recall that that term was used 
frequently there. As we sat listening to the proceedings in 
many languages, the term "technical"	 was often used. My 
hon. Friend will recall that the same point applied.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> I am listening 
carefully to my hon. Friend, and I think that he is right to 
warn the Committee in that way. It was often argued in 
the European Parliament, sometimes by Italian Christian 
Democrats, that something was merely technical, when, in 
fact, they were talking about the budget of the European 
Community a matter of significance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Indeed. We are not talking about that today, 
Mr. Cook, as I suspect you might be about to remind me. 
However, we are talking about an important part of the 
Bill. My attention was drawn to it by the wording of
the amendment, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the sum which the supplier claims is the amount of the debt"	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister has given a not unreasonable example of 
that. She said that the amount would be specified after the 
service has been provided. She then said quite 
reasonably, and before anyone else could say it that if 
that gave rise to dispute, the normal processes would be 
available. The Committee has heard that phrase once or 
twice before. I recall those words being used in other 
contexts, when it was said that everything would be all 
right because, if there was a problem or dispute, the 
parties could resort to legal proceedings.
<P>
The Minister spoke those words as if they were a 
reassurance, but they are not. Whether or not the change 
is technical, it says that the sum that the supplier claims 
is the amount of the debt, and that if that claim proves 
not to be satisfactory to the purchaser, resort may be made 
to legal proceedings. That is hardly a firm basis on which 
to legislate.
<P>
I wonder whether those words help. In some 
circumstances, they could make the position worse. If 
someone were to pray in aid those words and say "Oh, it 
says in the Bill that the supplier can claim the amount of 
the debt even if no prior arrangement has been made or if 
both parties disagree with the contract."	 Those words 
could favour the supplier against the purchaser. The 
supplier could resort to those words, claiming that the Bill 
states that he can claim the amount of the debt, if it was 
necessary thereafter to resort to legal proceedings.



<P>
I am not a lawyer, so I am watching the Minister 
carefully. She is a distinguished lawyer and I can see that 
she is not totally impressed with what I am saying, but I 
want to give her the chance to clarify the meaning of the 
amendment and say exactly how it may affect the 
relationship between supplier and purchaser. I want to 
know whether the Minister, with her dual expertise as a 
distinguished lawyer and as a Minister of the Crown, is 
satisfied that that form of words will not bias the 
relationship one way or the other.
<P>
That sort of thing is vital when considering legislation 
of this sort. There have been broad agreement on the 
Government's motivation and aspirations. The worries 
expressed by the Opposition on Second Reading 
included a worry that, if we are not careful, the detail 
of such a Bill can be counter-productive. We are now 
considering such an example. I suggest that the risk is 
that this innocent sounding amendment could be 
counter-productive.
<P>
The Minister sought to reassure the Committee by 
saying that if anything went wrong between supplier and 
purchaser they could resort to legal action. That is no 
reassurance: I find those words among the most chilling 
in the English language. Distinguished lawyers, such as 
my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull or the Minister, 
may be reassured when they hear those words; but they 
have the opposite effect on those who are not legal 
practitioners.
<P>
I ask the Minister to reassure the Committee it will 
be on record; I have Pepper v. Hart in mind that my 
fears about that innocent sounding phrase moving the 
relationship one way or the other or pushing people 
unnecessarily and gratuitously into legal proceedings are 
unfounded and unwarranted. I hope that we will receive 
a reassurance for those who, in their innocence, believe 
that the Bill will improve their lives by leaps and bounds. 
I hope that the Minister will oblige me.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It has come to my attention that 
several members of the Committee have divested 
themselves of their jackets. I am prepared to overlook that 
on this occasion. As the calendar is moving on and the 
summer is becoming warmer, proceedings may become 
somewhat sultry. I must remind members of the 
Committee that they can take that action only with the 
express permission of the Chair. I call Mrs. Roche.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Thank you, Mr. Cook. Let me start by 
saying [Laughter.] Mr. Cook, now that you have 
divested yourself of your jacket, may I thank you for your 
kind guidance in that area? Our proceedings on Tuesday 
became very sultry.
<P>
I think that I will be able to reassure the right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth). We 
seek by the amendment to make it clear from when the 
interest would run where the contract did not stipulate the 
price and, in line with the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and 
the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, provide a 
duty to pay a reasonable price. Our concern is from when 
the interest would run.
<P>
I can also tell the right hon. Gentleman that there is no 
intention nor should any such intention be implied of 
distorting the relationship between supplier and customer. 
The amendment could not be read as providing a bias.
<P>
On the right hon. Gentlemen's point about legal 
proceedings, the whole purpose of the Bill is to give an 
automatic statutory right to interest, so that people do not 
have to go to court to obtain that right. Court proceedings 
will arise only to enforce that right.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Forth: Of course one accepts that; we all 
understand that. The risk is that in some cases, where 
people seek to avoid the automatic right provided by the 
Bill, they will resort to querying other elements of the 
transaction in order to delay the matter or to avoid it 
altogether. The simplest examples would be a dispute over 
quality or fitness for purpose of the service or goods, or 
a simple query over quantity. If that dispute could not be 
resolved, it would become the subject of legal 
proceedings.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That is correct, but we intend that parties 
will not have to rely on court proceedings. The parties 
themselves can agree remission of the interest; we have 
provided for that under clause 7(2). That is clearly right 
and sensible.
<P>
I agree with the right hon. Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst; no sane or sensible person would want legal 
proceedings when they can be avoided. That is especially 
true in commerce, where the parties to a dispute will want 
to resolve it as amicably as possible and get on with 
their business.
<P>
The amendment is intended to stop time running 
against the debtor until he knows how much the creditor 
is claiming for the debt, which must already have arisen. 
It is not a charter for suppliers to start claiming out of 
order. I am happy to have been given the opportunity to 
make that absolutely clear, and I hope that that will 
reassure the right hon. Gentleman. I commend that 
amendment to the Committee.

<P>

<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I intend to address the 
Committee briefly. I know that I cannot refer to a new 
clause that I tabled, but which has not been selected.






<P>
I invite the Minister to recall the admittedly not very 
original remark that I made on Tuesday: the best way for 
someone running a business to protect credit is to have a 
good look at a customer before doing business with him 
or her, to ensure that he or she is creditworthy and has a 
track record of paying debts. It is with that in mind that 
commercial societies have enjoyed the benefit of a 
register of county court judgements since shortly after the 
Great Exhibition in 1852. There is no comparable register 
of commercial judgments in the High Court. When one is 
about to embark on business, perhaps with a new 
customer, it is common prudence to make credit inquiries 
and to search the register of county court judgments. 
However, county court judgments, and the quantum of 
county court judgments, have been left behind by time 
and many significant commercial judgments are now 
made in the High Court, which has no register that one 
can search. The Minister, the Department of Trade and 
Industry and the Lord Chancellor's Department should 
examine that omission.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 10, in page 3, line 6, leave out 
from "sum"	 to end of line 7 and insert "due in respect of 
a period of hire of goods,"	. [Mrs. Roche.]
<P>
Clause 4, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Remission of statutory interest</center></H4>
<P>
On proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I must 
apologise for my enthusiasm in leaping up to make a 
contribution to our valuable Committee proceedings.
<P>
As I understand it, the purpose of the clause is to 
require the Secretary of State to prescribe a statutory rate 
of interest to set out how it is calculated and to state what 
factors were considered in fixing the rate. On Second 
Reading, the Minister announced that the rate would be
8 per cent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am advised that the hon. 
Gentleman's remarks are relevant to clause 6. Would he 
check that and assess his position?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I agree, Mr. Cook, but in the notes on 
clauses clause 6 is crossed out and substituted by clause 
5. If that is misleading, I withdraw my remarks and will 
return to the subject at the appropriate time.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> New Labour, new deception.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am disturbed by sedentary 
interventions that imply that the Chairman is being in any 
way party political.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I apologise, Mr. Cook.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Apology accepted.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 6</center></H4>
<H4><center>Rate of statutory interest</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 
3, line 37, at end add 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3) An order under this section shall not be made until a draft of 
it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House 
of Parliament."	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to 
consider amendment No. 4, in clause 15, page 7, line 9, 
after "section"	, insert "6 or section"	.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I bid you good morning, Mr. Cook, and 
hope that as Opposition Members, we will be as well 
behaved under your chairmanship as we were under the 
previous two Chairmen of the Committee. It is a great 
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship; I know that 
you have had trouble with me before in similar 
circumstances, but I shall always bow to your wise words.
<P>
Clause 6 deals with the rate of statutory interest, which 
is a major plank of the Bill. It will concern all businesses. 
It is an enabling clause, which begs the questions why it 
was drafted in this way and why more detail was not 
included in the Bill.
<P>
In the draft legislation, the Government propose that 
the President of the Board of Trade set the interest rate 
not only by consulting the Treasury but with and only 
with the consent of the Treasury. Clause 6(1) gives the 
prescribing power to the President of the Board of Trade, 
but leaves the reins of power firmly with the Treasury.
<P>
What would happen in the event of a dispute between 
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Treasury? 
As we all know, that is not unheard of, irrespective of 
which party is in power. Who would act as arbiter? Before 
deciding the rate, the President has two considerations, 
which are laid out in subsection(2). If the President, on 
deciding the figure, discovers that she is at odds with the 
Treasury, who will have the final decision?



<P>
We have seen the Government's propensity to devolve 
power to other bodies, not least in the precipitate way in 
which they handed over responsibility for interest rates to 
the Bank of England. Why was the power to set these 
interest rates not devolved to the Bank of England? I 
know that the Minister is familiar with representations 
that have been made to both of us during the passage of 
the Bill. Some people believe that that power should have 
been given to the Bank of England, which would have 
been in line with Government trends. Has the Minister 
considered that? What is her view? How did she arrive at 
the decision that now faces the Committee?
<P>
Subsection (2)(b) provides that the Secretary of State 
must consider a rate that is desirable to deter generally 
the last payment of qualifying debts. How will she decide 
what level is a deterrent? What evidence will she regularly 
collect to enable her to establish whether a rate is a 
deterrent? The Committee would greatly benefit from 
such elaboration.
<P>
Accompanying the clause is a draft order, which sets 
the proposed interest rate at 8 per cent. Following a long 
consultation period, that rate has been revised from the 
rate that was initially decided. How did the Minister arrive 
at that figure? In the interim period between publishing 
the proposed figure and today, has she revised her views 
on the level at which it should be set?
<P>
Will the Minister also elaborate on future changes to 
the rate? How often does she envisage rate changes being 
made? Monthly? Weekly? Daily? In times of high 
volatility of interest rates, does she envisage the rate 
changing daily?
<P>
The clause allows the Secretary of State to choose 
whether to prescribe the rate directly or to set it by 
formula. Which method does the Minister favour? If the 
President of the Board of Trade decided to pursue the 
formula, what would prevent her from abandoning it and 
changing the rate as and when she thought fit? As the 
Minister said on Tuesday, small businesses want certainty. 
What certainty can the hon. Lady guarantee when the 
mechanism under the clause could operate in a volatile, 
uncertain and arbitrary fashion?
<P>
How will the Minister inform businesses of the rate? If 
it changes rapidly, how does she intend to advise them of 
the rate at which they should set interest? Will she take 
out advertisements in daily newspapers or trade journals? 
Will she appear on "News at Ten"	 and announce that the 
rate has changed? The amendments are probing 
amendments to encourage the Government to be open 
about the mechanism. One way in which to encourage 
more openness wold be for the setting of interest rates to 
be discussed on the Floor of the House. That would ensure 
a transparent process, and it may provide a disincentive 
to change rates rapidly. At present, the clause is viewed 
by some businesses as a bit of a nonsense. I hope that the 
Minister will explain the mechanism fully and provide the 
necessary assurances to businesses.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady made a wide-ranging 
speech, almost as though this were a clause stand part 
debate. Let me be clear. The Government believe that it 
is proper that the setting of interest rate order be subject 
to the negative resolution procedure. That view is shared 
by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and 
Deregulation in the other place. During the proceedings 
in the other place we listened to the noble Lords, and the 
order will now be made by the Secretary of State after the 
consent of the Treasury. The Government found 
discussions in the other place helpful, and we made the 
change on that basis. As the hon. Lady knows, the 
Government will make their views known after
the appropriate consultation process.
<P>
I am not sure why it is now deemed necessary to make 
the order subject to affirmative resolution. The power to 
set the rate of interest is particularly unsuitable for such 
procedure because, if economic circumstances change 
suddenly, it may be necessary to make an order at short 
notice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I read carefully the proceedings in another 
place and I appreciate that the Minister found them 
helpful. Given her last remarks, is she confirming my 
worst fears that she can envisage the rate changing daily 
or weekly?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, not necessarily. We do not anticipate 
that happening.
<P>
I reassure the Committee that the Government will, 
where practicable, listen to the views of business and 
other interested parties before making an order. That is 
why the work of the Bradford university payment 
observatory will be useful. Only after the consultation that 
took place last year have we now proposed an initial rate 
of base rate plus 8 per cent. It will remain open to either 
House to strike down the rate, using the negative 
resolution procedure.



<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I deal now with some of the other points made by the 
hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan). 
It is not possible to state in the Bill the rate of statutory 
interest. The Government wish to link the rate to the 
official dealing rate of the Bank of England, announced 
by its monetary policy committee, but it may not be 
incumbent on the Bank to announce that rate in future. 
The Bill therefore provides a power, exercisable by the 
Secretary of State with the consent of the Treasury, to 
announce a rate.
<P>
In setting a rate, the Secretary of State may consider, 
first, protecting suppliers whose financial position may, if 
they are paid late, make them particularly vulnerable; and, 
secondly, deterring the late payment of qualifying debts. 
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham will be 
aware that we have published a draft order, which 
announces that the initial interest rate will be base rate 
plus 8 per cent.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham rightly 
asked about consultation with business, so that business 
knows what rate may be set. We shall consult interested 
organisations, including the private sector, to ensure that 
the rate is consistent with the objectives of the Bill. That 
is why the work of Bradford university is so important.
<P>
We have been persuaded by the argument that the rate 
must recompense all businesses, but especially the 
weakest, which are most at risk from their cash flow being 
disrupted. The Bank of England has advised us that base 
rate plus 8 per cent. Should meet that requirement.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for 
Chesham and Amersham and that she will withdraw the 
amendment. If not, I ask the Committee to reject it.
<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am still not satisfied with the Minister's 
answers. I still wish to know how the Minister will 
communicate the rate to business. I also wish to know 
how she will decide what mechanisms should be used to 
discover whether that rate of interest is acting as a 
deterrent and what the DTI can do about it. I shall raise 
those questions again during the clause stand part debate. 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of
the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I apologise, Mr. Cook, for being misled by 
the Government's cunning ploy. For some obscure reason, 
when the Bill was debated in another place, this matter 
was the subject of clause 5; now, in the House of 
Commons, it has been moved to clause 6. I am unaware 
of the reason for that Machiavellian move, but I apologise 
to the Committee for working from the original document. 
I have not heard before of clause numbers being swapped, 
but I suppose that there is a first time for everything.
<P>
I do not want to repeat what I said during our debate 
on the amendment. It is well understood that the Secretary 
of State will fix the rate, and that the calculations will be 
made by various means and will take account of certain 
factors. One might ask why the magic figure of 8 per cent. 
has been produced. What consideration was given to the 
matter? What formula was used? Why was 8 per cent. 
chosen and not 6 per cent., 7 per cent. or 5 per cent? It 
would be interesting to see the detailed calculations and 
to know how 8 per cent. emerged from the hat.
<P>
I say that because I was under the impression that the 
purpose of the Bill was to help small businesses with late 
payment that it was to help small business to even the 
scales and to redress the balance between the big and the 
little boys. We have witnessed the Minister realising that 
the Bill is not the cure-all for late payment. We have heard 
her delicately back-pedalling by saying that it is just part 
of an armoury. Its role in that armoury is reducing as 
knowledge about how it will work becomes more 
widespread. The figures of 8 per cent. may be a 
disincentive that does a disservice to the small business 
man and woman.
<P>
I have said before, and repeat, that the Bill will do 
nothing but set and extend contract payment times. The 
only advantage of it is that it will help to make invoice 
terms more certain and, as the Minister has said, provide 
more certainty about the time of payment. As someone 
with a little experience of the business world, I would 
prefer the uncertainty of being paid under the time scales 
used in the United Kingdom to the certainty of the time 
scales used for payment in Italy. It is the velocity of 
money going round the circuit that is important. It is to 
be hoped that people will make a return on the money 
each time, so if it goes around seven or eight times, rather 
than four or five, they will come out better off.



<P>
As was mentioned on Second Reading, the good 
Professor Wilson of Bradford university concluded that 
those in the small business sector were not all saints, and 
that those in big business were not all sinners. In fact, his 
conclusion was the other way round: that small businesses 
were more likely to be the sinners than the saints.
<P>
The figure of 8 per cent. may place a huge advantage 
in the hands of big businesses that are supplying small 
businesses. A large company can borrow money at 2 per 
cent. or 2.5 per cent. above the London inter-bank offer 
rate, or whatever rate is used as the base. Small businesses 
pay much more 5 per cent., 6 per cent. and, in some 
cases, eight per cent. above that base. If I were a big 
business supplying a small business, it would pay me to 
ensure that I claimed my statutory right to interest, 
because I would be making three per cent., 4 per cent. or 
5 per cent. over my borrowing rate. The longer that that 
went on, the better off I would be. The huge difference in 
those figures would provide a positive incentive for big 
businesses to hound small businesses.
<P>
I now realise why, when the matter was originally 
considered, I was hounded by a debt collection agency 
that wanted the measure to be introduced: it must have 
had some hint of the interest rate that was to be set. 
Having seen the figure of 8 per cent., it must think that 
its birthday will come 365 days a year.
<P>
I would like the Minister to confirm that there is 
sufficient flexibility in the wording and operation of the 
clause so that if or when this country enters the euro 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Never, I hope.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My right hon. Friend says never. I return to 
what I have said all along: I hope that the Bill will be 
sufficiently forward-looking to accommodate as many 
circumstances as possible so that, if this country enters 
the euro, the clause can operate even if the figures have 
to be altered.
<P>
I was slightly teasing the Minister in wondering about 
the long, detailed calculations and how 8 per cent. 
emerged from the critical cost analysis that was, no doubt, 
undertaken. However, I draw the Committee's attention 
to the proposal for a European Parliament and Council 
directive on combating late payment in commercial 
transactions, article 4 of which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"interest rates run automatically form the due date which should be 
at least the sum of the tenderinterest rate of the European Central 
Bank, plus eight points."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Minister confirm that the figure of eight 
percentage points more than the base rate has been 
dictated by Europe, rather than by any calculation of the 
Department?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Gillan: I think that the Committee can anticipate 
the questions that, yet again, I shall ask the Minister. Can 
she tell the Committee how changes in the rate of interest 
will be communicated to businesses and industry 
throughout the country and, indeed, abroad? It is 
important that, when dealing with British businesses, 
companies from abroad know the rate of interest, the 
penalty that they can expect to pay, if they fail to pay 
their debts on time.
<P>
Secondly, can the Minister expand on subsection
(2) (b) and tell us how the Department of Trade and 
Industry will establish whether the interest rate deters the 
late payment of qualifying debts? What resources will be 
put into that work? What evidence will she look for, how 
will she analyse it, and how will it relate to the powers 
that she is taking on herself under the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall be as brief as possible, because I 
have dealt with all the questions asked by the hon. Lady 
and I do not want to repeat myself unnecessarily. She 
asked whether the rate and formula would be effective.
I take pleasure in repeating that we shall remain in contact 
with, and consult, business.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan rose </B><P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I should like to make progress.
<P>
Again, I refer to the work of Bradford university 
payment observatory. We have established the 
relationship with Bradford university precisely so that we 
can monitor the Bill's effect.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister is still avoiding the 
question. How will she communicate the rate to the 
business community? Will she take our advertisements 
will she appear on "News at Ten"	, or will she ask Alastair 
Campbell to arrange regular press briefings? How will 
she communicate the rate to business? Many of the small 
businesses in my constituency are not frequently in touch 
with Government 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Or Alastair Campbell.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Or Alastair Campbell, for that matter, as 
my right hon. Friend says. I understand what the Minister 
says about the research that she intends to carry out, but 
how will she communicate the rate?



<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I knew that I was wrong to give way to 
the hon. Lady. That was not what I was talking about. I 
shall deal with that separate point later. However, I am 
always open to offers and am willing to go on "News at 
Ten"	 at any time. Of course, it would give me great 
pleasure to have the hon. Lady as an opponent.
<P>
Let me tell the hon. Member for South-West 
Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) that I have always said that the 
Bill in not a panacea. It is, however, an important measure 
in a basket of proposals that includes making free credit 
guides available to business, thereby improving credit 
management practice. It should be viewed in that context.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We shall publicise the rate through a free user's guide, 
which we shall ensure is extensively distributed and used. 
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham looks 
askance, but through groups such as the Better Payment 
Practice Group we have done more in the past year to 
spread our message about what needs to be done than the 
previous Government managed to do in the previous 18.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked 
how we had arrived at the formula of base rate plus
8 per cent. We wanted to construct an effective formula 
to implement the legislation. As I said earlier, during 
consultation we were persuaded by the argument that the 
rate must recompense all business, but especially the 
weakest business which, as the hon. Gentleman will agree, 
are more at risk and bear a heavier burden. The Bank of 
England has advised us that a rate of base rate plus 8 per 
cent. should meet that objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I fully understand that; I felt it only right to 
point out to the Committee that the 8 per cent. figure 
might constitute a problem. Small firms could be hit by 
larger ones, to the distinct advantage of the latter. I 
thought that it was right to draw that to the Minister's 
attention. Is she saying that it is sheer coincidence that the 
draft directive states a figure of 8 per cent. and that the 
Department has arrived at a figure of 8 per cent.?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Although I understand that the 
Commission has presented the draft directive to the 
industry council, the hon. Gentleman will know that it 
has not been discussed by member states. It is certainly 
interesting that the Commission has come to the same 
conclusion. However, we focused on the anxieties of 
small business and the Bank of England.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked about economic and 
monetary union, as he did on Second Reading. The 
Government do not intend to set rates for every currency 
ever used in commercial transactions. Parties to a contract 
may use different interest rates from that provided by the 
Bill, as long as they meet the criteria for substantial 
remedy for late payment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> My phrasing was obviously poor, confusing 
clauses 5 and 6. I asked whether the Bill contains 
sufficient flexibility which I favour such that if we 
enter economic and monetary union, the proposals 
presented in the directive could be accommodated in the 
Bill. I am looking ahead, trying to save our successors 
work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. 
I was about to say that if the United Kingdom were to 
join economic and monetary union, legislation would be 
required to deal with existing Acts that recognise sterling 
transactions only.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter (Weston-super-Mare):</B> I should like 
to return to the point raised about the figure of 8 per cent. 
Considering it today, it seems a reasonable figure to 
ensure that small businesses are adequately reimbursed 
for late payment. It will not be cheaper for larger 
companies to use their suppliers as a means of borrowing. 
Indeed, it will be much more expensive for them to do so, 
at a rate of 8 per cent. Generally, 8 per cent. seems a good 
rate at which to start, at least.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Gentleman has hit the nail on 
the head. He is absolutely right. We do not want small 
businesses to be used by larger business as a cheap source 
of credit, as they are at present. The clause is essential 
and I commend it to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I do not want to drag out the matter, but 
I am dissatisfied with the Minister's response. She thinks 
that a free users' guide is the panacea for communicating 
the rate to businesses. Unless she can give a guarantee 
that she will send that guide to all businesses in the 
country each time there is a change in the rate, I will not 
be convinced that there is a decent mechanism for such 
information reaching them. I am surprised that she has not 
paid attention to detail. The hon. Lady has not explained 
how she will apply subsection (2)(b) or how she will 
judge whether the level of interest over base rate is acting 
as a deterrent to late payment of debt. Her response is 
unsatisfactory, and we may need to revisit the matter on 
Report.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.



<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Purpose of Part II</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in
page 4, leave out lines 3 and 4.
<P>
The amendment deals with the problem of late payers 
being able to contract out after settlement. If it were not 
accepted, dominant and powerful customers could 
circumvent the purpose of the Bill. I hope that the 
Minister will carefully consider the amendment, as my 
hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey) and 
I believe that its acceptance would prevent serious pitfalls 
resulting from the Bill.
<P>
Part II concerns the extent to which parties can contract 
out. Clause 7(2) allows for unrestricted freedom for 
parties to settle debts after their creation. The amendment 
would ensure that post-contract settlements are subjected 
to the test of substantial remedy. The Bill does not allow 
for that. Our proposal would be particularly important to 
small businesses, because it is the dominant customer who 
will be most able to impose settlements. Many small firms 
do not have that trump card to play. It is in the interests 
of small businesses that I am arguing this case, and I 
should be surprised if the Minister did not at least consider 
the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman be kind 
enough to give the Committee his definition of a small 
business?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> We shall be dealing with that matter later 
in our proceedings, but I would define a small business 
as one with up to 100 employees. If the hon. Gentleman 
wishes me to go on and waste time in Committee, I could 
justify such a definition but I prefer to leave such matters 
until later.
<P>
The intention of clause 7(2) is to apply the same test of 
substantial remedy to settlements as is proposed in 
clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell us who judges 
the issues of substantial revenue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I shall carry on and that may explain the 
point.
<P>
The amendment is crucial because under the Bill, 
suppliers could surrender their right to statutory interest. 
That would be ironic since the Bill aims to ensure that 
powerful firms cannot exploit smaller companies. The 
Minister made clear in her eloquent, passionate speech 
how much she wants to ensure that there are no loopholes 
that will militate against small businesses. Allowing such 
settlements to continue would create a loophole. The 
amendment does not obstruct parties' freedom to conclude 
a settlement. It brings to the Minister's attention the 
possibility of a loophole: dominant parties could, by 
allowing a slight variation, take advantage of smaller 
businesses.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I respond to the hon. Member 
for Weston-super-Mare, who sportingly answered my 
question about his definition of a small business. At our 
previous sitting, the Minister said, perfectly fairly, that in 
the arbitrary definition of a small business, the 
Government had settled on a figure of a maximum 50 
people, even though I pointed out that 92 per cent. of 
business in a typical constituency such as mine is smaller 
than that. The Liberal Democrats now seem to be more in 
need of a magnifying glass than the Department of Trade 
and Industry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I did not pick the figure out of the air; it 
was the figure used in the 1996 Department of Trade and 
Industry report on small businesses, carried out under the 
previous Government. I would therefore have thought that 
the hon. Gentleman would accept that my basis is sound.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I do not think that the Committee wants 
us to extend the exchange unduly, but I pointed out to the 
Committee on Tuesday, when the hon. Gentleman
was present, that in a typical constituency such as mine, 
52.9 per cent. of businesses employ between one and four 
people, 19.4 per cent. between five and 10 people and 
13.8 per cent. between 11 and 24 people. That means that 
the number of businesses with fewer than 25 employees 
is around 84 per cent.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We seem to be pursuing debate 
that is relevant to the first group of amendments to clause 
17. I wish to make as much progress as possible. Could 
the hon. Gentleman specifically address the clause and 
reverse his remarks for the debate on clause 17?
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> You quite rightly correct me, Mr. Cook.
I had jumped the gun.
<P>
I shall focus on clause 7, which deals with contract 
terms for late payment and the ability to contract out. 
There is an important, specialised constituency of people 
who are interested in that point. Although the Minister 
and I happen to be lawyers, unlike her I went straight 
about 10 years ago. There is a lot of leg pulling about late 
payment of barristers by solicitors, but I may anticipate 
the Minister by saying that the relationship between a 
solicitor and a barrister is not contractual, so the Bill will 
not apply to that relationship.



<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
However, I must ask the Minister about solicitors who 
are franchised to the Legal Aid Board; that appears to be 
a contractual relationship. If it is such a relationship for 
the purposes of the Bill, can solicitors expect to benefit 
from the projections of the Bill against the Legal Aid 
Board in respect of prompt or late payment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> As I interpret amendment No. 13, it 
would erase clause 7(2) from the Bill. I hope that the 
Minister will confirm that the purpose of clause 7(2) is to 
allow parties to contracts to agree terms for dealing with 
interest after a debt has been created if, for example, the 
goods supplied are faulty. The aim of clause 7(2) is to 
provide parties with the option to settle a dispute over an 
outstanding debt and interest out of court. While that is 
ultimately reasonable, I harbour a concern that that may 
allow small suppliers to be pressurised out of their right 
to claim statutory interest after a debt has been created.
<P>
However the obvious effect of amendment No. 13, 
which has been tabled by the Liberal Democrats, is to 
remove the right of parties to agree their own terms for 
dealing with interest once a debt has been created. We 
therefore offer the amendment no support.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I echo my hon. Friend's concerns. In 
moving his amendment, the hon. Member for 
Weston-super-Mare sought to reassure us that it was a 
step in the right direction because the concept of 
substantial remedy would be introduced which, he 
appeared to think, would make things okay. I have not 
studied the hon. Gentleman's biographical details but, 
although he is a distinguished business man, I do not think 
that he is a lawyer. That surprises me, because he appears 
to be trying to drive us all into the arms of lawyers. Once 
concepts such as substantial remedy have been 
introduced, either matters will be cosily agreed by parties 
who by definition are already in dispute, or increasing 
numbers of people will be driven to resort to legal 
proceedings to settle what is a substantial remedy.
<P>
We keep returning to this question, and the more we 
consider the Bill, the more my anxiety level is raised. The 
effect of the amendment is to raise my anxiety level even 
further. It would be much better to leave the Bill as 
drafted and not to be seduced by the hon. Gentleman's 
suggestion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for 
making those points. I agree that my legal experience is 
virtually nil. I am perfectly prepared for my amendment 
to be considered and discussed by lawyers; I am sure that 
that will happen in Committee. The right hon. Gentleman 
is right to say that the amendment highlights concerns that 
dominant parties should not dominate agreements under 
the Bill; that is what I wanted to achieve. I will be 
interested to hear what the Minister says in reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am somewhat reassured, because I think 
that the hon. Gentleman is telling the Committee that this 
is a gesture amendment. That is a perfectly legitimate 
strategy. Some of us call such amendments probing 
amendments, but in this case the term gesture amendment 
may be more appropriate. I am slightly happier than I 
was, because although I do not want to pre-empt the hon. 
Gentleman, it sounds as though he may withdraw the 
amendment once he has ben reassured by the Minister. If 
so, that will almost have made my day.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. David Chidgey (Eastleigh):</B> Thank you, Mr. Cook, 
and good morning to you I have not so far had the 
opportunity to say that. I am rather concerned by the right 
hon. Gentleman saying that I may make his day, but I 
shall plough on.
<P>
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for 
Weston-super-Mare for raising this important subject. 
Some hon. Members have been involved in business and 
will know that some companies started as large businesses 
under the Conservative Government and ended up as 
small ones. A small company that is party to a contract 
with a dominant partner will know the pressure of trying 
to meet its cash flow requirements, knowing that the other 
company holds the key to its financial survival.
<P>
Such a company is in an incredibly difficult position 
and is often forced to accept terms that provide no profit, 
that probably provide no incentive to the staff and that 
just about pay the bills. If the company is being driven to 
the wall or is offered a settlement that is basically unfair, 
it often has no alternative but to accept it. That is why we 
ask the Minister to explain this provision.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister understands that such 
companies need the protection of the law, so that they are 
not coerced, through the dominant power of the 
customer's purse, to accept conditions that will do nothing 
but harm and may affect their survival. I hope that the 
Minister can give such businesses some comfort.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the concerns raised by the 
hon. Members for Weston-super-Mare and for Eastleigh. 
The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare suggested that 
amendment No. 13 is a probing amendment. I shall try to 
reassure both hon. Members, and I hope that the 
amendment will be withdrawn.



<P>
If, after the creation of a debt, the parties cannot agree 
terms for dealing with it, they will lose a valuable means 
of resolving the dispute without the need to go to court. 
We have had a number of constructive exchanges on that 
subject. I think that all hon. Members would agree that it 
is right to avoid court action if possible, although that 
remark may not find favour with the hon. Member for 
Solihull and his learned friends.
<P>
Clause 7(2) would allow parties to waive all or part of 
the interest due for example, the creditor may choose to 
do that as part of a package of measures to resolve a 
dispute. I would ask the hon. Member for 
Weston-super-Mare to reconsider the amendment in that 
light; otherwise, absurdly, the parties might have to go to 
court for the remission of interest that both parties had 
agreed should not be paid. I am sure that the hon. 
Gentleman would not want that.
<P>
I give the Member for Weston-super-Mare another 
assurance. Companies can rely on the existing law of 
contract. It already affords protection when a creditor is 
put under pressure to forgo a debt. One rule goes back to 
1602 I reassure you, Mr. Cook, that I shall not speak 
about it in detail which provides that even if the creditor 
has agreed to accept part payment in full discharge of the 
debt, he is not bound unless the debtor gives a new 
benefit one of the essential elements of a contract in 
return for the amendment to the contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> May I pursue that point? Many 
commercial debts are not spectacularly large, but they are 
always significant to the people who owe the money. 
Under that law of 1602, which the Minister drew to our 
attention, such a course of action could prove quite costly 
to the company pursuing the case. Will she reassure me 
on that point?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> One of the essential elements of the law 
of contract is that there should be consideration; otherwise 
contracts are not valid. That is part of a principle that goes 
back to 1602. Protection exists in the law of contract, and 
I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> There is one derogation from the 
necessity for consideration to make a contract enforceable 
and binding: if the contract were by deed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I bow to the hon. Gentleman's 
knowledge, but he will agree that that exception applies 
to a limited number of cases. I hope that that will reassure 
the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
Where no improper pressure was exerted and the 
creditor has led the debtor to believe that he will not insist 
on full payment and the debtor has acted on the promise 
to his detriment, the courts will not allow the creditor to 
enforce the contract. That is not new. The existing body 
of contract law will come to the aid of the creditor. I say 
that in response to the point made by the hon. Member 
for Eastleigh.
<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull referred to the civilised 
relationship between barristers and solicitors. The hon. 
Gentleman will know that we have produced a draft order, 
which is available to members of the Committee. That 
order will exclude legal aid payments made under existing 
franchises and multi-party action contracts. However, 
when legal aid is put on a wholly contractual footing, the 
legislation will apply. We expect that advice will be on a 
contractual footing by the end of 1999, and that formal 
contracting will take place in 2001. I hope that the hon. 
Gentleman finds that information useful.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Member for 
Weston-super-Mare. The points that he has made are 
important, and I hope that he will consider withdrawing 
the amendment.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Cotter: I thank the Minister for illuminating 
several matters. That has been extremely helpful. I hope 
that she at least agrees that raising this issue has been 
useful because we are all concerned about the dominant 
partner. Our concerns will now be on record, but I 
appreciate that you have considered 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am here to run the 
proceedings, not to consider matters. The hon. Gentleman 
must address his remarks through the Chair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Cook.
<P>
I thank the Minister and beg to ask leave to withdraw 
the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. 
The final page of the record of our proceedings for the 
afternoon of Tuesday 12 May the Committee's second 
sitting seeks to list those Members who attended the 
Committee. I yield to no one in my admiration of Hansard 
and the speed with which it publishes our words, often 
improving them. However, that attendance list is clearly 
that of another Committee; it bears no relationship to the 
composition of this Committee. No doubt a simple 
correction can be made, but I felt that you, and the rest of 
the Committee, should be aware of the matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman 
for bringing that matter to the Committee's attention, and 
I give an assurance that the record will be corrected.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> This is probably the right opportunity for 
the Committee to deal with an exchange involving the 
Minister, myself and some of my hon. Friends that took 
place on Second Reading. I shall take pleasure in quoting 
my own words something that I do not often have a 
chance to do.



<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> Reading
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend knows that I do not make 
a habit of reading, but for the sake of greater accuracy I 
shall quote briefly from my speech on Second Reading. 
I said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"My fear is that the Bill will have precisely the opposite effect. 
There is at least a possibility, perhaps even a probability, that as a 
result of the Bill large firms will seek to change the terms of trade 
that hitherto have been normal in British business net 30 days. 
They will argue that, if they are forced to pay interest on late 
payments, they will unilaterally change the terms of trade to net
60 days or net 90 days."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister seems to recall the point that I was making. 
Interestingly and significantly, the hon. Lady responded, 
as ever with great courtesy, and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We have said that terms in a contract that amount to a de facto 
contracting out of the provisions of the Bill will be void."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Later, in her winding-up speech, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"it would be ludicrous were the Government to ignore the 
possibility that businesses might abuse their negotiating strength and 
force excessive credit periods on suppliers we live in the real 
world."	 [Official Report, 5 May 1998; Vol. 311, c.615, 625.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am now unclear about the extent to which the Minister 
believes either that the existing words in the Bill provide 
a power or that she or another agency will have another 
power to interfere directly in the contractual arrangements 
freely arrived at between businesses in the commercial 
sector.
<P>
I cannot tie in the Minister's reply to the points that I 
made. I want to know whether to use her words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a de facto contracting out of the provisions of the Bill"	,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
thus making the contract void, which is what clause 8 
will do, would cover the circumstances that I am about to 
explain. What would happen if a purchaser renegotiated 
terms of trade with a supplier and said that instead of 30 
days, he wanted 45, 60 or 90 days? If the purchaser said 
that he was not seeking to exclude the penalty, but wanted 
to change the basic terms of trade, would that contract 
be void?
<P>
As my hon. Friends the Members for South-West 
Hertfordshire and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) asked on 
Second Reading, would the position be covered if a 
purchaser sought to change supplier and took the 
opportunity to negotiate afresh different terms, such as 60 
or 90 days? I imagine that it would not be. It would help 
the Committee if the Minister made crystal clear the 
extent to which she believes that the Bill would give any 
power of direct intervention in freely negotiated 
contractual terms, even if the new terms still contained 
the required element of interest penalty on late payment. 
That is the key issue.
<P>
It is important for firms to know whether they are free 
to renegotiate terms even if one business is deemed to be 
dominant something that seems to worry so many 
people. We forget that most commercial transactions take 
place between firms of broadly similar size. There are a 
few dominant businesses. As my hon. Friend the Member 
for Solihull said, the vast bulk of businesses in this 
country employ fewer than 20 people. They are all happily 
and furiously doing business with one another. Naturally, 
from time to time they deal with a dominant purchaser. 
Some companies, if they are unwise or forced into it, may 
do most of their business with a dominant purchaser the 
most invidious position in which a supplier can be. Before 
we proceed any further, it is crucial that the Minister 
clarify whether the Bill will provide new or additional 
power for someone to intervene in freely negotiated 
contractual terms such as I have described.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> Is not my right hon. Friend flagging up the 
fact that the Bill will work to the detriment of small 
business vis-a-vis big business? Was not the initial raison 
d'etre behind the Bill to try to even out the balance? My 
right hon. Friend has pointed out the danger that lies 
behind the Bill unless the Minister presents a means of 
Government intervention if the contract terms are 
deemed unjust.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> My hon. Friend has neatly pointed out the 
dilemma that the Minister faces. The Bill is designed 
largely to favour, protect or help small business. I am not 
sure that that would necessarily be its effect, but for the 
moment I shall concede the intention. My hon. Friend the 
Member for South-West Hertfordshire and I are worried 
that in some circumstances it could have the opposite 
effect. On Second Reading, the Minister implied that to 
cover such circumstances the Bill would include a power 
probably under clause 8 that would allow someone to 
intervene in freely negotiated commercial terms. Will she 
now clarify whether that is the case? At this point in our 
proceedings, it is important that the Committee 
understand that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman felt 
strongly about the mater on Second Reading. When a 
contract already provides a remedy for late payment, the 
Government believe that its provisions should stand. 
However, as I mentioned on Second Reading, we 
recognise that such contractual freedom could lead to 
wide-scale avoidance of the legislation. It is therefore 
necessary to provide the courts with the power to strike 
down any contractual term that ousts or varies the right to 
interest under the Bill and replaces it with an insubstantial 
remedy for late payment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Is the Minister saying that if a company 
agrees with a customer that payment will be made within 
100 days of an order for goods being placed, that supplier 
can approach the court with a request that the agreement 
be torn up, because 100 days is beyond reason and it 
wants the money in advance?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I was about to say that such matters will 
be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. No one may 
intervene unless one party to the contract believes the 
terms to be unjust. There will be no arbitrary intervention. 
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire gave 
examples of different cases. Each case will depend on its 
facts and will be judged on a case-by-case basis. As the 
right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst and I 
discussed on Tuesday, different sectors of industry often 
have different practices. I mentioned the Christmas card 
industry which, by custom and practice, has a very long 
payment period. It will be done case by case, and it will 
be triggered only by the parties themselves. Nobody will 
force people to go to court; there is no arbitrary 
intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I accept that I cannot ask the Minister to 
make judgments about individual cases, but surely she can 
give the Committee some indication. In a not untypical 
case, where the terms of trade have hitherto been net
30 days, one of the parties, typically the purchaser, may 
say that, under the Bill, he wanted to renegotiate the terms 
to net 60 days but still retain the panoply of interest 
clauses. Would the Minister think that unreasonable or 
not?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Roche: It may be, but such things can be decided 
only on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
There is nothing new about statutory intervention in the 
law of contract. For commercial as well as for consumer 
contracts, the Sale of Goods Act 1893 intervened as 
between supplier and purchaser to imply terms into the 
contract of sale, even though the parties were free to agree 
to disapply the rules. More recently, the Unfair Contract 
Terms Act 1977 was intended to prevent parties from 
sidestepping their contractual obligations.
<P>
When one party deals on the other's standard written 
terms, he cannot escape liability by reference to contract 
terms unless the terms satisfy the requirement of 
reasonableness. That protects weaker commercial parties 
as well as consumers. The need to prevent defacto 
contracting out of the legislation has been impressed upon 
us by a number of business representative organisations 
during the consultation. We recognise that in clause 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I made it clear on Second Reading that the 
courts issue should be addressed. I realise that it is not 
within the Minister's power, but I hope that one result of 
the review of court procedures will be that, when such 
disagreements arise they can be more easily be dealt with 
briefly and in a manner helpful to small companies which 
does not involve heavy costs.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, 
which he raised on Second Reading. I responded by 
saying that I would take note of it, which is why the Lord 
Chancellor has announced his review of those court 
procedures.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Perhaps the Minister now understands why 
I said on Tuesday that she was starting to feel that the 
Bill may have seemed like a good idea at the time.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst pointed out that the Bill has created a can of 
worms, which will keep the courts busy for days. Does 
not the Minister agree that we shall soon have to consider 
the European directive, which provides that the seller 
retains title to the goods until they are paid for, and that 
public procurement contracts will have to include a period 
of time, stated and agreed, which it is proposed should 
not exceed 60 days. Is not that the first step in moving 
away from individual contracts and towards set-period 
credit terms, which will not be variable?



<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I always hate to disagree with the hon. 
Gentleman, but I disagree with everything that he said. 
Retention of title is an entirely separate point, and the 
directive has not yet been discussed by the Council of 
Ministers, although a presentation has been made.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>

<P>
On the main point made by the hon. Member for 
South-West Hertfordshire, the provision arose from our 
consultation exercise with business, and in particular with 
organisations representing business. As the hon. 
Gentleman well knows, in the past arguments were made 
for and against the statutory right to interest. It was argued 
that people would just lengthen credit periods in an unfair 
way. That is why the principle behind clause 8 has been 
warmly welcomed by several organisations that had 
entertained such concerns. The drafting of the Bill has 
reassured several groups.
<P>
Clause 8 highlights the ability of parties to a contract 
to agree their own remedies for late payment, while 
reserving the power of the courts to strike down remedies 
that do not meet the terms of the Bill, and I commend it 
to the Committee.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Committee has made rapid progress 
in the past five minutes; that must be because of your 
chairmanship, Mr. Cook.
<P>
I want to probe the Government on phasing in and the 
definitions of small and large businesses. The Minister 
said that she expected such a debate, and I will be asking 
questions arising from what is a set of probing 
amendments. If you will allow me to range across the full 
subject, Mr. Cook, this debate may replace a clause stand 
part debate.
<P>
The matter that we want to raise was raised in the 
House of Lords. I regret to say that despite that fact, the 
Government's thinking still appears to be somewhat 
muddled. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity 
to set the record straight and to show some sign of 
movement in the interests of common sense and equity.



<P>
I appreciate that, during the consultation process, the 
Minister received much support for the phasing-in 
proposals. Indeed, in response to the Green Paper, 87 per 
cent. of business respondents and 82 per cent. of all 
respondents supported the concept of phasing; 85 per cent. 
of business respondents and 79 per cent. of all respondents 
supported the proposed timetable for phasing. The way 
in which the responses were invited in the Green Paper, 
however, was not entirely transparent. I should like to 
explore what the Minster thinks the results would have 
been had the questions been posed slightly differently.
<P>
As currently phased, from the Bill's enactment, small 
businesses can sue large businesses and the public sector. 
Within two years, small businesses will be able to sue all 
businesses and, after four years, all businesses and the 
public sector can have a free-for-all. Why is the Minister 
protecting the public sector so overtly. Surely it would 
have been more equitable to allow all businesses, 
irrespective of size, to claim the right that is extended by 
the Bill and charge interest against the public sector, the 
Government and all their agencies. If the Minister had 
asked in the Green Paper whether any business should be 
able to sue the public sector from day one, she would 
have received a resounding yes.
<P>
Lord Clinton-Davis gave a reasonable but inconclusive 
response to that question in the other place. He said that 
he would reconsider it. I hope that the Minister will say 
whether she has examined the phasing-in process and 
whether she agrees that, from day one, all businesses 
should have the right to claim interest under the Bill 
against the public sector. A problem arises in the 
definitions that the Minister is proposing for small and 
large businesses. Although the sector is usually called 
SMEs small and medium-sized enterprises there is no 
mention in the Minister's proposals of the medium-sized 
sector. I suppose that, in many ways, I am making a plea 
for that sector; it is so often deserted.
<P>
If a firm has 51 employees, it will not be able to sue 
the public sector and claim protection under the Bill. I 
acknowledge that, as she is doing now, the Minister made 
great efforts when she was a shadow Minster to examine 
the problems that face small and medium-sized 
businesses. No one would deny that she is a reasonable 
person and has taken great pains to understand the 
difficulties that businesses face. She will therefore agree 
with me that many firms that are just over the threshold 
of 50 employees are still small enough to lack reserves 
and be vulnerable to cash flow fluctuations. Some of them 
will be dependent on public sector contracts for much of 
their income.
<P>
The Minster has never denied the example that I cited 
of the health service and the large number of bills that are 
not paid on time about 600,000 in any one quarter. No 
party in government could condone that, especially as 
more than 2 million bills are paid late by a large part of 
the government sector. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
deduce that many firms at the margins of the line that the 
Minster has chosen to draw will be unable to take 
advantage of the Bill for years.
<P>
The Minister has a chance to put her money where her 
mouth is. She has always said that she has good intentions 
towards the small and medium-sized sector. If she were 
to do a U-turn, it would be welcomed. Perhaps her 
officials will not allow her to do so now. I understand that 
changing policy on the hoof is not her style. Indeed, she 
has pursued the Bill ruthlessly, even though she has 
admitted in an article that 60 per cent. of organisations 
representing small businesses do not want the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that a Minster 
of the Crown present as a member of the Committee must 
always be free, having listened to the arguments, to make 
the appropriate adjustments to policy perhaps either by 
accepting an amendment, or by giving an undertaking to 
table an amendment on Report? Can my hon. Friend 
confirm that that is her understanding of the Minister's 
role in Committee? The Minster is here so that, if she is 
persuaded by the arguments, she can act appropriately.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that 
intervention, during which the Minister was nodding her 
head.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Again she nods and says, "Of course."	 
We now have irrefutable evidence that, right here and 
now, the Minster could level the playing field for those 
businesses with more than 50 employees. Right now in 
Committee, she could decide to allow those businesses to 
have the protection of the Bill, so that they could pursue 
the public sector in the way that they could pursue large 
businesses. She could make her mark by changing the Bill 
in the next 10 minutes.



<P>
It would be wrong of me not to deal with another 
anomaly in the phasing. The Minister will acknowledge 
that small businesses are often owed money by other 
small businesses figures that I have been given show 
that about 70 per cent. of outstanding debts to small 
businesses are owed by other small businesses yet it will 
be two years before the statutory right to interest comes 
into play.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will argue she has already 
done so that the phasing is intended to allow small 
businesses to improve their credit management systems. 
However, if they are availing themselves of the 
legislation, they would not expect to be on the receiving 
end of it. I ask the Minister to prove that she is genuine in 
her intentions towards small and medium-sized business.
<P>
I ask the Minister to change the phasing-in proposals 
to increase the likelihood of the progress that she wishes 
to make being made. If she can deal with the fact that
70 per cent. of the debts to small businesses are owed by 
other small businesses from day one, she has a greater 
chance of making rapid progress towards removing a 
great burden on businesses outstanding debts.
<P>
The Minister's thinking on the matter is still a little 
muddled. It is obvious that what she proposes will be 
inequitable for the medium-sized business. If she changes 
her mind now, businesses small and large will appreciate 
it. She would have made a great move towards improving 
that aspect of business.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I want to speak to amendment No. 6. I shall 
not get drawn into speaking to amendments Nos. 14 and 
15, although I understand why the hon. Member for 
Weston-super-Mare tabled them.
<P>
For some obscure reason, the Bill moves away from 
the current definitions of small, medium-sized and large 
businesses. I am slightly puzzled about the need to 
introduce a definition with 50 employees. It is generally 
accepted that up to 10 employees defines a 
micro-business; that from 11 to 200 employees defines a 
medium-sized business. The idea of 50 is hard to 
understand. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and 
Amersham spoke about the delicacy of a break point of 
50, or 50 plus one.
<P>
I confess to some embarrassment at having to pray in 
aid the latest circular from the Forum of Private Business. 
It puts me on the spot, but needs must when the devil 
drives. The forum says that, of the people that it 
contacted, a majority 41 per cent. opposed the 
phasing-in period of two years, and that only 30 per cent. 
support it. The forum sees no reason why the Government 
should not be drawn into the loop much earlier. It then 
states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We can see little reason why the public sector should not be 
subject to interest on all contracts from initial implementation. This 
is particularly important, both because of the trickle down effect of 
better payment, but also because"	 <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
here is the question that the Minister must answer 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise the public sector will largely escape liability until the 
final phase, trading as it does principally with `large' suppliers. This 
would not seem to fit well with the Government's accepted objective 
of leading the change."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Getting Governments to detail their payment practice is 
a relatively new innovation. At its launch at the Queen 
Elizabeth II centre on 11 March 1996, the former Prime 
Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for 
Huntingdon (Mr. Major) said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I intend to instruct all Departments to pay promptly and, to 
ensure they do, we will publish each year a league table of all 
Government Departments' payment performance not their 
aspirations, but the record of what they actually achieve, measured 
on a consistent and rigorous basis, and combine this with tough 
targets to ratchet up the weaker performers."	<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
My right hon. Friend went on to say that he would like to 
do the same for local authorities.
<P>
I have already paid tribute to the fact that the Minister 
is carrying on that tradition. That first step, taken by the 
then Prime Minister, gives us some measure of control, 
some ability to check what is happening. The former 
Prime Minister talked about measurement on a consistent, 
rigorous basis. That is the torch that the Minister has had 
thrust into her hand: to ensure that Departments operate 
in a consistent and regular manner, and do not employ a 
series of arbitrary systems to their benefit.
<P>
This will probably be the last time that I refer to the 
draft of a draft directive, but article 10 proposes that the 
due date for payment of public debts shall not exceed
60 days the interest and so on will follow from that date. 
Why are not the Government leading from the front? Why 
do Departments have a series of different systems for 
payment of bills?
<P>
In conclusion, to reinforce my concern that the public 
sector is not setting a good example, I quote the immortal 
words of the then Minister for Small Business, Industry 
and Energy, during a debate on the Companies Act. I am 
struck by the wisdom exhibited by the hon. Member for 
South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page), who said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"On 29 November, the Audit Commission published payment 
performance figures for local authorities, which showed that the 
average figure for settling invoices on time was 77 per cent."	 
[Official Report, 13 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 479.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We might say "Well, that is bad, but not that bad."	 It 
gives me a quiet chill of horror to consider that that figure 
was based on voluntary returns from 57 local authorities. 
I hardly think that the guilty local authorities that were 
paying much later than that would have been enthusiastic 
about owning up to their record of late payment.



<P>
We have all been told by constituents that they are 
owed money by their local authority, and that its payment 
performance has been appalling.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I have referred to the latest available table 
of Government statistics for payment performance. 
Perhaps my hon. Friend would like to congratulate the 
Ministers responsible in the Department of Trade and 
Industry at the time, because between 1995-96 and 1996-
97 there was a significant improvement in the way in 
which 23 Departments made payments. Will my hon. 
Friend venture an opinion as to whether the protection 
offered to the public sector by the Bill will be of any 
benefit to small and medium-sized businesses in 
attempting to force the remainder of government to pay 
bills on time?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> It is a bit like the curate's egg: good in parts. 
Undoubtedly, during the final few years of the previous 
Government there was improvement in the time in which 
Departments paid their bills.
<P>
I return to the concern expressed by the former Prime 
Minister that payments should be made on a consistent, 
rigorous basis. We know that some Departments' payment 
methods can only be described as individual and geared 
to suit the Departments themselves, not necessarily those 
people to whom money is owed. My hon. Friend the 
Member for Chesham and Amersham made the point that, 
for some reason, government is not up front setting a good 
example. It is a case of "do as I say, not as I do."	 My 
hon. Friend has been slightly provocative in expecting a 
Minister to make policy on the hoof. In a similar position, 
I should be most reluctant to do so. I know that my right 
hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst 
would have no such fears; he would be in there like a 
ferret down a rabbit hole, causing an immediate 
disturbance in the warren. I advise the Minister to be 
circumspect and to exercise caution. The Committee will 
have achieved something if she were to say that she would 
be quite content to examine the matter and perhaps to 
present it on Report, with a fanfare of trumpets, showing 
how she is ensuring that Government set an example to 
the entire business sector by saying that they will pay their 
bills on time.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> As the Minister will readily acknowledge, 
I asked her at Question Time about the issue raised by 
amendment No. 5. She agreed that the Government's 
record was not good. Liberal Democrat Members 
therefore believe that this is important. The hon. Member 
for South-West Hertfordshire discussed the Government's 
setting an example, which is one of the best reasons for 
considering the amendment. Government must indeed set 
an example.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members and others have suggested 
that some local authorities, increasingly under pressure as 
a result of their settlements, adopt policies, formal or 
otherwise, to string out payment of bills to meet their 
commitments. I cannot produce evidence of such cases, 
but shall endeavour to obtain more information. All levels 
of government and all organisations operate in a 
commercial climate; such a climate is relatively new for 
councils and puts them under pressure.
<P>
Government involvement such as the amendment 
suggests is vital for a vigorous economy: cashflow is 
extremely important for business. The involvement of 
Government will make the Bill more effective, because it 
will encourage cash in the markets, a question that I shall 
address again at every opportunity. I hope that the 
Minister will consider the matter, not only to set an 
example but for the sake of cash flow within our 
economic community.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 deal with the number of 
employees in a company, to which hon. Members have 
already referred. The hon. Member for Chesham and 
Amersham asked what would happen when the number 
of employees is 51 or 52, or when it varies from 48 to 
51 over a relatively short period of a few months. The 
amendments try to address that problem. A threshold 
problem will always exist; arguably, the day is past for 
deciding exactly what the figure should be.



<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The justification for the figure of 100 was outlined in 
the DTI's excellent report on small business that was 
published in 1996. I hope that the Government will 
publish similar reports, as that one covered many issues 
and it dealt helpfully with the number of employees in 
different sizes of companies. The matter must be 
considered and I shall be proposing 100 as the figure.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Committee can understand the 
reasoning behind the hon. Gentleman's figure of 100. I 
have said already that the figure of 50 seems to have come 
out of the blue. There is no rhyme or reason behind it and 
it does not fit in with the usual definitions. The directive 
might contain the solution, which has nothing to do with 
the number of employees, but with the amounts involved. 
It is suggested that member states introduce into their 
legislation simplified procedures for small debts, which 
one would think would cover small businesses. The figure 
that has been suggested is about 20,000 euros, which is 
about 6,000 or 7,000. Using accelerated court 
procedures, a small business could get things moving 
more quickly and receive its money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> That is an extremely helpful contribution. 
We will always be trying to find the right level for a small 
business. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman's 
argument because the level of debt does not necessarily 
reflect the size of the company. I do not dismiss it, 
however, and perhaps the Minister will consider it. There 
must be one way of judging what a small business is, but 
we must ensure that it is small.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Minister replies, it 
might help the Committee if I announce that Hansard has 
said that the report of our afternoon sitting on Tuesday
12 May is to be reprinted in the correct form. I register 
yet again my gratitude to the hon. Member for Solihull 
for bringing the matter to the Committee's attention. He 
has done us a great service.
<P>
Standing Orders allow an extension of running time at 
the last sitting of a Committee to terminate proceedings. 
I must remind the Committee that that is done at the 
discretion of the Chair, and I am disposed to invoke such 
a measure only in the absence of undue repetition or 
procrastination.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Gillan: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I thank 
you for bringing the fact that you could extend our 
proceedings if you saw fit to our attention. Through you, 
I also extend our thanks to the Hansard reporters who 
have so rapidly put right an error that was spotted by the 
Opposition. We are most grateful. I am sure that
the misprint was inadvertent, but we are impressed that 
Hansard has returned to you so quickly with a result.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Me too.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I associate myself and my hon. Friends 
with the hon. Lady's remarks. As the hon. Member for 
Solihull said, Hansard does an excellent job; its staff are 
sometimes the unsung heroes and heroines of the 
parliamentary process.
<P>
Our debate has been constructive. The Government do 
not intend to extend or amend the initial commencement 
period. I shall explain why that is so, and I hope to 
reassure hon. Members.
<P>
As the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham said, 
we consulted on the phasing proposals and they received 
widespread support. Of those business respondents who 
expressed a view on the Green Paper, 87 per cent. 
supported phasing, and 85 per cent. supported the 
proposed timetable. Our main concern is that phasing 
should be seen to be certain and easily understood. The 
Bill is meant to supprot an improvement in the payment 
culture. I say again to the hon. Member for South-West 
Hertfordshire that it is not a panacea but an important 
part of a package of measures intended to improve the 
payment culture.
<P>
The hon. Lady asked why phasing was needed. I have 
said on several occasions that we want to give the 
legislation a chance to bed in, so that small businesses 
could undergo the necessary credit management 
procedures and respond to the legislation. Phasing 
resulted form the representations made to us during the 
consultation exercise on the Green Paper; a number of 
organisations made that point and we wanted to respond.



<P>
The hon. Lady made some play of late payments for 
small firms. She will not deny that late payment hurts 
small firms and that it places a disproportionate burden 
on small businesses. The hon. Lady will not deny either 
that late payment works its way through the supply chain. 
Phasing is intended to help deal with that problem.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister is right that late payment 
problems work their way down the supply chain. That is 
why I argued strongly for the public sector to be in the 
firing line it is a dominant player from day one. If a 
business has only 51 employees, it should not be totally 
disadvantaged; its financial situation could be just as 
critical as a firm with 49 employees. By her logic the 
Minister is really saying that the public sector should be 
there from day one as the target for all businesses. I hope 
therefore that she will reconsider her position. It worries 
me that she seems to have made up her mind.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand what the hon. Lady is saying. 
Our aim in the Bill is to provide certainty. The hon. Lady 
has several times said that businesses need to know where 
they stand. She has also raised important questions about 
information on the Bill being given to businesses. We put 
the phasing timetable firmly and fairly in the Green Paper, 
and business gave the timetable an overwhelming 
endorsement. I must tell the hon. Lady that the measure 
will not protect the public sector. As she knows, the 
overwhelming majority of businesses that will fall within 
the definitions that we have adopted can go against the 
public sector from day one. I agree with what the hon. 
Lady, the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare and the 
hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said: local 
government and central Government must lead by 
example. My only note of rebuke to her is that we will 
not take any lectures from the Conservative party on 
Government payment; their Government had 18 years to 
get their house in order but completely failed to do so.
<P>
I note that the hon. Member for South-West 
Hertfordshire prayed in aid the former Prime Minister. It 
is a great pity that he could not also pray in aid the former 
Deputy Prime Minister, who let down small businesses 
so badly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Minister lets no opportunity go by 
without bringing up the case of the former Deputy Prime 
Minister when he was starting and building up his 
business. Every time she makes such remarks, she shows 
an appalling ignorance of how a small business is built up 
into a medium or large one. I know of dozens of business 
men and women who, when they are in trouble when it 
is a matter not of "won't pay"	 but of "can't pay"	 go out 
of their way to pay all of their debts, but cannot meet the 
contract period initially agreed. That is exactly the 
position that the former Deputy Prime Minister described; 
he has reiterated it several times. It does not move the 
game on much for the Minister to keep putting her 
erroneous gloss on his remarks.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Of course the hon. Gentleman does a 
courteous job of seeking to protect the former Deputy 
Prime Minister, but those words came from the former 
Deputy Prime Minister's mouth. They caused great 
offence to the small business community and set a bad 
example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I would like to reinforce that point. At the 
time, I was a member of the public and a business man. I 
understand the remarks of the hon. Member for 
South-West Hertfordshire about small businesses that are 
struggling to pay their bills, but the former Deputy Prime 
Minister made it clear that he took great joy in what he 
had done. That was damaging. We are talking about 
Government setting an example. We must talk about 
examples set by Ministers, and the former Deputy Prime 
Minister set a bad one.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
his intervention. He was involved in the business 
community at the time, so he will appreciate how those 
remarks were taken.
<P>
The phasing arrangements will improve the payment 
culture. I hope that I can give the hon. Member for 
Chesham and Amersham some consolation and 
reassurance. I will carefully monitor the effect of the Bill, 
not least through the payment observatory of the credit 
management research group at Bradford university. If it 
appears to me that we need to make the right available 
earlier than we currently intend, we may do so, after 
consulting interested parties, including the Better Payment 
Practice Group.
<P>
As I have said, we will publish league tables of the 
payment performance of central Government and local 
government before the summer recess. If it appears that 
their payment performance is deteriorating, I will 
certainly consider introducing an order to enable all 
businesses to claim against them. The hon Lady is right; 
that idea was canvassed during debate in another place. 
Of course, I considered those exchanges carefully. 
However, I have received no representation from large 
business stating that that step is necessary.
<P>




<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I shall deal next with the speech of the hon. Member 
for Weston-super-Mare. Raising the threshold is not the 
right way forward. The Government think that any 
company with more than 50 employees should be able to 
employ someone to manage the payment of bills. We are, 
of course, pursuing other measures to ensure that small 
businesses for the purposes of the Bill, those that 
employ 50 or fewer staff have an opportunity to develop 
the skills necessary to manage their payments.
<P>
Raising the threshold would only serve to reduce the 
number of businesses against which another small 
business could make a claim. I am sure that the hon. 
Gentleman would not want the Bill to have that effect I 
hope that I have persuaded him of that. I also hope that I 
have persuaded the hon. Member for Chesham and 
Amersham to withdraw the amendment; if I have not, I 
urge the Committee to reject it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am deeply disappointed in the Minister. 
I thought that she was a brave individual. I thought that 
she would make a judgment and allow companies with
51 employees to use the protection provided by the Bill 
in their dealings with the public sector. I am afraid that 
she has chickened out at the last minute. She has tried to 
comfort me by saying that she will re-examine that matter. 
I think her words were, "if the payment periods of 
government deteriorate"	, so she is happy with the status 
quo with current payments records and she is willing 
overtly to protect the public sector against businesses with 
50 or more employees for four years. That is not 
satisfactory, businesses will be extremely unhappy about 
it, and it is inequitable.
<P>
The Minister has had her opportunity; we intend to 
return to such matters on Report not least because they 
have not been explored either to my satisfaction or that of 
my right hon. and hon. Friends. The Bill might result in 
longer payment periods. It will increase appearances in 
court. Adjustments will be necessary to the Bill as and 
when the European directive comes into play. I know that 
the Minister has tried hard, but she has fallen at the last 
hurdle. The Opposition will raise this issue on Report, so 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Mr. Cotter: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 
8, line 6, leave out "contracts"	 and insert "debts"	.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
amendment No. 17, in page 8, line 7, leave out "contracts"	 
and insert "debts"	.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The amendment would ensure that all 
debts that arise after the Bill's enactment are liable to 
statutory interest regardless of the date of the contract. 
I am especially concerned about pre-existing, evergreen 
contracts, which last for ever and a day. I should be 
interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I will try to persuade the hon. Gentleman 
to withdraw the amendment. It would apply the legislation 
to contracts that were agreed before the Act came into 
force as long as the debt arose after that. The Committee 
will agree that it is only right and proper that parties to 
the contract shall know the legal position before agreeing 
its terms.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Would not the Minister accept that late 
payment of debt is something that we would expect not 
to be part of the contract culture, whether or not it is 
legally enforceable? It would be expected that people 
would pay their bills on time even if the contract were 
entered into this year, next year or in a previous year. It 
is not unreasonable to expect parties to be within the law.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand what the hon. Gentleman 
says, but he is talking about legislation that could have a 
retrospective effect and I am sure that the Committee 
would not want that. There must be certainty. The 
Government do not want to move the goalposts, making 
parties subject to a possible duty that they had not 
foreseen when agreeing the contract. The amendments 
would create much commercial uncertainty for parties that 
are currently agreeing contracts, and we have already 
dealt with and rightly so the need to create certainty. I 
understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I hope 
that my brief comments have reassured him and that he 
will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister for her response. I 
hope that we can consider the matter again at a later stage. 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 7, in page 
8, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(4A) The subject matter of this Act shall be a reserved matter for 
the purposes of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998."	.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is by way of a probing amendment. We want to 
clarify the position of Scotland and the rest of the United 
Kingdom, a matter that was touched on in another place. 
Will the Minister explain what the position will be before 
and after the new Parliament and Executive are set up 
in Scotland? It is important that the business community 
throughout the United Kingdom understand fully whether 
the setting of the interest rates, in particular, and any other 
aspects of the Bill that are subject to ministerial 
discretion, will continue to be determined by the 
Government or whether they will be matters for the 
devolved Scottish Par1liament. The issue is important for 
businesses that have cross-border commercial 
relationships. Different regimes in various parts of the 
United Kingdom could lead to undesirable results. I hope 
that the Minister can set people's minds at rest.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I welcome this opportunity and I 
appreciate the spirit in which the amendment was moved 
by the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. 
The Government believe that it is prudent and fair that 
the late-payment legislation should cover Scotland, but 
that is not an argument for retaining those powers when 
the Scottish Parliament comes into being. There is no 
compelling reason why policy responsibility should be 
retained by Westminster for late-payment legislation, 
given that other aspects of contract law are to be 
devolved. Hon. Members should note that, as the White 
Paper, "Scotland's Parliament"	, explained, liaison 
machinery will be put in place to promote close 
co-ordination and mutual understanding between the 
Scottish Executive and the United Kingdom 
Administration, at both ministerial and official level.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is exactly what I feared. This may be 
an early example, perhaps the first, of the difficulties that 
will arise. In their eagerness to give as many powers as 
possible to the devolved Scottish apparatus, the 
Government may create differentials in commercial 
relationships between Scotland and the rest of the United 
Kingdom even to the extent, I assume, of a different rate 
of interest being applicable. Is the Minister happy with 
that? Is that how she wants trading and commercial 
relationships to develop? Does she not foresee difficulties 
arising from that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> No, I do not; other aspects of contract law 
will also be devolved. the right hon. Gentleman knows 
that Scotland has a robust and extremely good legal 
system. I am sure that the hon. Member for Solihull would 
endorse that.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I would endorse what the 
Minister has just said; I have the greatest possible 
admiration for the Scottish system of law. However, if I 
have clients in England doing business north of the border 
from here on, I shall have a clause in my clients' contracts 
that states that English law shall apply to the contract.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall leave that judgment to the hon. 
Gentleman.
<P>
The arrangements will help to ensure co-ordination in 
handling late payment. I thank the right hon. Gentleman 
for allowing me to deal with that issue; I hope that I have 
clarified it for him. He may not be happy with that 
clarification, as he has indicated, but as he said at the 
beginning that it was a probing amendment, I hope that 
he will withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for her 
explanation. It is now clear what the intention is; it does 
not make me any happier. Although at this stage I beg to 
ask leave to withdraw the amendment, that is merely to 
give us the freedom to consider the issue further and 
perhaps to return to it on Report.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 17 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question proposed, That the Chairman do now report 
the Bill, as amended, to the House.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> As we appear to be reaching the end of 
our deliberations, I thank you, Mr. Cook, for your 
chairmanship, and your co-Chairmen for theirs. I also 
thank Hansard, especially for its swift remedying of 
mistakes, and all officials of the House who have served 
the Committee well, especially the Clerks, who have kept 
a quiet eye on our proceedings. Earlier, I thanked the 
officials at the Department of Trade and Industry for their 
help, and I also thank my two research assistants, 
Alexandra de Scitiveaux and Guy L'Etang, who helped 
me to find my way around the Bill's finer details. Finally, 
I thank the Minister for her courtesy; she has always been 
respectful, if slightly repetitious when she feels that she 
has a point to strike against us. However, we are both 
guilty of that, so I forgive her. We intend to return to the 
Bill on the Floor of the House; I look forward to further 
exchanges with the Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I shall be brief, because I do not want to 
earn your displeasure, Mr. Cook, especially as I am going 
to thank you for your courtesy and chairmanship. I also 
thank your predecessors, Mrs. Roe and Miss 
Widdecombe, for their great efforts. I thank the officials 
and Officers of the House and Hansard. I also thank all 
hon. Members. Our proceedings have been robust but 
courteous; the House will feel that we have done a good 
job, and I am grateful for the Committee's help and 
support.
<P>
