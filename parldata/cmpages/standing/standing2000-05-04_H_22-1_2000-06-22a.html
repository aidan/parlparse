On resuming-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was a timely reminder of how much we all take things for granted-even geriatric Chairmen. I am obliged to the Economic Secretary for drawing to our attention the absence of Hansard staff. Under the circumstances, we shall begin from square one.

<H4><center>Clause 106</center></H4>

<H4><center>General insurance reserves</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 414, in page 76, line 39, after ``was'', insert ``insufficient or''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 415, page 76, line 40, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`For the purpose of making good to the Exchequer the loss occasioned by the excess, an' and insert `An'.<P>

No. 416, in page 76, line 42, after second ``the'', insert ``insufficiency or the''.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an expense or, as the case may be,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 419, in page 77, line 14, after ``excessive'', insert ``or insufficient''.

<P>
No. 420, in page 77, line 15, after ``excess'', insert ``or insufficiency''.

<P>
No. 424, in page 78, line 45, after ``receipt'', insert ``or as an expense''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 106 covers tricky and technical areas. To understand the amendments, I wish to say a little up front about the provisions under the clause and explain why the insurance industry has, as the Minister will be aware, expressed considerable opposition to them. When we debated schedule 30, we dealt with matters the net effect of which will be to increase the tax paid by British insurance companies, especially non-life insurers, when changing the rules for the calculation of relief available under double taxation treaties.

<P>
Clause 106 will add further substantial United Kingdom tax bills to British insurers, first, by discounting insurers' technical reserves, which will lessen their reduction for recovery for tax purposes and, secondly, by recalculating insurers' taxable profits each year, with hindsight over each of the following 10 years or more. That will similarly increase taxation. It will make earnings volatile and impossible to know from the point of view of those dealing with those insurance bodies.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): The hon. Gentleman speaks of the uncertainty introduced under the clause into the taxation regime for insurance companies. Will that be of any advantage to them or will it have a purely negative effect on insurance companies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments; I shall respond to them in more detail later. Such provisions will not only have a negative effect on the industry but present major problems for those who use a particular company who want to know whether it is solvent, because the figures will change in future. The provisions will present problems for pension funds that are making investments, which want to know the real earnings position of the business, which may be chucked up in the air and recalculated in future. From all angles, including that of creditors, it is extremely unsatisfactory to have tax law that rewrites major accounting profit and loss figures up to 10 years later.

<P>
During the three years that I have been privileged to be a Member of Parliament, I have learnt to spot a stealth tax when I see one. What lies behind schedule 30 and clause 10 is an increase in the tax yield from the insurance industry. The Government have forecast that it will be about £250 million per annum, but the total impact on the insurance industry could be several times that figure because, as alluded to, the measures will have major effects on the income, balance sheet and cost of capital of insurers. The proposals will increase by 10 per cent. the capital requirements of an insurer with an average length of tail on his insurance of four years. In essence, the knock-on additional costs are the costs of additional capital.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Does my hon. Friend agree that Ministers should tell us that they are not inventing a stealth tax, but closing a dreadful loophole? I wonder which set of actions the Government believe that insurance companies have been taking that are illegitimate as opposed to perfectly normal actions in the course of ordinary business.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, although I suspect that the Government's excuse for the stealth tax will not be one of tax avoidance, but an incorrect argument that the changes would bring insurance companies in line with the tax provisions of insurance companies elsewhere in the world, as well as in line with the tax provisions for other businesses in this country. That has been the main justification for the proposals. As I shall demonstrate, neither the industry nor I think that those two arguments stand up.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stephen Dorrell </B>(Charnwood): I am listening carefully to my hon. Friend's line of argument. His response to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) was interesting. If declaring profits based on the Government's proposed provisioning policy introduced unacceptable variations of earnings and unacceptably raised the cost of capital to an insurance company, would the company's rational response not be to publish profits to the markets on a different provisioning basis from the one proposed in tax law? We might move into a position in which the tax computation assessed a higher level of profit to tax than the level of profit that the insurance company declared to the market.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for his comments. That is the case and, if one thinks of a pension fund investing, it is also the case that someone may buy a pup, because the figures are false. I shall come to other related problems anon.

<P>
The Government's justification does not stand up. They argue that their proposed measures are fair because they will tax insurers broadly in line with other United Kingdom businesses, and because they are in line with other insurance markets. The correct basis for calculating a trader's profits has always been the commercial accounts of the business, which reflect, honestly and with the best endeavours, the profit and loss of the year. Clause 106 will depart from that and substitute a notional charge that might bear no relationship to the actual profits of the year. It would put UK insurers at a disadvantage compared to other UK businesses by taxing them on a figure that might be larger than their actual commercial profits. I am not aware of that approach being followed in any other industry.

<P>
The proposals do not simply have the effect of importing to the UK insurance industry allegedly the same standards as FRS 12-financial reporting standard 12-on the accounting of insurance technical reserves. FRS 12 requires a provision to be set up for what a company might rationally pay to settle or transfer its obligations. Best estimates are discounted only if they are material, and must account for differing risks and uncertainties. The Government seem to have overlooked the key territory of the massive difference between the portfolio of risk that different insurers and, within Lloyd's, different Lloyd's members undertake.

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Will my hon. Friend confirm that FRS 12 explicitly does not apply to insurance companies?

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend. That is my understanding. The Government's measures have been justified on the basis that FRS 12 should apply; I was endeavouring to explain that the Government have not made it apply, as one of the principles of FRS 12 is that best-endeavours provisions for risk should be discounted only if they are material, and that they must properly take different risks into account.

<P>
The Government propose to strip out all uncertainty and risk premium with hindsight, and to tax insurers as though they had perfect knowledge of risk at the time at which they wrote the business. That must surely be nonsense.

<P>
The Government have alluded to European Union legislation. For profit calculations in relation to insurance companies, I should point out that although European Union legislation permits discounting of reserves, it does so only in certain limited circumstances. Germany is the only country that has done that, but on a different basis from the approach that the Government are proposing.

<P>
<H5>1.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that, in the context, there is an enormous difference between life business and general insurance business? The latter is the subject of the clause and the amendments. In the life business there is an actuarial valuation, which, although it may not provide certainty, at least provides a high degree of knowledge and hence a basis for discounting. In general insurance there are companies that, by the nature of the beast cannot accurately estimate long-term liabilities.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my hon. Friend. That is the case, although I cannot resist saying that life companies have got it all wrong because we all live 10 years longer than we did 15 years ago. Lloyd's business is to insure all sorts of strange and sophisticated risks that are not easily insured elsewhere in the world. The measures would drive that business to other locations that did not have such inappropriate tax requirements.

<P>
I was surprised that the Government had not taken heed of the fundamental concerns of the actuarial profession and those expressed by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries. Those people have made it publicly clear that the Government's proposals are not acceptable from actuarial principles and perspectives. The only discounting calculation by which general insurance reserves are discounted and of which standard actuarial approaches would approve is the incorporation of margin for risk deviation, reflecting any particular situation and distinct from any element of profit.

<P>
Evidence was given from insurance computations, in relation to transfer of business and from the actuarial and accounting professions in a recent case brought before the general commissioners of income tax in connection with a Lloyd's syndicate. The commission found that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it was neither intended, nor would it be reasonable, for the tax treatment of the reinsurance to close premium to be so significantly out of line with commercial reality  if the premium was discounted for tax purposes<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 as is proposed by the Government in the clause. In short, the Government seem to have overlooked the real commercial value and importance of insurance liabilities and risk.

<P>
In addition, the proposed system of recalculating profits with hindsight for 10 years-

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> In his remarks, my hon. Friend reminded the Committee about the case of the commissioners and Lloyd's, which the Revenue lost. Will he confirm that that was not the first time that the Revenue had ventured into that area and lost a court case? He may well recall a case against Commercial Union that had the same effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend for his comment. I believe that that is the case but, as I said earlier, I have little substantial career knowledge of the insurance industry. I have had to do a lot of boning up on the subject to understand the proposals. However, I believe that the case that I mentioned was not the only one of its kind. The issue is a clear one of an actuarial principle that has been around for some time.

<P>
The proposed system of recalculating profits with hindsight for 10 years or more will lead to enduring uncertainty over the taxable profits relating to each year. It will render rational decisions by institutional investors impossible to arrive at, and will place UK insurers at a severe competitive disadvantage in relation to insurers overseas in virtually all other jurisdictions.

<P>
As we see it, the Government have also failed to consider the accounting and solvency implications of the measures. Insurers will have to recognise in their balance sheets future tax that may be payable. That is almost impossible to calculate meaningfully, and will clearly affect and could damage their solvency positions.

<P>
After I cold-towelled this territory, it seemed that there was much in common between the proposals and the mixer proposals, as they would place UK insurers at a major disadvantage. Indeed, they would make the UK an unattractive location in which to base global insurance businesses. I felt that the Budget day spin about bringing the UK regime more in line with other major markets was, with respect, either ill informed or disingenuous.

<P>
The measures have been proposed without any formal review of the tax systems in other locations, and the Government have failed to give any enduring evidence that UK insurers are taxed less heavily than insurers in other jurisdictions under the present regime.

<P>
The competitive threats include the fact that the proposal will give an advantage to non-UK based insurance companies selling straightforward general insurance, such as motor insurance, in the domestic UK market. I have already alluded to the fact that international business will be wise to go anywhere other than the UK and London, because premium costs will be lower, reflecting lower tax costs for the insurers. The provision will reduce the retention of risk and cause larger volumes of reinsurance business to be written elsewhere. No other tax regime in the European Union or elsewhere in the developed world disadvantages insurers by discounting or the hindsight regime. Germany has adopted a form of discounting for tax purposes, but it is not analogous to the provisions. The United States and Canada operate discounting, but also have major protection of their home markets.

<P>
Our objections are therefore mainly about principle. The Government have not considered the global competitive environment. The proposal seems to be largely to raise tax without regard to the damage to UK industry.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 414 to 420 and amendment No. 424 are designed within the framework of the proposals to provide even-handed treatment in the case of over-reserving, as opposed to under-reserving.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman has painted a broad canvas. I have been happy for him to do so, but the Committee must understand that I shall require a much sharper and tighter focus on subsequent amendments unless the Committee wants to forfeit the clause stand part debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I take note of what you say, Mr. Cook, and well recognise the fact that our focus will need to tighten as we proceed through the amendments. To understand any of the amendments, one needs to talk about the whole effect of the clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) brought out some of the major points, but I wish to add one or two.

<P>
Before going further, I should say that although I am not aware of Rothschild having any insurance clients, it or one of its competitors may have some, and I should therefore declare an interest. There is already-quite properly-a mechanism in place for recapturing, ex post, underpaid tax. When, some years after the provision has been made, the risk in question is seen to have materialised at a lower level than the provision allowed for, tax is paid on the over-provisioning. The Revenue therefore gets the forgone tax at a later date, if and when it transpires that the tax should have been paid at a higher rate. Nobody objects, or has ever objected, to that. We are not talking of the Revenue trying to get the tax that it transpires, ex post, was due but of the Revenue trying to ensure that it receives, ex post, today's value of the effect of the over-provision.

<P>
We must look at the question of motive. What does the Revenue seek to achieve? If it is merely, as my hon. Friend unkindly speculates, trying to introduce the ultimate stealth tax-a tax so complex that almost nobody in the United Kingdom would even be willing to listen to an explanation of it, much less understand it-then it scores highly on the ingenuity stakes. It is perfectly respectable for Governments to try to raise additional revenue. We need only engage in a campaign to inform the British public that another stealth tax is being added to the long list of existing ones.

<P>
I stand to be corrected when the Economic Secretary replies-she is in a good condition to reply, being a stronger person than I would have been in her place at Treasury questions-but I harbour the doubt that it is just a stealth tax. We will know when she replies whether that is the case. I doubt that it has been driven by Ministers or by the necessity to improve the fiscal balance. I certainly do not believe, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs does not, that it is a purely mistaken endeavour to bring us into line with other jurisdictions-it does not do so. The Inland Revenue is much too knowledgeable wrongly to suppose that it brings us into line. Symmetry, which the amendment seeks to introduce, helps but even with that, we will not be in anything like the same position as that of other countries.

<P>
We will not be in the same position because the risk of over-provisioning will be greater. I point out-you will be glad to know, Mr. Cook, that this is narrowly on the amendment-that ex post symmetry does not induce ex ante symmetrical risk. If the insurer in question knows that if he over-provides he will have to pay tax with interest, he will be more disinclined to over-provide than to under-provide. By under-providing he is simply effectively increasing his gearing. In other words, he knows that he will be able to collect from the Treasury the back tax with interest, exactly as if he had had money back from the bank. It would therefore be exactly as though he were borrowing the money from a bank now. However, if he over-provides, he faces the uncertainty of having to pay later what may be a grossly inflated sum, at a time when it may be, in cash-flow terms for his business, highly inconvenient to do so. Insurance companies are not always in a convenient position from a cash-flow point of view, as we know all too well from the saga of Lloyd's. If arrangements are put in place that give insurance companies from the perspective of today an asymmetric risk profile that is not the same as that which is visited on other insurers in other places, they will do exactly as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs describes, and write their international business overseas.

<P>
<H5>1.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I should like to add to what my hon. Friend rightly said. We should not imagine that such activity involves the huge expense of setting up offices elsewhere, for example. As I understand it, writing an insurance policy in one place rather than another is today a metaphysical occurrence, not a physical one. It is extremely easy-

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo) That is a very loose use of the word ``metaphysical''.</B><P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree that, as the Paymaster General says from a sedentary position, that is a very loose use of the term ``metaphysical''. It is an airy-fairy activity, in the sense that people in London can write business overseas just as well as people can anywhere else. It can all be done electronically. Ultimately, the Inland Revenue will engage in a self-defeating activity of negative tax competition. It will end up inducing insurance companies not to pay UK tax on their insurance, because they will move their business to another realm.

<P>
For those reasons, I do not believe that the Inland Revenue has proposed the change in order to bring us into line with other countries. I do not believe that that line of argument stands up as an explanation of the motives. We are therefore still searching for a motive. If we discount for the moment the stealth-tax motive and the motive of bringing us into line with other countries, what else could the motive be? I believe, and the amendment makes the point even more clearly, that we are facing another attempt in the immense series that we have debated throughout the past few weeks of ingenious-alas, wildly over-ingenious-efforts to close loopholes.

<P>
I believe that somewhere in the Revenue-I hope that we shall hear the answer as the debate proceeds-someone knows or thinks that he knows that some insurance companies, the details of which we do not want, have been consciously over-providing in order not to satisfy the demands of prudence and their auditors but to avoid paying tax today in order to gain the present value advantage of a low tax bill today, knowing that five, 10, 15 or 20 years hence they will have a higher tax bill but will not worry about it-carpe diem.

<P>
Alas, no one is saying-and, as far as I am aware, no one from the Treasury or the Inland Revenue has said until this debate-which cases they have in mind. I understand the Inland Revenue's general reluctance to discuss the wheezes that people employ. We do not want the Inland Revenue to alert the industry more widely to tax-planning activities in which it is not already engaged. However, in this case that cannot be a defence against telling us what has been going on, because the clause, even as amended, makes perfectly clear the abuse that the Inland Revenue is trying to stop. It therefore falls to the Inland Revenue, if that is its motive, to tell us what has been happening-

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am listening with care to my hon. Friend, who is advancing a powerful argument. I have reached the same conclusion as he is about why the clause is being introduced. Would he care to reflect on the fact that the conclusion that we have both reached reflects an extraordinarily one-sided view of the world on the part of the tax authorities? It is assumed that people declaring profits are motivated only by the resulting tax bill that will be based on those profits. It seems to me that the tax authorities must always remember that although that is certainly one factor in the mind of management deciding on their provisioning policy, another factor is the fact that there is a group of shareholders to whom they must justify themselves. If the management over-provide, they will end up declaring profits to the shareholders that will lead them to sell their shares. Will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that the system is a great deal more self-regulating than the tax inspector will often allow?

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The trouble with being a member of a Finance Bill Standing Committee with people like right hon. Friend is that they keep saying the right things better than one can say them oneself and ahead of the moment that one has. He is absolutely right. There is a self-regulating system and it operates partly through the profit motive in the sense of declaring as high a profit, not as low a profit as possible each year. That is another reason why we are owed an explanation of the putative villains who have been consciously over-providing for the advantage of obtaining a present value gain on their tax bills.

<P>
Goodness me, I see that my hon. Friend wants to make a further intervention. In case he is about to provide me with the next bit of my argument, let me just add that there is another self-regulating mechanism. It is a statutory mechanism that has existed for a trivial 600 years, so we would not expect Ministers to have caught up with it yet. It has a considerable effect and is called auditors. They ensure that there is proper provisioning, not wildly excessive provisioning or prudentially insufficient provisioning. As my hon. Friend has said repeatedly, we are dealing with necessarily subjective and highly complicated judgments about how a portfolio of general insurance risk will mature. What kinds of risk will be realised and to what extent?

<P>
Great experts in the auditing firms are well placed to make such judgments. I have no doubt that they will interrogate the actuaries and managers of general insurance companies about how their provisioning has been arrived at. I have not been involved in such activity, but from personal experience of other audits of firms with complicated portfolios, such as banks, I am vividly aware of the process. It is an enormous protection against the abuse that the Inland Revenue is imagining. We are owed an explanation of who is doing what and on what scale that could justify trying to close a loophole that will drive people wildly offshore.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> If anything, the record of the UK insurance industry is surely that there have been problems of under-provisioning for reserves. In essence, that was the problem with the Lloyd's debacle. I was told that, when the responsibility for insurance companies moved from the Department of Trade and Industry to the Financial Services Authority, it was found, after going back four or five years, that many potential cases of capital inadequacy had not been dealt with, but were the result of under-provisioning. There is little evidence of a problem of over-provisioning for the tax advantages of which someone might have conceived.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend. The real risk to our economy does not arise from some element of tax forgone-it would be interesting to know how much the Treasury imagines that it is-but from the great danger to the whole of our commercial system of systematic under-provisioning in the insurance industry. For the reasons that I gave earlier, from the ex ante view the proposal even with the amendment-which would improve the situation-will be asymmetric. There will be a strong inclination on the part of companies to get away with as little provisioning as they can, partly from the profit motive point of view and partly from the tax point of view, which
used to counter the other slightly. There will be institutionalised an increasing battle between them and their auditors, except for the large number of companies that will find ways to write the business offshore, thereby depriving the Treasury of the revenue in the first place and solving the problem to the disadvantage in another way of the UK economy.

<P>
This is a classic case of the Revenue spotting what, subject to our hearing otherwise from the Economic Secretary, is probably a tiny problem. The Government want to close a loophole in a way that is meant to be extremely ingenious. Ministers pretend to themselves that they will thereby raise some extra tax-tick! Another stealth tax, which they think is jolly good-and discover en passant that they have, alas, clobbered the entirety of another great UK industry. It is not enough to have moved in that direction through double tax relief, the climate change levy and this and that; they must add another tax. When they hear the response from the industry, they put on some sticking plaster, the symmetry of which is helpful. However, it does not go to the root of the problem, which is that, even with ostensible symmetry, the ex ante position is asymmetrical and the provision will still have many of the same effects as it would have had without the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Because the provisions do not conform to generally accepted accounting practices, will not the auditors to whom the hon. Gentleman referred have real problems? They will have to consider the accounts in terms of accounting principles and then, wearing another hat, consider them using a different set of rules for taxation purposes.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. His point reflects something that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, which was that in all probability a discrepancy will emerge between profit-and-loss accounting and tax accounting if the clause, even as amended, comes into force. That is not unknown in some fields, but it is always highly inconvenient. It makes management extraordinarily difficult, especially on a subject such as insurance for which the accountancy is already extraordinarily complex. It will distract management time and much else from the real business into the accountancy.

<P>
That fact also reflects on another of my hon. Friend's points, one that deserves to be made even further. The Inland Revenue has been dealing with the subject for a long time. One way or another in the courts, it has kept trying to do something about it, and the courts have kept batting the issue back and saying that the Revenue is all wrong and is not being fair or reasonable. Now Ministers are trying to add the provision to statute so that the poor old judges can no longer exercise good sense about the relationship between provisioning and profit and loss. Judges will not be able to consider what is reasonable in all circumstances and will have to consider the statute. That is a bad way to make tax law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made an important wider point. Some foreign jurisdictions have suffered precisely because their tax law has led their accountancy law, whereas we have tended to prefer it the other way round. We have tended to prefer a world where accountants determine what is a profit, and the tax man takes his lead from them. Under the provisions, the tax man will conclude that the accounting profession and the general commissioner are wrong.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> And actuaries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Having failed to persuade them, he will come before Members of the House of Commons, regarding them as a rather easier audience than the accounting profession or the general commissioner. Members of the Committee might like to reflect on that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> My right hon. Friend is right, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, he forgot to put actuaries on the list. We know, because the Economic Secretary told us on the Floor of the House, that the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Association of Corporate Treasurers, the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors are so stupid that they could not even read the consultation exercise on double taxation relief correctly. Therefore, it is not to be expected that the Government would pay any attention to minor figures such as commissioners, auditors and actuaries, as they are all too stupid to understand the point. The Government have to put the provision in statute in a way that ensures that the Treasury will clobber the industry and not collect as much tax as it used to.

<P>
Of course, I parody for effect, but this is another example of the Government's being too clever by half. The amendment is a welcome step backwards, but it does not go nearly far enough. The right place to go is back to square one, and I hope that the Economic Secretary will lead the Committee there at the end of the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Unlike the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, I have not hot-towelled on the clause. However, it raises some important general principles that all hon. Members should consider. They have been mentioned in previous speeches, possibly with more eloquence than I can employ, but they bear repetition.

<P>
First, the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) made the point that laws exist to prevent excessive provisioning-they would take effect to disallow that. The new measures complicate things far more and may be unnecessary. Will they have any effect on the over-provisioning that the Inland Revenue seems to be so worried about?

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> In this particular instance, the close analogy with the banking industry should be stressed. During economic downturns, banks may over-provide substantially; when they write back provisions, taxable profits are affected. That is entirely analogous, yet I do not hear the Government suggesting that banks are acting wrongly. Why, then, do they suggest that insurance companies are doing so?

<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That leads me to my second point of principle. I touched on the issue of uncertainty with the hon. Member for West Dorset. Uncertainty is inherent in the nature of the insurance industry, which deals with huge sets of risks, and it seems unnecessary to add more uncertainty through the tax system. If anything, the tax system should be assisting such an industry by giving it a stable, clear and certain framework within which to deal. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs was right to say that the measure might have a damaging effect on the competitive position of the United Kingdom industry vis-a-vis countries in the European Union and elsewhere.

<P>
My final point of principle concerns the fact that many of the details of the new legislation are not before us-they will come into force in regulations. As the tax change is a major one, conflicting with convention in the accountancy profession and going against generally accepted accounting practices, it seems odd that the Treasury wants to make it through secondary legislation. Perhaps, however, it is not odd but a deliberate attempt to avoid drawing attention to the measures. The Treasury may have deliberately left some of the detail out of the Bill so that there would not be an uproar similar to that which greeted double taxation relief. Leaving the details to secondary legislation is a bad way to proceed, because it adds further uncertainty before the fine print of the regulations is debated in a statutory instrument Committee.

<P>
We-or perhaps I should say I, for the moment-are unhappy with the clause. The amendments, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, may slightly improve it, but the Government should take it away and think again.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I share the concerns expressed about the clause by my hon. Friends the Members for Arundel and South Downs and for West Dorset. For one thing, the matter is technical; we, as laymen, do not have the expertise to judge how much insurance companies should reserve as provisions, or how to set the rules under which they make them. It is better for such things to be decided by the experts in the field, such as the accountants and auditors, and to be inspected by Inland Revenue officials. If there is disagreement, the matter can be taken to the commissioners and expert legal advice can be drawn on. In the end, if there is a serious matter of principle to be contested, it can be taken to the courts. Through the judicial and historic process through which tax law has been determined, all the expertise is to hand.

<P>
However, let us consider today's situation. The Government, with their massed ranks of Treasury and Inland Revenue officials, are putting forward their highly informed point of view as the way for the future. Opposition Members, with limited resources at our command, are expected to take it or leave it.

<P>
As I remarked in our debate on Tuesday, we would have more confidence in the Government and their approach if, first, we felt that they understood what they were trying to do with the provisions and, secondly, if they explained them in a clear and upfront way. On Tuesday, I asked the Paymaster General whether the Inland Revenue was worried that insurance companies refer matters such as those that we are considering today to the tax commissioners and, through the courts, dispute the Inland Revenue's approach. The hon. Lady replied:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Is he saying that some people may challenge interpretations of legislation on any subject through the commissioners? If so, he is right, as that happens quite a lot, but that is not an issue with regard to this matter.-[Official Report, Standing Committee H, 20 June 2000; c. 783.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I learned subsequently both in respect of what we were discussing on Tuesday and in respect of what we are discussing this afternoon that insurance companies not only take issue with the Government's interpretation of the rules, but have begun to contest them through the normal process. Cases will come before general commissioners and, in one instance, a case is to be heard in court. The lack of intelligence and information demonstrated by the Paymaster General inspires no confidence in her or other Ministers' understanding of the issue or in their willingness or ability to put the case honestly and clearly.

<P>
The Economic Secretary protected one member of her Front-Bench team this morning in the Chamber. Will she, this afternoon, protect another member of her team, who has every opportunity to explain her statements to the Committee? The question that I asked on Tuesday, which was not answered then but must be answered now, is why is clause 106 considered to be appropriate? I hope that the Economic Secretary will listen to what I am saying and not conduct a private conversation with the Paymaster General.

<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): Oh, get on with it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I heard language from a sedentary position complaining about the style of the very effective speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn). I wonder whether those words caught your ears, Mr. Cook, and whether you considered that they were in order.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I did not hear the remarks to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, so I suggest that we continue the debate.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The Government Whip said, ``Get on with it.'' I do not know whether those remarks were directed at me as the speaker or at the Economic Secretary and the Paymaster General, who are still continuing a private conversation in the middle of this important debate on clause 106.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order, I deplore all comment from a sedentary postion, which is why I stand before I say anything. If anyone wants to contribute to our debate, I suggest that the person seeks to catch my eye and he or she will be given every opportunity to do so. I should prefer it if contributions did not refer to sedentary comments; it is a diversion from our line-by-line scrutiny of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I am very grateful for your guidance, Mr. Cook. I was merely informing you about what had gone on in the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am most grateful.

<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will continue to do so, if it is at all helpful to you, Mr. Cook.

<P>
The Economic Secretary must say why it is preferable for us, with the imbalance of expertise in the Committee, to decide the matter today and cast it in stone than for a dispute over reserves for the insurance industry to be determined, if necessary, by general commissioners, judges, the Court of Appeal and, ultimately, the Lords of Appeal. Why is that parliamentary process preferable to the judicial process, with all the extra expertise that would be at its command?

<P>
I agree with my right hon. and hon. Friends that behind the clause lies further evidence that the Government, far from being a friend of the new economy, is its enemy. Here is another example of a way in which companies based in this country are being placed at a disadvantage in a service that will be delivered increasingly over the e-commerce network. Customers in the UK, in Europe and throughout the world will increasingly search the internet for the best insurance deal. Wherever it is, they will choose that deal, provided the regulatory regime covering it is satisfactory. If companies based in the UK find that, owing to the implied costs and the extra taxes that they have to pay as a result of measures such as those in the clause, the benefits of their products are lower and the costs of managing their products are higher, customers will go elsewhere.

<P>
We live in a highly competitive age. Treasury Ministers need to grasp, before it is too late, that unless British business is competitive, we will lose out and there will be far less tax to collect. The way to stay competitive in such a fast-moving environment is to have flexibility. One reason why Britain could be a centre for e-commerce is that our system of common law provides for flexibility. Matters are decided on merit as we go along. In general, we do not favour a system in which Ministers lay down the law for ever and a day-as they are doing with the clause-about how a provision should be interpreted. The Government are adopting an approach that is hostile to the new economy, the insurance industry and business in the UK, and therefore to the interests of the British people, who want as broad and secure a tax base as possible.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to place on the record my strong opposition to the clause and my support for the amendment, which constitutes a minor improvement-although even if it were accepted, I would vote against the clause.

<P>
I shall set out the reasons why I find the clause totally objectionable. My first argument is one that I offered to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset: the belief of Revenue authorities that there is in the system a single, one-way incentive companies to manage their affairs in such a way as to minimise their tax bill. That is an unrealistically one-sided view of the world, for the two reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset emphasised. The first is that a management's principal incentive-in this respect, the management of an insurance company are no different from that of any other profit-making enterprise-is not to minimise its tax bill but to maximise its return to shareholders. My hon. Friend rightly referred to the fact that the insurance industry has suffered at least as much from under-provisioning caused by managers' desire to report over-ambitious profits to their shareholders, as from over-provisioning caused by managers' wish to minimise their tax bill.

<P>
In assessing whether the proposal to allow the taxman to rewrite auditing standards-which is what the clause amounts to-should be accepted, we should remember that managers deciding the provisioning policy of an insurance company must consider two incentives; there are more examples of managements responding to the incentive to over-declare their profits than of damage being done by managements under-reporting their profits. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said, we must look at the incentives in the system, assuming that it is totally unregulated-even leaving aside the taxman's role. However, as my hon. Friend said, the assumption that the system is unregulated is false because any management deciding their provisioning policy, and therefore the profits that they report to their shareholders, must first get over the hurdle of an independent auditor. An auditor is paid and appointed by the shareholders to police the management's decisions about provisions, which is one of the most important elements that an auditor will investigate in a company, regardless of whether it is an insurance company.

<P>
This is a system in which the incentives are two-way. Arguably, the more powerful incentive is to overstate, not understate, profits. The system already has a regulator built into it. That regulator is far better placed in his professional body to determine the proper level of profitability for insurance companies than either the taxman, who has a one-way incentive, or a group of lay Members of Parliament, who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford said, are asked to adjudicate on these difficult questions about a proper provisioning policy for an insurance company. I venture to suggest that probably not a single one of us in this Room has ever worked in an insurance company. Certainly, none of us have been responsible for determining the provisioning policy of an insurance company. Nevertheless, that is precisely the question that the Committee is now being asked to decide.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman is discussing incentives, is he aware that any income arising from the reserves is taxed as it arises and is not allowed to roll up? Again, the incentive seems to be against over-provisioning.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Absolutely, for the reasons that I have given. The incentive to under-provide is more powerful than the incentive to over-provide. That is as true for insurance companies as it is for all commercial companies. Much of our discussion this morning has proceeded on the basis that the question of provisioning is somehow unique to insurance companies. However, my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs correctly drew attention to the fact that a precisely analogous set of provisioning decisions must be made by banks, which advance loans and must make bad debt provisions on the basis of what they believe to be recoverable debts on their balance sheet.

<P>
It is not only financial companies that must take provisioning decisions at the end of every financial year and justify those decisions, first to their auditors and ultimately to their shareholders. As I said, I have never worked in an insurance company. However, I have worked in a commercial company that had to determine provisions every year against stock and debtors and justify them to the auditors and, ultimately, to shareholders.

<P>
In the context of a commercial trading company, such decisions can have just as big an impact on reported profits as the provisions made by insurance companies to cover unquantified and unknowable risk when they report theirs. Just as insurance companies must assess the risk that may crystallise when they report their profits, so retailers must judge the realisable value of their stock in a period going forward. When that decision is made, it is a question of judgment.

<P>
The matter before the Committee is whether such questions of judgment about provisioning should be determined according to principles set out by auditors who specialise in the field and ultimately determine the results of trading companies, both insurance companies and others, according to what they believe represents best accounting practice, based on experience. Should the policy by which those decisions are taken be determined by the taxman? That is what is driving the matter. The Inland Revenue has convinced Ministers that they should come to Parliament and ask the House of Commons to overrule both the general commissioners and the auditing profession on the proposal. I do not believe that that case can be made.

<P>
My third point relates to the impact of the provision on the international competitiveness of the insurance industry. This week, we have seen television pictures from Portugal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister celebrating the fact that, as a result of their advocacy-we can argue about whether that is true or false-the European Union has decided not to introduce a withholding tax that would have undermined the competitiveness of London as a financial centre. I am pleased that that threat has been averted.

<P>
In the week in which Treasury Ministers are busy celebrating that victory, it would be odd if they now persuaded the Committee that we should introduce a set of provisioning arrangements for insurance companies that drove a different set of companies offshore. It is worth remembering that the eurodollar bond market is here because the Americans made the mistake of introducing a withholding tax arrangement 30 years ago. We are now being asked to send the Americans an insurance company market in return. I suppose that it would be a fair exchange, but the Committee should not endorse it.

<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford rightly said, where is an insurance policy written in a world of e-commerce? All that one needs to write an insurance policy is a computer.

<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): The right hon. Gentleman has prayed in aid the professional associations of accountants and actuaries, and said that they should decide how the insurance provisions and the reserves should be taxed. If the associations suggested that there should be a Europe-wide arrangement for the taxing of such provisions, would he fall in with that or reverse his argument and make the case that the Inland Revenue should decide how the provisions should be taxed?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not think that I would draw the conclusion that the Inland Revenue should determine provisioning policy, for all the reasons that I have already given. The idea that we should exclude tax competition from outside the EU by means of 15 member states forming a huddle and declaring what the rules are going to be has never struck me as remotely persuasive. Ministers do not think it persuasive either, or they might have been more attracted to the withholding tax argument. The idea that one could put all the jurisdictions together to exclude tax competition would work only if one could make every rock in the Pacific ocean sign up. That cannot be done, which is why the Government rejected the withholding tax argument.

<P>
It is also why, for the taxation of insurance companies, we must ensure that our tax regime is at least as attractive as the tax regime of the majority of home countries where major insurance companies now operate. The proposal will make the tax regime on our insurance companies significantly more onerous than the tax regimes that operate in Switzerland, Holland, the United States of America and several other countries.

<P>
It may sound far-fetched that the motor insurance policy for my constituent in Birstall can be written in Arkansas, but it is not remotely far-fetched in this age. An agent for an insurance company in Arkansas can operate in a one-up, one-down office, and if that company has a more advantageous tax regime than an insurance company in the City of London, it will quote lower premiums and take the business. I do not see why that is in the interests of the British insurance industry; in fact, I am sure that it is contrary to its interests. I cannot understand why the Government, who sometimes make such great play about their desire to promote the attractiveness of Britain as a competitive place to do business, should close their eyes and ears to that argument.

<P>
The proposal is wrong for all the reasons that I
have given about international competitiveness, comparability between insurance companies and other companies in the UK, and the entire thought process being based on a misunderstanding of commercial incentives. It is wrong also because it puts the taxman in the lead in determining the level of insurance companies' profit, rather than observing the long-standing preference for the Inland Revenue to assess tax while taking its lead from the accounting profession and commercial decisions. We seek to tax commercial profits, not to determine through the tax code what those profits are-to take the lead from the auditors, with the taxman to follow, and not the other way around. The proposal takes an important and damaging step in the wrong direction.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman not want the Inland Revenue to set the level of the tax, or does he want that level to be the lowest in Europe, as he seems to be suggesting?

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I will try to make my point as clearly and simply as I can. We should determine the profits of any company in accordance with the best commercial principles. The repository of those principles in determining profits after provisions is the accounting profession, answerable through the normal processes to the commercial world. Managers, regulated by their auditors, determine the commercial profits; it is then for the taxing authorities to tax those profits, not to distort their determination in accordance with the priorities of the tax system. That is a hugely damaging path to go down. The moment that we decide that the determination of commercial profit should be led more by tax than commercial reality, we start to create a series of wrong incentives for commercial managers and distort reported profits, which leads to a misallocation of resources through capital and other markets. The proposals could damage the long-term interests of a freely functioning market economy.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My right hon. Friend and my hon. Friends the Members for West Dorset and for Guildford have made powerful speeches on the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. I want to advance that debate. The Economic Secretary knows that we have our doubts and, if she is to win support from the Committee, she must put on record the detail of how the Revenue has arrived at this situation.

<P>
The matter is one that, as they say, has form. The Revenue's interest began in the 1980s, when it had long discussions with the Association of British Insurers and scratched about in the undergrowth of the insurance business with the intention of bringing in discounting provisions. That was a long time ago, and the Revenue rowed away from that aim. Perhaps it received a modicum of comfort in 1986, when similar proposals were introduced in the United States; the ambition to have parallel provisioning burned in the Revenue's breast for a long time.

<P>
Let us stop at that juncture and reflect on the difference between the London insurance market and that in other areas. As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, we insure things in London that other people will not or cannot insure. Much of that activity is described in technical terms as long-tail risk. Sometimes, it takes a long time before one knows what the eventual outcome of a claim will be and, thus, what provisions one must make to cover those liabilities.

<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Clause 106 would have an inhibiting effect on the London market's ability to cover such insurance. Will the Economic Secretary please tell us in detail what analysis she has carried out? The Revenue has undertaken a consultation exercise on the proposals. What was the reaction of the London insurance market, in particular Lloyd's, to its abilities under the proposals to carry on with profit properly dealing with the type of risk that I have described? What detailed analysis satisfies her that her proposals are correct?

<P>
Secondly, can the Economic Secretary explain why the Revenue lost its case against Commercial Union, when it was having another go through the courts to ensure that some of the provisions in the clause were introduced, so that there would be a blanket provision to deal with the problems? I hope that she is writing all my questions down, because I shall look forward to receiving her answers to them. The basis of the Government's launching their views on such matters was to say that, if financial reporting standard 12 were applied in such matters, insurance companies would have to make similar provisions for normal companies. In fact, that was reflected in the Treasury's press release, REVPN2L, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The new rules bring general insurance companies and Lloyd's members broadly into line with companies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That use of ``broadly in line'' is interesting. In response to the consultation document, the Association of British Insurers states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This confirms the view expressed above that the Inland Revenue proposals are significantly harsher than those applying to commerce and industry generally in the UK.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Can the Economic Secretary explain the misaligning of language in which she says that the proposals are supposed to bring Lloyd's members and insurance companies ``broadly into line'', whereas the ABI's view is that they go too far? Why is there not a fit?

<P>
At the heart of the proposal at which the amendments are directed is over-provisioning for future risk by insurance companies, especially in the general insurance area. What does the Department of Trade and Industry's returns database show, for example, during the early 1990s, about the speed with which reserves for future risk were used up? I hope that she will be able to put some information on the record about how final claims were settled. The quicker that claims are settled, the less risk is left around in the balance sheet not used up. Does the data on the DTI's returns database support the contention that there is over-provisioning for risk? If so, by how much, and what is the tax effect of the over-provisioning with which the DTI's figures deal? If the Economic Secretary is going to try to convince us, she has to give us an objective assessment.

<P>
FRS 12 is an interesting subject. According to the Accounting Standards Board, its objective is to ensure that a liability of uncertain timing or amount is recognised only when it actually exists at the balance sheet date. The nature of insurance makes that an extremely difficult test to satisfy. That is why there is an element of uncertainty in what insurance companies do, which is the issue at the heart of the clause.

<P>
Insurance companies must try to be accurate in their financial provisioning. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) tellingly pointed out, insurance companies that are plcs have shareholder responsibilities and have to be accurate in their public statements. Perhaps the big difference between now and the time when the Revenue first became interested in the subject is that many of the specialist actuaries who now try to help insurance companies to determine their future provisioning did not exist then.

<P>
What discussions have the Economic Secretary or her officials had with actuaries? It is on actuarial analysis that the question of provisioning will arise. What was the outcome of those discussions? She will be aware of a letter to Mr. Andrew Page from the Institute of Actuaries dated 15 May. Has she read it? If so, what does she think of the actuaries' concerns? Like me, the institute makes the point about the inapplicability of FRS 12 to this subject.

<P>
The letter also deals with the issue raised by the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale). I wonder whether he had read it; I do not think that he has. He has shown what happens when ignorance becomes bliss and one wanders into a debate without knowing the facts. If he had read it, he would not have asked his question about the EC. I shall be happy to give way if I am putting words into his mouth, but he did not seem to know that an EC insurance accounts directive dealt with some of the issues. The institute points out in its letter to the Revenue that the directive prohibits the discounting of claims provisions when the mean term to settlement is less than four years, as is the case for the large majority of claims.

<P>
In the context of the directive, the institute goes on to question the practicality of the proposals, subject to the amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs tabled to clause 106. How are the proposals compatible with an EC insurance accounts directive to which we are already signatories? My hon. Friend raised that question. The Inland Revenue is now flying in the face of our directive obligations.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman elucidate that point further? Is he saying that there may be a case for a challenge against the legislation in the European Court?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not know whether there could be a challenge. I can merely report the actuaries' message to the Inland Revenue. I ask my question-questions for the Economic Secretary are piling up, and we will look forward with keen interest to her detailed explanations-because I am doubtful about whether what the clause invites us to do is possible. Will the Economic Secretary help me to understand whether we are in line with our directive requirements? I am sorry that I cannot answer the important question asked by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. We now wait with bated breath for the Economic Secretary's comments.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I am still reeling from the right hon. Gentleman's heavy-handed personal attack on me for not being an expert on European Community accounts directives. I was not asking a factual question about whether such a directive exists, but how it should be evaluated. Is that a good example of European Union harmonisation?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I shall try to respond with a light touch, if the hon. Gentleman thinks that I was heavy-handed before. In response to the hon. Gentleman's question, if the accounts directive has been agreed, then it has been agreed. The reasons for raising it is that part of it is germane. On whether I accept it, or whether it is good or bad, my answer is that I do not know. That is why I asked the Economic Secretary the question. That makes two of us-one on the Opposition Benches, and one on the Government Benches-who will now hang on her every word on the implications of the EC accounts directive. I look forward to a substantial debate later in the Committee.

<P>
I posed a number of questions to the Economic Secretary, and it may be necessary to deal with further matters. However, it would be fairer to give her a chance to reply. The provision seems to be a heavy-handed attack on the insurance industry. Other approaches exist to deal with such matters, and a clear case has not been made on why the provision is the best way. Clearly, the Government are making the covering of future risk more onerous for insurance companies. If I may ask a final question, will the Economic Secretary explain why the proposed discount rate is not discounted for risk? That might be a way of addressing some of the many unfairnesses that my right hon. and hon. Friends have exposed.

<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson)</B> There are some general issues on which it would be helpful to respond. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs for the approach that he took in his opening remarks, and for raising issues that it is worth while to discuss before debating the amendments.<P>

<P>
First, a good and useful period of consultation with industry has taken place. I have had recent meetings with representatives of industry bodies, especially the ABI, in connection with the proposals under discussion. We discussed the issue of competition, which, in relation to the proposals, is perhaps not as great an issue as the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs would wish to claim.

<P>
I believe that the proposals do not have an adverse effect on competition in relation to the insurance industry. The effects of the tax changes will be gradual and will give the insurance industry time to adjust. Even after 10 years, the expected additional tax will not lead to companies in the UK suffering a competitive disadvantage compared with other leading European Union countries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Many points have been made in the debate and if I am not allowed to answer them, I will not bring forward the answers that the right hon. Gentleman wants.

<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I certainly seek to challenge what the Economic Secretary is saying, but not in a destructive spirit. I want to give her the opportunity to justify her proposition that the clause will not lead to a competitive disadvantage. In Switzerland, the answer to whether the reserves shown in the accounts are accepted for tax purposes is yes; in Ireland, it is yes; in the Netherlands, the answer is longer but, in principle, it is yes and, in Germany, the answer is yes in principle. If the provisions as set out in the accounts are accepted in other countries, but not here, how can the hon. Lady say that there will be no impairment of our competitive position?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As I had not yet said anything accept what the general drift of my remarks was to be, it is hard to say that I would have said anything in support of such a case. I had not yet got on to my main point, and I think that the right hon. Gentleman is aware of that fact.

<P>
The ABI has produced a useful submission, in which one of the main comparisons was between the UK and the Netherlands. I am sure that many members of the Committee are well aware that comparisons with all other countries around the globe as a base for potential insurance companies are not relevant and that certain comparisons are more useful than others. In that regard, there would be a difference when comparing any EU country with countries that might operate as a tax haven for insurance business.

<P>
Let us compare this country with some significant EU countries. It is a relevant comparison to make and, indeed, one that several Opposition Members have made themselves. I shall make the comparison using KPMG's January 1999 global tax survey figures for EU countries. In Germany, the corporate tax rates are between 44 and 52 per cent.; in Italy, the corporate tax rate is 41 per cent.; in Belgium, it is 40 per cent.; in France, it is 40 per cent. and in the Netherlands-the subject of the comparison in the ABI document-it is 35 per cent. As the UK rate was, in 1999, only 31 per cent. and has since dropped to 30 per cent., we have a 5 per cent. competitive advantage over other countries. That is the worse-case scenario, in others the difference is 10 per cent. or more. Within that setting, it is more difficult to see that a proposal that officials in the Inland Revenue, the Treasury and the ABI agree would produce a yield of about £250 million after a considerable number of years-probably four to 10 years-would be in the order of 0.75 per cent. of premium income.

<P>
Opposition Members questioned the cost of that to the industry, but they did not quote a sum-they made not a single remark about the financial effect on the insurance industry.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I recollect that I quoted the Government's figure of £250 million. I said that there was a problem of ongoing costs in terms of the effect on capital adequacy and so on and a potential cost several times that-not a tax cost, but an operating cost.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for forgetting that he had mentioned that. He was the only Opposition Member to mention a sum of money. The second part of his point is different to the one that I was making.

<P>
If we suppose that a significant other EU country is the Netherlands and that the corporate tax differentials are at their present rates-I believe that taxes on employment are higher in the Netherlands-there is not the tax advantage that Opposition Members claim.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I hope that the Economic Secretary has a stronger argument to come on the issue of international competitiveness. It is strange indeed for a Government to argue that while our tax rates are lower, that is a meaningless apparent advantage for British business because we will assess to tax a tax base that is higher than that of any other country. Are we to hear, every time that Ministers say that we have the lowest corporate tax rate in Europe-which is a welcome development-the qualification that our taxable profits are higher for any given level of economic activity than they would be in any other European country? Is that the coda to the ministerial claim about tax rates?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman's second premise, but even if I did, the relevant issue is the overall effect on business. Companies operating in the UK are not at a competitive disadvantage; that also goes for the insurance industry.

<P>
Other competition issues affect the insurance industry and point to a general uncertainty about the future. They are not necessarily specific to the proposals, but are general issues about the future of e-commerce. The point made by Opposition Members on a number of occasions about the ease with which insurance policies can be drawn up and underwritten in different places has not changed in any way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Economic Secretary comment on paragraph 6.7 of the ABI's response? It says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A likely behavioural effect is that companies at all levels will take out higher levels of excess of loss reinsurance to protect themselves from volatility. Because the proposals will make the UK a less attractive location to write such business, it is probable that much of this business will be reinsured abroad and be a loss to the UK.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Why does the Economic Secretary claim that the ABI is totally wrong and she is totally right?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Our proposals would address in several ways the issues that the right hon. Gentleman raises. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs talked about the extra capital that might be required from insurance companies. The Royal and Sun Alliance has suggested 10 per cent. As I said, the additional cost of the proposals is expected to remain well below 1 per cent., at around 0.75 per cent. of premium income, even after a 10-year period. The first-year effect is an estimated £50 million. It is also less than the cost of the increase in corporate tax rates to typical EU levels. However, in the long term, the cost can be avoided by taking advantage of the election and making a large up-front payment. The company can, if it wants to do so, spread that one-off cost across several years by making gradually larger elections. Once the one-off cost has been met, ther will be no on-going effect on capital requirement.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Economic Secretary chided us for not referring to the figure of £250 million more often. She has now said twice that £250 million represents 0.75 per cent. of premium income. Perhaps a more material number is what percentage that 0.75 per cent., or £250 million, represents of the taxable profits of such companies. What percentage of the profits of the general insurance industry will be handed over to the Government as a result of the provision?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall return to that point in a moment.

<P>
I shall speak more generally to clause 106, as did the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs in his opening remarks. Several Opposition Members asked about the principles behind the proposal. It is worth pointing out that much of the detail will be dealt with through regulations. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton complained about the use of regulations in this regard. The technical nature of the issues covered in the clause requires such an approach.

<P>
The use of regulations also allows for consultation, which has been undertaken. As I said, the consultation process has been productive, and I take the opportunity to thank all those who responded for their valuable input. The consultation period ended recently. We received some 20 responses, many of which were detailed, and discussion of the issues raised by the respondents continues. If the continuing dialogue suggests that changes to the clause would be necessary or desirable, I shall return with amendments to the clause on Report. I am pleased that the consultation process has worked to good effect. The regulations that will be made under the clause will be released later in draft form for comment.

<P>
I shall explain the proposals in a little more detail. As several hon. Members said, the nature of the insurance trade is such that many potential liabilities are taken on. Sometimes the existence of a liability and its cost are established quickly. However, an insurer is likely to have entered into some contracts for which the amount, or possibly even the existence, of a liability is known for several years, and sometimes for several decades.

<P>
If a liability is not due immediately, the insurance company will benefit from the investment income that it can earn on premiums before it needs to pay the claim. For example, if an insurer needs to pay £100 in five years' time, it can invest £75 now at 6 per cent., which will grow in five years to become the £100 needed to pay the policyholder. That delay in the liability is recognised by discounting the value of the liability. The discounted value is equivalent to the amount that needs to be set aside now in order to pay the liability later. The discounting process-

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Economic Secretary is advancing a familiar argument in favour of discounting provisions for long-tail business. Will she speculate as to why that argument was rejected by the general commissioners, the auditing profession and the regulators of the insurance industry?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman has been a Minister and knows full well that Ministers never speculate. His attempt to encourage me to do so is mischievous.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am simply asking the Economic Secretary to reinforce her argument, which, on the face of it, sounds reasonably attractive. However, such an argument has been rejected by every specialist inquiry into the insurance industry that has considered it. She must go beyond making a bland presentation, and explain why we must reject the findings of the general commissioners, the auditing profession and insurance industry regulators, and replace our judgment for all of theirs.

<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Will my hon. friend give way?

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have not yet stood up. I shall be happy to give way to my hon. Friend in a moment.

<P>
If Committee memebrs wish to hear me make a coherent argument, continually asking about matters that I shall cover in due course will probably not be of assistance.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Economic Secretary is making a speech.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that all these pieces of paper amount to a speech, they do not; at least not in the sense that he means.

<P>
The International Accounting Standards Committee recently argued that discounting is appropriate in the reporting of an insurance trade. It commented:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Steering Committee concludes that the use of present value in measuring general insurance claim liabilities is consistent with the  emphasis on information that is relevant and decision-useful. A claim payable within one month imposes a higher economic burden than a claim of similar amount that will be paid two years in the future. The use of present value allows financial statements to provide information that distinguishes those two claims from one another  The Steering Committee finds no basis for exempting general insurance claim liabilities from [present value] measurement.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> So far, so good. Now will the Minister-

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have not given way to the right hon. Gentleman. I propose to make some progress.

<P>
Discounting is the process that reflects the true economic effect of a liability, and is well established. It is right that that difference should be recognised in the tax deduction, so that an immediate liability is recognised by a larger tax deduction than a delayed liability. As I said, if the tax deductions are not discounted, a liability due in 10 years is treated in the same way as one due now. Those liabilities are not the same, and it is right that the taxation of insurance companies should recognise that.

<P>
That clause aims to limit the value of tax deductions to a discounted value of liabilities. However, it recognises and important difficulty in making such a change. Currently, only a small proportion of the tens of billions of pounds worth of insurance liabilities are discounted in tax computations. The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) asked what DTI returns in the 1990s showed. They showed that there was no discounting. The figures in the ``Financial Statement and Budget Report'' are not disputed by the industry, and are based on the entries in those returns. Therefore, a sudden and immediate change to a discounted basis would create a large tax liability immediately for almost all insurance companies. Overall, the cost to the industry would be substantially in excess of £1 billion in the first year alone. That has more in common with the approach taken in Germany.

<P>
The proposed legislation avoids such a large immediate cost by allowing an insurance company to continue, if it wishes, to base its tax deductions on undiscounted liabilities. If it does so, however, it will have to pay an additional tax later, which will compensate the Exchequer for the fact that the tax deductions were larger than the discounted value of the actual liabilities, as they turned out to be. The additional tax would be equivalent to an interest charge. That wait-and-see approach has some advantages. It would allow the cost of the change to be brought in gradually. There is also a danger that a change to the discounted basis could bring about lengthy and costly disputes between insurance companies and the Inland Revenue about the discounted value of liability.

<P>
Waiting until the liability is settled will avoid the need for such disputes, so some companies may prefer to make the change to a discounted basis in advance. The clause allows for that as well. A company may elect to reduce its tax deduction in order to move to a discounted valuation of its liabilities. It may move all at once to a discounted basis, or may do so over several years to stage that cost. In either case, to the extent that the company takes advantage of the election, its later interest charges will be correspondingly reduced.

<P>
The legislation also applies to Lloyd's members. As far as possible, the rules for them will be equivalent to those for other insurance companies. The detailed rules for other companies will be in secondary legislation.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 414 to 420 and amendment No. 424 would change the way in which the clause deals with tax deductions that have been too low. They would allow regulations to create for tax purposes an additional expense in a later year, calculated as though it were an interest charge. That would be the mirror image of the additional receipts recalculated in the same way if a tax deduction turns out to be too high.

<P>
The clause's wait-and-see approach means that the possibility of tax deductions that are too low must be considered alongside the possibility of ones that are too high. The clause already allows regulations to make negative interest calculations, but it restricts the extent to which relief for them can be used. The effect of the relief is ring-fenced to additions made under the clause.

<P>
The consultation paper for the secondary legislation invited comment on how relief would be allowed against additions arising in the same or a later year. It did not suggest carry-back of the relief to an earlier year, or that the negative interest should be treated as a trade expense, which would not be possible without a further amendment. Many respondents to the consultation paper made representations on the matter. There were two main suggestions. One was that the relief should be available for carry-back to an earlier period, and the other was that it should be available as a trade expense, as proposed in the amendments. I welcome those responses. The Government agree that there is a case for extending the availability of relief.

<P>
There are advantages to both approaches. Additional trade expenses may be set off against other profits without restriction, but trade losses may be carried back for only one year whereas carry-back could be allowed for a longer period. More responses to the consultation suggested that relief should be carried back than that it should be a trade expense. We intend to further discuss the merits of the options with the industry. If trade expenses are favoured, I will consider whether there can be a Government amendment on Report to make the necessary changes. The amendments as tabled would leave a duplication of regulation-making powers, and subsection (5)(c) would be left without any apparent purpose.

<P>
In view of the commitments that I have made to review the relief in sufficient deductions, I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank the Economic Secretary for her specific response to the group of amendments. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I made it clear that we feel that the clause represents a mistaken approach. The amendments are designed to make it possible to interpret the provisions more fairly, if the Government use their voting power to proceed with them. I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for confirming that consultations are proceeding and showing some support for the intention behind the amendments. On that basis, I shall not press the amendments to a Division.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I agree with my hon. Friend and do not oppose his decision not to press his amendment to a Division. However, I asked the Economic Secretary a question about the yield of the tax as a proportion of the taxable profits of the general insurance industry, and I notice that she has a piece of paper that might help her to answer it.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes, I have a piece of paper, but I already had a figure in my mind. The yield is expected to be around 5 per cent. of profits.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Economic Secretary for revealing that figure, because by doing so she has shot her own argument out of the water. She said
that we did not need to worry about competitiveness vis-a-vis Holland, because we are on a corporation tax rate of 31 per cent. falling to 30 per cent., while the Dutch are on 35 per cent. Never mind that the taxable profits will be higher here than they are in Holland, we can rely on the fact that our tax rate is lower. When I ask her an inocuous question, she tells us that the change in the tax system closes the gap between ourselves and our principal competitors in Holland. Her argument is shot out of the water by her own words.

<P>
The evidence that the Economic Secretary has given the Committee proves the case that we have made from these Benches. By intervening in such a way in the general insurance industry, the Government are impeding its competitiveness against the Dutch industry and others, against whom the loss of competitive advantage is that much greater. Her case that we should accept discounting appears to be based exclusively on the word of the International Accounting Standards Committee. All other bodies that have considered the question have said no, including the British courts, the general commissioner of the Inland Revenue, the British Accounting Standards Board and British insurance regulators. Only the International Accounting Standards Committee-as a form of advice or a flyer-has said yes. On that basis, the Government have decided that we should go after the tax revenue and hang the consequences for the British insurance industry.

<P>
The measure is iniquitous. Although the Committee has been good-natured on other occasions, as it should be, we must oppose a proposal that will be deeply damaging for the insurance industry and in the precedent that it creates for tax-led auditing standards. The Committee should be in no doubt that we will be taking a major step in the wrong direction if the Government railroad the proposal through.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am disappointed that the Economic Secretary has not, with her characteristic courtesy, answered a large number of the specific questions that I posed. One of those questions related to a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood in an intervention. When he cited the previous attempts to deal with the matter and asked for the reasons behind them, the Economic Secretary said that Ministers should not speculate. In her briefing-I would be surprised if she had not received it-there is always a bit that gives the history of any particular policy issue. The Revenue is good at that, as it has been around for a long time. The note will say, ``The Minister will be aware that there have been previous cases''. It will cite a case and give the Economic Secretary the reason why, on that occasion, the Revenue did not win. There will then be a justification for another attempt on the same area. I am not asking the Economic Secretary to speculate. I am merely asking her politely and straightforwardly to tell the Committee why, on previous occasions, the Revenue lost. Her answer might give us some idea of why it now feels more confident to take such action, and it would deal with the questions asked by my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood.

<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
At the heart of the matter is my question about the DTI's figures. I wanted to know about claims paid as a percentage of projected final outcomes. I did not fully understand the Economic Secretary's answer. It was delivered in about two lines and, to be honest, it takes me a little longer than that to digest a response, think about it and reach a conclusion. If the hon. Lady had read the ABI's responses to the consultation document, she would know that that subject was part of its evidence and that, when it was commenting on the tables that I mentioned, it said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The table below shows that for the companies reviewed aggregate nondiscounted provisions for the period 1989-1996 suggest a slight degree of underreserving over the period as a whole.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is significant. If the Government's own figures show that there was underreserving over the period 1989-1996, we must ask why the Revenue now wants to take action in an area where official data say that the problem does not exist.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> A further visit to the area.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Indeed.

<P>
The ABI continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Noteworthily the greatest variances/deviations came in years with underreserving which suggests that there is no systematic overreserving across the industry.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If that was not true, the Economic Secretary should apply statistics slowly and carefully-for those of us who take a little time to understand such matters-to illustrate why the Revenue is right. She has not decided to do so, so I now give her the opportunity to deal with that matter.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood said that it seemed as though the Government had alighted-like a desperate man from a boat seeking a desert island-on an island kindly provided by the International Accounting Standards Committee. Someone at the IASC had put his head above the parapet and said, ``Well, in general terms, this type of thing is all right,'' to which the Government replied, ``Whoopee, here we go-a flag to wave in our defence.'' I am interested to know whether there has been any discussion about the apparent difference between our own Accounting Standards Board and the IASC. We do not necessarily have to borrow the latter's proposals. We are on ASB here, but perhaps the Minister had not noticed that fact. What does the ASB think about the matter? I will be the first to sit down and say that I am sorry that I have got it wrong. Will the Minister comment on how the ASB regards the IASC's proposals? The two organisations do not agree with each other. The ABI made that clear in its evidence.

<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood mentioned international competitiveness, and it is evident that the insurance company-being based internationally-will deal with that. However, before I discuss that matter in more detail, I wish to refer to the effect of the proposals on general insurance premiums. The Government profess to be interested in consumers, but the Economic Secretary has not mentioned that matter. Has she received categorical assurances from insurance companies that they will not use the proposals as an excuse to increase premiums? When my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs was talking about a stealth tax, I was about to get up and say, ``It is not stealthy at all; it is more like smash-and-grab, straight through the front door.'' I have a feeling that insurance premiums will increase as a result of the proposal. A precedent exists-insurance premium tax. I shall not discuss the merits of that at this stage, but it is self-evident that insurance companies lose no opportunity to pass on to policyholders the full effect of a change in tax.

<P>
If the Economic Secretary chooses not to reply, those who study and report our affairs will say that the Government tacitly and silently acknowledge that premiums will increase. That is a stealth tax. It will be interesting to hear what she says.

<P>
Others in the insurance business have, like my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, pointed out that domestic lines of insurance, such as motor insurance, for example, could be sold on the internet or from other EU countries. That business could be exported, and international business could go to places such as Bermuda. That would result in the retention in the United Kingdom of less insurance business. Again, the ABI made that point in the paragraph that I quoted.

<P>
The Economic Secretary has not yet made a powerful, compelling well argued and factually supported case for the proposal. If the industry is to understand why the Government want to introduce the provision and make any sense of the consultation on the regulations that will be made under the clause, I invite her to give a better account of the Government's position on the matter than she has given heretofore.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Earlier, the right hon. Gentleman mentioned the courts. I did not respond, because I thought that the main contribution about the courts had been made by the hon. Member for Guildford, who is no longer in his place. As current law, as interpreted by the courts, I cannot deal with the issue, the courts have ruled that under the current law for insurance companies, discounting is not permitted for tax. We must therefore change the law in order to introduce discounting. I am sure that the courts' judgment has been in the public domain for people to read for some time. The courts can interpret only existing law, which is why we are making the change.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Fylde felt that the issue of under-reserving was involved, and the hon. Member for West Dorset, who is not in his place, also raised the issue. However, it is not. The clause will allow insurance companies to make a tax deduction below their accounts reserves. As a result, there will be no pressure to reduce reserves for tax reasons. The clause will merely ensure that the amount claimed for tax purposes is not excessive.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I was talking about over-provisioning, not under-reserving. That was the basis of my question.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I apologise. If that was the right hon. Gentleman's point, I misunderstood it.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman also made a point about the effect of insurance premium tax on premiums. IPT was introduced by the previous Conservative Government; indeed, it may have been introduced when the right hon. Member for Fylde was Financial Secretary. I am afraid that I do not have the relevant dates. The 2.5 per cent. rate of insurance premium tax raises much more than the clause will. I hope that the right hon. Member for Fylde is considering his own role if he believes that the clause will create a problem.

<P>
I remind the right hon. Member for Charnwood, who mentioned competition, that several wider issues are involved, even in tax comparisons with the Netherlands, which is the nearest to us. All countries of the other have at least a 5 per cent. differential over and above the UK in terms of competitiveness.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I have not finished my point; I will give way to the right hon. Gentleman when I have done so. I note his extreme keenness to speak on the matter. It is hard to keep him sitting in his place. There are several other differentials between the tax regimes in the Netherlands and the UK, including tax for employers and employees and other aspects that work to the UK's advantage. I do not accept his argument that the tax advantage of being based in the UK is negated.

<P>
Several hon. Members talked about the insurance industry and the risks involved in it as if it were a homogeneous animal. It is not, as I am sure they know full well. The right hon. Member for Fylde-who is talking to his Whip at the moment-talked in that way about the motor insurance industry. The risk of paying for the periods involved in motor insurance is less than that incurred by insuring larger, riskier projects that involve a much longer time scale. We are talking about a different kind of business. We cannot lump the entire insurance industry together. The risks in the motor insurance industry are fairly quantifiable-far more like the pension industry's actuarial assessments, which some Opposition Members raised.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want the Economic Secretary to mislead the Committee about competitive tax rates elsewhere in Europe. She is right that the corporate tax rate in Holland is currently 35 per cent. She is not right to imply that the Germans are stuck on a corporate tax rate of well over 40 per cent. As she said, that was the position last year. The German Government are introducing proposals that will significantly cut the German corporate tax rate and remove some of the safety margin that the Economic Secretary suggests exists.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am afraid that I will have to go back over some ground because I am still not satisfied that I have had answers.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I had not finished.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I apologise.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I apologise, I thought that the Economic Secretary had indicated to me that she had finished.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Cook; I too was confused. I rose to continue speaking and you called the right hon. Member for Fylde. I was not sure whether I had indicated that I had finished.

<P>
It is not our place to discuss at great length the taxation system in Germany, but it is worth pointing out that one of the arguments of those who, like Opposition Members, oppose the clause is that the Germans will have discounting and that insurance companies are as a result leaving Germany in large numbers. The right hon. Gentleman cannot say both that that is happening and that German tax rates offer a competitive advantage Those two statements point in opposite directions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> A number of areas still need to be probed. I ask questions because, as I have discovered from my postbag, people read the record of what is said in the Committee carefully. The insurance industry will be interested to read what the Economic Secretary says.

<P>
I asked the Economic Secretary about over-provisioning, and she responded with an answer about under-provisioning. She said that she did not understand my question. I refer her to paragraph 4.2 of the ABI's response to the Inland Revenue consultative document on this very subject. I shall not read it all out again, but it says that the DTI figures for the period from 1989 to 1996 suggest slight under-reserving for the whole period. If that is correct, it raises a question about the justification for the measure. The Inland Revenue wants to act because it argues that there has been over-provisioning for risk, as a result of which insurance companies are more profitable in any one accounting period than they should be. It wants to attack that, and extract a slice of tax as a result. Will the Economic Secretary comment on that in detail?

<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The Economic Secretary misunderstood my point about IPT, which I decided not to debate. I shall not resile from my argument. My point was that a new tax on the insurance industry quickly results in increased premiums. On behalf of everyone in this country who has an insurance policy, I asked what assurances she could give that the proposals would not become an excuse for insurance companies to increase consumers' premiums.

<P>
The Economic Secretary also failed to respond to the serious question of the implications of the EU directive. There appeared to be a genuine conflict between the objectives of that accounting directive and what is proposed. She is happy to pray in aid the IASC in favour of a cause, but she remains silent on the EU directive, which seems to move in the opposite direction.

<P>
The most interesting comment made by the Economic Secretary was about long-tail business, which is especially important for this country because Lloyd's specialises in that area. Effectively, Lloyd's, and other insurers of long unquantifiable risk, will be in a less competitive position to write such insurance, which brings in so much revenue in invisibles. However, she remained silent on those points. The insurance industry will be interested to receive specific answers to those questions. Consequently, when they toil under the extra tax burdens, they might have some insight into why Ministers-

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I understand that the right hon. Gentleman wants to make the British insurance industry into the bucket shop of Europe, with the lowest tax rates and so on, but the measure is not about the level of taxes. It is about the way in which profits that will be taxed will be determined. If an insurance company is using its provisions and reserves to hide profits that, under a fair regime, should be subject to tax, those profits should be taxed in the usual way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> What does the hon. Gentleman mean by the word ``fair''? The word is chucked about in Labour circles as if it is the answer to everything. We have heard about ``fair votes'', and now ``fair tax''. If he were listening to my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood-who succinctly described the responsibilities of plcs in terms of shareholder value, the reports that they must make in their accounts, and so on-he would have understood that people do not operate in a mystical nether world in which they hide things. In a way, there are no hiding places. The point that I made, which directly answers his point, was in relation to the analysis of DTI figures. If he wishes to intervene again, perhaps he will tell me his interpretation of the DTI returns database for the period from 1989 to 1996, which I quoted? Rather than showing manipulation, it suggested that companies had under-provided for such future risks. I also dealt with that point by referring to the growth of specialist actuaries, who have to advise insurance companies on such matters. The insurance industry makes that point that 20 years ago, when such specialists did not exist, one could have argued that there was something wrong with the degree of provision for future risk. Now it argues that it is more targeted, because it has to be careful with the provision of other people's money in its accounts for future risks. That is the point of our argument. The industry is in a much more transparent position than it was before, which is why it considers that the proposals are inappropriate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> When insurance companies are under-providing, they have an adequate incentive to make the proper provision to retain their competitiveness in a competitive market vis-à-vis the future. When there are instances of their deliberately over-providing, that is simply a way of disguising profits that need to be properly assessed and taxed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> It is no use for the hon. Gentleman to pop up and say that. I have put to the Government data that counter his argument-not my data, but their data. The Economic Secretary cannot reveal the necessary information. When the Revenue presents proposals to Ministers, it trundles up to them with a great file labelled with a Budget starter number, says, ``This is what we would like you to do in the Budget'' and gives reasons why it has been cruising through the accounts of X, Y and Z insurance companies. It does not tell the Ministers which companies they are, but it usually gives the Government some concrete examples of where the over-provision is happening. It is a great pity that the Minister cannot share that information with the Committee. I understand why she cannot do so, but she did not tiptoe up to that. All that we have is a cost to the industry. We have no number for the over-provisioning. If the Government had been able to give us some factual numbers, particularly with reference to the DTI, that might have helped us to understand where they were coming from.

<P>
<B>Dr. Palmer:</B> I am worried about the way in which Opposition Back Benchers, in particular, seem to be operating as the extended arm of the industry. I noted the attack on my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon about the concept of fair taxation. As advocated by Labour party members, that concept is taxation that takes account of the interests of the industry and consumers, and of the population at large. Surely the right hon. Member for Fylde cannot seriously suggest that Ministers will exclusively take account of the interests of the industry and the accountancy profession at the expense of consumers and taxpayers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My interest is in insurance. I have just paid my motor vehicle premium. I am a user of insurance products. I make consumer points. It is the job of the Opposition to ask such questions in Committee. I do not apologise for repeating those points of concern that have been put to me by ABI, because it represents the interests of the industry, which the hon. Gentleman said that we should take into account. I want to draw from the Minister more information so that, if we are unfortunate enough to have to have the clause in the Bill, we shall know a little more about why it is there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My right hon. Friend is on to an important point when he talks about the alleged over-providing. The hon. Member for Wimbledon suggested that insurance companies are over-providing in order to cut their taxes. Well, he should look at the evidence, which, in respect of 1989, for example, is not that they over-provided in order to cut their tax bills, but that they under-provided by 28 per cent. of what turned out to be the liabilities. Where is the consumer interest? Surely it is not to over-declare profits as happened in 1989-incidentally, presumably paying more tax to the Revenue-with the result that there was an appreciable risk that individual insurance companies would be unable to meet the claims of their policy holders. We do not have over-providing.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The right hon. Gentleman is making an intervention, not a speech.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for your reminder, Mr. Cook. I was getting carried away. I wanted to suggest to my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde that the evidence is not of over-providing for tax planning, but of under-providing and undermining the interests of the consumers on whom the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) invited us to concentrate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> That was a superb intervention. It was of such quality that I almost did not bother to speak again. I cannot better it, so I invite the Economic Secretary to respond to those further points.

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The DTI report is based on non-discounted reserves. To judge by his comments, the right hon. Member for Fylde seems to be taking no account of my remarks. The issue is not over-provisioning but discounting, and the DTI returns do not deal with it. Even if the reserves will not be over-provided on a non-discounted basis, they will be on a discounted basis.

<P>
Earlier, the right hon. Gentleman referred to consultation responses made to the Treasury by the Institute of Actuaries. The thrust of the discussion about that letter was on the risk element in the discount rate. I am sorry to stray further, Mr. Cook, but that is covered by amendment No. 421, which is not in the group. The Opposition are trying to have such a free-ranging discussion that it is difficult to know when certain points should be made. As the right hon. Gentleman is keen to have the points made now, I shall make them, with your indulgence, Mr. Cook.

<P>
The consultation paper suggested a 5 per cent. margin of error. The responses to the paper, especially that from the Institute of Actuaries, suggested a preference for an allowance in the discount rate, as that would more effectively target the margin at the longer-tail liabilities, which are inherently more uncertain. The Government accept that there is merit in that approach. I agree that some allowance for risk should be made in the discount rate. I am grateful to the respondents to the consultation paper for their considered views on the subject. I hope that the Opposition accept the force of those points, although I will make them at more length when we debate amendment No. 421.

<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood and the hon. Member for West Dorset, who is still absent, raised those issues earlier. The over-reserving and non-discounting arise from the need to follow regulatory rules in companies' accounts. Few insurance companies are discounting at present.

<P>
A useful exchange was started by my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon. ``Fair'' is indeed extremely relevant. It means discounted reserves to get to commercial profit, which is the same as for other companies' tax deductions on a commercial basis. Provided account is taken of risk, which can be handled by considering discounting and its rate, it is reasonable to think that companies that provide insurance should be taxed and given an element of adjustment for risk in the same way in which other companies are taxed. That is what we propose.

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I must advise the Committee that we had a very broad discussion on that group of amendments. Anyone who looks for a clause stand part debate after that will look in vain. I shall want tightly focused comments on the following amendments, and I shall be strict in applying that ruling.
