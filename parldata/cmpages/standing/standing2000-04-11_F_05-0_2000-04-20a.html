<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I beg to move amendment No. 54, in page 2, line 33, leave out `reasonable'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may take amendment No. 55, in page 2, line 43, leave out `reasonably'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I welcome you, Mr. Benton, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills), who was indisposed the other day, to the Committee. We are delighted to have a full ministerial clutch for the first time. Would that I could say the same for my own troops on this occasion and, at present, the Liberal Democrat Benches are not staffed—they obviously get up late and think hard when they get here. It is a jolly good job that some Opposition Members are here—the Bill's passage through Committee might otherwise be speedier than we had anticipated.
<P>
I have no intention of rehashing Tuesday's debates on clauses 2 and 3, which you may feel that you mercifully escaped, Mr. Benton. They were important, useful and constructive debates, but it would be redundant to repeat them, even if it were in order to do so. Before our sitting began, I was asked whether I intended to be reasonable about my amendment, which is about reasonability. I replied that I intended to be reasonably reasonable about it. However, it is important to tease out various issues.
<P>
Clause 3 is about what, for shorthand, we could call adult education. We discussed at length on Tuesday the fact that the duties that are placed on the Learning and Skills Council are less intense in this regard than they are for the education of young persons. The Liberal Democrats encapsulated the issue well, when they were present, by distinguishing between what might loosely be called an entitlement or a demand-led expenditure on young people, and a cash-limited aspiration for the education of older people. In fairness, bearing in mind the track record of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Croydon, North (Mr. Wicks) and many other Committee members, I should not caricature the Government's approach to adult education. We all recognise its importance and seek to realise it by securing the most appropriate wording and the most suitable balance of duties in the Bill.
<P>
The amendment is intended to establish what is reasonable. It is sometimes necessary to stand back from an issue—doing so shows one that what one had previously assumed to be the case was not necessarily so. The clause appears to impose no duties on the Secretary of State. He has general duties for education, but the duties in clauses 2 and 3 relate solely to the council. If my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), who has the advantage of a year or two in age over me, were here, he would remind me of a remark of William Joyce, the late Lord Haw Haw, who features in this morning's newspapers. Apparently, he was tipped off and got out of the United Kingdom, although I am pleased to say that that did not do him a lot of good. During World War Two, which none of us remembers actively, he used to ask: ``Where is the Ark Royal?'' It was sunk, at least metaphorically on Germany's propaganda radio, at least nine times when it was really afloat, although it subsequently perished. [Interruption.] Indeed. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) seeks to assist me in that regard.
<P>
We should reasonably ask: ``Where is the Secretary of State?'' I do not suggest that he or any of his successors will be highly antipathetic to adult education, but that is possible. He might say: ``I do not want to waste my time on that subject. I shall concentrate on schools, which is a subject that commands more votes.'' More legitimately, but perhaps more misguidedly, he might say that greater returns to the public purse could be made if the expenditure were restricted—[Interruption.] I am delighted to welcome the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) to the Committee—he almost made it here in time, and we shall not set him too many lines for his slightly tardy arrival.
<P>
The clause appears to place duties on the council but not on the Secretary of State. I may have overlooked that duty and the Under-Secretary may point out where in the Bill it can be found. If it exists, the Secretary of State will not be able to wash his hands of adult education. If I asked the Under-Secretary what constituted reasonable action by the council, he would probably reply: ``It depends on the circumstances at the time. It will be for the courts to decide whether the council has acted reasonably.'' I should enjoy it if he said that—I am sure that he is already sharpening his pencil in preparation for his answer—and, in a sense, he would be correct.
<P>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will not take it amiss if I say that the tendency these days is very much towards suing people for what they do or do not do and challenging in the courts actions that would previously have been in the domain of the administrative sector. It would be tedious to discuss that at length, although the business of judicial review and the constraint of the Executive by the growth of administrative law is broadly a beneficial tendency, despite the fact that it may occasionally give Ministers sleepless nights and/or disappointment.
<P>
In what circumstances could such an action be undertaken? Someone could come to the courts flippantly, unreasonably or factiously and say: ``I do not think that that is reasonable,'' and the court would have to decide whether that judgement was right. Would there be a test for success or failure?
<P>
The key to the matter lies in subsection (2), to which amendment No. 55 relates. That subsection states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Facilities are reasonable if (taking account of the Council's resources) the facilities are of such a quantity and quality that the Council can reasonably be expected to secure their provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That gives the council a let-out clause in relation to its resources. That is why I asked about the Secretary of State's and the Cabinet's responsibilities. I do not suggest that the present Secretary of State does not want to give money to adult education, but in comprehensive spending reviews, Chancellors of the Exchequer do not always give as much money to spending Departments as those Departments want. The Committee should be clear whether that is an absolute get-out for the council.
<P>
Adult education receives £2 billion. If Ministers collectively decided that subsequent annual expenditure should be £1 billion less than that, there would obviously be a rapid cutback in adult education provision. If that happened, someone might go to the courts to complain that that is unreasonable. This morning, I received a letter about special educational needs from a constituent who complained about a similar issue. If that person sued the council, I wonder whether the people at the council would simply say, ``I am terribly sorry because we would have liked to help, but we do not have the money. The Secretary of State has not given it to us, and that is Parliament's decision.'' Parliament is not subject to the courts, but the Government as the Executive are subject to their ability to convince the House. If the council is to have an absolute get-out for the provision of resources, its duties are, presumably, to use the resources that it has. If that is the case, we need to be clear about it.
<P>
Let us imagine that the council is awarded £2 billion, which is the sort of envelope figure that the Under-Secretary suggested, and completely mismanages its affairs so that it does not provide, or provides highly perversely. For instance, as someone flippantly suggested last week, it might provide for legal education alone and do nothing for other aspects of technical education. It might leave lacunae, geographically, so that some areas of the country are under-resourced and others over-resourced. If the council did anything of that order, I presume that it would be perceived as unreasonable and—in blunt English—not doing its job properly. I suspect that, in that case, a suit in the courts that suggested that it was failing in its duty might be successful. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the import of the words used in the Bill?
<P>
What I have said covers the legal fencing, which is important. Two other issues are involved, however, one of which we have already touched on and one that we shall consider further in our subsequent consideration of the Bill. How does the Under-Secretary propose to deliver adult education funding? The Government have given assurances on the matter in the funding consultation document and in their replies both in the House and another place. They have referred to a two-year guarantee of funding. I understand why Ministers are occasionally leery about committing themselves to a particular pattern of provision; they will nearly always go for flexibility unless there is a good reason not to. However, the hon. Gentleman owes the Committee a clearer explanation as to how the measures will work in practice.
<P>
Most adult and community education provision is delivered through local education authorities and, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is patchy because certain LEAs have failed to accept some of their responsibilities. Those LEAs have just about escaped punishment—at least, I am not aware of one that has fallen foul of a court judgment on its failure to discharge its statutory duties, although that may have occurred. Alongside that provision, safeguarded powers for the Further Education Funding Council are enshrined in the so-called schedule 2 provision for vocational and basic skills education. The hon. Gentleman said that he wants to abolish that distinction and I do not want to canvass for its retention. It was there to safeguard what were regarded as the more important courses, but not to prevent local authorities from doing other than they did. The hon. Gentleman needs to be clearer about how that abolition will work. As I understand it, the money will flow through the Learning and Skills Council and be delivered to the local providers, of which a significant proportion will be related to the local authority.
<P>
We need to be clearer about how the funding stream will work, especially in relation to the guarantee. I remain unclear from what the Under-Secretary said—forgive me if I have misunderstood or overlooked it—about whether the guarantee will bite on the individual local education authority provision, the individual institution or collectively throughout the sector. The degree of specificity will make a difference to how the guarantee will work.
<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
If the Under-Secretary is simply saying that the Government will not sandbag adult education by taking away funding—a couple of billion is involved—and can guarantee that funding will go through the Learning and Skills Council to adult education and that the Secretary of State will provide letters of guidance, for example, at least we shall understand that that is what he means. If he is saying that provision for each LEA and/or further education institution will be maintained for those purposes for a two-year period, we need to know. If he is saying that every course will continue—which I do not necessarily advocate—we need to know that, too. We need to know the flavour of the commitment by sector and by type and to be able to test how it will continue.
<P>
The Under-Secretary has a difficult task. I understand that he does not want to disturb the even flow and wants to smooth any future changes, which is well and good. However, we need to know more about how the system will work, especially as money will go through the Learning and Skills Council to local authorities as providers.
<P>
I sense that the Under-Secretary will be advised to tell us to wait for funding document No. 2. In my more cynical moments—on Thursday mornings it is always important to wake up the Committee—I am reminded of the prospectus for the South Sea Company. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster will advise me of the exact terms used, but I believe that people were invited to subscribe to a south seas operation or enterprise—the same has happened subsequently in relation to dot.com companies—of which further details were to be supplied in due course.
<P>
I am sure that the Under-Secretary will, as is necessary, supply the sector with further details in due course, but we have not received them yet, and the Committee is entitled to at least a dress rehearsal of what he has in mind at this stage. The issues involved are not trivial, because people who provide such commendable activities, whether in the further education sector or the more conventional and familiar adult and community education as delivered by LEAs, need to know where they stand and that the changes will not destabilise them.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman will know that anxiety has been expressed in the sector by organisations such as the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education, which has broadly accepted the principle of the Bill, about whether some turbulence will result and about the quality of the guarantees that he has given.
<P>
The final issue, which I trailed to the Committee as a matter on which we shall want to touch again—the hon. Gentleman might like to give us a dry run—is the balance between local and national institutions in delivering adult education activities, regardless of whether they are vocational. No doubt we shall tease out the matter when we examine the relationship between the national Learning and Skills Council and the local learning and skills councils. Some anxiety has been expressed about whether adequate provision will be made for national organisations and whether their funding and negotiation will involve the LSC or the 47 subordinate local learning and skills councils.
<P>
The Government have announced an integrated structure in which it is pretty clear that the local learning and skills councils will constitute branch activities of the national Learning and Skills Council, albeit with some local decision-making discretion. Ministers may have received representations from, for example, big businesses with a national spread and national training needs, and the national training organisations, expressing their concerns about national provision. The LSC will look at the supply of computer programmers, hairdressers, health and beauty care specialists and so on, and will have a view about what is required. A big business in one of those areas will find it handy to talk to the national Learning and Skills Council to examine how the national training and recruitment requirements can be met, but there will also be local delivery. My impression is that ministers seek to disintermediate decision-making in relation to a number of national organisations with which we are familiar, such as the Pre-School Learning Alliance, which fulfils an important training need for adults. Among the great virtues and blessings of the pre-school learning movement are the facts that its members undergo personal development and are trained to help in the educational process, as part of looking after their own or other children in a co-operative activity. If all such organisations have to go to local councils for funds, there may not be a national overview. There will also be much friction, complication and—dare I say—administrative costs; we are unconvinced by the Minister's figures on the process.
<P>
As I said, that is a dry run of debates we can have on later amendments. To summarise, we need first to know what, if any, duties inhere on the Secretary of State and the Government. Can they be sued for not finding the cash or in other ways failing to resource adult education? Secondly, we need to know the circumstances in which the LSC and its subordinate local learning councils could be tested on whether they are acting reasonably. It would be helpful if the Minister gave an indication of how the clause might bite. Thirdly, there are concerns about the way in which the funding mechanism will work. The more the Minister can tell us at this stage, the more helpful it will be. Finally, there is the issue of the need to strike a balance between on the one hand the funding, supervision and linking of the national organisations, which may have local delivery arms, and the national LSC, and the local councils on the other. The clause provides for a general duty but delivery will be local. The Minister needs to explain what that general duty means, how we will proceed from it and how he approaches the problem of delivery at the coal face, where it matters to the individual learner.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Graham Brady </B>(Altrincham and Sale, West): I shall comment briefly on the amendments. First, a general concern is raised in amendments Nos. 54 and 55 about the safeguard term of ``reasonable'' that the Government use in the Bill to qualify the quantity and quality of provision. The initial requirement, set out in clause 3(1), that the council must secure ``reasonable facilities'' is undermined by subsection (2), which gives a definition of ``reasonable''. It states that facilities are reasonable if they are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of such a quantity and quality that the Council can reasonably be expected to secure their provision.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am worried that that may neuter the whole effect of the clause. Given the budgetary constraints on available funds, quantity and quality are likely to interact in the application and interpretation of the clause. If it were necessary to provide a large quantity of training or adult education, the quality that could reasonably be expected would probably be lower, because the available resources would be spread more thinly in that they would be divided between more people. The application of the duty to provide reasonable quantity may therefore, in certain circumstances, result in the provision of a lower standard of what is considered in the Bill to be reasonable quality. Similarly, if the council were to place the emphasis on a reasonable quality of provision to the local population of a given area, that could have an impact on the quantity of provision.
<P>
My worry about subsection (2) is that it removes most of the meaning of subsection (1). It creates a completely flexible and open-ended environment in which the council will be free to interpret its duties without any meaningful constraint in terms either of quantity or quality. The Bill allows those two factors to interact so as to give total freedom to use one as a reason to diminish the reasonable level of the other. I would welcome a tighter definition from Ministers as to what exactly is reasonable in given circumstances. It is not good enough to say that both quantity and quality must be reasonable. As the Under-Secretary is a reasonable man, I am sure that he accepts that the two requirements interact and will have an impact on each other.
<P>
I want to move on to more specific concerns, one of which is the requirement to take account of facilities whose provision might reasonably be secured by other persons. What is the reasonable expectation, under subsection (3), of what other persons might provide? Employers may reasonably be expected to be involved in the provision of vocational or work-related training—that is often the case—through utilising their own facilities, funding courses provided by colleges of further education, and other mechanisms.
<P>
That leaves massive scope for flexibility in the council's responsibility to provide such services and facilities. It may say: ``It is our reasonable expectation that training courses that have a vocational element and so are of direct value to employers might be provided by employers, and therefore we will not make such provision.'' Again, I would welcome some comment from the Minister.
<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have a final question relating to the provision of reasonable facilities for organised leisure-time occupations connected with such training. Under clause 3(1)(d) the council must secure the provision of reasonable facilities for ``organised leisure-time occupations'', but it does not make it clear what powers or flexibility the council may have to secure that provision. Will the council be required, if all else fails, to purchase and secure its own facilities for the provision of organised leisure-time activities? I am thinking, in particular, about team sports.
<P>
There is a playing field in my constituency, which is a rare commodity now. It is well used by a local sporting club, but the local authority is thinking of disposing it for housing use. If a local authority takes such action, will the LSC be required under clause 3(1)(d) to step in to purchase suitable facilities to make sure that this reasonable provision can be maintained if other agencies fail so to do? It might be a welcome power for the council to have, given the failure of many local authorities in this area, but it would clearly have considerable budgetary implications. I would welcome the Minister's comments on that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): I apologise, Mr. Benton, to you and the Committee for being late. Had I been batting rather than bowling I would have been dismissed under the two-minute rule. I cannot even claim that I thought that you would be inspecting the wicket, given the conditions outside. I regret having missed the beginning of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), given the quality of what I did hear. He said that he had to wake the Committee up at 9 am on a Thursday. I was myself woken up by his reference to the prospectus for the South Sea company, which was ventilated in my constituency, and the particular terms that he described.
<P>
There is a lot of that sort of thing about in my constituency. One of the hazards of being the local Member is that one can wake up on a Thursday morning not knowing precisely what one is going to see in the business pages of the quality dailies. As with the recent losses at Lloyds, the collapse of the South Sea company cast a long shadow over the subsequent economic performance in the constituency at large. Sir Thomas Bond inaugurated Bond street in 1686. It was going extremely well for the first 35 years, but the development of Mayfair collapsed in the 15 years after the South Sea bubble burst because of the effect on the general economy and the people who were funding Mayfair's expansion.
<P>
Fifteen years is a long time. I mentioned on Tuesday that it was 15 years since I was a Minister in the Department whose affairs we are discussing. A great deal of change has occurred in education during that time. If 15 years was a long time in the 1720s, it is worse today.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady) alluded to subsection (2). Perhaps I am being unduly purist, but that provision smacks of tautology. In his notable memoirs, the late Claud Cockburn said that the best things in life are those that turn out as one expects. If he were caught in a snowdrift in the Alps, the mere sight of a St. Bernard would do a great deal for his morale, even if the barrel round the dog's neck did not turn out to contain any cognac. When he first entered the newsroom of The Times, for which he worked despite being a communist, and which he served as a distinguished correspondent, he walked into the sub-editor's room, which satisfied all his expectations. One sub-editor was betting that another could not translate Plato's ``Phaedo'' into Chinese at sight. To settle the bet, one sub-editor was reciting ``Phaedo'' while the other was simultaneously translating it into Chinese.
<P>
Clause 3(2) does not have the arresting value of the unexpected. By way of distinction, I cite the New Oriental hotel in Galle, Sri Lanka—that town is widely thought to be the Tarshish referred to in the affairs of King Solomon. Until she died, the last Dutch resident of Galle—the Dutch ceded Sri Lanka to us in 1796—owned that hotel. Its modest brochure—equivalent to a cricket fixture card—is a single folded piece of cardboard. It says ``The New Oriental Hotel'' on the front, and the back says, ``Room rates are available on request''. That prevents the hotel from ever having to publish its rates. The card's most arresting element is its middle section, which says, ``The New Oriental Hotel is neither new nor oriental''.
<P>
I have introduced the unexpected to reinforce the reference to the vicissitudes of funding imposed by Her Majesty's Treasury on all spending Departments. I apologise for going back into the mists of time, but I must recount a moral tale. I had been Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for a month at the old Department of Education and Science when my noble Friend, Lord Lawson of Blaby, who had been Chancellor of the Exchequer also for—a month, imposed a 1 per cent. cut on all Whitehall budgets after the 1983 general election. That amounted to £23 million in my Department. One may wonder how we ran the Department with £2.3 billion in those days, but we did it.
<P>
One per cent. might have been feasible across the board. The Secretary of State, the late great Sir Keith Joseph, had been in that position before the election, and had squirreled away for the higher education sector not so much a war chest as a reservoir of lubricating oil, which would be made available to Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer and the University Grants Committee to achieve several objectives in universities. The Secretary of State, with admirable decisiveness—slightly uncharacteristically, if I may say so, given the manner with which he could pace the battlements of Elsinore—resolved that the £23 million should come entirely from that reservoir. That decision was a fairly severe shock for the Under-Secretary responsible for higher education, in his first month in office. Therefore, I totally support what my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said about living in an uncertain world. There are vicissitudes in spending, and such contingencies should therefore be covered by the Bill, which will govern what happens if those vicissitudes occur. My hon. Friend has asked reasonable questions, with which my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West also concurs. I give the Minister the benefit of the doubt, which, although a cricketing term of art, should be comprehensible to all Committee members, regardless of their personal past. As my hon. Friend said, the Minister is a reasonable man, and we therefore expect reasonable answers to the reasonable questions that my hon. Friend asked.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Malcolm Wicks):</B> Indeed, this is the age of reason. Sitting here, I sometimes feel that I am in a liberal education class, such is the erudition on a range of matters that are often not related to the Bill. It sometimes feels as if one could not get into the class of one's choice, but one benefits nevertheless. I shall—more tediously—stick to the clause.
<P>
We debated issues relating to the LSC's main duties previously, in the context of amendments to clause 2. As has been recognised, amendment No. 54 is the flip side of that coin, although I am not convinced that it takes the debate further. The main effect of the amendment is to remove the LSC's ability to take account of the public funding available when making decisions about carrying out its duties. Under the current drafting, it can take such matters into account, which is plain common sense. We shall invest considerable new resources in adult learning, as our spending commitments to further education demonstrate. However, it must be recognised that such resources are not unlimited. If the LSC is not permitted to take resources into account in discharging its duty in relation to adults, it will be placed in an impossible position. I appreciate the points that have been made, but the reality is that such a body must be able to take into account the resources available. To put it bluntly, we cannot afford to give a learning entitlement to all 40 million or so individuals who are over the compulsory school age in this country. This part of the Bill recognises that openly and honestly.
<P>
Amendment No. 55 tackles technical matters relating to the nature of reasonableness. It would not help the Committee to perform too many verbal gymnastics about the meaning of the term. I suspect that the hon. Member for Daventry will be more than familiar with the term, because of his experience as a Minister, as will the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. The LSC is a public body, and its decisions may be challenged in the courts, which is the crucial point. If the LSC acts unreasonably, its decisions may be overturned or it may be told to recondider. That will be determined according to the facts of the individual case. That is the safeguard.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, who is bang on cue in terms of what I thought he would want to say. If I am right that a general presumption exists in law that all public bodies should act reasonably, why is it necessary to specify that duty in the clause?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> In determining priorities for post-16 education, it is necessary to make distinctions that confirm our determination to give greater priority to the education of those aged 16 to 19 than to post-19 education. Anybody who considers that the LSC has acted unreasonably will be able to approach the Secretary of State, and ask him to intervene using his powers of direction under clause 25. The use of the word ``reasonable'' is entirely appropriate in the context of the LSC's main duties. As I said in relation to amendment No. 54, the LSC will have access only to finite resources. That is why it must be able to take account of the resources available to it, when fulfilling its duty to secure learning provision for adults.
<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for reminding us about the clause under which the Secretary of State can receive complaints about the conduct of the council. Will he confirm that if the Government were to blame, there would be no legal sanction in relation to the amount of resources made available to the LSC? It would be a political sanction. It would not be open to a disaffected person to say that there was not enough money for adult education. The council would then say that it did not have enough money and attack that person in the courts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Secretary of State has overall responsibility for education and employment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is a political measure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Yes. The Secretary of State will issue guidance to the Learning and Skills Council. His first letter of guidance will be a critical document that will emphasise the importance of adult and community education. The Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament and Parliament is accountable to the people.
<P>
Clause 3(2) defines when facilities are reasonable. It is only common sense that that definition relates to facilities that the LSC can reasonably be expected to secure. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster said that that was a circular definition. We disagree. Subsection (2) amplifies the meaning of reasonable facilities as facilities that the LSC can reasonably be expected to secure given the limits on the resources available to it. It also makes available an objective test in that, ultimately, a court of law could decide whether the LSC was right about how much it could reasonably be expected to do with its finite resources.
<P>
We were urged by the hon. Member for Daventry to give the Secretary of State such explicit powers in the Bill. If we had done so, the hon. Gentleman­who, like other Opposition members need not be too consistent on such matters­would have accused us of control freakery and having a top-down approach. We are establishing the learning and skills councils because of our commitment to post-16 education and training. We will create that new entity because of our commitments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am pleased that the Minister, in the context of control freakery, admitted a few moments ago that the Secretary of State has such powers of direction under clause 25. In other words, the Secretary of State will be taking over all the powers as a fully fledged control freak would do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Given that we are talking about a crucial aspect of public policy and taxpayers' money to the tune of some £6 billion a year, Parliament should have some authority over it. The Secretary of State is always accountable to Parliament. It would be extraordinary if money was allocated and the Secretary of the State and Parliament had no control over it. How we undertake our affairs is just plain common sense.
<P>
We shall have opportunities later to explore other matters that have been raised, such as the powers of local learning and skills councils. We want the LSC to be strong at the centre as well as in the locality. It is a distortion of the facts and of our intentions to say that the local learning and skills council is some kind of branch office. That is not the case. I emphasise that because we are now in the process, through advertisement, of encouraging men and women from a range of sectors including business to apply to become members of their local learning and skills councils. Frankly, much of the success of that policy will depend on our attracting able people from different walks of life.
<P>
Therefore, I am not prepared to listen to the hon. Member for Daventry suggest that the local learning and skills councils are branch offices. If such a suggestion discourages the talent that we need, it will be bad news and will be an irresponsible act on his part. The councils will have major responsibility for the successful implementation of policy. There will be a 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. discretion in terms of their use of funding. More significantly, they will have power over 100 per cent. of the budget of the LSC. There will be clear directions from the national council and the Secretary of State about the need for the LSC to provide adult, community and 16-to-19 education, but how they will be discharged will be in the hands of the local learning and skills councils.
<P>
Unlike the situation under the training and enterprise councils to which the previous regime were so committed, business men, business women and others in the community will be enabled to have a say, nationally and locally, about the £6 billion for post-16 education and training. We need able people to help us face the challenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I will respond to the general issue later. The Minister made it clear that local learning and skills councils will have responsibility for the local discharge of the obligation to spend on adult education. If they fail or are unsatisfactory in some respect, can a disgruntled elector approach the courts by attacking the national council for the local council's dereliction of responsibility? Who is to blame? Who can be sued?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> Disgruntled constituents could take the Learning and Skills Council to court and argue the case about the unreasonableness of the situation. That is a strong statement, and we are at a delicate time in the public presentation of the policy. I may have been unkind to the hon. Gentleman; I am sure that he does not want us to be knocked off course by attempts to play silly politics with an important public policy.
<P>
The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West properly took the opportunity to raise a local matter. The LSC, nationally and locally, would not be in the business of purchasing any facility, land or building. Its task is to ensure provision, and it will work through schools, sixth form colleges, further education colleges and other providers of facilities. It will not purchase playing fields.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Although I am pursuing a matter of local interest, it has a wider read-across. Given that the council has a duty to secure such provision and if the remaining facilities are subject to disposal by the current provider—in this instance, the local authority—how can the council fulfil those obligations? Under the Bill, it can fulfil them only by taking direct steps itself to secure facilities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The Learning and Skills Council will not be in the business of purchasing direct facilities for itself, but it will be responsible for securing facilities for education, training and leisure-time activities. If, for whatever reason, the relevant institutions fail to provide such facilities, the council will be required to find a provider. The hon. Gentleman will understand that I am not as familiar as he is with his patch, so I cannot develop the point much further.
<P>
I hope that we have dealt with the matter as best we can at this stage, without being tempted down the path of unreasonably long discussions about the word ``reasonable'', and I hope that the hon. Member for Daventry will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> We have been doing quite well and the Under-Secretary retains the style, if not the substance, of reasonability, but his reply was rather unsatisfactory. We are teasing out the implications of the legislation in a crab-wise fashion, and some of the little progress that we have made has, for various reasons, caused me concern.
<P>
I do not seek to caricature what the hon. Gentleman said on this or other matters, but it is clear that, under the clause, the Secretary of State will have no legal responsibility for securing the provision of resources. That responsibility will be the council's, and is heavily diluted by the provisions in subsection (2), which have regard to the resources available to the council. Although there may be theoretical access to the courts, it is unlikely that an action against the council would succeed if the council could cite a lack of resources by way of defence. If a disgruntled person wished to proceed with the matter, he or she would have to make a political case and attack the Secretary of State in Parliament, rather than the courts. That point needs to be—and now is—clearly understood, but it perhaps leads to an unsatisfactory conclusion. I should have thought that the Secretary of State had general duties in respect of the provision of education. Those duties appear not to be testable in the courts.
<P>
Interestingly, a somewhat separate matter arises in relation to clause 2, to which I shall briefly return. As there is no let-out clause in respect of resources, and because previous discussions made it clear that young persons are entitled to education, the council will be responsible—and suable—if that entitlement is not met. That may be of some comfort.
<P>
I was particularly disappointed to discover that, yet again, we have no details of the way in which the adult education funding package and the guarantee that Ministers have been anxious to discuss will be delivered. I do not understand where the money will come from, the basis on which it will be grouped and reallocated, or the implications for individual institutions, whether within the two-year guarantee period or subsequently. The explanation must be that the Under-Secretary is unable to provide that information at the moment. If I may pursue my earlier analogy, which was also pursued by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster, we might say that the South Sea bubble remains unpricked, or that Pandora's box has yet to be opened.
<P>
We shall continue to test this matter and we await the funding package document mark two. However, giving assurances and guarantees without the small print to back them is unsatisfactory.

<P>

<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The guarantee that we gave was to the local education authority. We cannot guarantee a history class here or a fine art class there. We witnessed a decline in adult and community education under the previous Government, but we shall see it increase under our Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for that elucidation. Will the Minister say what guarantee he gave to the LEA? Was it that the funding will remain unchanged, or something more specific?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> It was that the funding for that period will remain unchanged.
<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I want to talk about the local learning and skills councils. I realise that this is a precursor to subsequent debates. The Minister at first seemed to suggest, but then thought better of it, that I had, perhaps improperly—I am sorry to use a phrase that resonates from our debates on clause 2—decided to have a go at local learning and skills councils. I am sure that he does not wish to suggest—and nor do I—that they are not important and do not have a role. It will be the Committee's duty to discuss what that roll will be. If I came across a suitable person locally, I would readily encourage him to put his name forward in response to the Minister's advertisement. No member of the Committee has the slightest wish for the councils to fail through a lack of personnel. However, it is not yet clear how much discretion they will have. What we do know suggests that they will have rather less discretion than is appropriate to get the big hitters locally to take an active part. The Minister may demonstrate—and I shall be happy to help him—that LLSCs genuinely have a role that will become enhanced so that they can increasingly become involved in the business of delivering, and informing the national council about how to fund and deliver, education. But we shall return to this issue.
<P>
A point that came through explicitly was the question of the suability of the local councils and the national council under clause 3. I understood the Minister to say that the national council would be responsible and, by implication, that any deficiency in local delivery could be attacked in the courts by means of a suit against the national council—which, in turn, has certain implications for the degree of local councils' autonomy. I do not want to bandy words with the Minister. It was interesting to have had that exchange at this stage.
<P>
The Minister also said—I take it that this is the implied answer to my fourth question about the difficult relationship between national interest institutions and local institutions—that the LSC was not in the business of purchasing direct facilities for itself. In other words, the whole of the front line will be in the local learning and skills councils, acting under direction and with funding—the Committee is broadly familiar with such a system. If that is so, the only inference I can make from our preliminary exchanges on national interest institutions is that the LSC will not take any interest, and that everything will be delivered by the local learning and skills councils. That is a recipe for Balkanisation, which may not help the national institutions or the designated colleges, which are the subject of another amendment.
<P>
There is a great deal more work to be done on the Bill to deal with these issues but what I have heard from the Minister so far has been disappointing. We have not had answers to reasonable questions, and those that we were given were less than satisfactory. For that reason, I advise my hon. Friends to persist with the amendment and to press it to a vote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I apologise for entering the debate after my hon. Friend, but the Minister took me to task for implying that there was a tautology in clause 3(2).
<P>
In earlier sittings, the Government made frequent reference to a supposed lack of investment by previous Government. When I served as a Minister in the Department of Education and Science, the departmental budget was £2.3 billion. That appears a modest sum in comparison with the sums available to the present Government, largely due to inflation, but that £2.3 billion was inherited from the previous Labour Government, who saw it as the appropriate working capital for education when they left office in 1979. We also inherited from that same Government a 12.5 per cent. annual rate of admissions to higher education. Only one in eight of 18-year-olds went into higher education. For these over 18 years, we transformed that rate into 30 per cent., or three in 10.
<P>
As I said, resources were £2.3 billion in 1983, but it is difficult to work out how substantial the facilities covered in clause 3 would have been in relative terms. I acknowledge that all those facilities might not have been provided with the relative share of £2.3 billion.
<P>
I recognise that clause 3 is timeless. It could have occurred, for example, in the Forster Education Act 1870. We must come back to the words in the clause. Seventeen years before the South Sea company prospectus was issued, the poetess, the fair Orinthia, said of the coronation of Queen Anne:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The sun shone in parentheses—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a classic way of describing the English weather. The clause includes several parentheses. Frankly, the Minister's entire argument hangs on the second parenthesis in subsection (2):
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(taking account of the Council's resources).<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister rebuked me for suggesting that clause 3(2) had a tautological element, but it does. Everything hangs on the reference to resources. If that were the only duty on the Department or on the Learning and Skills Council, there would not be a problem: that timeless phrase would be inscribed in a lapidary manner and would stand the test of time. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry said, there are other pressures on the Department and the Learning and Skills Council. I apologise if that sounds circular, but if I have been circular, it is the fault of the wording of the provision.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Minister was generous in giving way during his speech. Unfortunately, to borrow a phrase from the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn), he came to a complete stop before I had the opportunity to raise this concern. I shall attempt to be brief.
<P>
Local discretion in the learning and skills councils is important. Will the Minister clarify what he would consider to be ``reasonable'' provision for such councils, and can he give the Committee some guidance about the parameters of reasonableness for provision in local areas? A learning and skills council might have to provide for the industrial area of Broad Heath, in my constituency, and for Trafford Park, just a few miles away in the constituency of the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend also pass on to the Under-Secretary our concerns about not only the quantity, but the quality of provision? That might also be relevant, because, as the hon. Gentleman has said, local learning and skills councils will be responsible for local delivery.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I agree absolutely. I hope that the Under-Secretary can reassure us that there will be equality of provision within the area covered by each local learning and skills council and that a similar measure of reasonableness, in terms of both quantity and quality, will be applied across the area.
<P>
I will illustrate for the hon. Gentleman the reasons why such concerns are so significant to those of us who represent constituencies that some in the media would describe as ``Middle Britain''. At the last election, people in constituencies such as mine were led to believe that, if they voted for the Labour party, resources for the national health service would be increased. They were not told that the formulae for the allocation of resources in the NHS would be changed so that there would be less provision in areas such as mine and that the provision would be shifted to other areas. My constituents—and many others—are, very reasonably, concerned that such powers of discretion can be used or abused in such a way as to channel resources towards some areas and away from others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall respond briefly to the last point. The work of the Learning and Skills Council will be directed by the legislation. The clauses that we have been discussing are crucial in guiding the work of the learning and skills councils. Matters of quality and quantity must be properly balanced. The first task of the local learning and skills councils will be to assess local needs. We are talking about need and demand, not existing supply. The councils will consider the needs of the local community. That is the key point. Individual needs will vary within the 16-to-19 group and so on, but there will be fairness in provision. However, it would be proper for a learning and skills council to give greater priority to an adult who lacks basic skills—cannot read or write or do numbers—than to a highly educated individual. That is just an example, but there is no attempt to discriminate on some absurd geographical basis between one constituency and another.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I hope that this will take less of the Committee's time. These are probing amendments on the designated institutions under section 28 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The Minister will remember that I was not responsible for the passage of that Act through Parliament—I have no apology to make because it was an excellent Act—so I was not party to the discussions at that time. Even in my subsequent ministerial experience, I did not spend a great deal of time considering the problems of the designated institutions. Nevertheless, it is important that the Committee should get some further appreciation from the Under-Secretary of his intentions as to these institutions. That is the purpose of this group of amendments.
<P>
The matter has become a little more intense because the hon. Gentleman has already told the Committee that it is not the business of the LSC to have regard to the funding of particular institutions. The logic of what he has said is that the designated institutions will be funded by the local learning and skills councils, so everything will come through the front door and nothing will be reserved for the national level. That may be a defensible position, and I should like the Minister to explain what is in his mind, but it has undoubtedly given rise to concern in the sector.
<P>
It is fair to say that there is rather less concern in voluntary sixth form colleges and rather more in the designated colleges, including those in London. The Under-Secretary is a London Member and I appreciate that there may be greater concern in London because, unlike most parts of the country, the metropolis, which arguably functions as a whole, is split into five local learning and skills areas for reasons that I am not contesting at this point. Although many of the students of the designated colleges are drawn from a wider area, their relationship will be with a particular local learning and skills council.
<P>
There were some exchanges in the other place on this matter and initially the Government got off on the wrong foot. NIACE's comments on the quality of the Government's response to probing amendments in Committee were uncharacteristically censorious. I am not making a qualitative judgment, but if NIACE is upset, that usually suggests that there is a problem or an insensitivity. It is not impossible to give assurances that are reasonably satisfactory and it is important that they should be given.
<P>
These institutions were designated for direct funding for reasons that were recognised by the Committee that discussed the matter eight years ago. One of the reasons may well have been either the traditions of the institution or the fact that the geographic coverage of its student body is a little different from that of a local institution that is embraced by a particular local learning and skills council. For example, the City Literary Institute is a designated college that has expressed specific concerns to me. Its history would bear reading out, but I shall not do so in full. It was established 81 years ago as one of five literary institutes with the commendable purpose of bringing adult education to the people. It went through various changes and the City Lit, as it became known, having been funded by the Inner London Education Authority until its demise, is the remaining such institution. It does a tremendous job with a large number of enrolments—pushing 50,000 a year, which is a large involvement of people.
<P>
Those institutions see themselves as wider in scope than a single local learning and skills council. They would need assurances about the future arrangements for their continued success. I am sure that the Minister does not want to subvert them, but we do not want to create that condition accidentally. They are not merely institutions in the sense of buildings on the ground. That also applies to the Workers' Educational Association, which is extremely important. I think that all members of the Committee respect that. We must tease out a little more clearly how such institutions will be funded and how the national elements of their work will be expressed.
<P>
I will return to arguments that I floated in our debates on previous amendments, to which the Minister did not respond. The situation goes wider again because there are national institution activities, such as the Pre-school Learning Alliance, that the Government are happy to support for public purposes, even though they are not designated institutions. It must be clear whether provision will be secured nationally or locally, or what the relationship between the two will be.
<P>
I have no template or final view about how best provision should be secured. It is important that Ministers consider the matter and propose a scheme that is acceptable to colleges and other institutions, so that they can fulfil their duties. I am sure that all members of the Committee want them to do that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> In responding to the amendments I will start by clarifying the fact that clause 3 sets out the LSC's duty in respect of adult learners. It is concerned not with providers, but with the needs of the individual learner. Clauses 15, 21 and 22 deal with the national and local planning required of the national and local LSCs.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry is concerned about the position of the designated institutions that provide for adults. As he may know, the Bill provides for the LSC to fund all further education, not just the more formal learning that leads directly or indirectly to recognised qualifications, as listed in schedule 2 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. That can only benefit the adult designated colleges that will have the opportunity to develop and build on their existing work. Those specialist colleges do an important and significant job for adult learners, often those adults in most need of support. We recognise and value their contribution to further education.
<P>
Institutions such as the City Lit, Morley college and the Mary Ward centre in London have long traditions of working with adults, and we value that. Indeed, I met representatives of those institutions on 13 March and was interested in their perspective and ideas for the future.
<P>
Officials from my Department met the governing body of the City Literary institute even more recently on 28 March. We have a clear commitment to the future of such institutions and have listened to their concerns and aspirations. Clearly, all the colleges are doing a lot of excellent work.
<P>
Another example is the WEA, which is a large national provider of adult education with a clear mission, values and strategic objectives. It will shortly celebrate its hundredth birthday, having been founded, I think, in 1902.
<P>
To digress, when I was a young academic at York university many years ago, I was persuaded to venture into the territory of adult education. I was asked to prepare a sociology course to be delivered at an institution in Tadcaster—a town that hon. Members might know for other reasons. Although I was not and am not a sociologist, I nevertheless rose to the occasion, remembering the inspiration of the great democratic socialist Tawney, who was a great friend of the WEA. I prepared thoroughly—a useful lesson for the Committee—and ventured out on the bus to Tadcaster. I sat in the school on a dark, wet evening until 8 o'clock, the designated hour. No one arrived. Eventually, a little man on a bicycle rode up, looked at me—he did not seem very impressed—looked around at the empty classroom, announced himself as the WEA organiser and said, ``I told them sociology in Tadcaster wouldn't take off''. I tell that story because, although I am a visionary when it comes to adult education, I know that its practical implementation is sometimes challenging.
<P>
A shining example is the Northern College of Residential and Adult Education. I was pleased to see that a recent inspection report highlighted its excellent provision, dedicated governors and staff and excellent support for students. Those institutions are examples of the valuable role of the specialist adult designated colleges. There are, of course, many more colleges, all of which provide excellent work with adults, many of whom are disadvantaged. The sector would be poorer without them. The position of those colleges and others will be at least as secure as it is now. Indeed, they should have considerable opportunities to expand their provision now that we have removed the artificial schedule 2, non-schedule 2 divide. The LSC will be able to offer funding for a variety of education and training programmes that those organisations are well placed to deliver.
<P>
The amendments attempt to secure the position of a small group of institutions, which we fully recognise are a valuable part of the sector. However, it is not necessary to protect their position in the new arrangements. The institutions are an important part of the provision to be funded by the LSC and will remain a constituent part of the further education sector. The LSC and local councils must have regard to the work that they do because the LSC will need to fund the provision that they make to carry out its duties.
<P>
We are consulting on financial arrangements. Some of the institutions are national and some cover the population of greater London while also serving a wider area of commuters. We want to establish sensible arrangements, which might include funding from the national LSC. It is a matter of common sense and practical detail. We have not singled out any other category of colleges in the sector and it would be wrong to single out that group.
<P>
I am aware that we are debating a probing amendment, but I am surprised that the hon. Member for Daventry wants to provide for top-down control over what the LSC and local councils could do. He and his party usually argue against such control. No reasonable body with duties to provide further education could sensibly ignore those institutions. Their place as a group is safe. Indeed, given our policy objectives, they have a flourishing future. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that we are concerned about the future of those institutions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Anecdote and wit are the lubricants of the Committee. The Minister has amply deployed both in his response, so I shall give it a warmer welcome than I might have given to previous exchanges.
<P>
I am considerably reassured by what I take to be a pragmatic approach to the general funding of national interest institutions. I wanted to hear the Minister say that he would be prepared to consider national funding or a national understanding or arrangement if that were the most appropriate course of action. This is not a matter of top-down or bottom-up theology; it is matter of what works. If institutions are content to rely on what can be managed administratively through the national or local arrangements as appropriate, I am happy for that to happen.
<P>
The Minister said that he and his officials are in touch with those designated institutions, particularly adult colleges, that have expressed some concern about the matter. I hope that that will lead to a fruitful conclusion; it has already produced some first fruits of understanding. People at such institutions will no doubt have the opportunity to read the report of our proceedings, and will be able to come back to Committee members if they are dissatisfied, but we are proceeding along the right lines.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I seek the Minister's advice on a point of elucidation as a result of some exchanges in the other place about governance and designated institutions. Governance is not the same as funding, although the two are closely connected. Is it the Government's intention that the provision in section 28 of the 1992 Act, about the designation of institutions, will remain in force? Is that provision necessary for reasons of governance, notwithstanding that, as the Minister said, it will not be necessary for reasons of funding, as a result of the removal of the schedule 2, non-schedule 2 distinction? In other words, will we continue to have designated colleges or are they no longer needed, and if not, why not?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> The answer is yes, we shall continue to have designated institutions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Allan </B>(Sheffield, Hallam): I did not wish to speak to the earlier amendments, but it is worth briefly returning to some of the key issues in clause 3, which is an important clause.
<P>
Clause 3 relates to educational provision for those over the age of 19. As we have already said, we favour a stronger entitlement to educational provision rather than the somewhat weak provision in clause 3. I draw the Committee's attention in particular to clause 3(1)(a), which refers to education other than higher education. There seems to be a stronger entitlement to higher education at level 4 than at levels 2 and 3. Historically, that has been the situation, and we do not see how the Bill changes that. I can see that the provisions in clause 3 for those over the age of 19 are wide in scope.
<P>
At one end of the spectrum is the situation that we fear; that because the budget is cash limited, such provision would face severe squeezes, especially if learning and skills councils tend to direct their funds, quite properly, to the priority group identified in clause 2. That could have the unfortunate effect of squeezing clause 3 provision, so that people who wish to learn are denied access to courses on the basis of cost to an extent that would be unhelpful. At the other end of the spectrum, we believe that much could be done to create effective entitlements, even if they are not enshrined in law. Provision should be set up in such a way that, just as individuals expect to gain a place on a higher education course if they have the appropriate qualifications although they do not have a strict entitlement to it, they can reasonably expect the same to apply in the further education sector.
<P>
There are other methods of funding, however. The fact that people may have a reasonable expectation of receiving funding does not necessarily mean that those who are in employment, and who have other means of funding, would necessarily receive the entire cost of the course. Therefore, the state need not necessarily fund the entire cost of courses, but by levying charges appropriately on individuals and employers in addition to state provision, a broad range of options could be provided under clause 3. I hope that that is the Government's intention, and that those over 19 will generally be assisted in that by the learning and skills councils, although they may want to recover the costs from employers and individuals where possible.
<P>
We understand that the Scottish Executive is considering a framework for the further education sector that would be more closely comparable with that of the higher education sector in England and Wales and in Scotland, so that means testing is used to decide who pays what, but the state makes a contribution to further education fees, which has not happened traditionally. The Scottish Executive proposals will be interesting. The disparity in expectations with respect to further and higher education models should be reduced. Higher and level 4 education is often perceived as more of an entitlement than further education, which is often cheaper and more relevant to people in disadvantaged circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I shall be brief, because I have spoken at some length to the amendments. I broadly associate myself with the remarks of the hon. Member for Hallam. The sector is important for lifelong learning and reskilling in adult employment. It relates to basic skills deficiencies, which the Minister has mentioned, and to progressive improvement in the work force. Also—and in saying this I welcome the lifting of the schedule 2 distinction—it affects the wider horizons that are of great importance to personal development and may eventually affect people's contribution to the economy.
<P>
The establishment of a duty to provide reasonable facilities does not preclude the charging of reasonable fees. We do not ask for a ticket for free adult education, but there should be more adult education, with a charge that is appropriate in all the circumstances. We shall return to that matter, but I hope that the Minister will confirm that common objective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wicks:</B> I shall be brief, because we have scrutinised the clause thoroughly in debating the amendments. Notwithstanding our discussion about balancing young people's needs for education and training against the needs of the adult population, and notwithstanding our argument, which we feel strongly about, that the needs of the young should take precedence, the Government are committed to lifelong learning, much of which is for people over 19. That is why we take work force development seriously, and why we want to challenge a culture in which after the age of 19 people are expected to forget about education or training. We all understand that in the modern economy many of us will need to re-educate, re-equip, retrain or re-skill ourselves quite often in our careers, and that successful companies will understand that and take it seriously. The clause is important because of that.
<P>
The Government also take seriously the special responsibilities to people with learning difficulties and understand that those do not end when a young person is 19 or 20. We feel passionately about the need for adult and community education. There has been a long tradition of adult education in this country, by which many people from working-class backgrounds have acquired skills and knowledge, together with confidence and self-esteem, which are equally important. That task remains. I am encouraged when I visit different parts of the country to see the way in which adult and community education now seems increasingly to be delivered where it is needed in those communities. It is no longer a case, if ever it was, of requiring people to get on three buses to go to an institution called an FE college.
<P>
We need to be innovative in the way in which we deliver adult and community education. We feel strongly about that, and part of the challenge for the Government and for our country is to translate notions of lifelong, or life-cycle, learning and training into practical reality. There is much good experience on which to draw, from many different quarters. I hope that hon. Members will support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I shall be brief, and I respond very warmly to what the Minister has said. I quoted earlier from the memoirs of Claud Cockburn. When he had completed his time at Oxford, he went to say goodbye to his tutor, who sent him on his way with the memorable words: ``Up to now, Cockburn, your life has been punctuated by examinations, but from here on out you've got a clear run through to the grave''. That reflects the view that the Minister put forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I wonder whether my right hon. Friend might like to recall the words of my former tutor at that establishment who, on hearing the bells of Magdalen college ringing for his election as a fellow of the college was told very solemnly by the porter, ``You mark those bells well, Mr. Stevens, because next time they ring for you, you won't be here to hear them.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend.
<P>
I particularly appreciated the resonance and clarity of the Minister's declaration, about not only adult education but lifelong learning. I am happy that there seems to be a unanimous view in Committee about this issue, and it would be wrong for any other impression to be given. Despite the fact that we have made some mischief with the wording of the Bill, the basic point remains.
<P>
The Minister referred to his experiences in Tadcaster. We all know that Neil Kinnock made his career in the Workers' Educational Association before he entered the House. I have felt no need to declare an interest, not least because the provisions do not relate directly to me. However, after my father had spent a year immediately after schools at Oxford teaching philosophy while his tutor had a sabbatical, he spent the following year in an adult education settlement in the Rhondda. That settlement was visited by the equivalent of the Secretary of State, who lured my father into the Conservative research department on its foundation and effectively decided the whole of his subsequent career. Adult education has, therefore, played a significant role in my father's life and in mine.
<P>
The Japanese take the view that everyone will need to be retrained eight times during their working life. That is a discipline to which we have not yet subjected ourselves in this country. It is absolutely right that a clarion call should go out from this Committee that we are universally in agreement with what the Minister has said, and that he is supported by the Committee as a whole.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`appropriate to their needs'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> This is the last of the general duties clauses in the Bill. It is particularly short, which may have some resonances on the other side of the Committee. I have sought to assist new Labour by suggesting the deletion of part of it. I am obviously proceeding entirely along modernisation lines. However, in case the proposal in the amendment should be misconstrued, I would say to the Minister that we have no intention of implying that individuals should not be encouraged to undergo post-16 education and training. It may be helpful if I go through the words individually and explain what was in my mind when I tabled this probing amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A spirit of eloquence characterised the exchanges between the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster at the conclusion of the stand part debate on clause 3. We all attach great importance to post-16 and continuing education. That is not an issue between us. Students need to understand that they are part of an historic continuum and a phrase that I often use in the more unlikely places that I sometimes visit—for example, when giving lectures at further education colleges—is that of the Greek law-giver Solon who said that he grew old always learning something. That should remind adult learners today that education has a continuous history and a proud record extending over two and a half millennia. Of course we want to encourage individuals to undertake education and training. The problem is how we do that and the nature of the duties to be secured under the Bill.
<P>
I told the Committee that in probing the matter, I was minded to go through the words in sequence. I shall begin with the word ``encourage''. I should like to know whether that is an active or passive duty. The Minister will be familiar, sadly, with the circumstances with which all ministers become familiar, and sometimes cynical, when corresponding with their colleagues in this place, often having to conclude letters with the phrase, ``I am sorry to send such a disappointing reply, but I am bound by the provisions of the statute.''
<P>
The Minister set an admirable example of encouragement to the Committee and suggested that individuals could be fired up if the council said that it wanted adults to be educated, so come and join. I have no objection to that, but if the council has a general duty to encourage, we need to know who would be likely to succeed in a suit against it for breach of its general duty. Will the council have to be active in its encouragement and go around saying, ``Please join us here and now'', or will it be a passive duty not actively to discourage individuals from pursuing post-16 education and training? How will it work?
<P>
I am reminded of Lord Emsworth in P. G. Wodehouse who, at a particularly awkward juncture, was described as being not exactly disgruntled, but very far from being gruntled. The Minister should tell us what encouragement means and what discouragement might mean, because the matter could end up in the courts, although neither he nor I want it to do so.
<P>
The second word, which gives me most concern, is ``individuals''. It should not, because the central point of education and training is that it is made available to or it is inspired and fired up in the individual. I have no objection to the concept. Indeed, I shall give one more reference from antiquity to the Committee. People might think, for example, that the Romans were control freaks, as well as stuffy, and, again in unlikely places, I often fall back on the comment of the Roman educationist, Quintilian, who said that the maximum respect is due to the child. In fact, he used the word ``reverentia'' and referred to a sacred quest for education. We want to encourage individuals, but, to return to the world of legal duties, the Minister needs to explain to the Committee what ``encouraging individuals'' means. We have considered whether it means not discouraging, but in the Bill it could be interpreted as meaning that the council must run round frantically identifying all 40 million potential adult learners as individuals and encourage them to enrol. To be realistic, that will not happen, but the Minister must explain how the duty will be discharged.
<P>
We do not want to discourage people. As we said in the debates on clause 3, reasonable resources must be provided, but what does it mean to state that the council has a duty to encourage? I cannot believe that it relates to the individual. However, it would be unfortunate if an individual could sue the council, saying that he or she had been discouraged by the action of the council, its officials or a provider financed by the council.
<P>
The Bill probably enshrines a feeling about groups of individuals, ensuring that no one should feel left out or be overlooked, whether they have special educational needs, are interested in learning a foreign language, or want to pick up a manual skill. However, it would be helpful if the Minister would clarify the matter.
<P>
Is the word ``undergo'' appropriate? It is somewhat depressing, rather like a cruel and unusual punishment or torture. ``Undertake'' would be better, or more neutral.
<P>
Amendment No. 57 would delete subsection (a), which includes the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>post-16 education and training.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I repeat the offer that I made as a Minister seven years ago, which has not been taken up but which remains open, to make a modest donation of a prize of £1 sterling to anyone who can come up with a better phrase than the hateful ``16 to 19''. Some of us have children who have now gone through the teenage years; others may be blessed with children of that age, but I have never gone up to anyone and said, with any plausibility, ``You are a 16 to 19-year-old learner.'' The Minister may like to commission a competition with an even larger prize to find a better phrase, and I may hazard an entry.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gordon Marsden </B>(Blackpool, South): I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman. He is right about the issue; is not this an appropriate occasion to use a focus group?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I have not the slightest objection to using a focus group; perhaps the Committee could collaborate and we could have an all-party focus group, which would break new ground.
<P>
The phrase in the cIause is rebarbative and needs attention. My suggestions are rather lame and, dare I say it, a bit new Labour, rather like ``new beginners'' or ``career initiatives'' and so on. I do not have the answer, but between us we should come up something.
<P>
We should pause over the more substantive and serious matter of what is meant by ``post-16 education and training''. That may seem somewhat circular, because I presume that the phrase means education and training for persons over the age of 16, but I make a serious point, which would have been discussed if another amendment had been selected.
<P>
Arrangements for the further education sector are set out in the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The sector is broadly defined as including further education corporations, colleges and designated colleges. In due course, all post-16 education and training will be funded through the Learning and Skills Council and the local learning and skills councils, a balance being struck between them.
<P>
Later clauses refer to the further education sector, which will no longer be funded by the Further Education Funding Council. I am not sure that the Bill provides an adequate anchor for defining the further education sector. If there is one, I am not aware of it. The Minister should reflect on whether the sector should be defined by reference to earlier legislation.
<P>
I am not setting a trap; the Minister need not respond to the matter now, other than to say that he will reflect on it, but I am genuinely worried that the Bill will not give the right cover in subsequent references to the further education sector. That is not intended to detract from the measure; it does not suggest that the further education sector will cease to exist, but it will move into a new mode which includes other providers, and it needs a clear legal base.
<P>
We could have a useful debate on virtually all the words in the terse expression of general duties under subsection (a). I trailed the fact that I wanted to consider the tension between subsections (a) and (b) and look at them together; amendment No. 77 proposes that education should be appropriate to the needs of individuals, which might seem inconsistent with the proposal to delete the subsection.
<P>
Presumably, Ministers intend the learning and skills councils to provide education that is appropriate to individuals, but the concerns and interests of employers must be taken into account. Ministers say that they want the local councils to be informed by the views of employers, learning partnerships and others. Only yesterday, a personal friend who is the chief executive of one of the training and enterprise councils told me that employers, LLSCs and others may think that a particular kind of training or education is appropriate given the needs of the labour market. However, that may be entirely at odds with the wishes and aspirations of individuals. If push came to shove, I would probably say that in that case some regard should be given to the interests of individuals and what they want to do, not least because I am not a great fan of labour market planning.
<P>
I spoke on Second Reading about the dangers of the prescriptive approach that said, ``There are 85 hairdressers in this LLSC area and if you want an 86th place, you will have to do it on your own.'' It is not possible to work like that, but Ministers must understand the tension between the needs and aspirations of individuals and the concerns of employers to meet labour market needs. The process must provide for juggling individuals' demands with market and supply constraints and strike a balance.
<P>
The Minister must explicate the various terms and explain how they will work in a legal context. He must also tease out the relationship between the needs and aspirations of the individual and the perceived needs of local business and the economy, and say how the two will be reconciled. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere will speak to the next amendment and consider the implications of the Minister's response.

<P>

<B>Mr. Allan:</B> I am pleased that the hon. Member for Daventry described the amendment as a form of textual analysis rather than an attempt to remove the important duty in the clause. In a classic ``South Park'' episode, one of the characters—I suspect it was Cartman—informs us that school sucks. That attitude is widespread and forms an important background to the notion of encouraging education and training for post-16s. Many youngsters lose interest in education, often between the ages of 13 and 15, and by the time we are trying to pick them up at 16, they have a negative attitude to any form of education, be it school or college. The council should be responsible for trying to overcome that and encouraging people back into the system. Subsection (a) states that the council needs simply to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encourage individuals to undergo post-16 education and training<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 103, which talks about service and support for 13 to 19-year-olds, gives a different definition:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may provide or secure the provision of services which he thinks will encourage, enable or assist (directly or indirectly) effective participation by young persons in education or training.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That sets out a separate duty for those identified by the Secretary of State as the target group: the socially disadvantaged group of 170,000 or so young people to whom we have repeatedly referred throughout our proceedings.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I encourage the Government to strengthen the requirement given in subsection (a). The stipulation that the council should encourage individuals to undergo education is important but retaining young people's interest in and supporting them through such education and training is also essential. The clause refers to what I understand as the advertising and marketing function of the LSC to get young people into education, but not—unlike clause 103—to a more comprehensive function in regard to the identified target group. There are colleges and institutions, including some in my city of Sheffield, that provide courses—which tend to be over-subscribed—in areas where there is already much interest. However, in areas where there is a lack of interest—the hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Benn) referred to this problem the other day, in the context of Leeds, where the situation is probably similar to that of Sheffield—there is insufficient demand to sustain such courses. It then becomes a vicious circle in which colleges have to ask why they are providing courses for which there is no interest.
<P>
I am glad that Conservative Members seek not to delete but to explore subsection (a). I make a plea to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills) to reflect on whether there is any way in which that could be strengthened so that the learning and skills councils have the function not just of getting young people in through the gateway but of maintaining interest and keeping people on the course. If that happens, we will see proper provision across cities in particular, and across the country in general, even where demand has traditionally been low.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I look forward to the Under-Secretary's comments on the terms used in the clause and on the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. I will make no further allusion to the matter, but I am pleased that a year ago, when the Under-Secretary last had the dubious pleasure of hearing my detailed comments about a Bill—on what has subsequently become the Employment Relations Act 1999—he was not paid for the privilege; I am delighted that he now is. He is no doubt appropriately grateful for earning the sympathy of his Whips and the Government machinery.
<P>
The clause is particularly odd. Its practical import is hard to see. We are all, I am sure, waiting with bated breath for the Under-Secretary to put some life into that rather odd collection of words. My hon. Friend the Member for Daventry has already asked whether the obligation contained in subsection (a) is active or passive and whether the assumption is that the LSC must actively encourage people to undergo post-16 education or whether it can passively encourage people in a more general sense. That leads to the question whether the individual or the collective is key to the intention behind the clause. Do the Government intend the obligation to fall so heavily on learning and skills councils that they must actively seek out individuals and deal with each one on a case by case basis? Given the phrasing of the clause, that appears to be the obligation that will be placed on the councils. It seems an unduly heavy obligation, which will be difficult to fulfil, especially as the conclusion of earlier exchanges in the Committee was that those who are dissatisfied with the performance of the Learning and Skills Council will be able to take legal action to secure proper treatment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise a continuation of much of what training and enterprise councils already do, such as interviewing individuals and finding them appropriate training and education?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed. However, the clause would impose a duty to do that in every case. I cannot believe that that is the Government's intention. It would certainly be an ambitious proposal, which could not be expected to be put into action. Would not the clause be closer to the Government's intentions if it had required the promotion of post-16 education, and a more general encouragement?
<P>
<B>Mr. James Clappison </B>(Hertsmere): Does my hon. Friend agree that the word ``undergo'' is an ugly word to use for such a process? It strikes me more as the kind of word that would be used by a surgeon suggesting a course of treatment or a judge handing down a sentence, and not as a term of encouragement.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Indeed, or a Minister undergoing the Committee stage of a Bill. It is an odd phrase, which might have been taken as a discouragement in itself. It might lead individuals to the conclusion, which many have already reached erroneously, that lifelong learning is not for them and might cause pain and suffering.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Would my hon. Friend warm to the idea of using the phrase ``participation''? After all, the Government have a strategy of widening participation. I am sure that, like me, my hon. Friend has no problem with such aspirations. Participating is a more pleasant activity than undergoing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Participation may be a less finite concept than undergoing. I do not want to dwell on the word ``undergo'', but I think that it gives the wrong impression. I cannot see why the Government chose to use such a term, which is probably contrary to achieving their aims. What is the extent of the obligation that Ministers envisage? At what point would the council have taken sufficient steps to fulfil its obligation to encourage individuals, whether by targeting particular groups or areas or those who are deficient in particular skills? Without those bits of flesh on the bones, the clause has no real meaning. It is odd that the Government saw fit, in clause 3, to rely heavily on an interpretation of reasonable actions—I hesitate to call it a defence of reasonableness—to fulfil obligations and duties under the Bill, but clause 4, which seems to impose an open-ended obligation on councils, contains no defence of reasonableness and does not specify that the council must merely take reasonable steps to encourage people. Would the provision be open to someone who felt that his contact with the Learning and Skills Council had discouraged him, as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry suggests? Would the test be subjective or objective?
<P>
The clause is commendably brief, but unfortunately it is not to the point, and it does not adequately explain the Government's intention. Why is it better to encourage people to undergo post-16 education and training rather than to encourage people over the age of 16 to participate in education and training? That may be a semantic point, but it is an important one. We are surely not trying to differentiate post-16 education and training. The thrust of the Government's intentions is surely to encourage lifelong learning and the concept that education begins at or before school and continues throughout life. However, the clause reinforces the concept of post-16 education and training, rather than the notion of education and training for those who happen to be over the age of 16. I hope that the Minister will add some detail to a sketchy clause that may result in dangers and pitfalls for the councils if the Government are not prepared to make clear the obligation that will fall on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry on his reference to Quintilian, of which I was not aware until this morning. It was a perfectly admirable quotation, and it encouraged me. I was brought up on the woman scholar who said that the entire logic of administration of the Roman empire could be derived from the Latin construction of the subjunctive, which was a rather more rigorous attitude towards education than that demonstrated by my hon. Friend. I am less enthusiastic that he responded so warmly to the suggestion of the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) to have a focus group. I am not a believer in focus groups.
<P>
At column 87 of our proceedings on Tuesday, I was slightly ungracious in ascribing to the late Dean Acheson the phrase ``in at the beginning''. The phrase is not in quotation marks in Hansard. I do not suggest that he used those words, but his great book was entitled ``Present at the Creation'', which is a rather more lyrical way of expressing the same thought. One of its early chapters contains a paragraph in which he describes an episode during world war two, when President Roosevelt was in the chair and Mr. Cordell Hull, the Secretary of State, was present. Cordell Hull said to the President, ``Mr. President, this is not one of those occasions when there is sufficient time for you to learn where we wish to be led.'' That seems as satisfactory an epitaph on focus groups as could be devised—although I must confess that I find it slightly surprising in the context of President Roosevelt, whom I have previously thought of as decisive.
<P>
I rise to make a retrospective allusion to the speech of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), which was getting into its stride at column 14 of the first day of our proceedings. The latitude that he was allowed to make a Second Reading speech—he had not been present on Second Reading for reasons that we all understood—unfortunately inflicted a brief excursus of the cricket field by myself, and the latitude that you had shown him, Mr. Benton, you kindly extended to me.
<P>
At column 14, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said that he had attended the national conference of the Federation of Small Businesses a little while before, which had debated whether entrepreneurs were born or made. He went on to say that the national conference had taken the view that they were born, and that small business men could derive benefits from further training—thus putting the opposite point of view.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It always surprised me that the late, great Sir Keith Joseph—who was a fellow of All Souls and a distinguished business man before he entered the House—was convinced that an excess of education could dilute and dissipate the entrepreneurial spirit. He used to cite Richard Branson as an example, but one could point to any number of similar figures throughout history. Another current example is Michael Green of Carlton.
<P>
I have no problem with the clause's suggestion that individuals should be encouraged to undergo post-16 education and training, and support the amendment that was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. However, it would be a mistake if that process became too rigorous and individuals such as Richard Branson were discouraged from resisting further education. I am not saying that such people might not gain from education in their particular area of business, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough suggested. However, the view of the late, great Sir Keith Joseph deserves serious attention, and I hope that the provision will not be carried too far.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> A wise educationalist may sometimes seek to appear to discourage a young person from undertaking education in order to stimulate them further to rebel against the system by participating in it. Someone with whom I was associated at school believed that the best way to ensure that chapel attendance rose was to threaten the most severe penalties for those who attended. Has my right hon. Friend considered the moral implications of the council appearing to discourage a person from education while at the same time secretly hoping that they might thus be stimulated to participate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Without wishing to attribute Byzantine or labyrinthine characteristics to my hon. Friend, I shall not follow him down that path. I do not seek to argue against the general thrust of the clause, of which we naturally approve. However, there are exceptions to the rule, and it would be a pity if its objectives were to be distorted.
<P>
<B>Mr. Allan:</B> The point about entrepreneurs is that every Richard Branson is successful only because they have a horde of trained and well-educated people— accountants, legal executives and so on—working for their organisations. The entrepreneur is the tip of an iceberg that is based on education and training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hallam for providing me with a happy note on which to conclude. I do not know who will win the London mayoral election, but if the current front-runner wins I hope that there will be many such trained people at his elbow. I am sure that the Under-Secretary, as the only other member of the Committee with a London constituency, shares that view.
