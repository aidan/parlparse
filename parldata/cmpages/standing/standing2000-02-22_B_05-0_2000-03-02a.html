<B>The Chairman:</B> Hon. Members may take off their jackets if it gets hot.
<H4><center>Clause 33</center></H4>
<H4><center>Review and information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 18, line 29, after `Kingdom', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, the European Community'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 16, in page 18, line 31, after `Kingdom', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, the European Community'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is a unique and great pleasure, Mr. Hood, to welcome you to the Chair of this splendid, productive Committee. I am amused that your first contribution should be to allow us to take off our jackets. I take the view of the former President Reagan, who always refused, out of respect for his office, to take off his jacket in the Oval Office, so I shall keep mine on.
<P>
The amendments are simple ones that might at first sight appear a little bizarre, but they were drafted for a particular purpose. I am not harking back to the old EEC or the European Coal and Steel Community by deliberately using the phrase ``European Community'' in the amendments. Rather, that is the proper and distinctive labelling. The clause deals with reviewing and information-gathering on the part of the regulator. The amendment would include express reference to reviewing and collecting information about the provision of postal services within the European Community.
<P>
We all know how irksome it is when we seek information through a parliamentary question and are told that that information is not centrally held. It is—to be more relevant to the amendment—equally frustrating when we ask a question about the United Kingdom, for example on our health service, to which the proper answer can be given only by comparing our situation with that of, say, France or Germany, and are told that information about other countries is not held and that Ministers have no responsibility to give such comparative information to the House.
<P>
The scope of the clause is broader, which I encourage and welcome. It states that the commission shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>keep under review the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of postal services<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>collect information about the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of those services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would make the comparative parameters within which the information is to be gathered more specific, so that instead of reading
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the United Kingdom and elsewhere<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the clause would read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the United Kingdom, the European Community and elsewhere.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The most valuable comparative setting for the collection of such information is at pan-European level. A precedent for that has been set in debates and statements. Indeed, the White Paper of July 1999: ``Post Office Reform: A world class service for the 21st century'' emphasised the need for the regulator to pay particular attention to developments in the rest of Europe in discharging its duties, noting at paragraph 11 on page 21:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Regulator will, of course, need to take fully into account actual and prospective developments in the EU, WTO and the Universal Postal Union; and to ensure that its own actions and proposed policies are compatible with those of these organisations.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Article 22 of the directive also provides that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The national regulatory authorities shall have as a particular task ensuring compliance with the obligations arising from this Directive.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would ensure that there was an overlap between the clause and all the other directives and statements so far issued.
<P>
Postal services are of pan-European significance and subject to on-going review at European level. It is probably at pan-European, although possibly also transatlantic level that some of the most obvious partnerships between a freer Post Office and other established commercial concerns in a similar sector are most likely to occur. The communications business is global, but at the early stage of the sector's development there is likely to be more concentration on the European area than anywhere else. The amendment would provide the focus necessary to achieve the stated goals of the White Paper and the directive.
<P>
The amendment refers to the European Community, not the European Union. The European Community is one of the three components of the European Union. Pursuant to Community legislation made in accordance with the treaty that established the European Community, Community institutions undertake measures relating to the single market, including the continuing review of postal services. It is therefore correct for the amendment to refer to the European Community, not the European Union. To many people that is techno-babble, but I am not trying to play games. I am simply trying to make sure that the Bill clearly provides that the focus of the review and the collection of information entrusted to the Commission is well directed and places proper emphasis on the pan-European market in which comparative studies will most usefully be made. There is adequate provision in the Bill for the Commission to make studies of the States, or further afield, in the far east or the Gulf or wherever other partnerships might arise. The word ``elsewhere'' would cover that, but it would be a pity not to make specific reference to the primary area to which the Commission should look. The amendment would enhance the Bill and give it a better focus.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood. In the context of our debate, it is good to see that the package was eventually delivered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): It was over 20 kg.
<P>
<H5>1.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Indeed.
<P>
I would not quarrel with the hon. Gentleman's argument that the European Community should be a special focus for the Postal Services Commission. The clause refers to the exercise of the Commission's functions. It states that it shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) keep under review the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of postal services,
<P>
(b) collect information about the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of postal services<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
``Elsewhere'' covers the European Community as well as the rest of the world.
<P>
The problem with the amendment is that it introduces an air of confusion. The Commission will need to ensure that it is informed about the pan-European requirements in the European postal services directive, such as that on service standards. However, the current drafting is adequate for that purpose and the amendment may confuse the issue by suggesting that the Commission has powers in the European Community that it would not have elsewhere. Its powers, including those to insist that information is provided—this relates to amendment No. 16—are limited to the United Kingdom. To suggest that it should have special powers in the European Community but not elsewhere is extremely confusing and a little dangerous.
<P>
There is a good argument for the Commission requiring information from outside the European Community, rather than inside, in a particular element of its work. In what is called remail, mail is shipped out of the country, mainly to east European countries that are not members of the European Community at present, and then shipped back in as a way of getting round the universal service and uniform tariffs, as the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) knows. The system is called ABA remailing, because it goes from country A to country B and back to country A. It is legal to send mail from country A to country B to be processed and delivered in country B—ABB remailing—and to send mail from country A to country B to go to country C—ABC remailing. However, going from country A to country B and back into this country is not acceptable and it is an issue to which the Commission must pay particular attention. The main problem is outside the European Community.
<P>
I do not want to make a big issue of the problem. The clause ensures that the Commission can tackle service quality and the requirement for information within the European Community and elsewhere. The amendment would cause confusion by giving the impression that the powers extended to the European Community, which would be dangerous and misleading.
<P>
I ask the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I listened to what the Minister said, but I do not accept his argument that specifying the European Community in the clause would suggest that the Commission had powers over, or within the European Community. Amending the clause would be straightforward. It would state that the Commission shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) keep under review the provision (in the United Kingdom, the European Community and elsewhere) of postal services
<P>
(b) collect information about the provision . . . of those services<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Minister's argument were valid, it would imply that the Commission had powers over everywhere else—``elsewhere''—which obviously it does not. Including the words ``European Community'' would not suggest that the Commission had power over the European Community, just as the inclusion of the word ``elsewhere'' does not suggest that it has power over other parts of the globe.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Does my hon. Friend find it surprising that the Minister did not respond to questions on the Reims agreement? Have not the changes to that agreement mitigated the problem? If there are still difficulties, I can understand the Minister's point, but my hon. Friend's position is valid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> My hon. Friend brings to the Committee his experience as a Minister who has considered such matters. I quibble with the Minister's logic; the matter is no big deal. The Minister is right to say that the Bill allows the Commission to study everything that it needs in the European Community; that is covered by the word ``elsewhere''. However, the amendment would remedy the Bill's failure to give it an early focus on the European Community, which is the main competitive area, to direct its attention to it, and to ensure that in considering wherever ``elsewhere'' might be it cannot avoid looking at the European Community or just skim over it. It would benefit the proper functioning of the Commission if it was specified that when looking at the postal systems of the rest of the world, it must consider the European Community, even though it might not look at Singapore and Saudi Arabia. The amendment would ensure that the Commission could not look at Singapore and Saudi Arabia without also considering the European Community. It is a logical step to say, ``Come on, guys in the Commission. Make sure it is always on the agenda and ensure that there is no risk of putting it at the bottom of the agenda.'' Members of the Committee understand that that should be the priority.
<P>
I am prepared to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will reconsider the proposition and give us some comfort now or on Report that the amendment's important emphasis will not be ignored. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 18, line 37, leave out `from time to time' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`at least every three years'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I, too, welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Hood. The amendment follows logically from my previous amendment. The phrase ``from time to time'' should be firmed up. It seems to us that a period of at least three years should be specified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lindsay Hoyle </B>(Chorley): I am a little concerned. Is the hon. Gentleman using the royal we, or does he mean ``I''?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I am sorry if I used the word ``we'' on behalf of my hon. Friends. I am not sure that it matters very much. I was certainly not using the royal we.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that by saying ``we'' he means the Liberal Democrats collectively, given that at present there is more than one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Now I am even more confused. I feel that I am going down a hole. I wonder if I should say any more. As the Liberal Democrats are a united party, I feel confident in saying ``we'' in referring to Liberal Democrats who are not in the Committee but elsewhere, about their daily business.
<P>
Despite the fact that our amendment was not accepted first time round, I ask the Minister to continue to consider the importance of specifying a more definite time scale.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The Committee rejected amendments this morning and the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) should withdraw amendment No. 71, which is totally unnecessary.
<P>
Clause 33 deals with performance standards and clause 34 gives the Commission a duty to report on licence holders' performance standards in its annual report. To make the report meaningful and useful, the Commission is required to collect relevant information every year, which makes the amendment superfluous.
<P>
This morning, the hon. Gentleman argued that there was no time scale pinned down. However, the clause makes provision for a yearly time scale, as the Commission must report on performance standards in its annual report. That is different from the position under the two clauses that we discussed this morning. Therefore, the point is covered and it is safe to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I—or we—rise to thank the Minister for pointing out the subtle difference between amendments. I accept his comments and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 58, in page 18, line 38, after `by' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`—(a) any universal service provider in the provision of a universal postal service, and
<P>
(b) so far as not falling within paragraph (a),'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> In some respects, clauses 31, 32 and 33 naturally flow into one another. Under Mr. Maxton's chairmanship, I sought to raise the relevance to clause 33 of the draft statutory social and environmental guidance to the Postal Services Commission. I was directed to discuss that matter in the clause 33 stand part debate. The relationship between the guidance and the clause leads one to say, in the words of John McEnroe, ``You cannot be serious''.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the hon. Gentleman speaking to clause 32? We should be having a debate on clause 33 stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am speaking to clause 33.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman mentioned matters discussed under Mr. Maxton's chairmanship and, by implication, was referring to clause 32.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I shall not query whether reference was to clause 31 or 32. I accept that it was to clause 32.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Mr. Maxton may be in a better position to advise on this matter.
<H4><center>[MR. JOHN MAXTON in the Chair.]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I shall not get involved in whether, in our discussion of either clause 31 or 32, you directed me to the clause 33 stand part debate, Mr. Maxton, I am an easy, flexible fellow and am not in the slightest worried about that.
<P>
The connection between the draft guidance and requirements under clause 33 is troubling. If I were in the Post Office, I would go to bed in a cold sweat every night, not knowing where things were going to end. Subsection (1)(a) states that the Commission should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>keep under review the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of postal services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have no difficulty with that. However, a hole starts to form in subsection (l)(b), which states that it should
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>collect information about the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of those services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>2 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State may give directions.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Such directions are not a matter for discussion. One cannot respond, ``I'm not going to do it, guvnor.'' Will the Secretary of State confirm that? I am sorry, that was a Freudian slip, but I am sure that it will not be long before the Minister is promoted to that rank. The direction is not an arbitrary, take it or leave it arrangement for the regulator and the Commission, but an instruction: the matter is as long as piece of string.
<P>
We raised concern about expense in discussions of clause 1 and schedule 1. It is impossible to calculate how much will it cost to run the Commission. As the Post Office will be the only licence holder and contributor to the Commission's coffers, it will have to dig deep to supply funds to keep the Commission going unless the Minister gives us better news.
<P>
The matter is another spin without substance. We do not know what will happen when it comes to the crunch. Will money be provided for the Commission to carry out its task or will it batten on to the Post Office and take its blood? It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify that.
<P>
The clause, coupled with the draft guidance, has whistled through Departments and everyone has whacked in their threepenceworth, whether needed or not. Much of the matter is beyond belief. I know from experience that everyone wants to put in their aims and objectives.
<P>
The draft guidance states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government recognises that excessive noise can be considered as a pollutant and may decrease the quality of life.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We all agree with that: it is motherhood and apple pie. Will the Secretary of State give direction under clause 33 to postal operatives to ensure that their van silencers are working properly and that they do not wake people up? Will he direct that post boxes be lined with rubber? There will be more and more opportunity to discuss that.
<P>
There has been some confusion. We are debating clause 33 stand part, are we not, Mr. Maxton?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We are debating clause 33. However, there is some confusion about whether the hon. Gentleman should be raising the draft guidance at this point. I said that he should do that in our discussion of clause 32. I am being tolerant, but I will not allow him to go far down this road.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I understand why you have given such a ruling, Mr. Maxton. I have endeavoured more than once to make the point that clauses 31 to 33 have interrelated functions. I touched on this briefly on clause 32 and asked the Minister about the contribution. The clause states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State shall from time to time give guidance about the making by the Commission of a contribution.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the Minister ducked and dived once more.
<P>
I will return to clause 33, to which I thought I was speaking. Many aspects of the draft guidance are relevant. The content of the guidance may not be relevant per se, but it is relevant to the clause. Some aspects of the clause are inconsistent with the Commission's role and work. Subsection (1)(b) provides that the Commission shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>collect information about the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of . . . services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 4.20 of the guidance states, in relation to the collecting of information:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commission shall have regard to the desirability of consulting with with respect to the needs of vulnerable people where practicable, even when not required to do so.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is an open-ended contract as long as a piece of string. Does the Commission have any liability or responsibility to undertake this work, or can we be sensible and not worry about people buying a fleet of low-emission vans on the ground that such a decision is a matter for the Post Office management and not something in which Ministers should intervene?
<P>
The guidance puts the responsibility on the Commission. It states that it should have regard to the desirability of the Government's policy
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>when considering if postal operators are being efficient and economic.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In relation to the efficient spending of financial resources, the guidance states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The commission should be aware of this when carrying out its duties in regard to considering postal operators' financial affairs.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause suggests that the Commission will be responsible for having a great influence on the way in which postal operators may run their internal affairs. In the words of John McEnroe, ``You cannot be serious.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): In a previous incarnation, I was a director of a publishing house for books and periodicals. Subsection (1)(b) says that the Commission must
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>collect information about the provision (in the United Kingdom and elsewhere) of . . . services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 33 is an appropriate clause on which to raise concerns, although I may table amendments further on in our proceedings.
<P>
The Post Office delivers about 600 million magazines a year, which is worth approximately £250 million to it. Such is the critical mass of monopoly postal deliveries that the Post Office has historically been the only practical postal carrier of magazines, and that will probably continue. In the past 10 years, the cost of delivering them by Royal Mail has risen from about a third of non-editorial costs to about half, whereas other costs have been reduced significantly. The other costs of publishing periodicals have decreased—no doubt, as a consequence of competitive practice—but the cost of posting them by Royal Mail has increased.
<P>
In the 12 months before November 1998, intensive discussions on the restructuring of Presstream pricing were held with the Post Office, during which the Periodical Publishers Association stressed the need for adequate lead times between announcing and implementing a new pricing structure. That was the basis for setting the implementation date at 1 December 1999. In January 1999, the Post Office announced that prices would be increased that April. The Post Office has since frozen its vast programme of investment in sorting equipment to handle magazines and other packed materials.
<P>
Independent benchmarking research undertaken by the PPA has shown that the Royal Mail's costs are about 30 per cent. higher than best-in-class comparisons. Not surprisingly, periodicals publishers and the print unions are concerned about how fairly the Post Office will treat that part of the industry, which is not insignificant and employs many people, many of whom are trade unionists. They are also concerned about the Post Office's commitment to traffic outside the licensed or reserved service area.
<P>
The Bill provides a new licensing regime, under which the Post Office and possible competitors will be licensed by the Postal Services Commission to convey letters under clause 6. Periodicals are excluded from the definition of the word ``letter'' in clause 99. However, under clause 33, the Commission will be entitled to impose conditions and other provisions on activities that do not require a licence. Under the clause, the Commission will be entitled to collect information about postal services in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Because of the Post Office's dominance, we would expect the Commission to apply the same conditions to the mailing of magazines as to traffic in the regulated sector.
<P>
The Commission should undertake benchmarking exercises for other mail deliveries and other utilities in the United Kingdom. It should require price targets equivalent to those achieved in the private sector as shown to be achievable by benchmarking. It should also require proper notice of any price increase with an adequate consultation process, proper service standards and investment, and transparent accounting. Such deliveries constitute a significant part of the Royal Mail's business and it is right and proper that those who publish periodicals and send them through the post should be treated fairly.

<P>

<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am going to say something helpful, but the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire almost made me change my mind. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) made an important point, not so much about the requirement for the Commission to seek information but about the requirement for it to be well informed about European postal matters, which will be a major part of its function. We shall reconsider the drafting of the clause so that we can deal with that valid point on Report.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton said distinctly that Conservative Members supported subsection (1)(a) and (b) and that they could understand the logic of those provisions, but the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire took the John McEnroe stance of ``You cannot be serious'', as a result of which I became somewhat confused.
<P>
We dealt with the guidelines on clause 32. They are draft guidelines and if the Post Office is having sleepless nights about them, no doubt we hear about it when it submits the response. Its views will be taken extremely seriously, as will the views of the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire. We had difficulty following his argument, but if he believes that the consultation document is not as tightly drawn as it should be, we shall be interested to see his submissions to it.
<P>
<H5>2.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
We estimate that the cost of the Commission will be between £4 million and £5 million, which is not a huge fortune. Conservative Members should not assume that the Post Office will have to meet that cost; it will have to apply for a licence, the same as everyone else. Licence holders will be responsible for meeting the cost. It is not an enormous amount and I do not believe that the Post Office will consider it to be unreasonable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am absolutely delighted that, after several requests, the Minister has at last put a handle on the figures. I appreciate that and one of the reasons why I turned on clause 33 was that he ducked the issue when we discussed clause 32, when I asked him specifically about the constitution. He has now given me the figures, for which I can only thank him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> Peace has broken out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> For a bit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> For a little bit.
<P>
The hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) said that magazines are outside the monopoly area under clause 99. That is not strictly relevant to clause 33, but he raised the point. The Secretary of State has made it clear that the Commission will be responsible for pricing. The pricing is for the universal service obligation services only, but the Periodical Publishers Association has items that are not dealt with under monopolies legislation.
<P>
The new pricing regime—in terms of the experience of other regulators—has been a major success because it ensures that prices are kept at reasonable levels. The Post Office's pricing regime has been fair in the sense that it constitutes about a 17 per cent. reduction in real terms over the past 15 years; but I am sure that the Commission will note the submissions of the Periodical Publishers Association.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. I appreciate that the points I made were somewhat technical, but I will reflect on what he said because we will probably return to the matter when we discuss clause 13.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I have received a third delivery in one afternoon.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton recognised that clause 33 is extremely important to the Bill. His point about Europe is well taken, and we shall consider it. I trust therefore that we can agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

Clause 33, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. It is I who must apologise. I had understood that we were meeting at 2.30 pm and that time was firmly in my diary. I am grateful to Mr. Maxton and Mr. Hood for standing in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. Does the sittings motion specify that we shall meet every Thursday at 9 am and 1.30 pm?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, so I am advised.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> With some sang froid, I shall collect my thoughts after that pleasant shock.
<P>
Amendment No. 73 is one of several amendments designed to firm up the Bill. It would substitute the word ``shall'' for the word ``may'', Like all the clauses, clause 35 is important, because it allows the Commission to publish information and advice to licence holders on the understanding that such information should be practical, but should not seriously affect anyone's interests.
<P>
It is important to give more encouragement to the publication of such information. ``May'' is a rather slack word, while ``shall'' is more positive. The amendment has been tabled in the light of the greater commitment that we would like from the Government to freedom of information, which is important to Liberal Democrats, among others.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Although the amendment is well intentioned, it is very much six of one and half a dozen of the other. Clause 34, to which my hon. Friends referred in great detail, compels the Commission to publish annual reports and other information. The amendment has two elements. It proposes that, rather than the Commission being able to publish information, it shall publish information. However, clause 35(2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Publication under this section shall be in such form and manner as the Commission considers appropriate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would compel the Commission to publish something, but it does not mean anything unless it specifies what. The Commission could merely publish a document that reads, ``Hi, mate, nice to communicate with you.''
<P>
The element of compulsion that the amendment would introduce would add nothing, because the subsequent provisions of the clause do not specify what the Commission would be compelled to publish. Although the amendment is well intentioned and makes sense as far as it goes, changing ``may'' to ``shall'' would not achieve the objective of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare because it does not specify to what the compulsion would apply. The amendment is well meant, but it would not deliver.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I agree entirely. The point is to try to ensure openness and transparency. We would all drink to that if we had the opportunity. We all support that principle, but we must consider the effect of the amendments in detail. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton pointed out one aspect. The second is that while the Commission may consider that some types of information should be published, in the form of leaflets or posters, it may also decide that a letter to a licence holder or a user group should be confidential. It might feel that the publication of such a letter could cause difficulties. The use of ``shall'' in the amendment means that it would have to publish.
<P>
The Member for Weston-super-Mare argued that the Commission has some control over what is published, but do we really want to insist that its publishes every piece of advice and information that it gives? First, that would pre-empt its decisions. We have been careful not tie its hands, given that it is an independent regulator. Secondly, is it not unfair to insist that it can never send information to licence holders or user groups without also publishing it? Well intentioned though the amendment is, it should be rejected.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I take the point. I thank the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton for his contribution. It was worth making the point. We are trying to strengthen the Bill. The amendment does not preclude more private communications. If the Commission does not consider it expedient to publicise information, it does not have to do so. The Liberal Democrats want greater freedom of information. I mark my card on the issue, but in the light of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 59, in page 19, line 44, leave out `licence holders under Part II' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a universal service provider,
<P>
( ) any licence holder under Part II who is not a universal service provider'.—[Mr. Alan Johnson.]<P>

<P>
Clause 35, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 36</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of the Commission to require information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 20, line 13, leave out `any person' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the Council, a universal service provider, or any licence holder under Part II who is not a universal service provider,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We come to an important part of the Bill. It delineates the power of the courts or the Secretary of State to enforce certain provisions in the Bill and contains a description of information that can be demanded and the penalties that will apply for default. The Opposition's view is that the way in which the Bill is drafted at present and the penalties that can apply to the parties defined here are too draconian and sweeping. Genuine arguments about civil liberties and commercial freedom apply to this part of the Bill and the amendment addresses those concerns.
<P>
Clause 36(1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Commission may, for any relevant purpose, serve notice on any person requiring him . . . to produce any documents . . . at a time and place.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The sweeping category of ``any person'' is too wide, and I question how it can rightfully fall within human rights legislation. The Bill is about regulating postal services, granting licences, protecting universal service and allowing other competitive organisations to compete in the field, subject to certain provisions. However, the clause will allow the state to intrude on the lives and commercial freedom of people who may never seek to participate in the business.
<P>
<H5>2.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
One might logically assume that the opinions might at least be allied to the business. For instance, one might ask for the accounts of a courier company even though it is not applying for a licence or trying to compete with universal service provision. The Minister might tell me that the company might violate such a licence, but the powers are too broad and allow too much leeway to the state.
<P>
The White Paper states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The UK postal market outside the statutory monopoly is a vibrant, competitive market with over 4,000 competitors. It is therefore the Government's intention that regulation should focus on those who are operating within the monopoly area, leaving the rest of the market free to operate as they do now in a largely unregulated environment . . . The Government proposes that the Regulator's role will be confined to ensuring the general ability of the Post Office network to support the USO on letters and parcels; and to monitoring levels of access to the network, reporting any concerns to the Government.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In addressing the issue of the power of the regulator to require information, it continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Regulator will have the power to require information relevant to the exercise of its functions from the Post Office and other operators licensed to operate within the monopoly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause goes outside those bounds and grants dramatic powers to the state to demand information and to fine if it is not given. Since the White Paper, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has consistently maintained that extension of the regulator's powers outside the reserved area is unnecessary. In a letter dated 31 July 1999 to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not believe that it is either right or necessary for the Postal Services Commission to have powers to require information from the commercial sector where it is operating outside the monopoly.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I do not believe it is right because such powers would extend regulation into a highly competitive market (with over 4,000 businesses of all sizes) which has not shown any need for regulatory intervention. I do not believe it is necessary because the kind of information the Commission will tend to require of the broader market, for example on prices, will either be readily available; or is of a nature and type that I am sure businesses would be willing to provide voluntarily if asked.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A more limited power would also be consistent with the limited power of the council to require information as set out in, clause 47(2), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The persons on whom a notice under subsection (1) may be served are—
<P>
(a) the Commission,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a universal service provider,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) any licence holder under Part II who is not a universal service provider.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment echoes that, word for word.
<P>
Amendment No. 17 exactly reflects the specific and detailed words of the Secretary of State when he formally submitted comments to the Select Committee; it is also in line with the White Paper and, indeed, with other parts of the Bill. I am trying to confine potentially draconian state powers so that they cannot stretch beyond the ambit of those who are directly involved with what the regulator is legitimately entrusted to regulate. As both sides of the Committee admit, the commercial sector is a vibrant, thriving and competitive part of the communications sector.
<P>
The Minister has much justifying to do. Will he explain why all these powers—to produce documents, to supply information to the Commission and so forth—can be served on and demanded of ``any person'', instead of the relevant people whom the Bill attempts to oversee?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I do not propose to gallop over the same ground as my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton, who made a compelling case. I wish to make just a few quick points.
<P>
If the Minister accepts the amendment—as I hope he will—some consequential changes to line 18 may need to be made. The amendment will greatly tighten the definition and—dare I say it?—remove an element of temptation. As we know, the UK postal market outside the statutory monopoly is vibrant, competitive and growing. I am told that there are more than 4,000 competitors. It must be the intention of everyone, including the Government, that regulation be focused on those operating within the monopoly area, leaving the market outside it to operate freely and effectively.
<P>
The amendment would remove any temptation for the Commission to mount fishing expeditions. I may be becoming fixated on the draft guidance, which states under paragraph 4.14:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In general, if postal operators run services which have benefits to society . . . then the Commission should have regard to these when considering how efficient and economic, or financially able, postal operators are in their provision of postal services.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the clause were unamended, the Commission might be tempted to go into the accounts and affairs of operators in the non-monopoly area to ascertain how they do business and how things could be improved. That could be an intrusion and a burden, damaging competitive and efficient businesses. I hope that the Minister will accept my hon. Friend's arguments and remove the temptation to obtain information, if not on the cheap, at least to the detriment of private competitors operating outside the monopoly area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> We strongly oppose the amendment and with good reason. The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton argued about civil liberties and claimed that we are breaching human rights legislation: we are not. As to the level of fines proposed later in the Bill, they have been approved by the Home Office and are entirely consistent with human rights.
<P>
The amendment would change the ability of the Commission to require information from any person. The phrase ``any person'' has a wide definition, but the purposes for requiring that information are specific, as set out in the Bill, and do not include the time that people go to bed, prying into their bank accounts or anything of that nature.
<P>
The Commission can require people to provide information if it is investigating the offence of operating without a licence in the reserved area, under clause 6; exercising its functions in relation to breach of licence conditions under the new licensing regime, under clauses 14, 15, 16 and 21; providing advice and information on public post offices; or collecting information on standards of performance achieved by licence holders and universal service obligation providers, or on behalf of the council so that it can carry out its functions. It can require information only for those specific reasons.
<P>
The problem is that, under the amendment, the Commission would not be allowed to police the reserved area properly. Under the Bill, we shall remove the Post Office's right to police the reserved area and place that obligation on the Commission. If it is to undertake that role, it must be able to require information from other postal operators outside the licensed area or the universal service provision. It must also be able to require information from those who may have just set up in business.
<P>
The purpose is to protect the universal service obligation, so we shall require the Commission to police the reserved area. The only reason why we want a reserved area is to protect the universal service obligation. To protect the USO, the Commission must be sure that it can stop those who want to deliver mail, intra-city or inter-city, cream-skimming, which would totally undermine the Post Office's ability to provide a universal service.
<P>
If we accepted the amendment, the Commission could not police the reserved area properly; it could not ask those outside the reserved area, such as new companies or unlicensed operators who might breach the conditions of the reserved area, to provide information. Unlike in telecommunications, the entry costs involved in setting up postal services are low—the proverbial man and a van—but the Commission could not require those people to provide information under the amendment. That would make its job extremely difficult.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton mentioned what the Secretary of State said. My right hon. Friend made it clear that, unlike other utilities, the whole industry would not be regulated. That was welcomed by the industry. The 4,000 postal operators who do a tremendous job outside the reserved area and merrily go about their business will not be affected. We decided—it was a significant step—that they should not come under the scrutiny of the regulator.
<P>
The regulator will be confined to scrutinising the reserved area and the universal postal service. If we had made the regulator responsible for the whole industry, no such drafting problems would have arisen. We have used the term ``any person'' and applied it to strictly defined specific purposes, because we have an unregulated market, apart from the reserved area that the Commission will be obliged to regulate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The Minister may be able to satisfy me sufficiently so that I can withdraw the amendment. I have explained my anxiety about the phrase ``any person'', but that is qualified by the statement ``for any relevant purpose''. The argument boils down to determining that purpose. Such inquiries and demands for documents should relate only to those who are either in the regulated system or thought to be in breach of it, not to private companies outside the related system or those that wish to be part of it. If the Minister can assure us that it refers only to licence holders, universal service operators and so on, or to people suspected of being in breach of the conditions, I will certainly withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The answer is yes. That is why we oppose the amendment. I hope that with that reassurance the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.
<P>
<H5>2.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> To add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton said, is not the Minister adopting a belt and braces approach? Does not clause 38 give the Commission the authority to carry out necessary investigations without invoking the wide and draconian powers in the clause? We are asking for those powers to be limited, bearing it in mind that clause 38 gives the Commission the ability to go wider if necessary, after satisfying a justice of the peace that it has a genuine case.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> No, it does not. Clause 38 deals with justices of the peace and so on where an offence has taken place—but the Commission needs to assure itself that an offence has taken place in the first place. A completely innocent company could be accused of breaching the reserved area and the Commission would require information from it to ascertain the truth. Clause 38 deals with circumstances where the Commission needs powers of entry and seizure.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I freely admit that I might have read clause 38 wrongly, but it refers to a sheriff having to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting
<P>
</UL></FONT>—in my understanding, ``suspecting'' does not mean that an offence has taken place, only that it is suspected of having taken place. Surely those are two different things?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am by no means clear on why we are debating clause 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The Bill has a seamless thread running from clause to clause. The Minister says that the provision in the clause that the Commission
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>may, for any relevant purpose, serve notice on any person<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is necessary, and we are merely pointing out that the power to investigate someone suspected of doing something wrong is given under clause 38.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Yes, and I am sure that we will be happy to consider that when we come to clause 38.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument is that the Commission must be forced to get right of entry into premises to get information because the amendment would have prevented it from simply sending a letter requesting that information in the first place. That would invoke a power that is far too draconian for the situation. I hope that my assurances in respect of the powers to request such information satisfy the hon. Gentleman. If the amendment is pressed to a vote, I ask the Committee to oppose it, in the interests of the universal service obligation that we debated yesterday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's assurances. They satisfy me that the powers are genuinely confined to those who are subject to regulation or thought to be in breach of any conditions imposed by the regulator. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> rose—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was be grateful if the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton would be more positive in rising.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I am only a little chap.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I was not in any way referring to the hon. Gentleman's stature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I rise to my full 5ft 5Ž3/4in to make a simple point that follows on from our debate on clause 36 and the scope of the relevant powers. The clause gives the power to fine. I am advised that level 5 on the standard scale is about £5,000. Under the clause, the fines for the failure to supply information apply, as with clause 36, only to those in the category to which I referred in our previous debate. Will the Minister confirm that freely operating commercial concerns whose activities have no bearing on the regulated sector other than that they happen to be in a similar sector will not be subject to any such fine? I sense that such an assurance is similar to the one that I received earlier from the Minister.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> It is seconds away for round three and I seek the same assurance from the Minister. I assume that there is a consistent thread throughout the exercise of such powers under the clause and that no one will seek a warrant through either a sheriff or anyone else to demand information that is outside the categories under discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I am happy to assure the hon. Gentleman that the same thread runs throughout the clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Will the Minister take that assurance a step further? Constituents have told me about instances when their houses have been searched under a warrant granted by the justice of the peace, but when they ask why the justice of the peace authorised such a warrant, they are told that such information is confidential. We will never be able to find out whether a warrant had been applied for genuinely.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman takes me to areas of Home Office policy that I am not equipped to answer. We are talking about the powers not of the Post Office but of the Commission. The Post Office has considerable powers over people who are delaying or stealing mail, which will be enforced in line with the law.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton rightly asked for an assurance about a thread running the clauses. I do not wish to be awkward, but if the Commission can ask a justice of the peace to execute a warrant for power to gain entry, can the person whose premises are raided have redress if the request is regarded as being outside the Minister's assurance?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> To gain powers of entry, the Commission would have to convince a justice of the peace—in Scotland, a sheriff—that there are possible breaches of the reserved area. I should think that the justice of the peace or the sheriff would study the assurances given by the Government in Hansard. We may be helping them in their job today. The form of redress for anyone who considers that the justice of the peace or the sheriff was wrong to grant entry is the same as that which is open to anyone who believes that he has been treated wrongly under the law. I cannot say anything further than that to help Conservative Members.
