<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Allocation of existing schools to new categories</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [this day], No. 166 in page 95, line 32, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Local Education Authority." [Mr. St. Aubyn.]<P>

<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments: No. 169, in page 95, line 32, leave out from "determine" to end.
<P>
No. 170, in page 95, line 37, leave out paragraph 8.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Estelle Morris):</B> When we stopped our proceedings this morning, I was beginning my response to the group of amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn), which concerned who should make the decision when there was a dispute between the governing body and the parents about the choice of categories. The amendment would remove that power from the Secretary of State and give it to local education authorities.
<P>
It is clear that a person must have the power to determine the status of the school, but it is not acceptable to give it to local education authority. The decision must be made by a neutral and impartial person who is regarded as such by all concerned. The local authority may be thought to have an interest in such decisions for example, in whether a school becomes a community school, in which case it would have more of a stake than if it became a foundation school. Therefore, it is important that the final decision is made by an arbiter a postholder without a vested interest in the outcome. No matter how fair a local authority was and how determined it was to judge the facts, some would regard it as having a vested interest.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 169 and 170 would remove the constraints on the Secretary of State when making such a decision. It is important that he is guided by several constraints. For those reasons, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If he does not, I shall ask the Committee to vote against it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): The principle behind the amendment has been clearly stated. I am grateful for the support of Liberal Democrat Members and for their agreeing that decisions should be made locally. Having made my point, I am happy to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 95, line 41, after "specified", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"provided that no conditions may be specified which would restrict or alter the relevant school's established admissions policy.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 168, in page 96, line 24, after "requiring", insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any change as from the appointed day in the established admissions policy of the school or".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The amendments speak for themselves. We shall have a more thorough debate about admissions policy when we reach part III of the Bill and I do not intend to anticipate that debate this afternoon. The Government have adopted a contradictory style in the schedule in that they want to be able to attack the principle of selection. Yet, under part III, they are continuing in many ways to enshrine that principle for a proportion of those who will be admitted to a school.
<P>
My area of Guildford has a non-selection policy. However, if such a policy exists between schools, policies of selection must be used within the school. De facto selection process are undertaken when some schools are more popular than others. Many of the problems to which Labour Members have referred concern education, not selection.
<P>
<B>The Minister for School Standards (Mr. Stephen Byers):</B> I am not absolutely clear what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve by the two amendments. I wish to assure him about the admissions policy for those areas that have selection policies. We shall deal later in the Bill with the arrangements for parental ballots if there is a desire locally to hold a ballot on the selective status.
<P>
As for admissions policies generally, I can assure, and hopefully reassure, the hon. Gentleman that just by being allocated to a new category for example, a grant-maintained school becoming a foundation school that change, in itself, will not lead to a change in the school's admissions policy. The foundation school will be its own admissions authority, so there will be no change. The change may well come later when the provisions relating to the code of practice for admissions are introduced. There may be an argument on the admissions issue when we come to clauses 76 and 77. But simply by moving to a new category, the school can retain its present admissions policy. As I said, a change may come later, depending on how the code of practice impacts on the present admissions arrangements for a GM school that subsequently becomes foundation.
<P>
I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> That welcome statement from the Minister clarifies the point that the changeover cannot be used as a lever by some local authorities to force a change in the selection procedure of a school. His small concession is welcome, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 2 agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Kinds of foundation and voluntary schools and types of foundations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Angela Browning (Tiverton and Honiton):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 148, in page 19, line 22, leave out subsection (6)(c).
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 149 page 19, line 38, leave out subsection (7).
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The purpose of the amendments is to effect two deletions from the Bill, relating to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"model instrument of government for adoption by a foundation body"</ul></font>
<P>
and the powers of the Secretary of State to vary the instrument. That applies to both subsections 6(c) and (7).
<P>
We tabled the amendments because it seemed strange that the Secretary of State should have statutory powers to intervene on a foundation body. Surely such bodies are capable of making their own decisions without the Secretary of State intervening to such an extent. Despite all his other powers, we are not sure why this provision needs to be so precise or why the Secretary of State should interfere at such a low level in a body that will be well established and able to take day-to-day decisions about how a school is structured.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is worth stressing that the clause refers not to powers that will affect foundation schools, but to a concept that we want to extend group foundations. Such groups already exist, especially with regard to religious bodies, many of which have a group foundation to support voluntary-aided schools. There is a common interest through religion which leads to a group foundation being formed and to foundation governors being nominated.
<P>
However, that is quite distinct from foundation schools. There is no intention in the clause to interfere in how foundation schools operate. We shall address the issues of governance when we come to those later in the Bill. Group foundations will allow schools to come together if they feel that they have a common interest. The model instrument is a facility and a device to enable that to happen. All the Secretary of State wants to do in a simple way we intend that the instrument should be simple is to allow a group foundation to be established and for schools to join if they so wish.
<P>
With regard to voluntary-aided schools, it is quite common for them to be part of a wider foundation. That brings benefits and there is no reason why such benefits should be denied to, for example, community schools or others if they feel that they want to share their common interests. It is not the intention of a group foundation to take over the powers of individual school governing bodies; it is a facility that will allow schools to come together. Time will tell whether schools avail themselves of the option, but the Government believe that the provision should be in the Bill because it may help and we would not want to deny it to particular schools.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Theresa May </B>(Maidenhead): I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 19, leave out lines 25 to 28.
<P>
Much of what the Minister has just said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) may relate to this amendment. It concerns the powers that are given to the Secretary of State to make provisions for a person or body to resolve disputes within this foundation group. That could be disputes between schools in the group or between one of those schools and the body of trustees that makes up the foundation body. My concern is about the interference from the Secretary of State in that arrangement, and I will obviously listen carefully to the Minister's response. This is an area where had regulations been available prior to our discussion of the clause, we might have been able to see the intention more clearly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I have some sympathy regarding the difficulty that we all have in coming to terms with the distinction between foundation schools on the one hand and a group foundation on the other. I was not really aware of it until the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) drew attention to the measure on Second Reading and confused foundation schools with the group foundation. I then asked for further briefing about the distinction and am now far better briefed then I was on Second Reading.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Did I mishear my hon. Friend? I thought that I heard him say that it was not necessary to be a foundation school to be part of a foundation group. I read the Bill as clearly defining the group as not allowing community schools. Did I mishear him or am I doubly confused?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My understanding is that a foundation will be formed and it will be for individual schools to join the foundation if they want to do so. There will be no compulsion to join. It is a facility that is being provided for schools as a result of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to clause 21(4) which, in defining a foundation body, makes specific reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"three or more schools each of which is either a foundation or a voluntary school"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It does not include community schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This goes back to the debate we had this morning. My hon. Friend is absolutely right it is not possible to jump immediately from being a community school to being part of a group foundation. However, if a school decides that it wants to change category and wants to join a group foundation, it can propose either to become voluntary aided or a foundation school, and could, through that device, join a group foundation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> What is the logic that precludes the community school from being part of the foundation group my hon. Friend has described? If he wants to take time to consider his answer, I would be happy to let him do so, but I have not followed his logic as to why they should be excluded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> My hon. Friend may disagree with it, but the Government took the view that while they are community schools, the community of interest is the LEA because there is that link between them. If a school wants to become voluntary aided or a foundation school, it will be for the school organisation committee to agree or disagree with that change of character. On assuming the new status if it is ultimately agreed, it will have the opportunity to become part of a group foundation if it wants. If a school changed from being a community school to being voluntary aided, which is unlikely but is possible, it will almost certainly become part of a foundation that is linked with a church or religious organisation. As it stands, it is unlikely that community schools will want to take the circuitous route to becoming part of a group foundation. If they want to, however, they will be able to do so.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The amendment would deny the Secretary of State the opportunity to resolve disputes that might arise in a group foundation. There may be disputes about nominating foundation governors to governing bodies, and we need someone to resolve them. Disputes are unlikely to arise, but we need the fail-safe device that is in the clause. Unfortunately, the amendment would remove it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Although I remain a little concerned about the issue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 21 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 22</center></H4>
<H4><center>Maintenance and other funding of schools</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 20, line 24, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2A)(a) In the event of a Foundation School or Voluntary Aided or Voluntary Controlled School leaving the maintained sector, the LEA shall have a duty to continue funding places at that school for all pupils who are in attendance at that school at the time of transfer.
<P>
(b) This duty shall continue until each child has left the school.".</ul></font>
<P>
I am speaking on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West (Mr. Brady), who had hoped that we would reach the amendment at this morning's sitting. He cannot be with us this afternoon, so I am moving the amendment for him.
<P>
My hon. Friend was thinking of circumstances in his constituency when he tabled the amendment. He believes that the Bill's current wording would affect schools such as St. Ambrose college and Loreto convent in Altrincham that found grant-maintained status so attractive that they opted into it from the independent sector. No doubt other schools throughout the country have followed that path.
<P>
Children at such schools are currently funded by the state, but the schools might opt to return to independent status because of the loss of freedom and the narrow range of options that grant-maintained schools will experience as a result of the Bill. My hon. Friend is concerned that children attending a grant-maintained school that returns to the independent sector should have their places preserved at the school. The amendment would ensure that the state would continue to fund those children for the natural period that they were expected to remain at the school.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I welcome the amendments because they give us the opportunity to determine how far the Government's commitment to involving the private sector extends. We heard encouraging noises in previous sittings about how the private sector could become involved. The Minister acknowledged that, in some areas, it would be more appropriate to involve the private sector than in others. When we talk about the private sector, we must include the sector made up of private schools. The amendment should cause no difficulty to the Minister or his Department. It would engender more cross-fertilisation between the state and the private sector.
<P>
The Education (Schools) Act 1997, which dealt with the assisted places scheme, was a retrograde step away from more partnership between the public and private sectors. Since then, the Government's rhetoric has changed. I am delighted that, at a meeting at the end of last month, it was agreed to create a new partnership scheme in Surrey between independent schools and the state sector. I believe that it is one of the first partnership schemes in the country. It would at first involve certain subjects being provided by independent schools in Surrey, the provision being purchased through the LEA. For example, if a child has an aptitude for languages and wishes to study Japanese, and the school cannot provide a Japanese teacher but an independent school in the vicinity can, the money will be made available.
<P>
An important principle of the scheme is that the additional cost of the private sector provision will not come from Surrey local education authority's budget. For the scheme to work, the money will have to be topped up perhaps from a private charitable trust or private sponsorship, or by other means. A number of businesses and charities in the area are keen to support the idea that what the state sector delivers to pupils can be broadened and strengthened through the involvement of private sector schools.
<P>
I mention that because the amendment implies that the LEAs will purchase education provision from private sector schools. It is merely a continuation of the principle that underpins Surrey county council's new policy. The scheme could be subject to a provision that the cost per child should not exceed the standard spending assessment and that any top-up is, as under the Surrey scheme, provided by the private sector from charitable trusts or other sources.
<P>
We have attempted to make a constructive change to the Bill and to build on the Minister's language of partnership between the public and private sectors. We may have done so in a way that he may not have considered, but if he believes what he said, he must surely approve.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> It has been interesting to hear about the co-operation between the independent and maintained sectors in Surrey. The Department looks forward to receiving details of those plans and to hearing how children can be given more opportunities than at present. That is exactly the sort of co-operation that we want to see, especially in foreign languages; some languages are not traditionally taught in schools but are becoming more important as we approach the millennium. It is good that children should have the opportunity to study them.
<P>
However, the amendment was rather more re-inventive of the assisted places scheme than of the Surrey scheme. I am far less enthusiastic about it and will ask that it is withdrawn or that the Committee votes against it.
<P>
The amendment would not work. We are not talking about a revolving door, turning one way and then the other between the independent and maintained sectors. A school that wishes to become independent cannot do it overnight under the present structure; it has to close and a new school has to be set up. When a school closes, the children have to be offered alternative schooling. They cannot hang around waiting for the new school to open.
<P>
We do not propose anything different in the Bill. It is not the same as coming from the independent sector into the GM sector, as St. Ambrose and Loretto schools did. I hope that those two schools do not decide to go back to the independent sector, but if they did notices for closure would have to be published. The school organisation committee or the Secretary of State would have to make sure that there were sufficient good quality places for the children currently on their school roll.
<P>
I shall not accept the amendment. Not only is it inappropriate; such a situation would never arise because the children would have been offered alternative education if the school closed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I am bitterly disappointed, as I am sure my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will be when he reads Hansard. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 20, line 24, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(2B) Where the LEA is unable to meet the needs set out in its school organisation plan through maintained schools, it shall seek to fund alternative provision through the private sector.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 163, in clause 25, page 22, line 13, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(c) how the authority intends to meet any needs of the population of its area if those needs cannot be met by maintained schools.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I hope to tempt the Minister a little more with amendments Nos. 162 and 163, because there are precedents. They would require LEAs to make provision in the private sector to meet clearly identified local needs that cannot be met by maintained schools. They would require the authority to set out how to meet local needs and, if they cannot be met by the maintained sector for example, as part of the school organisation plan there should be open consideration of alternative provision through the private sector. It is clear from what the Under-Secretary said on the previous amendment that she does not favour co-operation with the private sector.
<P>
However, there are already many precedents and my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West has asked me to draw to the Committee's attention the current situation in Manchester. Trafford has always funded places at St. Bede's college, a Roman Catholic co-educational grammar school, because similar places are not available in the maintained sector. That precedent at St. Bede's, which has been funded by Cheshire county council since the second world war, was followed by Trafford borough council.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> The amendment would provide the sort of opportunities that were spoken about by my hon. Friend the Membr for Guildford and, indeed, welcomed by the Under-Secretary. In view of her response, should we not expect her to welcome the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The practice adopted by Cheshire county council after the second world war has been continued since 1974 by Trafford borough council. For a long time, authorities of various political persuasions have recognised the merit of filling a gap in children's educational needs by carrying out precisely what the Under-Secretary could not envisage when debating the previous amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes </B>(Stretford and Urmston): Is the hon. Lady aware of the particular circumstances that obtain in that area? They are different from anywhere else in the country. The policy was continued by the Conservative-controlled council because there was a universal 11-plus and because the Catholic Church refused, after consulting Catholic parents, to provide a Church-aided grammar school. There were thus no places for Catholic children passing the 11-plus within either the state or the aided sector. Although I disapprove of that policy, it explains why the policy was continued it was the result of special circumstances that did not pertain elsewhere.
<P>
The hon. Lady might also be interested to know that two of the three independent grammar schools have now come into the state sector through the grant-maintained process. Payment at St. Bede's college has been discontinued by the Labour council because there are now Catholic places at the two grant-maintained grammar schools in the borough.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Lady's comments support my argument. I appreciate her knowledge of the history of schools in that area. However, when legislation is drafted it has to take account not only of what may happen in future, but of what disruption may occur as a result of special circumstances. As the notes of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West clearly show, councils are prepared to be flexible.
<P>
I want to return to the point that I was making before the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes) intervened. This morning Ministers were anxious to impress on the Committee that changes such as the abolition of grant-maintained schools and their return to the maintained sector should be made with as little disruption as possible to the pupils concerned. On more than one occasion, the argument was that it was not so much about schools as about pupils. Yet here we have a clearly defined group of pupils with particular needs. It is entirely reasonable that the Bill should take account of those circumstances. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston is right to say that the situation in the particular part of the country is unique.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster </B>(Bath): It is not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The hon. Gentleman tells me that it is not unique. There are similar circumstances elsewhere, in which case I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his sedentary intervention. Clearly, under clause 21 the Minister must take account of those circumstances and, in his own words, of those children.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I support the principle that underpins the amendment. Some time ago, the Minister was critical of a letter from Mr. Graham Lane. In the letter to which I referred, Mr. Graham Lane wrote about LEAs being the providers of education. The Minister challenged me and asked whether I believed that LEAs were the sole providers of education because he certainly did not. I concurred with the Minister's opinion.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats believe that the key function of an LEA is the strategic planning of education and finding ways to meet the needs that have been identified. However, as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton has said, existing legislation allows many LEAs to purchase provision in the private or other sectors to ensure that those needs are met. That is especially true with special educational needs, where existing legislation enables that to happen.
<P>
I am well aware of many examples, other than that to which the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton referred, where LEAs already purchase provision for special educational needs from the independent school sector to meet the needs of the young people in their areas. I understand that, in a few days, the Independent Schools Information Service is to publish a detailed survey of such co-operation between the state and the independent sector.
<P>
I am also well aware of the interview in The ISIS Magazine, in which the Secretary of State, when he was shadow Secretary of State, made clear, on behalf of the Labour party, his view of the need to find new ways to develop partnerships and co-operation between the state and the independent sector. I entirely concur with that view. As has often been said, we are looking forward to a new system and it is important to find new, constructive forms of partnership between the state and the independent sector.
<P>
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton is absolutely right to say that it is important to ensure that the Committee reflects the desire to find ways to develop such partnerships. However, I am not convinced that the amendment is needed because I understand that, under existing legislation, such arrangements and partnerships are possible. If the Under-Secretary tells us that that is not so and that legislative changes are needed to do what the Secretary of State wants, which we support, we would be prepared to support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I shall speak briefly in support of the amendment. I do so because of the hon. Gentleman's comments, especially those on the purchase of special education outside LEAs.
<P>
One of the jobs that faces any chairman of an LEA is to decide where to place those children who cannot be accommodated either in mainstream schools or in special schools in the LEA. Often that will be in independent or private sector schools because they provide the specialist facilities needed by a child with special educational needs. It would be unfortunate and, I am sure, inadvertent on the Government's part if the clause were to deny that opportunity. As we heard in a previous debate, local education authorities are liaising and co-operating with the private sector to ensure that the needs of all the children in their areas can be met in the way they think best.
<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): Does the hon. Lady have a view on the quality of education? Should the schools to which she is referring be covered by Ofsted reports? I understand that at present they are not.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> It is obviously the duty of any education chairman who determines that a child should go to a special school that is outside the LEA and the state sector to ensure that the education provided in that school is not only appropriate but of the expected quality and standard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does the hon. Lady agree that if there is to be the sort of deal that she describes, which I have already said that I support, when the partnership agreement is drawn up it is important to ensure that the minimum curriculum entitlement of the current national curriculum is being met; that inspections can be carried out by Ofsted or by an organisation approved by Ofsted which may well cover the point raised by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford); that information is reported to parents; and that all the other provisions that we would usually expect for children in the care of the LEA are available? In most such arrangements of which I am aware, such provisions form part of the package.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> As I said earlier in response to the hon. Member for Colne Valley, any LEA that enters into such an arrangement with a private sector provider would have a duty to ensure that the educational provision that it purchased was of an appropriate standard and quality. Given the Government's acknowledgement that such arrangements exist, and are necessary in many areas to ensure that the needs of children in those areas can be properly catered for, I hope that they will accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I just wanted to add my support for the amendment, for the same reason that I supported the previous amendment. I welcome the Under-Secretary's comments on the initiative that has begun in Surrey. On[Mr. St. Aubyn]
the legal point of whether the amendment is necessary to enable such purchases of private sector provision, does she agree that, in the light of earlier debates, it would be unreasonable for the Department to take any action against such initiatives, provided that the local authority was acting within its budget and responsibly?
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that we want that sort of initiative to succeed. We would have no wish to act against the sort of initiative he described. Indeed, we welcome the partnership that is clearly being made in Surrey with the private sector; that is exactly what we want in the interests of children.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) was right to say that the amendment is unnecessary. We will ensure that local authorities can purchase places for special needs pupils in the non-maintained and independent special schools sector, where that is possible. Indeed, one suggestion in the Green Paper on special needs was to relax the constraints on buying from the independent sector by ensuring that the Secretary of State did not have to give case-by-case approval to applications to do so. Those applications currently number about 700 a year they have almost doubled during the past five to 10 years. We suggested devolving that to local authorities.
<P>
On the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley, it is crucial that the institutions concerned are inspected by Ofsted, or by social services if they offer day care. With the new ability to purchase directly from the independent sector, local authorities have a special responsibility to ensure that the youngsters concerned go to places that offer good quality care and education. Having received that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton will agree with withdraw the amendment.

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The amendments are reasonable. Apart from the issue of special educational needs, the Under-Secretary has not addressed the points that I raised in my initial remarks. One of those points related to the need for denominational school places and the gap that exists when they cannot be met in the maintained sector as was clearly the case in the Altrincham and Sale, West constituency. The Under-Secretary did not mention the need for denominational places. If she can satisfy me that an LEA's purchase of those places would also be a legitimate reason, then I would withdraw the amendment. She seems to be focusing only on the issue of special educational needs. I understand her reasons in that case, but will she tell us whether the Government would respond in the same way over the issue of denominational places?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Keep going for a minute, she is still writing.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I am not writing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Under-Secretary is clearly not prepared to make a commitment about denominational places and for that reason I wish to put the amendment to a vote.

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 150, in page 20, line 44, after "3", insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or paragraph 14 of Schedule 6".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a technical amendment to repair a provision in clause 22. The original clause did not state that the provision applied where the need for a new site for a voluntary-aided school was as the result of a statutory proposal. The amendment fills that gap by inserting a reference to paragraph 14 of schedule 6, which deals with the implementation of statutory proposals relating to voluntary-aided schools. I so move.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

Clause 22, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3) Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to a foundation or foundation special school where

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mrs. Browning:</B> These are probing amendments through which Conservative Members seek further information from the Government. I draw the Minister's attention to part I, paragraph 1(1), and its contrast with part II, paragraph 3(1). The first of those provisionsrelates to the obligations of governing bodies of foundation, voluntary-controlled and foundation special schools and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The governing body of a foundation, voluntary controlled or foundation special school are (in accordance with section 22(4)) not responsible for any of the expenses of maintaining the school."</ul></font>
<P>
That is in stark contrast to the definition in part II of those responsibilities and obligations of governing bodies, with respect to voluntary-aided schools.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to know more precisely the thinking behind the different treatment to be given to foundation and voluntary-aided schools. Clearly, voluntary-aided schools have the opportunity although it is not always guaranteed to seek grants of up to 85 per cent. from the Secretary of State. Why can the same not apply to a foundation school? Also, with particular reference to amendment No. 175, why can the Secretary of State not empower the schools to raise money perhaps from the private sector, possibly through private finance initiatives? Then the grant assistance from the Secretary of State could cover not just capital costs but might, in the case of voluntary-aided and foundation schools, compensate for the interest charges relating to current costs. We find it strange that, having designated the categories in question, the Government should propose for them such disparate treatment as to financial arrangements.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In the light of our earlier discussion of the fact that a voluntary-controlled school, as well as voluntary-aided school, may be part of a foundation body, to what extent will the principles laid down the operation of parts I and II of schedule 3 affect a voluntary-controlled school that is part of a foundation body? Perhaps the Minister will again say that I am confusing foundation bodies and foundation schools, but two status appear to be available for voluntary-controlled schools; one is as a stand-alone voluntary-controlled school, the other is as a voluntary-controlled school that has become part of a foundtion body. The foundation body would, according to my reading of the Bill, own the property of the school. It would be a body corporate and the trustees would own the property. What impact would that arrangement have on the financial arrangements set out in part I of schedule 3?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Ladies are absolutely right. Voluntary-aided schools are treated differently from the other categories of schools with respect to capital. That is not an original move by the Government. It dates back to the 1944 settlement between the Church and the state, arising from the Education Act 1944. The Church authorities at that time took the view which they still hold strongly that to maintain their involvement in the work of voluntary-aided schools they should make a contribution of 15 per cent. towards capital costs. The Government effectively fund the remaining 85 per cent. by way of grant. The grant-maintained schools that may be considering foundation status are likely to throw their hands up in alarm at the amendment, which would require foundation schools to receive 85 per cent. of their capital from central Government and find 15 per cent. themselves. I do not know whether the Opposition really want that to happen, but it would not be particularly good news for those grant-maintained schools to which foundation status appears attractive.
<P>
It is true that voluntary-aided schools receive different treatment as to capital. Churches treasure the fact that they make their contribution. They regard it as a contribution from their community to their schools. We discussed with the Churches whether they thought that the arrangement should be altered, such as by changing the split to 90 or 95 per cent. from central Government and a smaller percentage from the Church authorities. However, they held to the view that the settlement of 1944 should roll forward into the Bill. For those reasons, we have maintained the distinction. Opposition Members are right to point out that there is a different approach, but it is supported by the voluntary-aided sector. In the circumstances, it is appropirate to allow that sector to continue with that approach and to fund other categories in the way in which we have outlined. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I said that the amendment was probing and we do not intend to press it. However, will the Minister respond to my point about using the grant for capital expenditure and extending it to underpin interest on current expenditure?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I will try to help. If a school wants permission to borrow money, the revenue cost of the debt charges will fall on individual schools. However, under the new deal arrangements that were introduced in the Budget on 2 July, capital was made available not through permission to borrow, but through grants. Therefore, actual money will be provided to assist with capital spending. Schools have warmly welcomed that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 97, line 17, leave out sub-paragraph (6) and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(6) Any transfer under this paragraph may be made conditional on the persons receiving the transferred property agreeing terms relating to the disposal of other premises which have been used for the purposes of the school and which were wholly or partially financed by funds received from public sector sources.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment seeks clarification about the method transferring money if the local education authority builds a school and transfers it to the governing body. The Bill states that when other capital assets are sold in those circumstances, the books should balance and there should be some return from the sale to the local education authority.
<P>
The Bill should make it clear that its references to assets that are to be disposed of, and the proceeds from their sale returned to the LEA, relate only to property that was initially funded or owned by the public sector. The amendment would protect property that was not in the public domain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Schedule 3 covers circumstances that will rarely arise. If an existing school sells its premises and assets and moves to a new site that is provided and funded by the local education authority, the costs that[Mr. Byers]
the authority incurs should be reimbursed by the proceeds from disposing of the original site. Responsibility for building the original site is irrelevant. The important point is that the local education authority has incurred costs by providing a new site. Therefore, it is appropriate to use the proceeds from the original site to compensate the local education authority irrespective of whether the public sector or a private body was responsible for building and maintaining the original site.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In the case of a part of the asset, such as a sports hall, which may have been provided through private sector money, will the relevant portion of the money from the sale of the site be returned to the private sector? Would the site be considered as one account in terms of reimbursing the LEA?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The essential question is whether the proceeds from the sale of the first site are sufficient to compensate the LEA for its costs in providing the new site. Obviously, if there is a surplus from the sale of the first site, there might be an argument for some of it to be returned to the individual or the company who provided the sports centre. However, if the costs of providing the new site are greater than the proceeds received from the sale of the original site, all the proceeds no matter where they came from will need to be used to compensate the LEA for providing the new site.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I do not intend to press this to a vote and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 179, in page 97, leave out lines 51 and 52.
<P>
Again, we seek clarification from the Minister on the wording in the Bill. This part of the schedule seems to give some protection and safeguards many aspects in regard to the school, but exempts playing fields from the definition of "site" given earlier in the schedule. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`site' does not include playing fields but otherwise includes any site which is to form part of the premises of the school in question."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We would like to understand the thinking behind that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The reason for the omission is that we have good news on how the Government intend to deal with playing fields, which we shall incorporate into a new clause, during Committee stage or on Report. My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Culture I always forget his title [Hon. Members: "Media and Sport"]. Yes, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport although I call it the Department for the Lottery and the other Ministers have reached an agreement on how to tackle the issue of school playing fields. As a result, there will be restrictions on planning and on the sports council being a statutory consultee. The new clause will require any proposal to dispose of a school playing field to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, which will mirror the present provisions for the grant-maintained sector, where every proposal to dispose of an asset has to go to the Secretary of State. That is why it was inappropriate to include playing fields in the definition of "site" in schedule 3.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> In view of that response, could I urge the Minister to introduce that new provision during the Committee stage? We look forward to reading it with interest because one of the themes of the Committee has been, "Wait and see; it will all come along later."
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> Would my hon. Friend clarify my understanding of a point that the Minister has just made? He said that he would bring forward clauses relating to the planning of, and decisions on, the disposal of playing fields. My reading of the schedule I stand to be corrected is that it relates to the definition of "site" in regard to the sums of money that can be used for the purchase and provision of new school premises. As I understand it, excluding playing fields from the definition means that if a school with a playing field is closed and a new school with a playing field is built, necessitating the sale of the old playing field, the LEA would be able to take advantage only of the money raised from the sale of the school site, not that from the playing field.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Indeed. One of the matters of which we are most conscious is that in some cases, when there is a transfer from a school with large playing fields to another school, the value of the land that is freed-up by the transfer can be considerably increased by the granting of planning permission for housing development or for other purposes.
<P>
I trust that when the Minister brings a further surprise package to the Committee all our fears will be allayed. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Third schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I will not detain the Committee. I did not realise that unless I spoke at this point in our proceedings the issues raised this morning about the effect on the PSBR of grant-maintained schools coming under the full ambit of the LEA would be lost.
<P>
The schedule is about the funding of foundation, voluntary-controlled and foundation special schools. We should therefore pause and reflect that, under the terms of the schedule, the opportunity for some financing of schools to be outside the PSBR, which might mean that more money could be spent on them, will be lost.
<P>
When the Minister said earlier that there had been a change in the accounting procedure in December, I referred the matter to the Clerk to the Select Committee on Education and Employment, who was as surprised as I was to hear it. As recently as the last weeks of November, officials from the Treasury explained in great detail why it was appropriate that the borrowing of GM schools was outside the PSBR, whereas borrowing such as that relating to the funding of student loans was within the PSBR. The change therefore came as a great surprise.
<P>
This morning, the Minister could not give us any figures on the effect of the change. Perhaps I can help him. In 1995, the then Minister was asked why GM schools were classified as private sector bodies the power for GM schools to borrow came only 1996. By the time that the annual report was published in March 1997, the amount borrowed in that way was 3 million. However, it may be assumed that between March 1997 and the change in December 1997 it would have been more than that. We are talking about millions of pounds that have been transferred back to the PSBR, which was otherwise outside it. Had the system been allowed to continue, and had GM schools not known that they were facing execution under this Government, we could have considered the total capital spending by GM schools that might have been taken outside the PSBR.
<P>
The figure for total capital expenditure by GM schools was 138 million in 1996-97; the planned expenditure for 1997-98 was 145 million and for 1998-99 it was 143 million. There is a possibility that hundreds of millions of pounds of capital expenditure by schools is not constrained by the PSBR.
<P>
If expenditure falls into the PSBR that has consequences, but the Minister assured us that that will not affect individual schools. We can assume only that that is the case because the lost money has been taken from the contingency reserve. If the Government follow the practice of the previous Conservative Government, any money left in the contingency reserve after all contingencies for the year have been taken care of will be available to spend on, for example, education and health.
<P>
We should not assume that, because the Treasury has waved its wand and said that it will take care of the money, there are no knock-on consequences for schools. There are. Anyone who has had dealings with the Treasury would back up the view that if it takes on borrowing that it thought would be in the private sector, it will certainly take that into account in future allocations of resources the immediate effect being that less money than otherwise might have been spent on schools is left in the contingency reserve at the end of the year. In other words, it is not a cost-free option.
<P>
In view of the change in accounting practice, it would have been open to the Minister and his officials, when drawing up the Bill, to devise a method under which some of the capital spending on schools remained outside the PSBR. We have not been told why the accounting practice was changed there must be a suspicion that it was because it was anticipated that GM schools would be brought within the full ambit of local education authorities and would lose their independent structure, which underpinned the accounting practice.
<P>
It is convenient for the Minister that the change happened and that he has the Treasury's assurance that it will have no immediate impact on the schools in question. However, the wider impact that the PSBR has been added to, and the money available at the end of the year to spend on schools is not as much as it might have been remains.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman referred to Treasury officials attending a meeting of the Select Committee towards the end of November and giving their view that GM sector borrowing and the borrowing from CTCs did not count against the PSBR. He is right. December follows November, and the decision was taken in December by the Office of National Statistics, an independent body over which the Government have no control. [Interruption.] As I said, December follows November. If hon. Members who serve on the Select Committee are concerned about the evidence given, they should call back the people who gave it to give new evidence.
<P>
Whatever the reason, the independent Office of National Statistics, against the advice and strong representations of both the Department of Education and Employment and the Treasury, in the third week of December decided that there should be a redefinition of borrowing by the grant-maintained sector so that it counted against the PSBR. That was the sequence of events.
<P>
For the sake of the record, let us get right the magnitude of the change. The 138 million to which the hon. Member for Guildford referred is not borrowing, but expenditure grant from the Government and does not count against the PSBR. The sum that does count is that which I mentioned this morning 11 million. This is borrowed by the grant-maintained sector, and it is this which will now transfer from outside PSBR to being a call on it.
<P>
The Department for Education and Employment is now making representations to the Office of National Statistics to get it to reconsider its decision on the classification of grant-maintained school borrowing.

<P>

<B>Mrs. May:</B> The treatment of capital expenditure by grant-maintained schools, and the fact that this expenditure was held outside the PSBR, was a factor reported in the Select Committee's response to the Dearing reports. That formed the basis of one of the Select Committee's proposals for future funding of student loans. I am not aware that in the DFEE's response to our report on Dearing, the Government highlighted the fact that this accounting change had taken place. Therefore, I assume that one of the points made in the Select Committee was invalid. Can the Minister comment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not have the details of the Government's response to Dearing to hand, but I am more than happy to find out and write to the hon. Lady about the sequence of events. For the record, the Office of National Statistics has determined that as regards borrowing I stress that by the grant-maintained sector, it should be a call on the PSBR. To reveal the nature of its thinking, it has also decided that CTCs, which are independent schools, should be a call on the PSBR.
<P>
My Department's view is that those decisions are flawed, and we are making the strongest representations to the Office of National Statistics to get it to change its definition of this call upon the PSBR. The decision was taken by the ONS in December, which is why officials from the Treasury and others who appeared before the Select Committee in November were able to say that[Mr. Byers]
they believed that it should not be a call on the PSBR. If hon. Members are concerned about the quality of evidence, they should recall witnesses, who will, I am sure, take them through the arguments and reveal exactly what happened.
<P>
The amount of borrowing is not 138 million that is expenditure but 11 million. We have Treasury cover for that sum, but given the amount involved I doubt whether the contingency will have too much difficulty producing it. I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Guildford, but with the Treasury's help we can overcome this difficulty. The best solution will, I think, be to go back to the reclassification that we have lived with since 1996.
<P>
The hon. Member for Guildford asked why the Bill does not contain a definition that would allow capital to fall outside PSBR. We tried very hard; many hours were spent trying to arrive at a definition of school capital that would fall outside it, but it proved impossible. Indeed, in the light of the decision on CTCs which, legally, are independent schools it would have been impossible to find a definition that would meet the requirements mentioned by the hon. Member for Guildford. If we could have done so, we would have, for all the obvious reasons. We still felt that the GM sector and CTCs would continue to fall outside the PSBR, but this redefinition has changed that. In our representations, we are supported by Treasury colleagues and we hope that the ONS will change its position: so far it has not agreed to redefine what will count against the PSBR.

Question put and agreed to.
