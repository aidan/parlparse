<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000362"></a>The

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b> May I

begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Benton? I have had the

pleasure of serving previously under your chairmanship and that of your

co-Chair, Mr. O&#146;Hara. I look forward to doing so

again.</div> <a name="06051668000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">It may not

feel like it to members of the Committee, but we have now reached part

3, chapter 1 of the Bill. Clause 23 imposes income tax for the year

2006-07. The starting rate of 10p, that we first introduced in 1999,

means that more than 3 million low earners continue to see their

marginal rate of tax halved. We have kept our election promises not to

raise the basic or the top rate of tax, which remain at 22p and 40p

respectively, and the 22p basic rate is the lowest basic rate in the UK

for more than 70 years. The income tax rates set out in the clause are

part of the Government&#146;s commitment to maintaining

macro-economic stability and sound public finances. I commend the

clause to the Committee.</div>

<a name="06051668000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000363"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I, too,

welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. The stand part debate presents an

opportunity to mention the issue of the proposed shortening of filing

deadlines for income tax self-assessment returns, as outlined in the

Carter review that was published at the time of the Budget. The

review&#146;s recommendations were accepted by the Government. For

those submitting their tax returns for the 2007-08 tax year online, the

filing date will be 30 November 2008, whereas for those submitting

their income tax returns on paper, as all Members of the House

currently have to do, the deadline will be 30 September 2008, instead

of the existing filing date of 31 January in the year following the end

of the tax year.</div><a name="06051668000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

consternation that the proposal has caused among tax advisers can be

imagined&#151;they are concerned about the impact that it will have

on them and on their clients. The news section of TaxationWeb has an

&#145;There has been no consultation with taxpayers or agents on this

measure. HMRC should first find out if this idea is practicable before

them.&#146;</div><a name="06051668000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">She

continued:</div><a name="06051668000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This

is putting the &#145;Carter&#146; before the

horse.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000364"></a><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): Is the hon. Gentleman not

aware of the National Audit Office report on tax collection, which was

produced at the end of last year? The NAO, and indeed the Public

Accounts Committee, found that the long deadlines are one of the

reasons why people make mistakes and do not submit their tax returns at

all. That is one of the main reasons for changing the

administration.</div>

<a name="06051668000032"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000365"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The hon. Lady makes an interesting comment and I

shall return later to the report of the Public Accounts Committee.

However, shortening deadlines could also lead to more mistakes and

problems with tax return submission.</div>

<a name="06051668000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tax advisers have good reason

to be concerned about the lack of public consultation. It is certainly

not in line with the HMRC&#146;s guidelines on consultation, and the

lack of consultation has been remedied not by publishing and

circulating a consultation document but by asking professional advisers

to comment on the partial regulatory impact assessment. That is not a

very satisfactory way to gain tax advisers&#146; and their

clients&#146; consent and agreement to the

change.</div><a name="06051668000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other

aspect that concerns me is the impact that the proposals will have on

three key groups: taxpayers, their agents and the HMRC itself.

Taxpayers must produce information to enable them to complete their

returns on time. Hon. Members will know from completing their own tax

returns that, depending on how simple or complex they are, a great deal

of information can be needed. Some of that information is supplied in

line with statutory deadlines. For example, Members should receive a

P60 by 31 May and, where applicable, a P11D by July of each

year.</div> <a name="06051668000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">For other

providers, however, no such statutory requirements exist. Often,

information is provided only on an annual basis&#151;for instance, on

the anniversary of a particular policy or investment&#151;and there

is no consensus on when that information should be received. Taxpayers

will have to wait for information before they complete their tax

returns, and will have a shorter period in which to complete

them.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 153</div><a name="06051668000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Taxpayers in seasonal

occupations are also an issue. We mentioned that topic in debate last

week. Many people who complete self-assessment forms are self-employed

in small owner-managed businesses. They will face challenges when

trying to achieve those deadlines. Businesses will have to use the time

between the end of March and September to finalise their returns. By

bringing forward the filing dates for assessment, the Government will

compress the time that small businesses have to complete their returns

for tax and other purposes, placing an additional burden on

them.</div><a name="06051668000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We know that

certain sectors have seasonal peaks in their work load. A large amount

of the tourism and hospitality sector&#146;s business is done during

the time when the new filing deadlines will require businesses to

complete and finalise their returns. The farming sector spends the time

between July and September bringing in the harvest. Farmers will want

to use those hours to harvest their crops, not to complete income tax

self-assessment

forms.</div><a name="06051668000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we heard on

Thursday, auctioneers and people who work in the art market find their

own seasonal peak in the summer. They too will find it difficult to

produce their returns. According to research undertaken by the

Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, 54 per cent. of its

members feel that the revised dates will have a negative impact on

businesses engaged in seasonal trade. The pressure of assembling the

information required for self-assessment during that period and

completing the form will place additional burdens on individuals at

their busiest time of the

year.</div><a name="06051668000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number of

people will employ agents to complete their tax returns. Such agents

will have issues managing their work load. In April, they will need to

complete year-end returns for the HMRC; in May, they will deal with

P60s on their clients&#146; behalf; in June, they will deal with

P11Ds; and they then normally experience a lull in their work load

until September when some paper returns are finalised and again in

January when returns are finalised.</div>

<a name="06051668000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is not to say that outside

those peaks, agents are twiddling their thumbs. Often, they do audit

and accountancy work on their clients&#146; behalf and offer

high-quality business advice. Such agents will find their work load and

their ability to manage it challenged. Some 91 per cent. of respondents

to research on the impact believe that the Carter review will have a

significant impact on tax agents&#146; working practices.</div>

<a name="06051668000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Agents want to ensure an even

flow of work throughout the year. They have an interest, as does the

HMRC, in doing so. It is easy to forget the scale of operations

undertaken by some tax agents. A medium-sized practice with 13

individuals in its tax department might process as many as 3,500

returns. It normally starts to receive information from the majority of

its clients in early August. By the end of November, a practice of that

size has received back the information required for about 80 per cent.

of its clients, submitted draft returns for approval to about 65 per

cent. and filed about half of those returns with the HMRC already. That

is by November, the latest date under these recommendations for filing

online returns. If the deadlines were brought forward, that would bring

forward the timetable for clients and their agents.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 154</div><a name="06051668000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not just

advisers and their clients who will have a problem; the HMRC needs to

deal with the issue as well. It has two work load peaks, one near the

self-assessment filing date in January and the other at the annual

return deadline in May. The concern is that the arrangements will not

smooth that workload but will bring forward the peaks. The industry

would hope to see taxpayers and agents receiving greater encouragement

to file their returns earlier, so as to spread the work load. Tax

advisers welcome a great deal of Lord Carter&#146;s report, and they

support his proposal to align the inquiry window with the actual,

rather than the statutory, filing date, as they believe that that would

encourage the smoothing of the work load.</div>

<a name="06051668000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) referred to mistakes and

errors in relation to the later filing deadlines. If the deadline were

earlier, advisers, agents and businesses might submit provisional or

estimated figures in order to meet the September deadline for paper

returns or the November one for online

returns.</div>

<a name="06051668000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000366"></a><b class="B">Andrew

Selous</b> (South-West Bedfordshire) (Con): An accountant in

my constituency has informed me that the Revenue website cannot cope

with partnership returns, capital gains or foreign income. Is my hon.

benefit from the two-month

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000367"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> Indeed, and those are not the only types of income

or clients that the Revenue&#146;s website has a problem with.

Members of Parliament cannot submit returns online at the moment. There

is a great deal of work to be done to ensure that agents and their

clients can submit online a range of returns reflecting the complexity

of our tax system.</div>

<a name="06051668000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a

risk that, with the shortening of the deadline, people will submit

estimates or provisional figures. In addition, there is no electronic

system for amending a tax return, so the HMRC will receive manual

amendments that correct, update and revise data submitted online in

accordance with the suggested deadline. As my hon. Friend the Member

for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) said, the current system

for submitting tax returns online has limitations. As well as being

unable to deal with the forms of income that he mentioned, the HMRC

cannot accept additional documentation online so that, too, has to be

submitted in paper format. It is clear that the implementation of the

recommendations of the Carter review will create problems not just for

advisers and their clients but for the HMRC.</div>

<a name="06051668000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Public Accounts Committee

report on theissue contains interesting evidence from the

HMRC. On page 18 of the evidence section of the report,David

Varney, the chairman of the HMRC, says of moving the paper filing

deadline to

September:</div><a name="06051668000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whilst

this would provide a single combined date that already has currency for

SA taxpayers, it would create an un-manageable paper filing peak in

September as well as clashing with the tax credits renewal

peak.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even

the chairman of the HMRC recognises the problems that will be created

by the Carter recommendation to bring forward that filing deadline. The

report contains a graphic illustration of the peaks. The graph on page

16 demonstrates that there are peaks in both September and January for

returns that are filed by post. If we move the deadline for filing

paper returns from January 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 155</div>to September, we will create a huge spike in the HMRC&#146;s work

load, dwarfing the number of returns submitted online at the moment.

Even the HMRC recognised that problem, as did the Public Accounts

Committee&#146;s report, which acknowledged the major peaks in work

load at the time of the September and January filing deadlines and

highlighted issues around smoothing those peaks and improving the

accuracy and efficiency of the tax

system.</div><a name="06051668000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45

am</div><a name="06051668000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,

issues need to be resolved that affect taxpayers, their agents and the

HMRC to ensure that their work loads are dealt with sensibly. It would

be no answer to the PAC&#146;s recommendations for smoothing the work

loads if those of the HMRC, businesses and their advisers are simply

compressed into short spaces of time creating an increase in the number

of errors, estimates and re-statements that would require a long tail

of remedial action.</div><a name="06051668000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is a pity that those changes have not been introduced in line with the

HMRC&#146;s code of practice on consultation. That has caused a great

deal of unhappiness and disappointment among tax advisers. In recent

weeks, we have heard about the importance of consultation and agreement

before major changes from the Treasury, yet it seems keen on

pre-emptive announcements and deadlines for changes. It would have been

far better to have discussed the matter with interested parties, rather

than to have sprung the decision on them without

warning.</div><a name="06051668000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000368"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Before I call the next speaker, may I take this

opportunity to remind the Committee that the clause is about rates and

that although it is not unreasonable to allow those on the Front Bench

a little latitude, we cannot have repetitive debate? I insist on

that.</div><a name="06051668000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000369"></a><b class="B">Julia

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): I shall attempt

to return to the substance of the clause, which is actually very

straightforward because it leaves income tax rates as they have been

for some time.</div> <a name="06051668000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is an issue of fairness. In a fair taxation system, those with higher

incomes should pay a higher proportion of tax than those in the lower

income brackets. In our taxation system, however, the bottom 20 per

cent. of households pay 39.5 per cent. of their gross income in tax,

whereas the top 20 per cent. of earners pay only 34.2 per cent. That

might not be because of the income tax levels themselves, but because

of other increases in, for example, national insurance and council tax,

which year on year have risen above the rate of inflation. That has led

to inequality in the system. What plans does the Financial Secretary

have to make taxation fairer given those inequalities that still exist

despite the existing rates of income

tax?</div><a name="06051668000054"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000370"></a><b class="B">Sir

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I welcome you,

Mr. Benton, to the Chair. I wish to add a brief footnote to the

excellent speech that my hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)

made 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 156</div>from the Front Bench. Much of the Finance Bill has little impact on the

average taxpayer, but the change that he mentioned will by its nature

impact on everybody who submits a tax return. They, and indeed the

Committee, are entitled to a better explanation than the one that we

have had so far for bringing forward the

dates.</div><a name="06051668000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, if we

make those changes, there will be a penalty on those who, for whatever

reason, cannot submit their tax returns electronically. They will have

an earlier filing date. It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary

explained why, 10 years after self-assessment was introduced&#151;I

was the Financial Secretary who introduced it&#151;it is still not

possible for Members or civil servants to submit their tax returns

electronically.</div>

<a name="06051668000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it

would be helpful also if we could have up-to-date figures for the

numbers of tax returns&#151;electronic and paper&#151;submitted

between September and January so that we can see the impact of the

proposed reforms. My hon. Friend referred to such figures from a PAC

report. Those reforms would compress dramatically from July to

January&#151;the current time frame&#151;to July to September or

November, the effective working time in which tax returns are produced.

Inevitably, that will concentrate them more in the holidays. It would

have been better if there could have been slightly more effective

consultation with those involved before those reforms were

introduced.</div> <a name="06051668000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">According

to a survey produced by the Society of Professional Accountants, 84 per

cent. stated that the earlier filing dates were not readily attainable.

I am sure that the Government do not want to introduce a reform that

those who will have to deliver it believe to be unattainable. If the

Government want to move the dates forward, perhaps they could stage the

process and bring them forward one month at a time rather than all at

once. That would allow the accountancy profession and taxpayers more

time to adjust to the demanding schedule that the Government wish to

impose.</div><a name="06051668000058"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000371"></a>John

Healey:</b> Clause 23 sets income tax rates only for the

current financial year, but I have some sympathy with the hon. Member

for Fareham, who tabled amendments to the clause that were judged to be

outside the scope of the Bill. I say to him that the measures following

Carter&#146;s review are not in the Bill. We intend them to be in

next year&#146;s Finance

Bill.</div><a name="06051668000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall pick up the point about consultation made by the right hon.

Member for North-West Hampshire(Sir George Young) and the

hon. Member for Fareham. In July 2005, we asked Lord Carter to advise

us on increasing the usage of the HMRC&#146;s online services. I do

not accept that there has been no consultation. Many representations

were made to Carter&#146;s review team, which contained several tax

agents from different fields. We published Lord Carter&#146;s report

at the Budget, and we issued alongside it a partial regulatory impact

assessment. We specifically invited views and evidence on

Carter&#146;s recommendations from those in the fields involved and

from anyone else, and we have set a deadline of 30 June for those

consultations. There has been plenty of time to contribute and to

influenceLord Carter&#146;s thinking in the preparation of

his report and our thinking on how we may implement his recommendations

in next year&#146;s Finance Bill.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column156" />Column number: 157</div><a name="06051668000060"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000372"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I recognise that certain changes need primary

legislation and will be introduced in the 2007 Finance Bill. It is

interesting to note that evidence to the PAC suggested that the changes

would have to be introduced in this year&#146;s Finance Bill to be

effective, in line with the recommendations of the Carter

report.</div><a name="06051668000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">For a change

of such magnitude, tax advisers would have expected a discussion paper

to be published and debated in the industry, rather than the Carter

review being published and the Government saying that they would accept

its recommendations. They expected a more formal process of

consultation, rather than simply having to comment on the effectiveness

of recommendations that the Government have already committed to accept

and

implement.</div><a name="06051668000062"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000373"></a>John

Healey:</b> I had not yet finished dealing with the process

that we are going through to get in place eventually the measures that

we feel are appropriate following the review that we asked Lord Carter

to make. It is out for consultation and we have invited, and welcome,

views and evidence. I shall take the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments

in Committee as part of that

process.</div><a name="06051668000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland was right to refer us to the

National Audit Office report published in February. I say to the hon.

Member for Fareham that the PAC takes a tougher line thanLord

Carter on the mandatory filing of electronic returns. The purpose of

the Carter review and of implementing its recommendations is quite

clear: it is to have the most efficient tax service and system possible

for taxpayers and to continue to support the necessary and proper

efforts of the HMRC to ensure compliance. I do not want to get into the

detail of Carter&#146;s recommendations; we will have a full

opportunity to do so when next year&#146;s Finance Bill is published.

I simply say that nobody will be required to file a self-assessment

return online. We are looking to simplify the self-assessment to take

as many as possible of those whose tax affairs are relatively simple

out of the self-assessment system

altogether.</div><a name="06051668000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

rightly pointed out that the clause is straightforward, the hon. Member

for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) asked a much more general

question about fairness in the tax system. I remind her that, as a

result of the personal tax and benefit reforms that the Labour

Government have put in place since 1997, in real terms this year,

households will, on average, be &#163;950 better off. Families with

children will, on average, be &#163;1,500 better off and families

with children in the poorest fifth about whom she is worried will, on

average, be &#163;3,400 better

off.</div><a name="06051668000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">When we consider

the income tax rates under the clause alongside the operation of the

tax credit system, about four in 10 families now pay no net tax. A

two-child family earning up to &#163;21,000 as a result of the

combination of the tax and tax credit system pay no net tax. I say to

the hon. Lady that, in my book, that is a fair tax system and it is one

that we are keen to protect and

develop.</div><a name="06051668000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the

contribution of the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire who was

a much more distinguished Financial Secretary. It is still not possible

for Members of Parliament to file their tax 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 158</div>affairs online. He will know that there remain long-standing concerns

about the additional safeguards that are judged appropriate for the tax

affairs and personal data of MPs. There have been lengthy debates on

the subject that, in some cases, pre-date the current Government. That

is why the HMRC still handles those tax returns separately from the

system that is set up for other

taxpayers.</div><a name="06051668000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

with my explanation and my final reassertion of the fact that we expect

to bring forward a packet of measures to implement specific proposals

following Carter in next year&#146;s Finance Bill, when there will be

a full opportunity for the sort of the debate that the hon. Member for

Fareham wants in Committee this morning, the Committee will allow the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000374"></a>John

Healey:</b> I will attempt to be brief on

this clause, too. The Labour Government are committed to maintaining a

modern, fair and competitive corporation tax system. That is becoming

more important in what is increasingly a more flexible and competitive

global trading environment. Since 1997, we have therefore attempted in

part to promote enterprise by reducing the headline rate of corporation

tax from 33 per cent. to 30 per cent., the lowest United Kingdom

corporation tax rate since its introduction. Alongside that, we have

introduced several more targeted measures, including relief for

research and development costs, which we shall debate under future

clauses.</div><a name="06051668000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

will enable corporation tax to be charged for the financial year

2007-08. It sets the main rate for that year at 30 per cent., which is

no change from the current rate. I commend the clause to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051668000073"></a><div class="hs_Para" style="text-align: justify;"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000375"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> The Financial Secretary talked about

competitiveness. Although corporation tax rates have fallen in recent

years and have remained unchanged since 1999, they have been falling in

other developed countries. I should therefore be interested to know

what investigation his Department has carried out into whether the

United Kingdom looks set to remain an attractive place for investment

compared with other countries. I want also want to know his future

projections for revenues from the tax since, in 2004-05, the UK

revenues from corporation tax, excluding North sea oil, represented 2.6

per cent. of the total tax take. Including North sea oil revenues, the

figure is 3.3 per cent., which is very high for countries in the

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. I shall be

interested to know what future implications he thinks that that will

have for competitiveness. Are the taxes are being relied on more

heavily because of the commitment not to increase income

taxes?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000379"></a>John

Healey:</b> The clause introduces schedule 1 and together,

they provide for a small extension to the group loss relief rules for

companies, which will allow UK groups to claim corporation tax relief

for foreign losses in some very limited circumstances. I put it on the

record so that it is clear that existing group relief rules for UK

losses, which business is understandably keen to retain, are unaffected

by the proposal.</div>

<a name="06051668000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government are introducing this small extension to group relief

following the decision last December by the European Court of Justice

in the case of Marks &amp; Spencer <i class="I">v. </i>Halsey. In that case, the

court ruled that the UK&#146;s group loss relief rules are in

principle compatible 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 160</div>with European law, but they go too far in denying relief for foreign

losses in some narrowly defined circumstances: where a UK parent

company can show that a foreign subsidiary has exhausted all

possibilities of relief in its state of residence.</div>

<a name="06051668000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">With effect from 1 April this

year, our domestic tax legislation will be changed by the clause to

reflect the decision taken by the European Court of Justice, making it

clear that relief will be available in some limited circumstances to a

UK parent company and its UK subsidiaries for the tax loss of a foreign

subsidiary. That foreign subsidiary must either be resident in the

European economic area or have made the loss in a permanent

establishment based in the European economic area.</div>

<a name="06051668000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule 1 sets out new

conditions and rules. To ensure that they are observed the UK claimant

company will be responsible for showing that all the conditions for the

new relief are met. That is necessary because losses surrendered under

the new rules will be from foreign companies that are not generally

subject to UK law. Although the relief will be available only in the

narrow circumstances set out in the schedule, the Government became

aware that some people were planning arrangements with the aim of

obtaining relief in the UK where it would not otherwise have been

available. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General announced on 20

February that relief in the UK would be denied where such arrangements

are made. The schedule contains provisions that will give effect to the

announcement from that

date.</div><a name="06051668000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.

Benton, you are encouraging us to debate new clause 7 at the same time

as clause and schedule stand part, so perhaps I may take briefly the

opportunity to deal with it. It is interesting that it was tabled by

the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke), rather than

his party&#146;s Front Bench spokesmen, and it will be interesting to

see what they do if he presses it to a

vote.</div><a name="06051668000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">This

is an extraordinary new clause; it could have been drafted by the

European People&#146;s party in the European

Parliament&#151;perhaps it was. Its intention is clearly to pretend

that the European Union does not exist and, therefore, has no impact on

the UK tax system. I explained earlier why, in our view, clause 27 and

schedule 1 are necessary and reasonable. Just as importantly, we cannot

renege on our treaty commitments in the way that the new clause

encourages and suggests that we do; it is impossible for us to do that.

Simply seeking to say that existing legislation applies notwithstanding

the European Communities Act 1972, does not set aside those

commitments, even though the hon. Gentleman may wish to do

that.</div><a name="06051668000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

the important central point, it is right&#151;it is the

Government&#146;s clear policy&#151;that member states should have

the power to determine the shape of their own tax systems. Other treaty

provisions make it clear that that competence is preserved. We are not

endangering that power to determine our own tax policy by introducing

the clause and the schedule; we are simply aligning our law with the

latest developments in European Union jurisprudence in an area

specifically related to the internal

market.</div><a name="06051668000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,

clause 27 and schedule 1 make provision for a small extension to the

group relief legislation, to make it clear how relief from foreign 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 161</div>losses will be available in certain narrow circumstances, and enable us

to preserve existing group relief for UK losses. I commend the clause

to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051668000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000380"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I am

grateful for the opportunity to speak on the clause and on new clause

7. As the Financial Secretary said, the purpose of clause 27 and

schedule 1 is to ensure that our group relief laws comply with the

European Court of Justice judgment in the Marks &amp; Spencer case.

This is not the first occasion&#151;nor will it be the last&#151;on

which it is necessary for us to amend our taxation laws to comply with

ECJ judgments. I raised the significance of the impact of the ECJ on

our corporation tax law during Second Reading and I have no intention

of running through the complete history of this matter

again.</div><a name="06051668000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is also worth noting that there is a widespread consensus in the UK in

opposition to tax harmonisation, particularly relating to direct

taxation. I welcome the Financial Secretary&#146;s saying that it is

right that we determine our own tax policy. The Chancellor of the

Exchequer has stated

that</div><a name="06051668000293"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we must explicitly

reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should lead

inexorably to tax

harmonisation&#148;.</div><a name="06051668000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is sometimes tempting to think that tax harmonisation is simply about

rates, but it is not. It is broader than that; it is also about

exemptions, reliefs and thresholds. Although the Financial Secretary

states that it is right that we determine our own tax policy and this

measure is only to align group relief with regard to the latest

developments in EU jurisprudence, it cannot be considered in isolation.

Since 1996, a series of judgments by the ECJ has determined that our

tax laws have not been in compliance with European law in respect of

provisions relating to freedom of establishment under the single

market.</div><a name="06051668000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">When

this matter was debated on Second Reading, the Paymaster General was

understandably quick to point out that this is Conservative legislation

and that the various ECJ judgments are a consequence of that. However,

it is also worth pointing out that at the time of the Single European

Act there was no expectation that the various freedoms of establishment

and other freedoms set out in that Act would apply to direct taxation.

There was no explicit mention of direct taxation. All attempts at

giving EU institutions jurisdiction over direct taxation had been

rejected by member states. There was also an argument, widely accepted

until relatively recently, about the need for fiscal cohesion, and

therefore that single market provisions should not be used to strike

down national laws.</div>

<a name="06051668000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Marks

&amp; Spencer case determined that it was in breach of European law to

allow profits and losses made by UK residents to be offset against each

other but not to allow losses made by a subsidiary resident outside the

UK, but in the EU, to be offset against the UK group company. As a

consequence, the Finance Bill amends our law with the intention of

complying with this judgment and subsequent judgments made in the UK

courts. But as I said, this is not the first case and it will not be

the last where we are required to do this.</div>

<a name="06051668000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consortium relief, advance

corporation tax and thin capitalisation rules have all had to be

reformed as a consequence of ECJ judgments. In addition to the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 162</div>reforms of group relief being discussed today, we can expect the ECJ to

determine against the UK in respect of franked investment income, and

even since Second Reading, the Advocate-General has determined that our

rules in respect of controlled foreign companies are illegal. The cost

of these judgments to the UK Exchequer is considerable. Vast amounts of

tax have to be repaid and the estimates that I have seen suggest that

the cost to the Treasury of the Marks &amp; Spencer case will be in the

region of &#163;3 billion to &#163;4 billion. I would be interested

to know what the Treasury estimates the ongoing annual cost of

implementing the provisions contained in clause 27 and schedule 1 will

be, as compared with being able to maintain the previous position, as

my new clause 7

proposes.</div><a name="06051668000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

those who argue that the change to the law in these circumstances,

specifically in relation to group relief, is a good thing and that UK

companies will ultimately benefit from the reform of group relief. That

may well be the case. However, taken as a whole, I take the view that

even with this Government&#151;I am clearly not a

supporter&#151;the best interests of the country will be served if

decisions about our tax system are taken by the democratically elected

legislature of this country and not by a group of Luxembourg-based

judges.</div><a name="06051668000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

brings me to the purposes behind my newclause 7. As the

Financial Secretary has pointed out, new clause 7 amends section 413 of

the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to state that the existing

group relief rules shall continue in effect, notwithstanding the terms

of the European Communities Act 1972. It reinstates the legal position

as existed prior to the Marks &amp; Spencer case. It sets out the law

which this Parliament determined and says that that law shall continue

to apply. It sets out the law which the Government wished to maintain

throughout the Marks &amp; Spencer case. It will also save the Treasury

several billion

pounds.</div><a name="06051668000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will it be

treated as valid by the UK courts? At this point, and at the risk of

sounding like my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), I need to

turn to the Factortame case&#151;not that there is anything wrong in

sounding like my hon. Friend. The Factortame case will be familiar at

least to the lawyers among

us.</div><a name="06051668000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000381"></a><b class="B">Rob

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): Three of

them.</div><a name="06051668000101"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000382"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> Not nearly enough, but we will make a start there.

In brief and to simplify, the Factortame cases related to the Merchant

Shipping Act 1988, which determined that in respect of shipping quotas,

the UK quotas would be available only for UK persons. The ECJ

determined that this was in breach of EU law. The House of Lords

determined that the terms of the European Communities Act 1972 meant

that the terms of EU treaties were to be incorporated into UK law and

existing and future Acts of Parliament are subject to EU

law.</div><a name="06051668000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consequently, the

Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, which contains the corporation

group relief provisions, is subject to the provisions of EU law, as

determined by the ECJ. The Act, in its present form, cannot stand

because it is inconsistent with EU law, as the Financial Secretary

rightly says. Consequently, the Government have considered it necessary

to modify the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 163</div>law in order to comply with the views of the ECJ. However, the will of

the current democratically elected legislature is not necessary for the

case law of the ECJ to override the 1998 Act. Our role is to plug the

gap in the least damaging way possible.</div>

<a name="06051668000318"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15

am</div><a name="06051668000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

explore the alternative approach that is set out in new clause 7. It is

to state explicitly that UK law in its existing, enacted form continues

to apply, notwithstanding any contrary principle of EC law. Returning

to the Factortame cases, the essence of the judgment was the European

Communities Act 1972. It entrenched EC law by giving it the capacity to

override a later statute. The statute in question, the Merchant

Shipping Act 1988, did not purport to repeal or exclude the effect of

the European Communities Act. That gives rise to the essential question

whether a later statute may, by express words, repeal or exclude the

effect of the European Communities Act in giving effect to EC

law.</div>

<a name="06051668000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

suggestion that the 1972 Act cannot be repealed or overridden is

surprising, even if that is Parliament&#146;s express intention. If

that is not the case, the whole concept of parliamentary sovereignty is

thrown out of the window. Some constitutional experts have suggested

that that is the natural consequence of the Factortame decision and

that the ECJ case law is for the supremacy of EC law. Reassuringly, the

English Court of Appeal has refused to accept the argument. In Thorburn

<i class="I">v</i>. Sunderland City Council, the weights and measures or metric

martyr case, Lord Justice Law

stated:</div><a name="06051668000294"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Whatever

may be the position elsewhere, the law of England disallows any such

assumption. Parliament cannot bind its successors by stipulating

against repeal, wholly or partly, of the 1972 Act. It cannot stipulate

as to the manner and form of any subsequent legislation. It cannot

stipulate against implied repeal any more than it can stipulate against

express repeal. Thus there is nothing in the 1972 Act which allows the

Court of Justice, or any other institutions of the EU, to touch or

qualify the conditions of Parliament&#146;s legislative supremacy in

the United Kingdom. Not because the legislature chose not to allow it;

because by our law it could not allow it. That being so, the

legislative and judicial institutions of the EU cannot intrude upon

those conditions. The British Parliament has not the authority to

authorise any such thing. Being sovereign, it cannot abandon its

sovereignty. Accordingly there are no circumstances in which the

jurisprudence of the Court of Justice can elevate Community Law to a

status within the corpus of English domestic law to which it could not

aspire by any route of English law

itself.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000105"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000383"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s remarks are

becoming more generalised. Will he come back specifically to new clause

7?</div><a name="06051668000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000384"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Benton. I will not proceed with

the quotation, but the direction in which it is going is clear. The

purpose behind new clause 7 is to state that the law made by this

legislature stands. An argument that may be used against it is that

European Union law stands above it. There is nothing that we can do. It

would be ineffective. There is an argument that new clause 7 would be

entirely ineffective and that the British courts would not recognise

it.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 164</div><a name="06051668000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view and

that of numerous judicial authorities is that, where Parliament

determines, as I propose it does in new clause 7, that an element of

European Community law will not stand, Parliament&#146;s will

prevails. I should be grateful to know later in the debate whether the

Financial Secretary agrees with that interpretation and whether we have

that power. That still leaves the issue of our EU treaty obligations. I

fully accept that were new clause 7 to be accepted and to become law,

there are enormous issues with regard to our treaty obligations. I have

no doubt that enforcement action would be taken by the European

institutions against the UK. I should be grateful to know what

assessment, if any, the Government have made of the likelihood of such

action, and what the sanctions or fines are likely to be. I raise the

matter because the fiscal costs of the various changes to EU law are

considerable&#151;I am talking about billions. We need, at least, to

be able to evaluate all the options that are available to us.</div>

<a name="06051668000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">My purpose in raising the

issue, both on Second Reading and today by speaking to new clause 7,

has been to highlight the increasing interference in our tax law by the

EU. Secondly, I am trying to obtain a clear statement of Government

policy on the matter, both in respect of the M &amp; S case and more

generally. Thirdly, I hope to clarify the constitutional position: has

Parliament the right to insert an explicit override of EU law within

legislation, and do the Government expect UK courts to recognise the

validity of such an override?</div>

<a name="06051668000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ECJ has played a prominent

role in our deliberations during the last few sittings of this

Committee. We have seen how it has damaged our competitiveness in the

art market, and how the Government&#146;s strategy to tackle missing

trader intra-Community fraud has been scuppered by an ECJ judgment. Now

we see that our corporation tax laws are being fundamentally amended

because of the ECJ. We have to ask who should decide our tax

laws&#151;the democratically elected UK Parliament, accountable to

the British people, or the judges of the ECJ? Is our purpose merely to

implement our instructions from European institutions, and do we really

think that that would be to the long-term benefit of our tax system and

our economy? This might not be the time or place to determine such

matters, but we have a responsibility to ask those

questions.</div>

<a name="06051668000110"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000385"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I congratulate my hon. Friend on the way in which

he made his case for new clause 7. He was right to highlight the way in

which the ECJ is shaping the direct tax system in the UK. Of course, he

refers particularly to the Marks &amp; Spencer case, which underpins

this clause and the schedule. When we discuss amendments to the

schedule, I shall come to some of the issues arising from that case and

the way in which the Government have responded to that

judgment.</div>

<a name="06051668000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should

reflect on the fact that the case brought by Marks &amp; Spencer used

two articles&#151;articles 43 and 48, relating to the freedom of

establishment and the equality of treatment of member states&#151;to

argue the point that group relief should be available in the UK for

losses incurred by overseas subsidiaries. Those articles have been used

by businesses in other countries to amend or to force through changes

to their own tax legislation. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 165</div>My hon. Friend mentioned the changes in capitalisation rules&#151;I

think that they were in the Finance Act 2005&#151;that stemmed from a

case that sought to unpick the rules on capitalisation in Germany that

favour German businesses to the detriment of other businesses located

there. In a way, that action helped the UK heads of corporate

businesses to try to dismantle barriers in

Germany.</div>

<a name="06051668000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000386"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> It is also worth pointing out that, as a

consequence of that case, we have had to amend laws that imposed a

considerable bureaucratic burden on UK companies in order to show that

transactions within a group took place on an arm&#146;s length

basis.</div>

<a name="06051668000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000387"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> Indeed. As happens in such cases, if the

determination of a matter of European law affects one member state, it

might well have to be applied to other member states. A tax adviser has

told me that the ECJ is interested not in tax avoidance in a particular

member state but in tax avoidance that takes place across the European

Union as a whole. There will inevitably be situations in which changes

in one jurisdiction will lead to changes in other

jurisdictions.</div>

<a name="06051668000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend made an eloquent case for effectively carving out direct taxes

from the implications of the Single European Act, as that Act has been

used to bring the case before us. However, we need to think carefully

about the implications of doing so. He made a powerful argument in the

context of tax, but I am sure that other legislatures could make

equally powerful arguments about other matters covered by the Single

European Act. Those seeking to withstand market liberalisation measures

introduced by the Act might see a UK carve-out as an argument for a

carve-out to protect their own services. Those Governments that seem

inclined to protect their own businesses and withstand cross-border

flows of transactions might see the carve-out as a reason to seek their

own carve-outs from the Single European

Act.</div><a name="06051668000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we carve out

direct taxes, what will other member states seek to carve out? We must

be careful how we tackle the issue, because of what the consequences

might be. Although we all subscribe to what the Chancellor

said&#151;</div><a name="06051668000295"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we must

explicitly reject old flawed assumptions that a single market should

lead inexorably to tax

harmonisation&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051668000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">the

legislative bite required to put it into effect might have a knock-on

effect on aspects of our relationships with other member

states.</div><a name="06051668000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come to

another issue concerning the judgment and its application through the

clause and schedule&#151;the Government&#146;s consideration of the

ECJ judgment and its elaboration by Mr. Justice Park in the High Court.

I shall deal in more detail later with the point that the

Government&#146;s interpretation of the ECJ&#146;s judgment is far

narrower than Mr. Justice Park&#146;s. He said in his judgment that

he did not feel he needed to return to the ECJ to clarify certain

points left ambiguous as a consequence of its judgment; he felt that he

could do that himself.</div>

<a name="06051668000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government&#146;s interpretation and implementation of changes to

group relief that are narrower thanMr. Justice Park&#146;s

judgment creates a risk that businesses will challenge schedule

1&#146;s interpretation of the ECJ&#146;s judgment, that they will

push the Government on issues 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 166</div>of timing, arrangements and other aspects and that the Government will

incur great costs defending its narrow interpretation of the ECJ, to

taxpayers&#146;

detriment.</div><a name="06051668000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall

make one specific point on the Government&#146;s consideration of the

application of ECJ judgments to tax policy. Some would argue that

although the judgment in the Marks &amp; Spencer case dealt

specifically with group relief, which is available only when a parent

owns 75 per cent. or more of the subsidiary, it should also apply to

consortium relief and the rules for claiming group relief should be

reflected in the rules for claiming consortium relief. It is argued in

the light of the ECJ judgment that businesses will seek to take the

Government to court in the ECJ, saying that if the Government are going

to apply the ECJ&#146;s judgment on group relief in a particular way,

they should also make the same applications and changes to rules for

consortium

relief.</div><a name="06051668000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000388"></a>John

Healey:</b> The hon. Gentleman gives a reasoned exposition of

his views, but he has not been clear about where he stands on new

clause 7. Does he support it or

not?</div><a name="06051668000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000389"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I think that I have given that explanation clearly

already by highlighting some of the issues and the thought required

before such a clause is put to a vote. I hope that, in the light of my

remarks and given the thought that needs to go into how such a change

might be implemented, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West

Hertfordshire will seek the Committee&#146;s leave to withdraw the

new

clause.</div><a name="06051668000319"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

am</div><a name="06051668000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000390"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. New clause 7 has not been moved, so there

will be no necessity to withdraw

it.</div><a name="06051668000123"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000391"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am grateful. That will give my hon. Friend even

more time to think about the matter before it is dealt with towards the

end of our

proceedings.</div><a name="06051668000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

conclude by saying that this stand part debate has raised important

issues about the application of European law to tax. We cannot see it

in isolation from the wider issues of reducing barriers to business

across Europe, which we must examine carefully. We must remember that

much of our economic success at home and abroad is due to the free

movement of capital, both human and financial. We should be wary of

making changes that, while satisfying us on one issue, damage us on a

broader range of

issues.</div><a name="06051668000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000392"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Fareham for

rebuking the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire on new clause 7,

perhaps better than I could have done. The new clause would be a first

step towards taking us back to 1971, before the Heath Government

rightly negotiated our accession to the European Union&#151;the

Common Market, as it was then called. It is a wrecking amendment and

would wreck the UK&#146;s position within the European Union. The

hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire was quite clear about that. He

cited various cases, but as his colleague the hon. Member for Fareham

pointed out, European Union law is a two-way process.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 167</div><a name="06051668000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-West

Hertfordshire mentioned the Factortame case; I assume that he meant

Factortame No. 1 rather than No. 2 or No. 3. He did not talk about the

debate within the EU, which is perhaps too wide for us to discuss

today, on the horizontal applicability of directives in

contra-distinction to their political applicability, or about cases

such as Foster <i class="I">v. </i>British Gas and the Francovich case in Italy

on the applicability of EU directives. The EU is now a club of 25

members, all of which, including the United Kingdom, are at least in

theory bound by the same laws. If new clause 7 were accepted, we would

be seeking to opt out of that arrangement and see ourselves as distinct

from the EU. The huge risk is that other member states would do the

same, and we would end up with a fragmented EU. That would not be in

the interests of the UK. In particular, it could adversely affect the

position of the UK in financial markets, as the hon. Member for Fareham

said.</div> <a name="06051668000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">London is the

financial centre of the EU; most people would accept that, although

perhaps the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire would not. One of

the ways in which we have built on that position is by taking advantage

of the financial rules of the European Union, which are binding on all

25 member states at least in theory and often in practice. If we were

to start to resile from those rules, it would weaken the position of

London and the UK within the EU, to our detriment. It might satisfy the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s view of where the UK should be going as a

sovereign state, but it would be something of a little Englander

approach and an own goal in financial matters. We have the leading

centre within the European Union, a position that has been built upon

in large part, though not solely, due to our membership of the EU. New

clause 7 would seek to wreck that, and I urge my hon. Friends to vote

against it if it is pressed to a

Division.</div><a name="06051668000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000393"></a>John

Healey:</b> I appreciate the reasonable way in which the hon.

Member for South-West Hertfordshire put forward his entirely

unreasonable proposal. He has many colleagues who take an equally

hostile view of the European Union but have generally framed their

arguments in a less temperate

tone.</div><a name="06051668000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member

for Fareham was interesting. He encouraged the hon. Member for

South-West Hertfordshire to a point and then urged him to be cautious,

particularly on the concept of carve-outs, for which he was arguing. My

hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was much clearer

and more direct about the risks that such an approach might pose to our

national economic

interest.</div><a name="06051668000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

a number of points, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire

touches on the high principles of domestic and European Union

jurisprudence. The simple legal fact at the heart of the matter is that

the relevant Community laws are those concerning fundamental freedoms

prescribed by European Community treaties and relating to cross-border

movement between member states.</div>

<a name="06051668000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Gentleman also asked about costs. It is true that following judgment in

the Marks &amp; Spencer plc case, several reports suggested that the

cost to the Exchequer would be high. However, they reported the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 168</div>outcome of the case in a way that was misleading;the judgment

of the European Court of Justice was much narrower than was implied in

those reports. The Government estimate that the cost to the Exchequer

of the small extension of group relief proposed in this clause and

schedule 1 as a result of the Marks and Spencer judgment, will be about

&#163;50 million a year. That estimate was set out and reflected in

the Budget documentation. The Government are prepared to accept that

cost in order to maintain the existing group relief that we believe is

important and beneficial to UK

business.</div><a name="06051668000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.

Member for Fareham made a number of points which, as he said, we will

come on to in more detail later, but it is appropriate that I return to

two of his points now. He took the Government to task by saying that

the provisions in the clause and schedule are in fact narrower than Mr.

Justice Park&#146;s judgment. We have studied the ECJ&#146;s

judgment carefully and consider that the proposed extension to the

group relief legislation is in line with the requirements in the EC

treaty. The ECJ&#146;s decision was very narrow&#151;a view that

has been reinforced by Advocate General Geelhoed. <i class="I">[Interruption.]

</i>I should spell that out for the Committee. The Advocate said that

the judgment should be applied

restrictively.</div><a name="06051668000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked about consortium relief.

I am not sure if he is aware, but consortium relief is minute in

comparison with group relief and typically accounts for less than a

quarter of 1 per cent. of the volume and value of group relief. So we

have concentrated our efforts on the effects of group relief because

that has the greatest impact and effect on business. To be direct, the

implications for consortium relief of the Marks &amp; Spencer judgment

are unclear, and we are still considering what&#151;if

any&#151;consequences there might be. If we judge that it is

appropriate to take action, we will do so, but only if we feel that it

is necessary. I commend the clause to the Committee and if the hon.

Gentleman wishes to press his new clause, I shall ask my hon. Friends

to oppose

it.</div><a name="06051668000134"></a>

we evaluate our relationship with the European Union, it is important

to take into account both the credit and debit sides. The purpose of

new clause 7 is to highlight one of the disadvantages of our

relationship with the European Union. Our tax system is being changed

to our disadvantage, which is making it more difficult for the

Government to raise revenue through corporation tax in the way that

they would like. There is also a constitutional point about how there

has been no consent from this House that direct taxation, in

particular, should be a matter for the European Union. However, one has

to accept that there is a wider picture. There are undoubted advantages

to our membership of the European Union: anything that means that Peter

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000398"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The amendments concern the specific way in which

the Government have chosen to implement the ECJ judgment, and I want to

talk about something that the Financial Secretary highlighted in the

clause stand part debate. He referred to a statement made by his right

hon. Friend the Paymaster General in February, about the Government

trying to close down any attempts made by UK companies to use the Marks

&amp; Spencer judgment to claim group relief and to enter into what was

described as relevant arrangements to enable group relief to be

claimed.</div>

<a name="06051668000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to

probe the arguments of the Financial Secretary about the clauses that

concern those arrangements. It is fair to say that if someone were

setting up a UK-based group of companies, they would seek to ensure

that the shareholdings were such that they were able to claim group

relief if losses were incurred in trading operations. They would check

that they could offset the losses in one company against the profits in

another for tax purposes. I would argue that that is a legitimate form

of tax planning from the outset. Following the Marks &amp; Spencer

case, my belief would be that a UK parent company setting up

subsidiaries overseas would, when starting up a new operation or new

business, seek to structure the shareholdings so that they qualified

for group relief. It may be that rather than encouraging an overseas

investor to buy 30 per cent. of a subsidiary, they might ask that

investor to buy just 24 per cent., so that they could qualify for group

relief, and set up such arrangements from the outset. That is a

perfectly reasonable form of tax planning.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 170</div><a name="06051668000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, there may be

circumstances in which other arrangements are put in place, which would

enable businesses to claim group relief on losses incurred by overseas

subsidiaries. I should like to run through a few examples, to try to

tease out from the Minister where he thinks the boundary lies between

what he thinks is a sensible arrangement as part of the normal

structure of a group and arrangements that might, in his view and that

of the Treasury, be deemed to be tax avoidance. When companies are

looking at structuring their businesses overseas, they need some

certainties and some clarity.</div>

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): With respect to the hon.

regime for tax relief for groups of companies throughout the European

Union, which I understand is the essence of the judgment&#151;and

also argue that it is wrong of the UK Government to narrow the proposal

as far as possible so that Marks &amp; Spencer does not take

over-advantage of that situation? Is the hon. Gentleman in favour of

Marks &amp; Spencer getting away with it or is he in favour of

narrowing down to the bare minimum? Which is

it?</div><a name="06051668000320"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000400"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am in favour of proper implementation of the ECJ

judgment in the Marks &amp; Spencer case. I will come to two issues

that are connected with that matter in the next group of amendments.

The schedule refers to relevant arrangements to enable companies to

claim group relief. Anyone setting up a group structure from scratch

and determining its structure would think about how to ensure that if

losses do arise&#151;no company sets out to make losses&#151;they

can flow through to UK tax computation and be offset against UK tax and

profits. That is legitimate

planning.</div><a name="06051668000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,

I am concerned about where the line is drawn between legitimate

planning and the actions that people might take in order to make losses

eligible for UK tax relief at a later date. There might be some tax

structuring at the start of a new business opportunity, but people may

find that the arrangements they make further on in the process,

especially their choices about changes to group structures, for

example, could make some losses eligible for relief in the UK,

depending on their actions.</div>

<a name="06051668000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">To

help the hon. Gentleman, I give the example of a minority shareholder

in an overseas company in which the UK parent owns 60 per cent. and a

minority shareholder owns 40 per cent. If the minority shareholder

exercises a put option, and requires the UK parent to buy those shares,

which puts it over the 75 per cent. threshold for claiming group

relief, the arrangements have not actually been made at the behest of

the UK parent. If that happened as a consequence of actions by the

minority shareholder, those actions will act as a trigger and enable

the UK parent to claim group relief on the losses, assuming that there

is no other way of obtaining relief in the country where the overseas

subsidiary is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 171</div>located. However, because it is not their action or at the

parent&#146;s direction, they have not entered into the relevant

arrangements for the purposes of securing group

relief.</div><a name="06051668000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard

of cases in which the parent company may deliberately buy out the

minority shareholding and decide to close down the operation, and in

doing so goes over the 75 per cent. threshold, which in principle would

render those overseas losses eligible for group relief in the UK. If

that is the case and the parent actively seeks to acquire that minority

interest, does that fall within the remit of the anti-avoidance

provisions in the schedule?</div>

<a name="06051668000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are trying to understand

what actions a company can legitimately take that will trigger group

relief which will not be picked up by the anti-avoidance claims. Is

structuring from the outset okay? Will transactions later on fall

inside or outside the anti-avoidance regulations? That is not clear, as

the wording in the schedule is quite broad. People have a legitimate

interest in understanding where the Government and HMRC will draw the

line when considering what is permissible and what is not in relation

to the structures of group

companies.</div><a name="06051668000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000401"></a>John

Healey:</b> It is intended that the

amendments should, as the hon. Member for Fareham said, alter certain

detailed rules which would otherwise&#151;as the clause and schedule

are drafted&#151;prohibit relief under the schedule in some

circumstances. They would remove some of the protections in the

legislation that prevent groups of companies from entering arrangements

with a view to obtaining tax relief in the UK for foreign

losses.</div><a name="06051668000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

should like to deal with some of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions

about the scope of our proposals. The European Court of Justice only

expects cross-border loss relief in narrow circumstances, therefore it

is important that we ensure in legislation that that is given effect

and cannot be manipulated. The judgment in the Marks &amp; Spencer case

also makes it clear that Governments can adopt measures to prevent

companies from seeking to achieve a tax benefit in one jurisdiction

rather than another&#151;in other words, choosing in which

jurisdiction they will obtain relief for the losses. Just to be clear,

the legislation does not prevent the movement of business activities.

Section 403G only prevents loss relief from being obtained in the UK

where a main purpose of the arrangements is to obtain group relief in

the UK. That is the central provision, which, in some senses, answers

the hon. Gentleman&#146;s specific questions. I cannot give him a

judgment on hypothetical or individual taxpayers&#146; cases. The

purpose is to consider the motive in each particular case and instances

would have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. HMRC has established

procedures, with advisers and business, for doing just

that.</div><a name="06051668000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

summary, I am concerned because the amendments would remove some of the

important protections in the legislation. I am surprised that the

Opposition have tabled such amendments. I should be interested to hear

the hon. Gentleman say whether these are probing amendments, because he

is trying to be much more generous with UK tax. It is not possible to

be precise about the costs of the amendments, but 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 172</div>without the protection that they seek to remove, the potential for

abuse, which is our main concern, runs into hundreds of millions of

pounds a year.</div><a name="06051668000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division, but

if he does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose

it.</div><a name="06051668000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000402"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am slightly disappointed with the Financial

Secretary&#146;s response to the amendments, because people are

looking for a greater degree of clarity about what the fairly broad

paragraphs in the schedule are seeking to achieve. He referred to

assessing the motive in each case and the procedures that the Revenue

and Customs have to assess the purpose of transactions. I can see a

range of corporate transactions that people could enter

into.</div><a name="06051668000156"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000403"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give

way?</div><a name="06051668000157"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000404"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I shall just finish this

point.</div><a name="06051668000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of those

transactions are currently regarded as legitimate and acceptable and

others would unlock the losses for relief in the UK after a loss had

arisen and some group structuring had taken place. The Financial

Secretary is trying to capture such transactions in this anti-avoidance

provision in respect of groups that undertake restructuring to unlock

those losses for use in the UK, perhaps where there is an overseas

subsidiary with an external shareholder with more than 25 per cent. of

the shares in the company and some transactions have been entered into

that change the direction or benefit of the taxpayers. We ought really

to have some greater clarity on

that.</div><a name="06051668000159"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000405"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> Is it not simply this? We have a judgment which

we did not want and we are seeking to narrow that judgment down to

protect the Rvenue in this country. Does he not

agree?</div><a name="06051668000160"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000406"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I referred to that point in my earlier remarks. We

want to see the judgment properly implemented. In doing so, we also

need to give some clarity to taxpayers on the implication of that,

particularly where actions are taken to minimise the scope for abuse

and where we are looking for greater direction and clarity from the

Government. I regret to say that I do not think that the Financial

Secretary offered that clarity in this matter.</div>

<a name="06051668000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said at the outset, these

are probing amendments. I will not push them to a vote but I hope that

the Financial Secretary will reflect on ways in which further guidance

can be given to taxpayers on the breadth of these anti-avoidance

techniques. Would they inhibit or catch groups that were set up as

perfectly legal and sensible business arrangements, but to which the

Revenue might impute the motive of being set up to enable group losses

to be relieved at some time in the future if a business is loss-making?

Unless the Financial Secretary has further clarification to offer, I

beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051668000162"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000409"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> These amendments deal with two different areas

within the judgment of the European Court and particularly refer back

to the judgment of Mr. Justice Park on 10 April 2006, where he tackled

a couple of the issues that were perhaps ambiguous in the ECJ&#146;s

original judgment. I should like to deal first with amendments Nos. 5,

6, 7 and 9. One of the issues that was left outstanding in the minds of

Marks &amp; Spencer and their advisers, and on which they sought

clarification from Mr. Justice Park, was the use in the ECJ judgment of

the word &#147;possibility&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051668000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Justice Park&#146;s

judgment states at paragraph 33 that in his view when the ECJ refers to

possibilities available, it means recognised possibilities, legally

available, given the objective facts of the company&#146;s situation

at the relevant time. Some of the sub-paragraphs of the schedule refer

to every possibility, rather than trying to be more specific about the

nature of those possibilities.</div>

<a name="06051668000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two issues emerge from Mr.

Justice Park&#146;s ruling. First, there are the legally recognised

possibilities and whether those are available, given the objective

facts at relevant times. Mr. Justice Park states that while there may

be legal possibilities for group relief, the fact that they are

available does not necessarily preclude losses in other EEA countries

offsetting UK tax or profits. He goes on to discuss what is meant by

objective facts at the relevant time and uses two examples to

illustrate that. The first is where the overseas business is

loss-making and still trading. He said that although the parent company

might argue that the overseas subsidiary will not return to profit, the

fact that it could&#151;thereby offsetting its losses against future

profits&#151;would mean that those losses could not be used to offset

UK taxes.</div><a name="06051668000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">His other

example was of a loss-making overseas company that had been closed. The

losses had been fully utilised in that country, and a balance of

unrelieved losses remained that could be offset against UK taxable

profits. He said that the objective facts in that case proved that the

losses could be relieved in no other way than against UK taxable

profits.</div><a name="06051668000321"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12

noon</div><a name="06051668000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

6(4) of schedule 1 refers to &#147;every step&#148;, but what does

that mean? Will HMRC examine what a UK parent company has done to turn

around a subsidiary prior to closing it, in order to ensure that every

step has been taken? What is the objective measure of any step? In the

case of Marks &amp; Spencer, the French subsidiary was sold to Galeries

Lafayette, which then used the losses. If M&amp;S had not tried to sell



<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 174</div>the business to Galeries Lafayette, would it still have satisfied the

&#147;every step&#148; criterion? If it had not been able or had

not tried to sell the business, would Revenue and Customs have said

that the UK parent had not tried every

step?</div><a name="06051668000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">With the idea of

every step, the Government are asking UK parent companies to know what

purchasers have done with their losses. In the M&amp;S case, it was

known that Galeries Lafayette had used those losses to reduce its

taxable profits, but most groups retain a degree of confidentiality

about their tax affairs. There is no legal basis on which a parent that

disposes of companies can find out what the acquirer has done with the

losses.</div> <a name="06051668000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concern is

that phrases such as &#147;every step&#148; and &#147;by any

other means&#148; are poorly defined. In the effort to give better

guidance to taxpayers, perhaps they should be either changed or

qualified. That is why amendment No. 6 would insert the word

&#147;reasonable&#148;. Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 9 seek to

clarify what actions a claimant might take to meet the conditions for

losses to qualify for offset against UK tax by defining more tightly

the issue of possibility left hanging by the ECJ

judgment.</div><a name="06051668000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

issue that I shall tackle is that of timing, which is dealt with by

amendment No. 8. The Government say in paragraph 7 of schedule 1 that a

group relief claim should be made at the end of the current period. It

is important for the Committee to know that UK companies claiming UK

tax losses are allowed two years after the end of the current period to

make a group relief claim. In defining so clearly the timing of the

group relief payment for overseas losses, the Government are opening up

a mismatch between the treatment of UK losses and the treatment of

losses arising elsewhere in the European economic area.</div>

<a name="06051668000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his judgment, Mr. Justice

Park sought to elaborate on the ECJ judgment, which I understand was

silent on the issue of when the group reliefclaim should be

made. He identified three points at which the claim could be made. The

first, in line with the Government&#146;s new clause, is at the end

of the accounting period when the loss was made. The second is at the

time or times when the group relief claim is made by the

parent&#151;effectively a later date. The third is when the matter is

dealt with by the special commissioners. I shall deal with the first

two

options.</div><a name="06051668000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Schedule

1 as it is drafted reflects the first option, yet it and the third

option were ruled out by the High Court. In paragraph 44 of his

judgment, Mr. Justice Park said that</div>

<a name="06051668000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;option 1 is too soon, and would

be likely to rule out virtually every

case.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">He went on to

say:</div><a name="06051668000297"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;At the

end of an accounting period in which M&amp;SG and M&amp;SB made a loss,

and therefore was still likely to be carrying on its trade it is hard

to imagine any case in which German or Belgian law would not provide

for any possibility of relief for

losses.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">So

there could be a situation in which a business continues to trade at

the end of a period. Say the financial year ends at 31 December and the

business is still trading in Germany or Belgium, under schedule 1 any

claim for group relief on those losses should be made. Given that the

business is still trading at that point, and is likely to trade on into

the next year, there is still the possibility in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 175</div>German or Belgian law&#151;assuming that they allow for such

possibilities&#151;for those losses to be relieved against future

profits. The only way in which a claim for group relief could be made

in those circumstances would be if the business had closed during the

current accounting period, so that it was known that there would be no

future trade against which the losses could be offset, if they were

unable to be offset in that year or in previous accounting

periods.</div>

<a name="06051668000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The ECJ

judgment is that, where possible, losses should be relieved in that

country first, before being made available to offset in the UK company.

If the decision had to be made at the end of the financial year, the

company would know that there had been losses, but not whether there

would be profit in future years against which that year&#146;s losses

could be offset. Because the possibility still existed to offset those

losses against future trading profits, they could not be offset against

UK taxable profits. In a way, the timing in schedule 1 makes it

virtually impossible for a business to make a valid claim, because

unless it is closed down in the course of the year, it will still be

trading, so there will still be the possibility at the end of that

financial year to make a claim.</div>

<a name="06051668000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr. Justice

Park decided that the decision to make a claim for the use of losses

should be made at the time at which the group submitted its claim for

group relief. Such claims can be made up to two years after the end of

the accounting period in which the losses were made. In those

circumstances, a UK parent company could have much greater certainty

about the possibility that the losses could not be relieved in the

country in which the subsidiary was resident. For example, it could

have closed a loss-making subsidiary, so it would know that there would

be no tax on profits against which the tax losses could be

offset.</div> <a name="06051668000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the

Committee were to accept amendment No. 7, schedule 1 would reflect Mr.

Justice Park&#146;s judgment on the matter. My concern is not merely

to achieve certainty for businesses and clarity on the timing,

but&#151;having seen Mr. Justice Park&#146;s ruling, and the fact

that he chose option

2&#151;</div><a name="06051668000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the time or

times when the group relief claim was made by the

parent&#148;,</div><a name="06051668000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">that some UK

companies might seek to take the Government to court again to get them

to comply with Mr. Justice Park&#146;s original judgment.</div>

<a name="06051668000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government might say,

&#147;That is fine. We must go through that process and take it

through the House of Lords and to the European Court.&#148; However,

asMr. Justice Park said in paragraph 41 of his

judgment,</div><a name="06051668000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

principle that runs through the whole of community law and has been

enunciated by the ECJ in numerous cases is the principle of

effectiveness: procedures in Member States must not render practically

impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by

Community Law&#148;.</div><a name="06051668000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

appears to me that the drafting of schedule 1 ignores Mr. Justice

Park&#146;s judgment and the principle of effectiveness. It will

leave the Government and taxpayers open to further challenge in the

courts.</div>

<a name="06051668000186"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000410"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> Is it the hon. Gentleman&#146;s view that all

that Mr. Justice Park said was necessary in that case, or was much of

it not necessarily directly relevant to what we are now considering? It

is an opinion, but it is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 176</div>not necessarily one that the Government need to take as black-letter law

at this time.</div>

<a name="06051668000187"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000411"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman opens up a can

of worms in questioning the legal status of Mr. Justice Park&#146;s

judgment. To an extent, that goes back to the stand part debate, and

the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire

about the primacy of Community law. If Mr. Justice Park&#146;s

judgment were seen as fleshing out the ECJ&#146;s original judgment,

should it be part of Community law? If it is part of Community law,

will it have primacy over this legislation? I suspect that some people

will go back to the ECJ about that. There is an important legal issue

here about the status of Mr. Justice Park&#146;s judgment in

elaborating on the ECJ judgment. If we go down his route, we are saying

that the Finance Bill overrides that judgment. However, as my hon.

Friend has said, we know that parliamentary sovereignty is subservient

to Community law. If Mr. Justice Park&#146;s judgment is seen as

elaborating on Community law, that may well prove ultimately to have

primacy over the

Bill.</div><a name="06051668000188"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000412"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> It was potentially an interesting, wider question

that the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked. However, I am

asking a very narrow question. Did Mr. Justice Park need to say, when

he made the judgment in that case, what he said, or did he just go on,

because he felt like going on to elaborate on areas that he did not

need to elaborate on for the purposes of the case? If the latter, his

comments were obiter, and therefore unnecessary as part of the letter

of the

law.</div><a name="06051668000189"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000413"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman, who was a

barrister, would find it valuable to look at the

judgment.</div><a name="06051668000190"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000414"></a>Stephen

Hesford:</b> You have got

it.</div><a name="06051668000191"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The Chairman:

</b>Order. Remarks must be made through the

Chair.</div><a name="06051668000192"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000415"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> My understanding is that Marks &amp; Spencer went

back to Mr. Justice Park for a ruling on the issues, and that he was

specifically asked to clarify those points. In the detail of the

judgment, he refers to representations made on the issues by counsel

for both Marks &amp; Spencer and HMRC. What he was saying on the matter

was therefore relevant, and not simply some asides that we should not

take into account in dealing with this

schedule.</div><a name="06051668000193"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000416"></a>John

Healey:</b> Like you, Mr. Benton, I wanted to ensure that all

members of the Committee had a chance to contribute if they so wished.

These amendments would remove some protections in the legislation that

ensure that relief is consistent with Government policy and the

relevant European law, as expressed in the Marks &amp; Spencer

judgment. It is clear that the ECJ, in the Marks &amp; Spencer case,

intended relief to be given for foreign losses only in very limited

circumstances, where all possibilities of relief had been exhausted

elsewhere. The Court went out of its way to note that Governments are

free to adopt measures to prevent artificial arrangements seeking to

obtain a tax benefit.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 177</div><a name="06051668000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal, as the hon. Member

for Fareham did, with amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9 together. They would

undermine the purpose of the new schedule, which is to ensure that if

losses have to be, or could be, relieved in future in another state,

the UK is not obliged to give relief for

them.</div><a name="06051668000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">We still want to

ensure that if a foreign company gets relief elsewhere, it cannot do so

here. That is why a general description of other possibilities of

obtaining relief is necessary in the legislation. The alternative would

be an attempt to describe all the possible ways in which other

countries provide relief for losses. Such a description would have to

be updated each year. It would be burdensome for us to do and

burdensome for business to follow, and it would carry the obvious risk

that not all the possibilities of obtaining relief in the other EU

member states had been

identified.</div><a name="06051668000322"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15

pm</div><a name="06051668000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As for the

second issue raised by the hon. Gentleman, amendment No. 8 would change

the date at which a determination must be made on whether a loss is

potentially relievable for a future period in another state. He

proposed an alternative approach and, in so doing, made reference to

Justice Park&#146;s recent High Court decision on Marks &amp;

Spencer. There is indeed a difference between the approach in Justice

Park&#146;s decision&#151;members of the Committee might wish to

know that that might not be the final word on the subject&#151;and

that in the Finance Bill as to the relevant time at which tests of

unrelievability of foreign losses are to be

applied.</div><a name="06051668000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

difference in position comes about because there are two different and

distinguishable scenarios. The judgment of Justice Park applies only to

the circumstances of Marks &amp; Spencer. It applies in the context

when the United Kingdom legislation does not contain provisions to

allow relief on the losses of foreign subsidiaries. We are dealing

under the schedule with legislation that, first, reflects the European

Court&#146;s decision in December last year and, secondly, translates

that decision into UK legislation. In doing so, the Government have

decided that the relevant time should be immediately after the end of

the period in which the losses were incurred by the foreign

subsidiary.</div><a name="06051668000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In setting

out the legislation in such a way, we are relying on paragraph 55 of

the European Court&#146;s decision in the Marks &amp; Spencer case.

That paragraph sets out the conditions where, exceptionally, group

relief should be extended to foreign losses. Our view is that those

conditions are restrictive; that view was supported by the

Advocate-General in another European case. When giving his opinion on

class IV of the ACT group litigation case, he

said:</div><a name="06051668000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

court held that, in exceptional circumstances...a home State must

extend domestic group

relief&#148;,</div><a name="06051668000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">but that that

extension</div><a name="06051668000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should be

applied extremely

restrictively&#148;.</div><a name="06051668000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment would make the relief not restrictive, but more generous.

However, it would not make it more equitable. In short, these

amendments would remove important protections under the Bill, so I hope

that, having said that they are probing, the hon. Gentleman will not

press them.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000417"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his

response. I shall begin by dealing with the first aspect of the

amendments. I understand his point about the requirement to specify in

great detail the particular circumstances that would preclude losses

being utilised, and indeed being offset. He made a valid and important

point about that, which I

accept.</div><a name="06051668000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 8, the Financial Secretary distinguished between the specific

circumstances in the Marks &amp; Spencer case and the decision of Mr.

Justice Park, and the general position that is reflected in the

schedule. I understand the Financial Secretary&#146;s argument about

restricting the availability of the losses and setting out a theme that

runs through the proposals to which we have just

referred.</div><a name="06051668000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder

whether, in practice, the Financial Secretary has taken restriction to

a point at which it renders the possibility of claiming group relief

almost impossible. He is asking businesses, at the end of the financial

year, to make a decision about submitting a group relief claim for

overseas losses. Before a business has had chance to work through the

accounts, think about what the scale of the losses might be, implement

some judgments made in drawing up a set of accounts and determine the

loss, he is expecting it to decide whether it should submit a claim for

group relief for overseas losses. He is asking businesses to do

something

impractical.</div><a name="06051668000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

business might be continuing to trade, but it could be thinking about

closing down. The Financial Secretary is asking such a business to make

decisions at the end of the financial year&#151;without proper

reflection, without the opportunity to draw up proper financial

statements and without knowing the quantum of losses&#151;and before

it is able to determine whether the losses it has incurred in that year

can be relieved against past profits or profits that have emerged

during that year. For example, if a series of overseas subsidiaries are

operating the same territory, how will the UK parent business know that

their profits are greater than the loss incurred by that business that

year? The losses can be offset against the profits of overseas

subsidiaries in the same accounting period.</div>

<a name="06051668000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Financial Secretary is

asking businesses to know far more than they are capable of knowing and

is applying the provision in such a restrictive fashion that it is

impossible for those businesses to make a claim for group losses. This

is an area on which the Government should reflect further. He is being

restrictive in asking businesses to make decisions that they are not in

a position to make at the end of a financial year. While I do not wish

to press the amendment nor amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 9 to a Division,

I shall reflect on the issue. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="06051668000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000419"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I would be grateful if the Minister discussed the

amendments. I have his letter to the shadow Chief Secretary about them,

and while I appreciate the need for the Committee to move on at pace,

it would be appropriate to explain their purpose. What does the

Financial Secretary want to achieve by changing the definition of

losses to be relieved and the comparison between UK measures of the EEA

losses and other

measures?</div><a name="06051668000210"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000420"></a>John

Healey:</b> The amendments will make minor technical changes

to ensure that the amount of EEA losses that can be surrendered as

group relief to UK companies is in line with the policy objective of

preventing double relief for those losses. The previous version could

have been read in two ways. That was not drawn to our attention by

external sources, but it was something we spotted and decided to

clarify with the amendments. I could go into detail, but I hope that

the hon. Gentleman accepts that that is the reason for tabling

amendments and how they have arisen. They will simply clarify technical

changes. I hope that they are acceptable to the

Committee.</div><a name="06051668000211"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000421"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I do not want to appear to be an anorak or pedantic

about the changes, but the Government have sought to amend the Bill

here. Is the Financial Secretary confident that, when EEA losses are

restated using UK accounting rules and if those losses exceed original

EEA losses, the higher value will not be offset against UK taxable

profits?</div><a name="06051668000212"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000423"></a>John

Healey:</b> I rise to speak to the first of the two clauses

dealing with research and development tax credits simply to emphasise

the point, of which Labour Members are well aware, that the tax credits

are a key part of the Government&#146;s strategy to increase business

research and development. In so doing, we will boost the levels of

science and innovation in the economy to help to secure long-term

prosperity.</div>

<a name="06051668000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since the

scheme was introduced in 2000 for small and medium-sized enterprises,

the support claimed amounts to just under &#163;1 billion for such

enterprises and almost &#163;1.8 billion overall. Early evaluation of

the scheme suggests that companies claiming R and D tax credits

generally find the process quite easy and find that it is having a

positive impact on their R and D spending. However, we have constantly

looked at ways to improve 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 180</div>the package and to make it easier to apply for and more effective in its

application. The amendments and changes announced in the pre-Budget

report should improve the experience of companies claiming the credits.

The announcement was widely welcomed, as was the fact that HMRC will

set up dedicated units to specialise inR and D tax credit

claims.</div><a name="06051668000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also

announced that the range of qualifying costs for the scheme will be

expanded to include payments made to clinical trial volunteers. The

clause will enact that announcement. It follows the suggestion put to

us by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, which

argued that the cost of paying volunteers for clinical trials is a

legitimate R and D cost incurred by pharmaceutical and biotech

companies and others undertaking medical

research.</div><a name="06051668000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause

also makes equivalent changes to vaccine research relief, which was

introduced in 2002 to provide extra incentive for R and D on drugs and

vaccines to treat or prevent

diseases.</div><a name="06051668000221"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000424"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Brooks Newmark</b> (Braintree) (Con): At the end of last year,

the then Minister for Competitiveness, the hon. Member for Brent, North

(Barry Gardiner), said of the R and D tax

credit:</div><a name="06051668000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

truth is that it hasn't been a success. A lot of it has to do with a

misunderstanding of what the R&amp;D baselines were. We are trying to

iron that out.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">While I

appreciate that clause 28 will take out a wrinkle by including payments

to clinical trial volunteers, does the Financial Secretary agree that

the Government have some more ironing to do? I ask that question in the

context of a comment by John Cridland, deputy director general of the

CBI, who

said:</div><a name="06051668000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Companies

are experiencing too much uncertainty and inconsistency in its

application. That has to change if the Government is to achieve its

target of R&amp;D spending at 2.5 per cent of GDP by

2014.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would be

interested to hear the Financial Secretary&#146;s comments on

that.</div><a name="06051668000224"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000425"></a><b class="B">Jeremy

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I welcome you to the

Chair, Mr.

Benton.</div><a name="06051668000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the

Financial Secretary engage in some joined-up government? I welcome what

he said about the extension of relief for clinical trials, which is

clearly a necessary and important move, but he will know that there are

other reasons why it is difficult for companies, particularly smaller

ones, to conduct such trials. Many of those are related to the European

clinical trials directive. To see that the measure is enacted as

effectively as he and I want it to be, it is necessary for him to speak

to his colleagues in the Department of Health and to remove any

administrative obstacles to the conduct of clinical trials so that

advantage can be taken of the tax

relief.</div><a name="06051668000323"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000426"></a>John

Healey:</b> Obviously, it is the Treasury&#146;s role to set

fiscal policy; the role of HMRC is to manage and administer that tax

policy. We do so within the broader regulatory framework, for which

other parts of the Government are responsible, but I shall draw the

comments of the hon. Member for Rugby and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 181</div>Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) to the attention of my hon. Friends in the

Department of Health.</div>

<a name="06051668000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the

hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) that, as I think I indicated in

my short opening remarks, at each stage of the introduction of the R

and D tax credit system&#151;first for small firms, then larger

companies&#151;we have made it clear that we want to build on the

emerging success. At each stage we have said that we shall look at

possible improvements, including in the administration, and have

welcomed the views of businesses, including that of the CBI, and their

suggestions for improving the administration of the credit and payable

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000428"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I should like to pick up on some

of the Financial Secretary&#146;s comments and those of some of my

hon. Friends. Schedule 3 refers to the harmonisation of the timing of

claims rules for R and D tax credits. In other contexts, harmonisation

might not be welcomed, but it is in this

one.</div><a name="06051668000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall talk

about the claiming of tax credits. New clause 5 calls upon the

Chancellor to</div> <a name="06051668000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;publish a

review in relation to the cost of making claims...before 1st March

organisations which have a special

interest&#148;</div><a name="06051668000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">in that

particular area.</div><a name="06051668000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government and the Financial Secretary are proud of the introduction of

tax relief for R and D expenditure, but the fact that it is available

does not necessarily mean that it is accessible to all businesses. The

Treasury needs to think about the cost of claiming those credits and

how it might be made easier, and about who is currently excluded by the

complexity of the

system.</div><a name="06051668000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Institute of Chartered Accountants commissioned independent research

into the R and D tax credit, and the claiming of it. In the context of

the debate on the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 182</div>schedule and the new clause, it is worth reflecting on that research.

The report highlighted some of the challenges faced by businesses

without the resources to make claims, and the impact on those

businesses.</div> <a name="06051668000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">A large

business with a well-funded R and D programme will find it relatively

straightforward to make a claim, because it will have the systems and

procedures in place, and the technical expertise to claim efficiently

and effectively. The institute&#146;s research indicated, however,

that that did not necessarily lead to an increase in R and D

expenditure, because the business had already maximised its programme.

That is, the business would already have made the decision on how much

to spend, and the decision would not be particularly affected by the

nature of the offered

incentives.</div><a name="06051668000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">Medium-sized

businesses, on the other hand, did actually benefit from the tax

credits. They tend to be have better resources and to be better able to

go through the process of making claims. The view was that the tax

credit has been very helpful for them and has enabled businesses to

grow without having to seek further venture capital funding. Businesses

that have taken advantage of the tax credit have commented to me that

it has aided their cash flow, and that they have not had to raise

funding from outside sources.</div>

<a name="06051668000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The area of greater concern is

that of smaller companies, and the Government need to think about that.

The report quoted the example of a small business run by two

scientists, which did not have adequate human resources to complete the

returns, and so did not submit a claim. It therefore missed out on the

incentives brought by the R and D tax credit.</div>

<a name="06051668000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">As to the cost of preparing the

returns, the indications were that it could cost approximately

&#163;12,000 to employ a chartered accountant to fill out the returns

fully and to provide all the necessary support and administrative

back-up. That is quite a significant sum. The taxpayer would need to

consider the cash-flow benefit that it would receive from submitting

the return and obtaining the tax relief, and whether it would be worth

spending &#163;12,000 of the small resources available to most small

companies in order to make the

claim.</div><a name="06051668000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Alternatively,

the company could decide that it needed only to be briefed by a

chartered accountant, in which case it could submit a claim itself. It

was estimated that such a briefing would cost approximately

&#163;3,000, but the HMRC would come back and question the claim. I

am not disputing the need for HMRC to ensure that claims are valid, but

there is a cost in time and resources, including financial

resources.</div><a name="06051668000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

preparing for the debate I looked at the guidance that is available to

small businesses on the HMRC website, because one might ask why one

should spend &#163;3,000 on a chartered accountant if one can go to

the HMRC website to find the information. In saying that I am probably

doing a great disservice to fellow accountants who are still

practising, but on looking at the website I was struck by why it would

be difficult to complete a return without professional assistance.

There is a series of user steps that companies need to take to

determine whether they qualify, and there is a web page entitled

&#147;Is it worth reading any further?&#148; which has a flow chart

with more than a dozen boxes. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 183</div>If I were hard pressed for time I think I might question whether it was

worth reading further.</div>

<a name="06051668000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless,

I continued, and I came across theR and D tax credit claim

template for SMEs, which has a number of different lines for completion

relating to, for instance, consumable items, consumable stores,

computer software, staffing costs, externally provided workers,

payments to staff providers, issues about connected persons, underlying

relevant expenditure, subcontracted activities and payments to

subcontractors. That is a lot for a small business to consider and I

can understand their having difficulty with it. However, there are

pages of helpful guidance to underpin it. I have one here headed

&#147;CIRD82400&#151;R&amp;D tax relief: categories of qualified

expenditure: consumable items: meaning of consumed or

transformed.&#148; That sounds fairly hopeful. The first sentence

begins:</div><a name="06051668000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

not possible to offer a simple

definition&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051668000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">that

supports my case that we need more chartered accountants to help by

providing us with advice. However, it continues&#151;</div>

<a name="06051668000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;because of the variety of

possible circumstances.&#148;</div>

<a name="06051668000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">It goes on to say that it is specified in

statute that</div><a name="06051668000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the term

&#145;consumable or transformable materials&#146; includes water,

fuel and power...Apart from these specific items, we then have to

deal with the generality of the

wording.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am reminded

of the comments of the Financial Secretary during the last debate in

which we discussed the importance of using general wording so that we

do not need specific items. However, specific items might be helpful

for somebody completing an R and D tax relief claim. The form says

that</div><a name="06051668000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A good

example of a consumable item would be a laboratory chemical used in the

R&amp;D process which is used up...or converted to an unusable

product.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that

scientists will be able to work their way through that. I quote this

not for cheap laughs but to demonstrate the complexity that businesses

face in trying to deal with some of the issues. Another page of

guidance, &#147;CIRD82500&#151;R&amp;D tax relief: categories of

qualifying expenditure: software&#148;, sounds as though it could be

fairly straightforward. It rightly mentions that software, directly

employed, can be used. However, it goes on to talk about the

apportionment of software that a business might already

have:</div><a name="06051668000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where

software is only partly employed in direct R&amp;D an appropriate

apportionment of the expenditure should be

made.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">So

I suppose that if a business bought a licence to use Microsoft Office,

and used Excel spreadsheets for the purpose of tracking the expenditure

for R and D tax credits but also for some of the calculations that are

required for research, it could apportion the cost of that software to

the R and D tax credit. It rightly says that a pragmatic approach

should be adopted. I make these comments to illustrate the scale of the

challenge that is faced by businesses trying to claim these

reliefs.</div>

<a name="06051668000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other

aspect is not the complexity and the record keeping that is required,

but the degree of uncertainty about the likelihood of success of a

claim. Companies with a stable and recurring path of expenditure find

it relatively easy to claim tax credits. However, evidence collected

for the ICA report suggests that that is not a universal experience;

there can be issues about what 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 184</div>constitutes R and D expenditure according to HMRC. Often,

people&#146;s decisions to invest in R and D are irreversible. Once

the die is cast, that is it: they are going forward. Particularly in

the case of a smaller business, the extent to which the likelihood of

success of a claim is under question might have an impact on its

willingness to make that irreversible decision.</div>

<a name="06051668000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that context, the Financial

Secretary was right to highlight the importance of setting up dedicated

teams to tackle R and D tax credits. A concern that was highlighted by

a number of respondents to the survey was that although some tax

offices are very experienced&#151;I should imagine that the one that

serves Silicon Fen in Cambridgeshire would be very adept at dealing

with such claims&#151;there could be problems for somebody whose tax

office did not have that experience. The dedicated teams that the

Minister mentioned will help to tackle that.</div>

<a name="06051668000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that in ironing out the

wrinkles, to use the metaphor introduced earlier by my hon. Friend the

Member for Braintree, the Financial Secretary will reconsider the cost

of making claims, and think about what further steps can be taken to

simplify claims, to provide better guidance to taxpayers who might want

to take advantage of the relief, and to ensure that tax relief is not

just available but accessible to smaller

businesses.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000429"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> In their own terms, the new clause and

schedule are rational and attempt to simplify the process by aligning

the claims processes and time limits for R and D tax reliefs with those

of enhanced deductions. However, I should like to follow the points

made by the hon. Member for Fareham by considering the impact of the

changes in tax credits on small businesses and the knock-on impact that

they may have on them again. If all claims need to be made in company

tax returns within 12 months of the filing date, what will be the

impact of these changes on small businesses? Given that that is already

a difficult administrative burden for them, reducing the time scale

will be an additional

difficulty.</div><a name="06051668000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">There

is still an issue with small businesses having to pay up front and

claiming back tax credits. I should like to quote one conclusion from

the report by the Manchester and Nottingham business schools,

commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and

Wales, which

says:</div><a name="06051668000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;R&amp;D

tax credits on offer in the UK are similar to some of the best schemes

offered around the world. The incentives are relatively more generous

to smaller firms. The application process, however, diminishes the

effectiveness of the policy and this is especially so for smaller firms

and firms with small R &amp; D programmes. In some cases the costs of

preparing and administering claims prevents firms from taking advantage

of the

incentives.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

those conclusions, I wonder whether the Government really consider this

to be an efficient mechanism for supporting small businesses in

particular.</div><a name="06051668000259"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000430"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> It is a pleasure to follow an entertaining speech

by the hon. Member for Fareham. I say to my hon. Friend the Financial

Secretary that I have some sympathy with new clause 5.

<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Before the hon. Gentleman gets too

excited, I should say that the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 185</div>new clause is perhaps a little premature for the reasons to which he and

my hon. Friend adverted in a previous

debate.</div><a name="06051668000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Red Book

says, on page 62, paragraph

3.80:</div><a name="06051668000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

&#145;Supporting growth in innovation: next steps for the R&amp;D tax

credit&#146;, published in...2005, government announced that

HMRC would set up dedicated R&amp;D units to handle all SME claims for

tax credits. It is envisaged that these units will be fully operational

across the country before the end of the year. At the same time, a

statement of practice will be published presenting the standard of

service and support that SMEs can expect from the new

units.&#148;</div><a name="06051668000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

that, at the end of the calendar year 2006, the dedicated SME claims

units for R and D tax credits and statements of practice will be in

place.</div><a name="06051668000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5

suggests a date of 1 March 2007 for the research to be done on the

costs of claiming R and D tax credits. Understandably, we have a

particular concern for SMEs. I am delighted that the Budget extended

the number of employees from 250 to 500 in respect of the beneficial

arrangements. However,1 March 2007 is a little bit early for

a procedure or new way of doing things&#151;including new support and

so on&#151;in respect of provisions that will be in place by the end

of 2006. However, if the Government have not already included such

provision in the Finance Bill next year, the hon. Gentleman might

consider tabling a new clause similar to new clause

5.</div><a name="06051668000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have sympathy

with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s approach. To echo the comments that

have already been made, I say to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary

that we have to be careful that we do not have a wonderful tax regime

that is too difficult for people to claim under and therefore does not

boost R and D in the United Kingdom in the way that all hon. Members

wish.</div><a name="06051668000264"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051668000431"></a><b class="B">Stewart

Hosie</b> (Dundee, East) (SNP): I am

intrigued by new clause 5, and I hope that the hon. Member for Fareham

can offer some enlightenment. It suggests publishing a review, having

first consulted organisations with a special interest in claiming the

tax relief forR and D. Would he envisage that the

organisations consulted may not offer feedback in the published review

that would make the R and D tax credit system more effective and

efficient, but might suggest alternatives to it, at least in some small

way?</div><a name="06051668000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

have said previously to the Financial Secretarythat in

2004-05, the last year for which I have figures for R and D tax credits

and other R and D funding for Scotland and England, &#163;670 million

was budgeted to be made available for the tax credits, but only

&#163;290 million was actually taken up. In the same year&#151;the

figures are useful and interesting in this regard&#151;in addition to

the tax credit, a total of &#163;710 million of Government funds were

available, of which some &#163;37 million came through collaborative

research and development, knowledge transfer networks, knowledge

transfer partnerships, grants for research and development, and the

grant for investigating an innovative idea. The latter two apply only

to England. In the same year in Scotland, some &#163;16

millionwere available through Smart Scotland, SPUR, SPURplus,

Score, SEEKIT, R &amp; D Plus, and the small company innovation support

scheme, which also includes a certain element from the Highlands and

Islands Enterprise area.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 186</div><a name="06051668000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given that &#163;670 million

of tax credits were budgeted for, of which only &#163;290 million

were taken up, these small, more targeted schemes seemed to be quite

successful, and the take-up seemed quite high. Does the Financial

Secretary envisage that in the published review of the consultation, he

will look for feedback from companies to have the Government&#146;s

research and development funding provided through such other

mechanisms, not merely through the R and D tax credit system, of which,

in certain years, only 50 per cent. of the budget has been taken

up?</div>

<a name="06051668000267"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000432"></a>John

Healey:</b> There appears to be something of

myth around that, somehow, the R and D tax credit is costly to operate

from a company&#146;s point of view, and too difficult to operate in

order for companies to claim. Frankly, if that were the case, I do not

think that&#163;1.8 billion-worth would have been claimed

so far by companies, including &#163;1 billion by small firms.

Alongside that, I do not think that I could have been clearer. Since

the system&#146;s introduction&#151;first for small firms; then for

large companies&#151;we have been ready, and have proved that we

shall continue to look at its costs for business. We have been willing

to improve, and have improved, the process for applications and

administration where we can. We have also been ready and willing, and

continue to be so, to improve the guidance that is available to firms

if suggestions that seem sensible to us are

made.</div>

<a name="06051668000268"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000433"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> Does that mean that the Financial Secretary

rejects the conclusions of thework commissioned by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales that found

that there were significant difficulties for smaller businesses in

accessing these

credits?</div><a name="06051668000269"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000434"></a>John

Healey:</b> Is the hon. Lady aware of how many companies

constituted the study to which she refers? The answer is 10. I shall

come to that shortly.</div>

<a name="06051668000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">The schedule before us is not a

big move; it is a modest move, and should help companies in the process

of claiming tax credit. Harmonising the rules for claiming across the

two elements of the R and D tax credit system ought to make it easier

for companies to understand the claims process, and improve the

incentive effect of the schemes.</div>

<a name="06051668000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 urges us to

publish a review and a report by 2007. However, we have gone further

than that. We have already commissioned an independent survey of almost

1,000 R and D performing companies, looking at their experiences in

claiming tax credits, the results of which we published last year, In

contrast, the Manchester business school study was based on interviews

with just 10 R and D performing companies. Members of the Committee

could reasonably conclude that that was not the strongest piece of

evidence. Interestingly, the results from that very small study

contrast strongly with the results of the much wider first-stage

evaluation that the Government undertook. The results of the latter, in

contrast to the points made earlier, were very positive. It found that

three quarters of the companies that had claimed R and D tax credit

found the claims process 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 187</div>fairly or very easy. That does not suggest that the costs of claiming

are prohibitive, and experts generally agree with that view.</div>

<a name="06051668000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, a recent article in

<i class="I">Tax Journal </i>surveying the R and D fiscal incentives in the UK

compared with the US, Canada, Japan, Austria and the Netherlands,

stated:</div><a name="06051668000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For

SMEs, the UK system is widely regarded as the most generous and the

simplest to

administer&#148;.</div><a name="06051668000273"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051668000435"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s response.

He is right to highlight the nature of the survey by the Institute of

Chartered Accountants, which acted almost as a focus group in the way

it carried out its work. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee

are aware of focus groups and the role that they play in modern

politics. Perhaps the ICA should not be criticised for adopting the

techniques with which so many of us are

familiar.</div><a name="06051668000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">So that the

Committee is clear about the structure of the survey, 10 businesses

were involved in R and D and five people who were interviewed were

involved in manufacturing. Any manufacturing business today that does

not invest in R and D is likely to suffer from the competitive

challenge posed by India, China and eastern Europe. It is entirely

reasonable to discuss with businesses their experience of R and D. I do

not necessarily concur with the Financial Secretary that it is a myth

that it is costly to claim, as there are issues that affect the cost of

claims that the Government should think about and it is helpful to keep

the system under regular review.</div>

<a name="06051668000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I say to the hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West that I wish the Standing Orders had allowed

us to discuss new clause 5 to capture his mood of co-operation and

harmony. I am pleased that he expressed support for a simpler tax

system and I am sure he will warmly welcome the outcome of the Tax

Reform Commission&#146;s report on simplification later this year,

which will contain much for him to comment on positively.</div>

<a name="06051668000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman is perhaps

right to say that the date of the review should be moved backwards. I

hope that the system of dedicated units will be evaluated as they are

rolled out, rather than waiting until the full roll-out is completed

across the country. I will not be 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 188</div>setting the terms of the review as I do not expect to become Chancellor

of the Exchequer shortly, but I am sure that the Chancellor will take

note of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments.</div>

<a name="06051668000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Dundee,

East (Stewart Hosie) made a valid point about the complexity of the

support on offer to businesses investing in R and D and taking up new

developments. A theme taken up by businesses in my constituency and

expressed to me is that there are several different means of support as

well as R and D tax credit and that it can be difficult to navigate

their way around

them.</div><a name="06051668000278"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

Goldsworthy:</b> These are probing amendments that consider

the rationale behind the proposed changes to the time scale that apply

to the increased amount of allowances for small enterprises. The clause

proposes a temporary change to the first-year allowance of one year,

which the amendment would extend to two years in order to try to

understand the rationale for increasing the allowance to one year.

Could the Financial Secretary explain how small businesses will be

capable of responding to these relatively small and rapid changes? If

the change proposed is introduced, the allowance will have changed from

year to year in four consecutive years. I have received many

representations from people who feel that the changes add to the

regulatory uncertainty and
