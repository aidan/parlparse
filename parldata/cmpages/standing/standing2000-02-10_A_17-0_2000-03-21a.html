<H4><center>Clause 69</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The clause repeals subsections (2) to (5) of section 10 of the Gas Act 1995 and, according to the text of the clause, it will keep in force sections 33A to 33E of the Gas Act 1986. Sections 33A to 33E were due to expire, and the aim of clause 69 is to prevent that expiry.
<P>
Section 10 of the 1995 Act provides that sections 33A to 33E of the 1986 Act should expire four years from the appointed date, which, according to section 12 of the 1995 Act, was 1 March 1996. Four years on from that date is 1 March 2000. It is now the end of March 2000, so that problem was obviously known when the Bill was published. Will the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe say how that problem has been dealt with? If the period was extended by statutory instrument, will the right hon. Lady tell the Committee its name?

<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> I shall try to come at the matter from a different angle. As competition develops, so one can imagine the regulatory authority ceasing to set standards of performance for gas supply. The authority will have regard to its principal duty to protect consumers when considering whether the time has come to take that step. However, the market does not yet appear to be in that state, and it is therefore appropriate to continue those powers.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to point out that the sunset powers are being revoked. That will lead to equal treatment of gas and electricity companies. I am sure that he will agree that there is little merit in giving the authority the power to set standards in one sector that it does not have in the other. The clause will enable the authority to continue to protect the interests of customers.

<P>
I missed the last part of the hon. Gentleman's question.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> According to ``Halsbury's Laws of England'', the sunset provisions expired on 1 March 2000. However, I suspect that they have been extended for another two years by statutory instrument. If that is so, will the Minister tell the Committee the name of that order?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Yes, I certainly will. Subsections (2) to (5) of section 10 of the Gas Act 1995 provided that those powers would automatically expire four years after the appointed day-which was 1 March 2000-unless extended by order by the Secretary of State. An order extending that period was laid before the House on 8 February 2000; it came into effect on 1 March, and it extends the powers until 2 February 2002.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I can help the Minister. The order is the Gas Act 1995 (Standards of Performance) (Extension of Period) Order 2000-SI 2000/245. The Minister received that information by note from his parliamentary private secretary, who no doubt received it from someone else. Yet again, Ministers show a lack of knowledge on a critical matter. When preparing for today's debate, it took me 10 minutes to find that information. It concerns me that Ministers are not up to speed on the Bill's provisions. I had always assumed that they were involved in its detailed drafting.

<P>
The point is not esoteric; it is key. The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs is dealing with the question, rather than the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, despite the fact that it is her Bill. It is astonishing that such a fundamentally easy point was not at the tip of the Minister's tongue. He may think that it is a smart-eyed point, but it goes to the root of why we are having such problems with the Bill.-[
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. If the Minster for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe wants to intervene, she must rise to her feet and seek my permission to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The serious point is that the Bill is in trouble. Already, 245 Government amendments have been tabled and it is becoming increasingly clear that Ministers do not have the details at the tips of their tongues. They would have proper knowledge of that detail if they had been involved in policy preparation and in drafting the Bill. This is not the way in which legislation should be made. The Executive and their Ministers, who are accountable to Parliament, are responsible for the Bill. Bills are not proposed by civil servants who then merely pass notes to Ministers on how to respond to queries. We are made aware of such problems when we are not discussing amendments. Ministers can respond to amendments because they have 48 hours' notice and are given written answers on them. They find it more difficult, however, when the Opposition make points without amendments.

<P>
On a policy question, why does not the Bill contain similar sunset provisions to those which currently apply? The clause, which repeals section 10 of the Gas Act 1995, not only leaves in place sections 33A to 33E of the Gas Act 1986, but removes the sunset provisions. Will the Minister explain why those sunset provisions are not included? We hear constantly about better regulation, and sunset provisions were a new and novel way of ensuring that only better and necessary regulation was made. Ministers had to lay orders before the House to extend sunset provisions and to provide justification for doing so. No orders were made under sections 33A to 33E of the 1986 Act by the regulator, but I suspect that many such regulations will be made by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets. Is the Minister aware of Ofgem's intentions in relation to the clause?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was uncharacteristically pompous. He got his answer, and I pointed out to him that I missed the last part of his question. I shall leave it at that.

<P>
Existing legislation gives the regulatory authority powers to set standards and not duties. The authority is not required to use those powers or may decide to set standards in relation to particular classes of small customers only if it feels that that is the best way to promote the consumer interest. At present, it still seems useful for customers to be protected by such standards, and I make no apology for ensuring that the authority has powers to protect the consumer interest.

<P>
At the heart of the hon. Gentleman's question is an assumption that regulators will probably never relinquish the power to regulate. I disagree with that, although I agree that regulation imposes costs on companies and, indirectly, on consumers; there is no question about that. However, the costs are currently justified because the authority could conclude that they are outweighed by the benefits. For example, the regulator has proposed ending price controls for electricity supply and for Centrica's gas supply customers who pay by direct debit. That shows that regulators are willing to step back when they see competition developing, and electricity suppliers and Centrica have agreed to the proposal.

<P>
Gas transporters are covered by similar powers, which are imposed via licence conditions rather than statute. The Bill does not, therefore, impose an increased burden. We want to give the powers a statutory basis for the sake of clarity and transparency and so that the gas and electricity regimes are consistent.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The previous regime, before the clause tampered with it, had a sunset provision. We shall consider the electricity clauses later. Cluases 69 and 42 contain similar provision to the Gas Act. However, the Act contains sunset provision. Why did the Government decide not to replicate that provision?

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not realise that I have tried to answer that. It was necessary, for the sake of consistency and transparency, to make the gas and electricity regimes identical.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 69 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Standards of performance in individual cases</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): I beg to move amendment No. 554, in page 42, line 7, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: Government amendment No. 639.

<P>
Amendment No. 561, in clause 70, page 73, line 39, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> If members of the Committee have studied the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and myself, they will see a common theme, perhaps even a sameness. The intention is to ensure that the authority is not simply given powers to carry out functions, but has positive duties to perform. The amendments relate to clauses 42 and 70, which march side by side for electricity and gas. Our amendments would ensure that the parallel approach continues so that the authority's proposed powers for gas and electricity are enhanced and solidified into duties.

<P>
The first group of amendments under clause 42 would ensure that the authority regulates standards of performance. The clause maintains the standards of service that is offered to consumers and empowers the authority to act and regulate to ensure that. The authority's principal objective is to protect consumers. The regulations must be watertight. The Minister may mention the subtle differences between powers and duties, but in establishing an authority with a specific purpose, it is sensible to ensure that the duty to carry out its principal purpose is clearly set out. That is the background to the amendments.

<P>
Line 7 on page 42 amends the Electricity Act 1989 by imposing a duty on the authority. No doubt we shall hear why the Government want to remove the consultation process, but our amendment would not do that. Instead, it would ensure that the authority never loses sight of its main job, which is to protect consumers and to ensure that standards of service-and, in later amendments, standards of performance-are in place. It is a straightforward, simple amendment.

<P>

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> If I may, I shall start with Government amendment No. 639, which is technical. We want to delete nine lines from new section 39A, which the clause inserts into the 1989 Act. They provide that the authority may set performance standards only after consulting various people and arranging for appropriate research. The provisions duplicate new section 40B, which is established in clause 44. I hope that that answers the query of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). The equivalent overlap was avoided in clause 70, so that does not need to be amended.

<P>
The amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Lewes would require the authority to set performance standards instead of using a discretionary power to do so. I understand the motives behind the amendments, but they are not necessary or desirable. The authority will be under a general duty to promote the interests of consumers and it should decide whether setting performance standards for particular groups of customer will be the best way to fulfil its duty. If competition developed to such and extent that the authority considered it unnecessary to make relevant regulations, it would be wrong for it be compelled by primary legislation to do so.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
The gas and electricity Acts contain powers to set performance standards for suppliers, and currently only domestic gas customers and tariff electricity customers are covered. However, under the Bill, there will be no limit on the type of customer who may be covered. That is to avoid enshrining in primary legislation an arbitrary cut-off point such as the amount of electricity that someone would need to consumer to be considered a small customer. In practice, we do not expect the authority to set standards for very large customers and we expect coverage to be much as at present.

<P>
Given the expansion of the scope of the powers, it is even more important that the authority should have the discretion not to impose standards. Very large consumers will not benefit from receiving, for example, £50 of compensation for being without supply for 24 hours. Their relationship with utilities is likely to be based on contract, and in those cases it would be wrong to insist on the authority's intervention in the market.

<P>
I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister, particularly for his explanation of the Government amendment. One always suspects trickery and it is great to know that there is a straightforward technical reason for withdrawing a duplicate provision.

<P>
The Minister commented, with respect to amendments Nos. 554 and 561, that it would be unreasonable to give the authority a duty to make regulations that it considered unnecessary. There have been hiccups in the process of developing regimes for regulating gas and electricity in the past few years-perhaps most obviously when one regulator's idea of necessary action has diverged from the others. In bringing regulators together in an authority, the Government are preventing that disparity in regulation between the two industries. However, the possibility of the authority's diverging from the original, underlying intention of the Bill has not been catered for. The authority might prove self-willed, or might have a quite legitimate argument, on a narrow point, for or against regulation, or for a particular type of regulation. The Government might then look back and judge that it would have been better to impose a clear duty to behave as described in the Bill, so that primary legislation, rather than the decision of the management body for the time being, governed what was done.

<P>
The Minister's second point concerned expansion of the regulator's scope to include very large consumers who will have contractual arrangements with suppliers and for whom trivial or routine compensation schemes will not be appropriate. He said that such consumers should not come within the regulatory regime. Regulations can have a light touch, as the Minister frequently tells us he intends. A regulation might well provide that any contractual arrangements should take precedence. That would be neither difficult in regulatory terms nor unexpected in sound administration. I am not persuaded by the Minister's arguments that we should not toughen up the authority's powers and make them duties, to ensure that they come firmly within the ambit of the Bill. None the less, I understand that despite the sunshine and the spring in the air, the Minister does not feel inclined to concede the point. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendment made: No. 639, in page 42, leave out lines 9 to 18.-[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 555, in page 42, line 27, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and as far as possible ensure that this is automatic and equivalent to that paid in similar circumstances by electricity distributors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> These are two sets of amendments. Three amendments relate to clause 42 and three to clause 70, relating to the gas and electricity industries respectively. I should like to speak in a little more detail about the amendments to clause 42.

<P>
Amendment No. 555 would ensure that a compensation scheme ``shall'', as opposed to ``may'', be determined. It would impose a duty to pay compensation if distributors do not meet supply or other standards. If consumers are to be protected properly, it is essential that the regulations specify the level of compensation that will be awarded if the prescribed standards are not met. For that reason, we believe that a duty rather than a power should be imposed. A similar issue arises in line 28, which refers specifically to the standards of performance regulations. We do not want to leave anything to chance and we believe that it is important that protection for consumers should be written clearly in the Bill.

<P>
Amendment No. 558 would add some words to line 38. Those words are designed to ensure that whatever provisions apply to a compensation scheme or the regulation of electricity should apply equally in relation to gas. Amendment No. 565 contains the equivalent provision for electricity.

<P>
The arguments are not fundamentally different to those that I advanced on the previous group of amendments, so I happily await the Ministers response.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Again, I recognise the laudable objectives of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, and I shall try to explain why I shall resist them.

<P>
The first group of amendments, which would change the word ``may'' to ``shall'' in clauses 42 and 70, seems to continue the theme of the previous amendments tabled by the hon. Gentleman. They would require the authority to ensure that the regulations cover compensation payable if performance standards are not kept, rather than giving the authority a discretionary power to do so. That would not be appropriate. The authority will be under a general duty to promote consumers' interests and it should be able to decide whether paying compensation for failing to meet performance standards is the best way of fulfilling its duty.

<P>
The second change from ``may'' to ``shall'' would have consequences for subsection (4) of each clause that I am sure the hon. Member for Hazel Grove did not intend. If one looks closely at paragraphs (d) and (e) of the subsection, one sees that the amendments would require the regulations to prescribe circumstances in which distributors or transporters would be exempt from the regulations. They would also require the authority to set different standards for different companies if it could do so without breaching the competition test mentioned. The authority would not be allowed to set the same standards for all distributors even if it wanted to do so. It will continue to set performance standards broadly similar to the existing ones, but tying its hands in the way proposed is the wrong policy and it is wrong technically. That is why I hope that the amendments will be withdrawn.

<P>
Amendments No. 558 and 565 would require the regulations to ensure, as far as possible, that compensation was paid automatically when due. Their thrust is that the compensation paid for failing to meet a standard in electricity should be the same in gas. Both objectives are sensible. Electricity compensation payments are usually made automatically and additional compensation becomes payable if a payment is not made automatically. It is not clear whether gas compensation is paid automatically. It is wrong that customers must chase up payments.

<P>
Regarding the payment of equivalent sums, compensation for a missed appointment in electricity is £20. Yesterday, I waited for London Electricity to fit a new meter in my flat. The installers arrived in the nick of time; I was looking forward to the £20. To my delight, I discovered that I had paid for 4,000 more units than I had used-that shows how long the Committee's sittings have been. The £20 payment would have been automatic. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove might like to know that the gas payment has recently changed from £10 to £11. That seems hard to justify for many people.

<P>
I imagine that the different payments arose because the Office of Electricity Regulation and the Office of Gas Supply were separate, operating under different Acts. Now that they are merged and we are using the Bill to align the two regulatory regimes as much as possible, and now that many companies supply both fuels, I would not be surprised if the regulator considered the extent to which standards should also be aligned and I urge him to do that. However, it would be wrong to insert the words ``as far as possible''. They would not lay an unqualified duty on the authority given the difficulty of defining ``automatic'' and ``equivalent'' properly. I am sure that the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets will take heed of what has been said in Committee today and am therefore glad that the hon. Gentleman tabled the amendments. However, I invite him to withdraw them and the others that I discussed earlier.

<P>

<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I thank the Minister for his approach to the amendments; I take his point about the possibility of unintended side-effects from the first two amendments. I take comfort from the words that he used in relation to the fundamental intention to ensure absolutely that the authority does not duck or drift from the key issues of consumer protection in relation to compensation and performance standards.

<P>
I was interested in what the Minister said about amendments Nos. 558 and 565 in relation to clause 70. He made my case, illustrating perfectly that current compensation standars are not equivalent. Whether they are automatic might depend partly on the efficiency and effectiveness of complaints and accounts departments in numerous suppliers. He made a good case for the amendments' incorporation and for including a clear provision to ensure that such circumstances as he outlined do not arise.

<P>
I am tempted to wonder whether the Minister has had installed one of the new electronic meters, which can do net metering without thinking about it. I might return to the matter.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> It was the cheapest one.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Were you to allow me to stray, Mrs Roe, I could explain why that was, but never mind. The 4,000 units that the Minister saved might be a sign either of how long the Committee's sittings have lasted or of the Ministers' great efficiency and conservation-mindedness in his use of the flat. Let us hope that the second is the case.

<P>
I hope that the Minister will underline his assurances and the words that he has placed on the record about what he would like the successor authority to do. He might be willing to undertake to write to the authority along those lines or to draw its attention to those words. If he did that, I would feel that we had gone a long way towards achieving what we sought. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 640, in page 43, line 11, at end insert-

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> We are all pleased to see my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe return in blooming good health to the Committee. The amendments in her name will make technical changes to refine the drafting.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 640, 642 and 645 will rectify minor omissions in clause 42 and clause 70, clarifying that ``prescribed'' means
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prescribed by regulations made by the Authority with the consent of the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is obviously the policy intention as the authority is given the power to make regulations earlier in the clauses with the Secretary of State's consent. It is best to be clear of that meaning.

<P>
A consequential change to the part of schedule 5 that amends section 64 of the Electricity Act 1989 is required. The section currently says that ``prescribed'' means
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>prescribed by the Secretary of State,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which will not now always be the case. Amendment No. 663 says that that will remain the definition unless the context requires otherwise, as will be the case in clause 42 and clause 70. Amendment No. 643 will rectify an omission in clause 70. The words that it will add appear in the comparable place in clause 42.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 641, in page 43, line 18, leave out ``by such other person'' and insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 644.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendment No. 641 will carry forward to clause 42 an overlap with a different policy area and change the clause so that the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council cannot be appointed to determine disputes about performance standards in individual electricity cases. Amendment No. 644 will make an identical change to clause 70, in order to achieve the same result in the Gas Act.

Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Question proposed. That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Question proposed. That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This clause, together with clauses 43 to 46, amends the electricity legislation to bring it into line with gas legislation; it also extends it slightly. Clause 42 introduces two new sections to the Electricity Act 1998: 39A and 39B. Those new sections reflect the provisions of new section 33A of the Gas Act 1986.

<P>
Yet again, the revised measures do not include a sunset provision. The explanatory notes say that the regulation-making powers available to the regulator under the Electricity Act have already been used, although that power has not been used under the Gas Act. Will the Minister explain the general effect of those regulations? Is it the Minister's understanding that the regulations are unlikely to change again, or does he expect the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets to extend them further, and if so to what extent? Lastly, have any regulations been drafted under clauses 42 to 46 or 69 to 74?

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunnell:</B> I rise to give the Minister the opportunity to reinforce what he said about ``automatic'' and ``equivalent'' as between gas and electricity, and to emphasise the importance that he gives to the authority proceeding vigorously with the matters set out in clause 42. Despite his resistance to the imposition of duties on the authority, I have that he will do his best to ensure that it exercises its powers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Ofgem will certainly be made aware of what has been said in Committee. I hope that I have made my view and the Government's view clear.

<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) asked several questions. At present, the regulator has the power to set the standards of performance for the distribution activities of public electricity suppliers. The main purpose of the clause is to maintain that power, despite the abolition of public electricity supplier licences, and to extend its coverage to all licensed distributors. One example of a performance standard is a customer's electricity being reconnected within three hours of an interruption or fault- for instance, after a power cut.

<P>
In future, distribution companies will not usually have a contractual relationship with customers. As we said at previous sittings, the normal contractual relationship will be between the customer and the supplier. Nevertheless, as can be seen from the example that I gave a moment ago, the activities of distributors can have a direct effect on consumers, and it is important for the regulator to be able to set performance standards for those activities.

<P>
Some distributors have expressed the worry that although subsection (5) enables the authority to ensure that suppliers are the route for compensation, no such route exists for the information that consumers have the right to receive under subsection (4)(a). I confirm that I have been advised that section 39 of the Electricity Act 1989, as amended by clause 42, will empower the authority to direct that suppliers should be the route. In other words, information about the standards set for distributors can be included by suppliers with information on their own standards, which is often sent out once a year with the annual bill. Under clause 70, a similar amendment will be made to the Gas Act.

<P>
At present, performance standards can be set only for the activities of public electricity suppliers that affect tariff customers. The notion of tariff supply will cease to exist and will be replaced by supply under contract. The clause does not limit the groups that can be covered by qualifying the term ``customer''. We have, in principle, extended the scope of the authority's powers. I am not sure whether that clarifies the point made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I want to know how the Minister expects Ofgem to use the new powers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> One example is to avoid setting artificial limits in primary legislation. For instance, people who consume 3,299 KW hours a year would receive protection, but those who consume 3,301 KW hours a year would not. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree with the need to avoid that.

<P>
We expect that authority to set performance standards only for the same or similar groups of customers that are currently covered. The regulations might have to contain a consumption limit, like those that I just mentioned, but at least it will be possible to amend that if circumstances change, in line with the overall objective of promoting consumer interest. Increased regulation may increase the costs that are passed on to consumers. The authority will balance the benefit of setting performance standards against those costs as they affect different classes of customers.

<P>
Subsections (5), (5A) and (6) of section 39 of the 1989 Act relate to procedures on disputes about compensation payments. The provisions are also useful for new section 39A. However, to avoid simply repeating their content, they have been repealed and moved to new section 39B. They have also been changed to reflect the creation of the Gas and Electricity Consumers Council. The clause will allow the regulator to protect customers and potential customers by setting the performance standards that distribution companies should attain.

<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Although I am grateful for the Minister's response to my first two questions, will he answer my third? Do draft regulations exist under clauses 42 to 46 or 69 to 74?

<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I am not aware of any, but I would expect them to be similar to those that are before us.

<P>
Clause 42, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 70</center></H4>
<H4><center>Standards of performance in individual cases</center></H4>
<P>
Amendments made: No. 643, in page 74, line 5, after ``failure'' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and is of a prescribed description'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 644, in page 74, line 42, leave out ``by such other person'' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if it thinks fit, by such person (other than the Council)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 645, in page 75, line 7, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5) In this section ``prescribed'' means prescribed by regulations made by the Authority with the consent of the Secretary of State.'.-[Dr. Howells.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Clause 70, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 43 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 71</center></H4>
<H4><center>Overall standards of performance</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move Government amendment No. 646, in page 75, line 18, leave out ``only''.

<P>
By deleting the word ``only'', the amendment makes a technical change to the language of the clause so that it conforms with other clauses. The relevant sections in the 1986 Act and provisions in other clauses state that the authority may set different standards of performance for different companies if it is of the opinion that the competitiveness of a licensee would not be unduly disadvantaged, which is an important consideration. The clause has the same intention but uses the words ``only if''. Provisions should be consistent.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 71, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clauses 44, 72 and 45 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 73</center></H4>
<H4><center>Information with respect to levels of performance</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 647, in page 76, line 46, leave out ``may be so specified'' and insert ``the Authority may direct''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 657.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> The two amendments make technical changes to refine the Bill. The clause currently states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As respects each standard determined under section 33BA,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
companies shall provide such information ``as may be specified''.

<P>
The amendments make it clear that it is the authority that can specify which information should be provided and not the transporter. As proposed subsection
 (2A)(b) uses the word ``determined'', it will leave no room for doubt that it is the authority that can determine what information should be provided.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 73, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 46</center></H4>

<H4><center>Information to be given to customers</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 559, in page 45, line 30, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendments Nos. 648 and 649 and amendment No. 566, in clause 74, page 77, line 4, leave out ``may'' and insert ``shall''.

<P>
I call the Minister-I am sorry; I call Mr. Stunell.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I sometimes get into trouble for not standing up, and sometimes for doing so.

<P>
The amendments cover familiar territory, but I do not apologise for that. They apply in parallel to clauses 46 and 74 and are intended to turn a power into a duty. On this occasion, that power is to make regulations on information that should be available to consumers. The information will concern overall performance of electricity suppliers and distributors and the standards that they have achieved and which were set for them. The Liberal Democrats believe that the Government would not want to leave the authority an option to decide on such matters.

<P>
It is of great importance to consumers to be able to judge the performance of their suppliers and distributors. We are a little concerned that the authority appears to be able to decide not to make availabe information about a particular year or a specific circumstance, supplier or distributor. It would be safer and more satisfactory to impose a clear and definite duty on the authority to make regulations requiring the information to be available and not to give it the option of sliding to one side.

<P>
Our arguments are similar to those which we advanced in support of an earlier group of amendments. As the amendments relate to the provision of information to consumers without practical implications for the running of the industry, I hope that the Minister will take a more sympathetic view to them than he did to the other amendments to which I referred.

<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Amendment No. 648, which applies to clause 46, deletes the provision allowing regulations to require different information to be given to different classes or descriptions of customers. Amendment No. 649 deletes the provision allowing the placement on suppliers of information requirements that are different from those placed on distributors. The two provisions duplicate section 60 of the Electricity Act 1989, subsection (3)(b) of which allows regulations to make
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>different provision for different cases, including different provision in relation to different persons.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That clearly covers both cases set out in clause 46, so the redundancies should be removed.

<P>
I explained with reference to a previous group of amendments why it would be inappropriate to substitute the word ``shall'' for ``may'', as amendments Nos. 559 and 566 would do. If the authority eventually decided not to set performance standards for a certain group of companies or customers, it should clearly not be required to ask licensees to send out information about their performance against such non-existent standards.

<P>
The authority will be under a general duty to promote consumers' interests and should decide whether setting performance standards for particular groups of customers or companies would be the best way to fulfil its duty. I am sure that it will consider the best way for customers to be informed about company performance against any standards that it sets. Probably that will be in the same manner as at present, as the amendment would require. However, it is unnecessary to fetter the authority's actions when it will always aim to fulfil its general duty. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> That was a disappointing, if predictable, reply. I hope that what the Minister intends to happen will happen, and that the provisions will not produce difficulty for consumers and regret for a future Government. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Amendments made: No. 648, in page 46, leave out lines 1 and 2 and insert ``and''.

<P>
``No. 649, in page 46, line 7, leave out from second ``customers'' to end of line 10.-[Dr. Howells.]

<P>
Clause 46, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clause 74 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
