                  </strong> What a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair, Mr
Sheridan, on what will be the last day of our consideration of the Bill
in Committee—and what an interesting consideration it has been.
We have had some good debates; we have had some bad-tempered debates.
We have had the whole gamut of parliamentary behaviour in our
proceedings. Opposition Members have certainly tried to scrutinise the
Bill as well as they can within the time
available.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000017">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of amendment 412 is to require the Government to clarify the
regulations relating to prisoners’ earnings, as we believe that
the policy needs clarification. Amendment 413 would ensure that
prisoners’ earnings can be used for the benefit of their
dependants, as well as for the other purposes set out under the Bill.
Since prisoner work is a flagship policy of the Secretary of State, it
is worth pointing out that 24,000 prisoners in England and Wales out of
a population of 85,000 are already
working—<em>[</em>

                  </strong> Well, thousands of prisoners are working in
prisons in England and Wales. Actually, I thought that the number that
I gave was rather high; it comes from Policy Exchange—I know
that Government Members are interested in and involved with that think
tank.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Many
prisoners already work on matters to enable prisons to function,
including cleaning and working in waste disposal areas, but they also
work on outside contracts. I have seen such work at Frankland, which
has a good workshop in which furniture is made for Government
contracts. Wormwood Scrubs has contracts with the private sector. It
has a good scheme for learning how to mend shoes, as well as catering
work. Although such work is a flagship policy of the Government, and we
support them in their aim to increase the amount of work for prisoners,
I do not want Government Members to deceive themselves by thinking that
it is a new policy or a particular
innovation.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000021">&#160;</a>

                  </span> Does my hon. Friend
agree that, given that the measure was presented, at least by the
Government, as a flagship policy, it is regrettable that there has been
little sign of specific attention being paid to the employment of women
offenders, who are under-represented in accessing suitable employment
while in
custody?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000022">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In fact, I
have not heard Ministers say anything about the employment of women
offenders. I hope that they will correct that omission this morning,
given that it is obviously just as important that women have the same
working opportunities as men.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000023">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have also
noticed that the Secretary of State has rowed back somewhat from his
ambitious claims about the extent to which the number of working
prisoners can be increased in a short time. We now have more realistic
and meaningful targets. However, we have several questions about how
the system will work in practice and we believe that a number of issues
are unresolved, some of which I hope the Minister can
clarify.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000024">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Is
there space and equipment in prisons for such a policy to be
undertaken? Many prisons are on inner-city sites and are extremely
crowded already. Space that has been used for exercise or gardens has
now been built on, so there is less of it. The Government have
restricted their room for manoeuvre by cutting the prison building
programme, which will make the policy more difficult to handle.
Moreover, if they are serious about prisoners working a 40-hour week,
there is an issue about whether we need more staff in prisons to manage
the policy as it will not fit in with the current shift patterns of
prison officers. We need information about such
matters.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Where
the work comes from will raise several problems. Will it be unfair
competition to companies outside? I shall give a particular example
that bothers me: prisoners often undertake work such as packing plastic
kit things for
aeroplanes.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000026">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Such work is
often done in Remploy factories throughout the country. The Government
have renewed their attack 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 759<a class="bkMark" name="Column759">&#160;</a>
                  </div>on Remploy. Is it fair that people with disabilities who have not
committed crimes and who work in Remploy factories find the economics
of their work undermined because work is being diverted into prisons?
That is the sort of hard moral dilemma that the Minister needs to
address. We also want to know how the money will be
used.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000028">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have received an interesting set of detailed questions from the Prison
Officers Association, which—like the Opposition—has no
objection to the introduction of a 40-hour week, and I hope that the
Minister can enlighten the Committee about such issues. Which
categories of prisoners will have access to work? From where will the
capital investment come? How will the scheme be financed? What will be
the implications for the safety, security and decency agenda in
prisons? The association is worried that that might be put at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
should also be grateful if the Minister would explain in detail whether
prisoners will be required to do such work or whether they will they be
given a choice, because there is a human rights issue about the use of
enforced labour, which is an obvious problem. We want prisoners to work
and we want some discipline in the system, but we do not want a Soviet
gulag system. That issue is not straightforward, so I hope that the
Minister will say something about
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How
will the proposal fit with the changes to the benefits system and the
requirement for the unemployed to find work or lose benefits? How will
it fit with the Work programme, which the Department for Work and
Pensions is introducing? What level of wage will prisoners be paid? The
clause states that prisoners’ money can be
used<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000031">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“for

               <p>or
for their own rehabilitation, but it is unclear whether the money may
also be used for prisoners’ upkeep. What will the policy mean
for their entitlements to, for example, free prescriptions and free
dental
care?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will
the policy create unfair competition for factories in the external
world? How much of the work do Ministers envisage will be done inside
the prison and how much will be done by category C prisoners, for
example, outside the
prison?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">How
will the policy affect education, rehabilitation and attendance at
offending behaviour courses? That question is particularly significant
for younger prisoners. It is good to have the discipline of work, but
it is also important that people should learn. If people in prison
cannot read, they need to learn to read and should be given such an
opportunity because, even though they might get into a good pattern of
working, if they cannot read they will not be able to obtain a job once
they go outside again. Nowadays, people need to be able to read to get
a job. The issue of skills is therefore important, as is that of
attendance at offending behaviour courses, because people must address
whatever caused them to offend in the first
place.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
should try to get the balance right. We have heard many statements,
designed—not entirely successfully—to promote a tough
image of the Justice team, about how so many prisoners will be working,
slaving away for 40 hours a week, which is probably not what Ministers
really expect and is anyway unrealistic. It would be helpful if the
Minister addressed those issues. We have tabled the may/shall amendment
because we should be 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 760<a class="bkMark" name="Column760">&#160;</a>
                  </div>clearer at the outset about how the policy will work, rather than there
being massive
discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment
413 would insert the

               </p>
               <p>I
tabled it because there is a genuine dilemma; thinking about how the
money should be used is not straightforward. As we all agreed when we
discussed the clauses about compensation in September, prisoners owe a
duty to the community and to their victim and they must make recompense
for that, but we also want them to accept their family
responsibilities, because if they have such responsibilities they
should carry them out. Furthermore, in practice, family relationships
are particularly important to people’s realisation that they
need to change their behaviour. Therefore, if we can strengthen
people’s relationships with their families, that may be a more
powerful way to motivate them to improve their
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000037">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">There
is no straightforward answer. I do not think one can say,
“Families are always the priority” or “Victims are
always the priority”. It is genuinely tricky, but I am a little
concerned that families and dependants do not get a look in. That is a
mistake and the Bill should be amended so that that is taken on
board.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000038">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
voluntary sector has raised concerns about how the Government propose
to allocate money for victims. I understand that 100% of the new levy
on net earnings of prisoners will go to the Victim Support charity. Can
the Minister confirm whether that is the case? If so, can he justify
it, because there are many other organisations that do good work in
supporting victims? They cover particular classes of victims for whom
Victim Support does not currently have specialist experience. For
example, Support after Murder and Manslaughter, Rape Crisis and Action
after Fatal Domestic
Abuse.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">If
all the money goes to Victim Support, it raises another question, which
is whether this falls foul of the EU commissioning regulations on
contracts with the Government. If money is simply allocated to Victim
Support, it raises the question of fair competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally, can
the Minister confirm whether the Secretary of State told Victim Support
that it could have the money provided it stopped all campaigning work?
If true, it is very concerning and it comes back to the discussion that
we had in September. We want to have partnerships with the voluntary
sector. We all know that the voluntary sector is good at some things,
but we do not want to put it into a box where it works silently. We
need to hear from it and to learn from its experience. If what I have
been told is true, I will be alarmed, so I hope that the Minister will
be able to tell us this morning that it is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000041">&#160;</a>

you in the Chair.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000042">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I support the
Government’s wish to increase the amount of work in prison,
which is a hugely important aspect of the rehabilitative approach. It
can contribute significantly to reducing reoffending if it is followed
through outside the prison when the prisoner is released. I also
support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland.
I agree that we already have a degree of working in prisons. Many
thousands of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 761<a class="bkMark" name="Column761">&#160;</a>
                  </div>prisoners are already involved, although many of them work relatively
short hours in the week, and I am sure that is one of the concerns that
the Minister seeks to address with the ambitions that the Government
now have. However, as my hon. Friend says, it is difficult to
accommodate full-time or near full-time working for the majority of
prisoners within our prison
estate.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000043">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
visited Manchester prison in the summer. It is a very large prison
serving the north of England and has some excellent programmes for
prisoner employment. It runs a print shop that has a number of
substantial print contracts, including one for the Ministry of Justice.
It may have printed the Bill for all I know. If so, it did a very good
job. The prison also runs a commercial laundry and a substantial and
expanding waste disposal business. Even so, it is able to give
employment experience and activity to only a very small proportion of
prisoners. I understand that is not full-time employment or, if it is,
only in a small minority of cases. The Minister must offer a sense of
direction of travel towards a 40-hour week for serving prisoners. Over
what time scale do the Government intend to achieve that objective, and
what proportion of prisoners do they aim to have ultimately engaged in
such work?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000044">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, in
an intervention on my hon. Friend, I raised my concern about suitable
programmes of employment for women in prison. There is very little
provision for women to undertake meaningful employment in our prisons.
In the women’s prisons I have visited I observed a low level of
ambition and energy for preparing women for release. It is regrettable
that the Government have decided not to continue with the role of a
champion for women in prisons. This is exactly the kind of thing that a
champion for women in prisons could have looked at: identifying how
work opportunities suited to the needs and circumstances of women in
custody could be created. If we cannot look to that role to develop
those opportunities, I would be interested  to hear the
Government’s thinking on the employment of women in prison. I
have repeatedly asked the question in every possible forum, including
Justice questions, but I have never had a specific answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000045">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My third
question relates to another point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Bishop Auckland: the Government’s intentions regarding the
obligation on prisoners to participate in work where it is available.
Is it intended to have a different conditionality regime? Obviously the
sanctions will have to be different, as we will not be able to sanction
benefits. Will there be a different conditionality regime regarding the
obligation to work for those obviously not serving custodial sentences,
given that Ministers now intend to manage prisoner employment in the
context of the Work programme?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000046">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I also echo
my hon. Friend’s questions about the application of
prisoners’ earnings. How much does  the Minister intend
prisoners to earn? Will it be at the currently relatively low level of
hardly a living wage? Or, if this is to be meaningful, realistic,
real-life employment, is there an aspiration to offer real-life
wages—national minimum wage rates—in future? Is it
intended that prisoners should become liable for tax and national
insurance? They would have to be working extensive 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 762<a class="bkMark" name="Column762">&#160;</a>
                  </div>hours and have a private income, I suspect, to fall within the tax
bracket, but I shall be interested to hear the
Minister’s views.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000047">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My hon.
Friend asked whether running costs for the prison are to be met to a
degree from the profits of prisoner labour. In Manchester, due to the
commercial success of the industries run in the prison, the governor is
able to reinvest the derived income in other prison programmes and
activities. That is a hugely important benefit for Manchester prison.
If many more prisoners work and generate income within the prison
estate, is it intended that some earnings will be reinvested in more
and better programmes for
prisoners?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000048">&#160;</a>

                  </span> On the point about how
the money is distributed, it looks as though it will have to go a long
way. Does my hon. Friend agree that the proportion supposed to be
allocated to victims ought to be distributed across the different
organisations that assist victims, rather than just Victim
Support?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000049">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am certainly not going to decry the excellent
work of Victim Support. Ministers must run a proper process for
procuring, commissioning and inviting grant applications. Whatever the
distribution mechanism, it must be fair and transparent. Like my hon.
Friends the Members for Bishop Auckland and for Stockton North, I look
forward to hearing the Minister’s proposed process for
distributing money to organisations that work with victims.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000050">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In addition
to money for victims, there is the opportunity, as the amendment would
provide, to direct some of the money to family members, to dependants.
I echo the thoughts of my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland:
that could be incredibly valuable in preparing the prisoner for
reintegration and resettlement. We know that a prisoner released to a
stable family environment faces a greater chance of not being involved
in further offending. Cementing that family relationship by directing
money to family members outside the prison, perhaps the mother of the
prisoner’s children, could be an important way of strengthening
that
link.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000051">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
I want to ask the Minister about the fact that the Work programme is to
be knitted into the development of prisoner working. I have asked
questions about that over the past few months and I am glad that we are
beginning to get more certainty from Ministers that they want to follow
that route. Will there be seamlessness so that Work programme providers
working within prisons are the same providers who meet and deal with
the prisoners on release? It may be difficult if prisoners are released
quite far from the prison—if their home is many miles
away—and the Work programme providers in their home location are
different. How will the handover happen? I would be grateful if the
Minister told us what thinking has gone into that.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000052">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Will the same
kind of careful planning on long-term employability prospects be
carried out for individual prisoners by Work programme providers in
prisons? They might say that the right thing for a prisoner was not
necessarily work, or not full-time work, but spending time gaining
qualifications that could improve their employment prospects on
release. There is a very significant difference in future earning
potential between a basic level qualification and a level 2 or 3
qualification. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 763<a class="bkMark" name="Column763">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Prisoners who are less worried about their material circumstances are
less likely to reoffend. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop
Auckland asked, what  is the Minister’s intention on
access to the ability to obtain work-related qualifications as part of
the development of the Work programme in our prison estate?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Do the
Government intend Work programme providers to be able to choose to
subcontract to the probation service or the Prison Service? The
probation service in Greater Manchester subcontracts work, but it runs
excellent employment programmes itself for prisoners following release,
or for those on community programmes. In my constituency, I have seen
some terrific programmes that the Prison Service arranges in
collaboration with partners such as the local housing trust. They give
prisoners on release full-time, real-life work experience for up to six
months, but sadly at the end of six months many of those men lose that
employment and there is nothing else for them in the current jobs
market. None the less, if the probation service is already running good
programmes of real-life work experience, as it is in Greater
Manchester, will Work programme providers be able to subcontract to the
probation service so that that good provision can continue?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I warn the
Minister that I have looked at the Work programme carefully over the
months since its introduction—I would describe myself as
something of a Work programme junkie. The mainstream—outside
prisons—Work programme contracting process has left gaps and
difficulties for subcontracting providers while the prime contractors
sort out how and to whom they will subcontract and when the contracts
will be in place. It would be regrettable if we went through a similar
experience in subcontracting Work programme provision in prison and as
prisoners leave prison. Can the Minister reassure me that the Ministry
of Justice and the Department for Work and Pensions will undertake
detailed work to learn the lessons from the original round of Work
programme contracting and apply them appropriately in the penal
system?<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000055">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">My colleagues
and I are very interested in the direction of travel that the
Government are taking. We support it. We want more prisoners
undertaking good quality, meaningful work, but there is a great deal of
detail to work through and there is no point in setting off on the path
in a half-baked way. I would welcome hearing where the
Government’s thinking is on the detailed plans for delivery of a
laudable objective. I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate
in the debate this morning.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000056">&#160;</a>

raised a significant number of practical challenges, so it may take me
some time to address all their points. One of my personal priorities as

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 764<a class="bkMark" name="Column764">&#160;</a>
                  </div>prisons Minister is to get this agenda under way in
precisely the manner expressed by the hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston. She made it clear that the agenda cannot be implemented in a
half-baked fashion; all the problems have to be properly thought
through. I am happy to go on the record by telling the Committee where
we are on delivering work in prisons to scale. My answers to the
questions asked by the two hon. Ladies will make that
clear.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland said that the Secretary of State is
rowing back from the initial claims about where we will get to on work
in prisons. The Secretary of State has done no such thing, and neither
have I. We are both extremely conscious of how difficult it will be to
get the agenda to scale, and of how important it is to do so, which is
why we have to get it
right.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Lady raised a number of questions, some her own and some from the
Prison Officers Association, but I will start by painting the picture
that we face. At the beginning of her remarks, the hon. Lady referred
to 24,000 working prisoners. The actual number working in our prisons
today is some 9,000, but I understand that the figure excludes
prisoners engaged in maintenance and cleaning. Very few of those 9,000
prisoners are actually engaged in something that might be described as
commercial or economic work. Work in our prisons is usually one of the
more effective programmes available to prisoners, but, in most cases,
it is a cost centre for the Prison Service, rather than a profit
centre.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">People
who tour prison workshops, as I have over the past 18 months, will be
shown what is called work, but, to my recollection, I have seen only
one workshop in which workers were clearly engaged in a proper
commercial operation, in which the workers’ interests were tied
to the success of the business and where the workers were cutting
around the workshop in a fashion that showed that, frankly, the visit
of the Minister for prisons was a diversion they could well do without
because there would be some effect on productivity if the interruption
continued for too long. That workshop is in Kirkham prison, and the
reason why it is managed in that way, and has such a commercial focus,
is that an outside investor has invested hundreds of thousands of
pounds in a production line in a reused factory building or aircraft
hangar within the grounds of Kirkham, which is an open prison. The
business repackages food, which is imported in pallets from overseas,
so that it is suitable to be resold in shops and small stores,
principally in the north-west. The business is highly successful, and
the prisoners are incentivised to work, so they are highly committed to
the process. But that is an all too rare example of an actual business
in our prisons that produces not only a return for the business owner,
but an income stream for the
institution.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
is where we need to take prison work. We have to take it in that
direction because we have no choice; we cannot fund prison work as a
programme. It cannot be a cost centre in the current circumstances
because  we will not be able to take it to scale. That presents
us with a challenge because to move from 9,000 of our 85,000 prisoners
employed to some degree to many more tens of thousands effectively
employed in our prisons, and to reach the scale where they generate a
commercial return, requires a profound change in the approach to the
organisation of our prison estate. All the hon. Lady’s questions
flow from that point.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000062">&#160;</a>

is to increase the number to 10,000 by 2015 and to 20,000 by 2020? If
that is the case, between the last general election in 2010 and the
next, there will be an increase of 1,000. It may be an improvement, but
it is not impressive and not at all commensurate with the rhetoric we

                  </strong> That argument assumes that we have 9,000 people
employed in commercial work now, which we do not. I have probably seen
the one example of serious commercial work in prisons. As the hon.
Member for Stretford and Urmston said, there are examples from
Manchester and elsewhere, but I have not seen all of them, nor do I
know how many are commercial. I would have thought, however, that
rather fewer than 500 of that 9,000 are actually engaged in something
commercial. About 500 category D prisoners work outside prisons on
temporary licence, and they go back to prison each night. The
requirements of the Prisoners’ Earnings Act 1996 now apply to
them, but I will come back to that point later. The hon. Lady should
see the target in terms of getting 10,000 prisoners working in a rather
different way.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000064">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The target is
only an indication, frankly. At this stage, it can only be a set of
aspirations. We face significant challenges to get this to scale and I
want to take it as far as possible. First, we need to get society as a
whole signed up to the fact that it is a good idea for prisoners to
work usefully in our prisons. The Secretary of State announced that
approach in October last year. It received a warm welcome, and I am
delighted that the Opposition have made clear their support for the
scale of our ambition. Now, we have to engage the CBI, the TUC, and
everyone else involved in issues relating to unfair competition coming
out of prisons. We need to make sure that, in the first instance, the
CBI thinks it is a good idea that its businesses on the outside can be
competed against by businesses and prisoners working on the inside. Its
position appears to be that yes, it is.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000065">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Then, we have
to address the issue of what fair competition from people working in a
prison is. Let me be clear that prisoners will not be employed in
prison by a business in the same way as people outside. If prisoners
were employed on the inside subject to employment regulation, minimum
wage and everything else, employers could kiss goodbye to any prospect
of running a business inside a jail almost from the start. No business
would be able to carry the cost of running itself inside a prison, with
all the additional costs that that implies, and then be subject to such
things as minimum wage, or producing a wage for prisoners.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000066">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On a recent
visit to the United States I saw some examples where it is insisted
that prisoners are paid. Deductions towards the cost of running the
prison and towards the prisoners’ upkeep are then made from the
wages, until eventually prisoners end up with 10% or 20% of the
notional money that they would receive in the 90th percentile of the
average pay in that industry. There is also a complicated agreement
with trade unions, and so on, about the average pay for the particular
business that is being carried out in the jails. I do not want to go
there, however, because it is far too complicated and regulatory, and
has resulted in the scale of work in 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 766<a class="bkMark" name="Column766">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the federal prison system in the United States being now only about
15,000 prisoners out of, I think, 250,000. When that system was set up
in the 1930s, the federal Government was mandated to buy anything
produced by the federal prison system. If the
federal prison produced something, the federal Government was supposed
to purchase it, but that has not worked to the scale that was designed
when the scheme was set up. I have been to the United States
specifically to look at work in prisons, and to identify what does not
work and the policy obstacles that prevent putting such a system in
place and bringing it to
scale.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000067">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> Let me give the right hon. Gentleman and the
Committee my vision. We want tens of thousands of prisoners to be
working productively in our prisons. For that to happen, they must want
to get to the working part of the prison or prison estate. If the
scheme is to work properly, prisoners must wish to engage in it and
must regard it as something that will make their time in prison more
productive and useful to them. Putting the question of money to one
side, prisoners will spend their time in prison being taught skills and
being trained in some form of service or production. Such training will
provide them with a good CV, and they will be skilled up, with
experience of working in a particular business.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000069">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">On that basis
alone, prisoners should want to get to that place, and it will be a
much more interesting way for them to spend their time in prison than
is the experience of most prisoners at present. Everything I have seen
from round the world demonstrates that if such a system existed, it
would act as a magnet to attract prisoners to that part of the
estate.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000070">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That
brings us to the matter of learning—basic literacy and
numeracy—offending behaviour programmes and the addiction issues
that the system must address. Prisoners must attend to those matters
before they can get to the part of the prison estate where there is
work. People must complete their offending behaviour programmes and
must deal with the lack of basic literacy and numeracy skills that
results in their being unable to be effective members of
society—let alone effective members of a production team in a
prison. They must also address their health problems, principally those
relating to addiction, so that they are clean before they reach the
working part of the prison estate. That is the broad concept.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000071">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The measure
would apply to all categories of prisoner; there is no reason why any
particular category should be exempt. The hon. Member for Bishop
Auckland has visited Frankland, which is a category A prison. It
carries out some of the most effective work in prisons, producing
furniture for the Government. Indeed, the new headquarters of the
National Offender Management Service has been decked out in furniture
made in Her Majesty’s Prison Frankland, as one would
expect.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000072">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">How do we set
up such businesses? No capital expenditure budget is at Her
Majesty’s disposal because all the money has gone, so we must
find a new source to invest in prison workshop capacity to enable
prisoners to work. That will come in two ways. Our intention is to turn
the current prison industries directorate in NOMS into a trading fund.
It could be similar to the system in the United States, where Federal
Prison Industries is run as a trading fund, which turns a profit. It
might not have turned a profit in the past year or two, but it has
funds at its disposal and it is meant to generate a
return.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000073">&#160;</a>

                  </div>and Urmston asked, such as how the trading fund will work. Even in the
current climate, when consultancy is much more difficult to obtain, we
have identified that as a sufficient priority for us to get outside
help. At one level business will be secured by a prison industries
training fund, and whatever industrial capacity is available in current
prisons will be used. Major contracts will be delivered across a number
of different
prisons.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000080">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
also want to work from the bottom up. I want to put in place a
framework, or a code of practice, so that individual institutions and
individual prison governors will know what arrangements they can make
with individual businesses to come into their prison to create the
capital investment—the workshop—where prisoners will
work, and so that they know how much return they will be entitled to on
the investment they make inside the prison. How will the commercials
function? As long as we do not burden the system at the beginning with
demands for the minimum wage or a full notional return on the prisoner
labour, we shall have serious flexibility to enable the businesses to
function. A key thing is that the businesses will have to carry the
cost of the additional staff and the extra costs of running the regime
in prisons.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000081">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland and other hon. Members who are familiar with
the core prison week will know, it is tricky to run a business if the
prisoners come off the landings at 8.30 in the morning, are taken to
what they now do as work and then at 11 o’clock are taken back
from their work site to the landings to have their lunch. Then the
prison officers have their lunch. Then the prisoners are released from
their cells in the afternoon and taken back to their place of work. At
4.30 they go back to the landings. That is how the core week works.
With that arrangement there are five hours of work, if we are lucky, as
a maximum. If one was running a business on that basis, most people
would see that there was a bit of a handicap even before they
began.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000082">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The regime
will have to change. There will almost certainly need to be additional
staff or a different way of running the regime, however it happens. We
cannot lose the aspect that the hon. Lady asked about on behalf of the
Prisoner Officers Association: the safety, security and decency agenda.
All those things have to be sustained, but instead of the current
system, with work levered into the prison system so that it does not
interfere with the security arrangements, we would be better off
building the security around the work. We obviously have to achieve the
same level of security, but if the investment is there and the
businesses are generating the resources, it creates the opportunity to
have a slightly more expensive security regime, to enable
prisoners’ time to be used more
productively.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000083">&#160;</a>

will—where some of those flexibilities are already being applied
successfully. In Manchester prison, which is a public sector prison
where the businesses are being run by prison industries, not by
external companies—although I may be wrong about
that—they have managed to adapt the prison regime so that
prisoners can spend the day in the work setting. I hope that the

already. Does he intend that the expansion of prison

scheme in every way. There is no reason why the existing prison
industry cannot do that, run through the prison industries directorate,
although there needs to be a minor change of direction so that it is
far more commercial about running those businesses. The focus needs to
be less on them being a highly effective programme in the prison, and
more on them being commercial. It would not be much of a change in
direction for the businesses if there was much more focus on marketing
and the markets they serve, thereby affecting their return. I agree
with the hon. Lady. There is no reason why that should not

               <p class="tabbed">Of
course, all this stuff happens in bits, particularly in prisons where
good governors have forced the issue within their institutions and used
the flexibilities available to them. I sometimes find that there are
particularly good governors in the prison system who are going beyond;
they are taking themselves into a slightly difficult area. They are not
quite sure of the rules, but they will push the boundaries to achieve
objectives. I want to support them by giving them a much clearer code
of practice, so that individual governors know exactly what deal they
can offer. However, if we are going into commercial relationships with
businesses making a proper return, the arrangements will have to be
transparent and clear to everyone—not least if that leads to
challenges about what is fair or unfair competition from a business run
in a

success. In the construction of the scheme, prisoners must want to get
to those places and work there if the concept is  to succeed.
There will be plenty of other things that we can require prisoners to
do, such as wing cleaning, maintenance and everything else, which are

of us are conscious of a problem that faces prisoners who have
completed their licence. They have reformed and they want to work, but
it is difficult for them to find a job because there is a gap in their
CV. It is not that they do not have to explain it, but when they turn
up before an employer and there is a gap in their CV it suggests either
long-term unemployment or a prison sentence. If that gap is now filled

                     </span>
                  </strong> The latter option is precluded because we do not
have any money. The businesses have to make a return, so if we say that
the objective is a full programme of employment, it will end up as a
cost centre for us, and there are no additional funds. Therefore, we
must find creative ways of getting investment into the programme so
that it works. If it is commercial and economic, it is sustainable.
There is then a proper business, and—guess what?—the
prisoners taking part in it will have a real interest in that business
continuing to
succeed.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000093">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
are obviously now wrestling with the issues, and this is where we need
advice from corporate United Kingdom as to what is fair competition for
a business coming out of a prison. That is why engagement with the CBI
and the TUC will be extremely important, so that corporate Britain
signs up to the concept and there is a basic set of rules as to the
definition of fair competition. Rather than us setting a notional rate
of pay, we will need to get a point where each business can generate
extra funds once there is a proper return on the business
owner’s investment. Once the extra costs of managing the prison
are taken into account, the profit that the business makes is the
return on the prisoner
labour.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000094">&#160;</a>

               </h4>
               <p class="tabbed">That
return will go in three directions. The first is to the prisoner, as
now. There is no change to the overall scope of the prisoner allowance
as it is paid now. I do not want as a matter of policy to start
inflating the amount of money kicking around inside prisons. So the
prisoner allowance will be paid, as now, £10 to £20 a
week for the kind of work that is going on. That is what I envisage,
but again, we are in the policy development phase. The rest of the
funds will go in two directions. One is to victims. It is an absolute
priority that prisoners’ work is seen to service the victims of
crime. It will not be possible to establish a relationship between
individual prisoners and their victims, so this will be to help fund
the victim services that are funded by the Ministry of Justice. That is
a critical component. There has to be a return to victims in this,
otherwise, quite understandably, the public will have questions about
its
acceptability.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000095">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third element will go towards the rehabilitation of the prisoner. We
are some way off coming to the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 771<a class="bkMark" name="Column771">&#160;</a>
                  </div>detail of that, which is why I am not in a position to accept the hon.
Lady’s amendments. This is probably more difficult to construct
than the other elements of the return. It would be perfectly proper to
say that it could be money for dependants outside. It could also go
into a fund that prisoners could draw on when they are released. If
they were going on a skills programme, for example, they could
immediately draw on those funds to pay for their own education and
training. It could be put aside as a fund that they would receive if
they did not reoffend for two years. It would be their money, as they
had earned it, but it would be held out against their good behaviour on
release from
prison.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000096">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
are several different ways that we could do this and I am in the market
for good ideas. Obviously the hon. Lady’s amendment is one good
idea. This is the kind of detail that needs to be brought forward in
secondary legislation and that is what we will do. We are at the
policy-making phase. We are examining how it will work and exactly what
the right framework would be. I have dealt with the wage level, unfair
competition and whether this is inside or outside prison. I hope that
we can expand the scope of category D prisoners working outside
prisons. One of the interesting things I saw  in the United
States was a construction team based in what was effectively an open
prison going out to work in particular villages and communities in
Georgia. It worked rather well as a concept.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000097">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_ParaIndent">Those
who work outside prisons are currently employed by someone outside and
return to prison every day. The Prisoners’ Earnings Act now
applies to them and we are going to take 40% of the income they earn.
Currently, they have lucked out. They have a job outside and their
board and lodgings are provided by Her Majesty. We will now take some
of the money they earn and put it towards victims. One of the statutory
requirements of the Prisoners Earnings’ Act is that we nominate
the organisation to which the money goes. The hon. Member for Bishop
Auckland asked me why it was Victim Support. I thought that, because it
is the first time we have done this, it was probably appropriate to
give it to an organisation that is generic for victims. It happens to
be the largest victim services organisation and it provides the widest
range of services. There was a temptation to use the sum of money
involved—about £1 million—for one particular
cause. It could be Support after Murder and Manslaughter, or Rape
Crisis. It would obviously make a substantial difference to
organisations of that size, but I thought that was the wrong approach.
This is first of class. Hopefully, the Prisoners Earnings’ Act
will be overtaken by the Bill if the Committee and other Members of
Parliament so decide. It will mean that the current operation of the
Act is temporary, which is why I decided that Victim Support had made
the clearest statement about the policy. It is about victims. The
biggest victim support organisation will be involved, and we are
absolutely confident that our decision complies completely with the
appropriate EU
regulations.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have argued that people have to undertake education training programmes
before they are involved in prison work, and I come now to the
extremely important question about women in prisons and whether there
should be a women’s champion. Frankly, I see myself as the
champion for women prisoners in exactly the same way as I have to be
the champion for all my responsibilities. It is important that women in
prisons have the same access to the programme as men in
prisons.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000098">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I hope that
there will be opportunities for industries that are particularly
suitable for women’s prisons. Women will have the same priority
as men. It will be a big bonus if we can get the programme away to
scale for women as it is for men. I cannot say to the hon. Member for
Bishop Auckland that women will be a bigger priority than men. They
will have the same priority as male prisoners under the policy for work
in prisons, not least because the work is not designed to be a
programme. It will be commercial and have rehabilitative effects for
men and women, and give them the free good that comes off the back of
such
work.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000099">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Minister’s comments are reasonable. I
am not criticising him, but, of necessity, the work done by prisoners
will have to be work that can be done without client contact. In the
modern economy, many jobs and more especially women’s jobs in
the service sector involve such contact. I am making a constructive
point: people must learn skills that can be used in the economy as it
is now, not as it was 15 years
ago.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000100">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The hon. Lady is right. I shall have to look at
client contact, and whether prisoners can help market the business with
narrowly controlled access to internet sites. We shall have to deal
with all such issues, possibly case by case and as the business
develops. It is plainly good for prisoners to be involved in the whole
of the business, from its management to the production of services,
because that will make it easier for the business to function. If
discrete functions have to be carried on outside prison on a commercial
basis, that will be another on-cost to running a business on two sites,
something that we want to
avoid.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000101">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The

whether the Work programme can be subcontracted to the probation
service or the Prison Service. I shall follow up that extremely
interesting point. I am certainly sympathetic to it. I shall also
consider carefully the offender stream within the Work programme. It
could be of profound benefit, and sit separately from the provisions
under the Bill. The hon. Lady also raised the issue of how prisoners
might start working with a Work programme provider who is embedded in a
prison and then be transferred to a different provider if, once they
are discharged, their home is some way from the prison. Those practical
issues have to be addressed, and the hon. Lady has made perfectly good
points about some of the practical
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000102">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Another challenge will be the level of remuneration
received by the Work programme provider for working with prisoners,
because the programme has different levels of payment depending on the
scale of the distance from the labour market. I am sure that the
Minister will want to explore that matter with the Department for Work
and Pensions,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000103">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> We are doing so. Some 60% of prisoners arrive in
prison with a history of recent drug use, if not a deeply embedded
addiction habit. If providers take  a drug-addicted prisoner
and turn him into a tax- paying employee, the scale of benefit
to society is fairly 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 773<a class="bkMark" name="Column773">&#160;</a>
                  </div>straightforward. Those factors are therefore unlikely to be scored at

strategy.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000104">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Finally,
it is appropriate to finish with a point about victims. The hon. Lady
asked whether dependants or victims will be taken together. No, they
will not—victims come first. In the end, the strategy has to
focus on victims of crime, which it will do in two ways. First, the
prisoner’s work will generate money for services for victims of
crime. Secondly, free good will come out of the process: if men and
women return to the community from prison having engaged in work and
acquired the skills associated with work, they are much more likely to
be rehabilitated and much less likely to create future victims of
crime. Those two benefits should be the priorities behind the entire
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000106">&#160;</a>

am not sure whether the Bill is necessary to fulfil the

Government’s rhetoric about how much progress they will make in
the next three to four years will not be realised in the form of a
rapid expansion of the project. However, I entirely accept that the

                  </strong> I beg to move amendment 414, in
clause 105, page 85, line 38, at

               <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(a) The Secretary of
State shall not exercise his powers under sections 6A, 6B and 6C of the
Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 unless he makes a declaration that
any person transited under these sections is not at risk of execution,
torture or persecution.</p>
               <p class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(b) A
declaration must be in writing and be published in such a manner as the
Secretary of State considers
appropriate.’.</p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am rather concerned by the clause. It looks innocent, but all members
of the Committee will remember the alarming stories about the rendition
of prisoners. I want to explore whether the clause would make rendition
easier, which is why I have tabled the amendment. Again, this is a
subject on which there is cross-party concern. The hon. Member for
Chichester (Mr Tyrie) ran a very successful campaign; indeed, he has
written a book about this serious problem.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000121">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As I
understand it, the policy has been to seek to ratify and conclude
bilateral agreements that allow for the transfer of prisoners without
their consent, and progress has been slow. At the same time, the United
Kingdom is a party to two multi-party agreements. We are signatories of
the Council of Europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons,
and we also have the

			Column number: 775<a class="bkMark" name="Column775">&#160;</a>
                  </div>Commonwealth scheme for the transfer of convicted offenders. In
addition, we have ratified the additional protocols of the Council of
Europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons. Under that,
there are 34 signatory countries to which prisoners can be transferred
without their consent. That includes Libya, and the Commonwealth scheme
includes countries that, sadly, do not have particularly good human
rights records at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000122">&#160;</a>

I understand it, the people concerned had not been through a proper

sentenced by a lawful court. I hope that
helps.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000123">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Yes. I understand those were people who had been
picked up on the battlefield. I have discussed the matter with the
organisation Justice, which agreed with my concern that it potentially
sanctions UK involvement in rendition of those detained by foreign
criminal courts or foreign laws.</p>

                  </strong> I am still concerned that we might find ourselves
having people coming from a jurisdiction, when the jurisdiction itself
and the way the person has been treated in the criminal courts may be
of concern. That is one problem. They then turn up in this country and
we parcel them off somewhere else without their consent. My concern is
that, in the second place to which they are parcelled off, they could
be subject  to torture. I have worded the amendment as I have
because I would like the Minister to explain, if my understanding is
wrong, why it is wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000125">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> The purpose of the clause is to put in place powers
to enable the United Kingdom to facilitate the transit of prisoners
through its territory. Such prisoners will be transferring from another
state to a third state where there is a treaty between those states for
a prisoner to be repatriated. The prisoner will not have been
prosecuted, convicted or sentenced in the UK. Transit arrangements
would normally mean enabling a prisoner and escort to transfer from one
aeroplane to another at one of our international airports.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000126">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We expect
requests under this power to be few in number and only for the purpose
of enforcing a sentence of imprisonment lawfully passed on a prisoner
by an appropriate court in the sentencing state. In most cases the
prisoner concerned will have given his consent to transfer and will be
returning to his country of nationality, where he can serve his
sentence close to his family and friends, aiding his rehabilitation
back into society.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000127">&#160;</a>

               </div>
               <p class="tabbed">The amendment
proposes an addition to clause 105 that would require Ministers to make
a declaration that a prisoner subject to transit through the territory
of the UK would not be at risk of execution, torture or persecution in
the country to which they are being transferred, and to make
arrangements for the publication of that
declaration.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000128">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s position on the death penalty is unequivocal and
any request for transit for the purpose of carrying out the death
penalty would be refused. Transit is provided for in all our existing
prisoner transfer arrangements. With the exception of the EU framework
decision on prisoner transfer, where there is a requirement to
facilitate transit, transit is discretionary, and Ministers are able to
refuse any request, and they will of course do so, if they have any
concerns about an individual transit request or a particular state to
which the prisoner is being transferred.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000129">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In those
circumstances, I do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate for
Ministers to make a declaration as proposed. In addition, I have
mentioned the EU prisoner transfer agreement, which requires us to
facilitate transfer if requested. However under that agreement transit
involves the transit of a prisoner only from one EU member state to
another. Each member state is bound by the European convention on human
rights and we would expect each state fully to honour its commitments
and
obligations.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
UK will have no jurisdiction to interfere in international agreements
made between two separate states where they are transferring a prisoner
in accordance with those arrangements. The UK will expect other
countries to facilitate transfers of foreign national prisoners
repatriated from the UK; it plays its part in doing the same for other
states. Those are all prisoners who have been convicted and sentenced.
A declaration such as that sought by the amendment may give a prisoner
on arrival in the UK the right to challenge the UK’s decision to
allow further transit. Furthermore, a Minister could not properly make
such a declaration based on information given by the relevant state
when, not being party to the arrangements or the prisoner’s
views, the Minister would have no means of verifying such
information.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I hope, in
the light of that information and the rather limited circumstances in
which and to whom the provision would apply, that the hon. Lady will
withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11101335000132">&#160;</a>
