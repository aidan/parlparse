<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I beg to move amendment No. 767, in page 73, line 10, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(1A) The Secretary of State shall, before making an order bring into effect the provisions of this Act relating to Transport for London, publish a list of the property, rights and liabilities that will be held by Transport for London or any subsidiary of Transport for London."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. O'Hara, after our brief half-term holiday. I hope that you enjoyed your break; I am sure that you were working hard in your constituency, as many other members of the Committee were in theirs.
<P>
I also welcome the clause because it is one of the few to introduce greater flexibility to the operation of the Greater London authority and Transport for London. It will enable the various players to move around assets, rights and liabilities in a way that could empower Transport for London and the GLA to do their job more effectively. I am attracted by the clause because it begins to make the job of mayor for London more worth while. However, despite its value, I, like my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr.Hughes), have not been tempted to put my hat into the ring for that job.
<P>
I apologise to the Committee for the typographical error in amendment No. 767 as it appears on the amendment paper. It should, of course, begin:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall, before making an order bringing into effect the provisions of this Act",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and I am sure that members of the Committee took it to mean that.
<P>
The information that we ask for should be available to the Committee as we debate the clause. The Minister will say that aspects of that information are already published in annual reports and elsewhere in the public domain. However, they should be brought together in a coherent, structured way so that we can see what Transport for London will be worth and what assets it will hold.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will say clearly when the Government intend to publish the information, even if they do not accept the amendment. I also hope that he will tell the Committee how they intend to publish it. In the balance sheet that would presumably accompany such a publication, will they show clearly the types of assets, liabilities and rights and how they differ?
<P>
I shall be specific on that point: new clauses 42 to 44, which we shall debate later, will limit the marketability of Transport for London's assets by defining some of them as key system assets that cannot be used for collateral security. Those assets will have a different nature on any balance sheet. I hope that, when the Government publish the list of assets, liabilities and rights that we ask for, they will indicate such differences. That will be important to the people of London, to interested parties looking at the accounts and to future mayoral candidates.
<P>
It is important that the information is published as soon as possible because it might play a major part in the mayoral elections. Mayoral candidates might want to put to the people of London their ideas of how those assets could be used. They will be the most valuable part of the GLA's portfolio, and it is important that candidates can say how they will use them for the benefit of Londoners.
<P>
Before the last election, there was a discussion about the potential for privatising London Transport, an idea put forward by the previous Conservative Government. During that debate, there were huge variations in the estimates as to how much London Transport and London Underground were worth. If I recall correctly, the Government of the time put a figure of &#163;800 million on those assets, while estimates of up to &#163;13 billion were made elsewhere. When such a huge range of valuations exists, the Government must be specific about what they think the assets are worth, so that those estimates can be challenged and form part of the debate with the mayor.
<P>
Large amounts of land and buildings in the capital will be owned by the Greater London authority. Local communities will wish to know the views of assembly candidates on the future use of those assets. Employees of the relevant bodies will wish to know the rights and frameworks surrounding the pension rights of those working for the new authority.
<P>
Some of that information is gradually being prepared. In 1997, the Treasury published the national asset register, the so-called Domesday book, which sets out a number of the assets to be transferred. For example, it tells us that the net fixed assets of the department of the Traffic Director for London are &#163;0.28million, and those assets will be transferred. It gives a very limited breakdown of the assets of London Regional Transport and gives the value of LRT's net fixed assets as &#163;7,485.2 million. I could go on.
<P>
The so-called Domesday book does not meet the demands of the amendment, because it does not give the sort of detail to which Londoners are entitled. The original Domesday book was more comprehensible and detailed than the Government's more modern attempt.
<P>
Central Government are bringing in new accounting systems. Reforms were triggered by the previous Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring in resource accounting. Those important reforms, which were welcomed in all parts of the House, enable us to look more closely at the capital assets of the public sector and to make proper decisions about them. We can then find out what the civil service and the Government are doing to the capital base of our country.
<P>
Given that that reform is well under way in central Government, and is being implemented in other areas of the public sector such as the national health service and local authorities, I hope that the Government will ensure that the new authority will play its part in that financial revolution in the public sector. The starting point is to have the information published.
<P>
I wish to ask the Minister some specific questions. When will the Government publish that information? What estimates can they give to the Committee today of the value of the total assets and liabilities of the Greater London authority and of Transport for London? What breakdown would they be prepared to give to the Committee? What accounting rules and standards will the new body have to follow? Will it work to the new resource accounting rules, or will it have separate rules? Will it take the benefits of accruals accounting, and how will that be linked to the information that we are demanding today? I look forward to the Minister's response, and I hope that the Government, in their professed spirit of openness, will provide us with the information that we require.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway (Croydon, South):</B> I support the amendment in the spirit in which it was moved. However, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) took nine minutes to deliver a point that most of us understood in 30 seconds. We have a long way to go today, and if he could make his points in 90 seconds everyone would benefit. I do not mean to curtail his freedom of speech--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman has used 90 seconds making that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The amendment essentially relates to clauses 142 and 143. There is a lot at stake in the transfer of London Regional Transport to TfL, and we will make our points on the amendment in clause stand part debates on those clauses.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said some nice things about the clause, including that it introduces flexibility. We welcome those remarks. With the characteristic Liberal Democrat approach, he then moved an amendment that would entirely negate the benefits of that flexibility. The amendment would hamstring the authority and make it impossible for it to operate in a sensible and flexible way.
<P>
The amendment would require the Secretary of State to publish a list of any property, rights and liabilities to be held by TfL or its subsidiaries before making any orders--not only those relating to transfer--that bring into effect provisions relating to TfL.
<P>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to think about the implications of that. Such a list would be a massive undertaking. It would cover not only every piece of transport and maintenance equipment, but staff contracts and other legal items. To expect all that to be published before any preliminary step to bring TfL into existence is taken is a recipe for paralysis. Such thinking is to be expected of the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
Clause 139 is not in itself about transfers of property, rights and liabilities to TfL from its predecessors. It is typical of the Liberal Democrats that they have missed that point. It is about the GLA's ability to transfer the legal ownership of property, rights and liabilities between itself, TfL and its subsidiaries. As I suggested to my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) in my written answer on 11 February;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Subject to the passage of the Greater London Authority Bill, the Greater London Authority"--</font></ul>
<P>
and, therefore, TfL--
<P><UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
"will assume its responsibilities on Monday 3 July 2000."--[Official Report, 11 February 1999; Vol. 325, c. 314.]</font></ul>
<P>
Later, we intend to make a provision in the Bill to allow property, rights and liabilities to be transferred, either by order or by transfer scheme, from bodies such as London Regional Transport to their successors such as TfL. The vast majority of property, rights and liabilities relating to the relevant functions of those predecessors will probably transfer to TfL. Our assumption is that that will be done by exclusion. That means that orders and schemes will list the general classes of rights, property and liabilities that are to transfer from each relevant predecessor. They will also list those individual rights, items of property and liabilities that are not to transfer.
<P>
To produce a comprehensive list of every item that will transfer to TfL from its relevant predecessors would be a hugely time--consuming and expensive undertaking, and it would not be justifiable.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): Is the Minister saying that London Transport does not have a list of its current assets?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am not saying anything of the sort. I am saying that it would be preposterous to compile and publish a list of every detail, referring to every item and staff contract, as would be required by the Liberal Democrats' amendment. Only organisations that never expect to hold power could suggest such a list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Is the Minister telling the Committee that a list of the assets, rights and liabilities of London Regional Transport is not available to him, as the Minister for London and Construction, and to his colleagues? If that is the case, it is a scandal.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman does not listen. In answer to his previous intervention, I explained that that was not the case. I also explained, and I will say it again as he did not listen, that of course London Transport has asset lists. However, the publication of a comprehensive list, in the terms suggested by his amendment, would be a bureaucratic operation on a nightmarish scale. It would completely hamstring the establishment of Transport for London.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton are not listening. The amendment would prevent any action to bring TfL into existence before the list had been published at extraordinary and inordinate length. The Liberal Democrats clearly find the matter difficult to understand, so I will give way once again.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I know that when the Greater London council disappeared, a full list of its assets in the boroughs, such as my borough of Southwark, was not available for years. Some years later, people still did not know what was inherited from the GLC. That is the history. If the Minister says that it is not impossible to produce a list and if London Regional Transport is not incompetent, will he undertake to publish within the next month, for all members of the Committee and the public, a list of what London Regional Transport must currently hold as assets, rights and liabilities?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, I shall give no such undertaking. I have already made it clear to the hon. Gentleman that the requirements of the amendment would be nightmarishly complex and bureaucratic. To publish every contract of every employee of London Transport is a preposterous suggestion. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman is seriously suggesting it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> We are simply asking the Minister to tell us what he is prepared to publish. The national asset register was published by his Government, and his own Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions set a capitalisation threshold level of &#163;1,000 for the information about the Coastguard Agency that it was prepared to publish in the register. It was prepared to enter into that level of detail to produce the register. If the Department will provide such information about the Coastguard Agency why is it not prepared to do the sane for the Greater London authority?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman clearly has great difficulty with understanding this matter and for his benefit I will repeat my point. The Liberal Democrats find it difficult to understand the practical process of government. We have said that we will publish an order that will list the general classes of rights, property and liabilities, but not every single last sparking plug or item owned by every London Transport garage in London. That is the preposterous suggestion of the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
We will publish a list of the general classes of rights, property and liabilities that will transfer and, secondly, we will publish a list of the individual rights, property and liabilities that will not transfer. That will satisfy all the requirements of proper scrutiny and accountability without creating the nightmarishly complex list that the Liberal Democrats would like.
<P>
Orders made by the Secretary of State will be published in the normal way and will be subject to the negative procedure. The arrangements for transfer schemes are different: such schemes are well precedented in reorganisations of public bodies. They offer a more flexible and less expensive approach than statutory transfers or conveyancing. It would be unusual for the Secretary of State to be required to publish transfer schemes as that requirement would largely negate the benefits of the scheme mechanism.
<P>
The Secretary of State will no doubt want to consider, when the schemes are made, whether there would be benefits in publishing them. However, it would defeat the object of the transfer mechanism to require the Secretary of State to do so.
<P>
The questions of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton about accountancy procedures are outwith the clause and the amendment. We can return to those in the future when it will be in order to do so.
<P>
I have made clear the reasons why the amendment is entirely inappropriate and not just technically deficient but unworkable. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> For a Government who are committed to freedom of information, that is not a very good start to the day.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony McNulty  </B>(Harrow, East): Get on with it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If the Government proceeded with the revealing of facts,, we would make some progress, The Minister has read the brief but not the amendment. The amendment states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Secretary of State shall, before making an order bringing into effect the provisions of this Act relating to Transport for London, publish a list".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We do not want publication of all the contracts; we want a list. We want a list, for example, of the land in each of the London boroughs that is owned by London Regional Transport. We want a list of the values of rolling stock. That is not unreasonable. The amendment does not call for a list of numbers of sparking plugs--that is an example of a ridiculous, civil servant-type brief trying to undermine a perfectly reasonable amendment. The amendment states that the Government should make a list available--I should hope that they would be able to do so today. If the Minister does not give a positive answer, we will table questions and harry him, at great cost to the taxpayer, until he does so.
<P>
Is the Minister suggesting that LRT, which represents a nationalised industry, does not have available a list of its assets, rights and liabilities that it is willing to give to the public? If so, that is a scandal. If LRT does not have a list, I hope that he will ensure that it has one by the end of this month.
<P>
<B>Mr . Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman always likes to make a huge fuss about things that do not merit it. If he had considered the wording of the amendment--it was tabled in his name, although his hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton moved it--he would have realised that the problem is that it does not refer specifically only to the categories to which he just referred. it refers to any rights, any liabilities and any assets. Therefore, a list that failed to list all assets, all rights and all liabilities would be defective, and the Government could be challenged for failing to satisfy its requirements. That is how a list of every single spark plug could come about.
<P>
This is what is extraordinary about the Liberal Democrats. I explained to the Committee that the Government would be proposing a procedure for the provision of general principles for transfer, under which the general categories would be listed and the relevant information would be provided. That covers exactly the 667 668 
<P>
point that the hon. Gentleman raised in his previous intervention. He has been talking to his hon. Friend rather than listening. If he had bothered to listen, he would have realised that the Government are meeting in full his amendment's objective.
<P>
The Government are not prepared to accept a defectively worded amendment that would--if it were required by challenge to be legally met--impose a completely unreasonable set of obligations on the Government. I have given way quite enough to the hon. Gentleman; he clearly does not intend to listen. The amendment is unworkable and unrealistic, and I hope that it will be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I welcome the support of Conservative Members. However, I found the comments of the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) odd, as he has detained the Committee for long periods of time on the question of whether the Bill should refer to chairman or chair and on discussions of the assembly's photocopying facilities.
<P>
The amendment is incredibly important--it deserved an introduction of more than nine minutes. It concerns the setting out of the Greater London authority's balance sheet, which will be worth billions of pounds. If the hon. Member for Croydon, South thinks that that is not worthy of debate, his financial credentials have fallen even further than the level to which the Committee has become accustomed.
<P>
I found the Minister's response astonishing. He is not prepared to reveal the types of details that will be included on the list that the Government are to publish. He talked about general categories. He could have given us a market value. Is it going to go down--[Interruption.] 
I hear concern from the Government Benches. Will there be a line similar to the line in the national asset register, which simply states that London Regional Transport's infrastructure and other property is worth &#163;3.5 billion? If this is the Government's idea of openness, it does not resemble their words in their White Paper on freedom of information. "Infrastructure and other property" is a general category, but it tells us nothing. It would not enable mayoral candidates to put forward their manifesto commitments on the running of Transport for London.
<P>
Sir Humphrey has clearly been working overtime on the Minister's brief so as to put forward ridiculous debating points. However, the Minister has failed to understand what Sir Humphrey has been doing elsewhere. I referred earlier to the national asset register and the DETR's own list. The Minister should look at his Department's publications. The list of executive agencies that fall under the DETR gives details of the capital assets that several agencies hold, down to very small amounts.
<P>
In the reports in the national asset register, the Marine Safety Agency has grouped together assets that are worth as little as &#163;500. The Minister talks as if I and my hon. Friend were trying to be ludicrous. In fact, we are trying to follow the Government's own policy. We are saying, "Yes, the public sector should be open about its capital assets." That is an important matter of public record.
<P>
It is one of the tragedies of the public sector and of political debate that such information was not open to us in the past. We were unable properly to scrutinise Government spending and the activities of the civil service because we did not have such information. Indeed, Ministers were unable to examine what their civil servants were doing because the information was not readily available to them. It is important that we have the relevant information before we establish Transport for London.
<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment to a vote because I am more interested in the Minister's comments about the Government's intentions to publish information later. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made clear, we intend to follow up the spirit of the Minister's comments through Parliamentary Questions and to harry the Government until they are far more open than they have been today.

<P>

<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster):</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey attacked one aspect of the brief that the Minister read out as being typical of a civil service brief. Furthermore, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made a reference to Sir Humphrey. I will leave aside the convention that we do not attack those who prepare briefs, but I should say that most of them work in my constituency. I do not propose to challenge the hon. Gentlemen to a duel on the strength of their observations so far, but if we have any more of it I will see them behind the bike shed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<P>
Clause 139 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P><center>
<B>Clause 140</B></center><P>
<P><center><b>Restirictions on the disposal of land</b></center>
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 787, in page 73, line 24, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Mayor and Assembly".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments: 
<P>
No. 789, in page 73, line 34, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Major and Assembly".
<P>
No. 790, in page 73, line 36, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Major and Assembly".
<P>
No. 814, in Clause 141, page 74, line 3, leave out "Secretary of State" and insert "Mayor and Assembly".
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The amendments would give more powers to the mayor and the assembly and would strip powers from the Secretary of State. That is a familiar theme, which we have raised many times in Committee. it is, however, still right in principle and worth returning to in every case.
<P>
In every case, one can judge what I and my hon. Friends are trying to do in a generic sense by considering whether the Secretary of State or the assembly and the mayor should have more power. However, one should also--I hope that the Government will do this--judge amendments such as those before us on their merits in the context of the specific case. The amendments merit debate and inclusion in the Bill.
<P>
In our previous debate, we talked about the flexibility of clause 139, which was welcome. The amendments would simply extend that flexibility a little. If clause 140 is accepted unamended, the Secretary of State will have far too much to do. It is conceivable that every Red Box that he receives every weekend will contain yet another order for him to think about and sign. The clause gives him powers that are not only intrusive--as we have seen elsewhere, particularly in the financial clauses--but which he may have to employ very actively. Clearly, that makes no sense, particularly if one is interested in devolution.
<P>
Subsection (3) is particularly relevant. It states that the Secretary of State's powers will still apply to land that is not in use as a railway or tramway. One can easily imagine that the Secretary of State will frequently be asked to consider orders in this connection. There is also the issue of representation. The assembly members and the mayor will be directly elected by the people of London and will represent them. The land and property covered by the clause are important to many local communities. Surely the people who have been elected to represent those communities ought to have more of a say about what happens to those assets.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
When in Opposition, the Labour party made similar arguments about how Railtrack was operating--with the consent of the Secretary of State at the time. The Labour party then wanted to democratise that process; unfortunately it appears to have gone back on its fine words when in Opposition, and now wants to centralise control of many local community assets.
<P>
The Minister may say that Transport for London or the Greater London authority may make a decision that endangers the integrity of the national railway network--by selling off land and preventing a national decision about a new rail investment, for example. That is a good argument, to which we are sensitive. The problem is that such a danger is not really covered by the clause, which goes far wider. If it is designed to address concern about the GLA preventing national Government from making a strategic investment for the country, the Government could return with a far more tightly drafted clause. As I said, the clause gives the Secretary of State active and intrusive powers.
<P>
Amendment No. 788 would amend clause 141, but has been grouped with an amendment to clause 140. Clause 141 provides that the Secretary of State must give his or her consent to the sale of stocks and shares of subsidiaries. Again, that appears to be incredibly intrusive and to move away from the principle of devolved government. In a briefing that I am sure other members of the Committee have received, London First has expressed concern that that power goes far too far. It could prevent the conclusion of joint ventures and reduce the flexibility of the operations of subsidiaries of Transport for London. The power is far too restrictive.
<P>
The Government should consider the amendments in the spirit in which they have been tabled--as an attempt to give the mayor and assembly a little more control over the future of Transport for London.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> What a pleasure it is to be sitting under your chairmanship again, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
In his opening comments, the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton was open about the fact that the amendments return to a recurring theme of the Liberal Democrats in this Committee: they want more power to be given to the mayor and assembly. The amendments are intended to give that a little extra push. The hon. Gentleman appears to be completely unaware that the amendments would overturn the sensible safeguards that the clause places on the sale of key strategic assets such as the underground lines and stations and the docklands light railway. I presume that he is unaware that the amendments would be the first step towards privatisation.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton also appeared to be somewhat schizophrenic in advancing as an argument in support of the amendments the notion that leaving the powers with the Secretary of State would give the Secretary of State far too much work to do. The hon. Gentleman appeared concerned about the number of Red Boxes that the Secretary of State would have to take home, although he spent considerable time earlier this morning arguing for the listing of assets, which would be a back breaking, onerous duty on the Secretary of State.
<P>
We made it clear in our manifesto that we did not consider privatisation the way forward for the underground. As I said, the tube and the docklands light railway are vital strategic assets. That is why it will be for the Secretary of State to give consent should any mayor propose to sell off such vital assets. Even then, the permission of Parliament would be required before any such agreement could be reached.
<P>
We do not wish, however, to place excessive restrictions on the commercial freedom of Transport for London. I shall give an example. In the three years up to 1997-98, London Regional Transport disposed of a number of pieces of property with a combined value of more than &#163;75 million. The sales included residential property in Staines, offices in Manor House, a sports ground at Osterley and even a mosque on Cavell Street. We shall therefore table amendments designed to give Transport for London some operational flexibility in dealing with its property holdings while allowing it to retain in its strategy the principle that lines, stations and land needed to run the underground system will not be sold.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to amendment No. 814, which would replace the need for the Secretary of State's consent to enable a Transport for London subsidiary to raise money by the issue of stocks and shares outside the Transport for London family with 
<P>
the need for the consent of the mayor and assembly. That is another recurrence of the Liberal Democrats' favourite theme, so I trust that the hon. Gentleman will be delighted with what I am about to say. We intend to table an amendment to make clause 141(c) subject to the consent of the mayor rather than to that of the Secretary of State. There is no need, however, for the assembly to become involved. We have rehearsed all the arguments about the relevant balance of powers within the GLA and the role of the assembly.
<P>
I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment in the light of my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister's response was very welcome. Her suggestion that the Government would table amendments to give to Transport for London and the mayor greater commercial freedom was very welcome news. We look forward to seeing those amendments.
<P>
I should like to press the Minister on the Government's intentions. How far will their amendments go in giving greater commercial freedom to Transport for London? Will they enable it to become involved in other commercial activities such as property development? Will they enable it to form joint ventures? What borrowing limits will they place on it? Maybe the amendments will not go quite that far; the Committee has debated borrowing powers, and the Government did not seem to give way. What sort of aspects are the amendments likely to cover? I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that the Government intend to amend clause 141 and give the power that it contains to the mayor. She rightly referred to our preference that the assembly be included but I am delighted that the mayor will be given a little bit more say about the way in which stocks and shares can or cannot be issued by Transport for London subsidiaries.
<P>
The Minister suggested that we were being rather schizophrenic in our concerns about Ministers having to do too much with their Red Boxes.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Minister corrects me from a sedentary position, for which I am grateful. She said that our concern about the Secretary of State was inconsistent with our previous arguments about the lists. I assure the Committee that our previous amendment did not seek to ensure that the Secretary of State compiled the lists. We had assumed that civil servants would do it and produce one item in his or her red box. The clause will give the Secretary of State onerous duties. He or she may have to give consent to an awful lot of disposals.
<P>
Our amendments try to pave the way not for privatisation but for greater commercial freedom. It would be possible to exclude the option of privatisation in the Bill with different provisions from those contained in the clause.
<P>
I do not intend to press the amendment, because of the Minister's positive remarks. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"where the proceeds of such disposal or grant are not expended or to be expended within twelve months of the disposal or grant as capital sums to improve the provision of public passenger transport services in Greater London.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 788, in page 73, line 29, after "1992.", insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(3) Any money raised under subsection (1) above shall be retained by the Authority.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is a probing amendment to inquire what the Government believe should happen to the proceeds of sale of any land subject to the provisions of clause 140. In our judgment, it should be redirected into transport matters inside greater London. I should be grateful for the Minister's confirmation of that.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): I support the amendment. It is rather more than a probing amendment, inasmuch as it is of great interest to Londoners that there should not be an asset sale on the part of London Regional Transport of essentially transport-oriented facilities, particularly if the proceeds were, as proposed in amendment No. 788 tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, to go to the authority. They should go to London Regional Transport for the amelioration of transport in London. The idea that the assets of London Regional Transport could be used as a milch-cow by the authority is a thoroughly bad one, and I wholeheartedly support amendment No. 520.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I wish to speak to amendment No. 788. Unlike the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), we believe that the authority should receive the proceeds of any sales and then decide, for the benefit of Londoners, how those proceeds should be spent. The reason for tabling the amendment is not to ensure that the authority receives the proceeds rather than Transport for London, but to ensure that the proceeds are not expropriated by the Treasury, which is more likely. We saw that happen under the previous Conservative Government: when various assets were sold, the proceeds were not ploughed back into the sector from which they were drawn. The classic example is council house receipts, which were rarely used for improving the housing stock in the public sector, but were used by the Treasury to pay for the Government's poor economic policies.
<P>
Our amendment is important in that it would provide an incentive for Transport for London to use capital efficiently and to dispose of assets that are no longer used. If there were a danger or suspicion that the Treasury would take the proceeds of such sales, it is unlikely that Transport for London would make the sales in the first place. It is important to ensure that any proceeds will not be spent outside London. We fear that the dead hand of the Treasury would prevent the flowering of mayoral initiatives and the flourishing of potential schemes.
<P>
We oppose the Conservative amendment. The hon. Member for Croydon, South described it as a probing amendment, which is probably just as well. The idea that one can time the expenditure and sales in the way that the amendment proposes is obviously nonsense. I think that a finance director of a private company would suggest that the amendment was financially illiterate. However, we hope that the Government will look favourably on our amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The amendments are concerned with the disposal of operational land. Again, they are a somewhat obvious attempt to get around the very sensible safeguards that we have put in clause 140 to ensure that privatisation of the underground by the back door cannot take place.
<P>
Amendment No. 520, tabled by the hon. Member For Croydon, South, means that if the mayor disposed of land, it would be an imperative that the proceeds would have to be spent on improvements to public transport in London. If the mayor did not do so, the sale or the lease would be void and the purchase price would have to be returned, plus costs.
<P>
The amendment is clearly unworkable. It would place the purchasers of land from Transport for London in an impossible position. Having completed the acquisition, the purchaser would have to wait for up to a year to see whether the sale had become valid or would retrospectively become null and void for reasons entirely outside the purchaser's control.
<P>
The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke to amendment No. 788, claiming that it was very important. Its importance is that it underlines the Liberal Democrats' total lack of knowledge on this issue. We heard much about the Treasury taking money away and about Local authorities being unable to keep capital receipts, but the Government recently removed the requirement for local authorities to set aside part of their non-housing capital receipts for debt redemption. Any of the bodies that sells property will be entitled to make full use of the receipts for new capital expenditure. The GLA and its functional bodies will be subject to the same basic capital finance rules that apply to all local authorities; neither those rules nor the Bill allow the Government to take receipts from the GLA or its functional bodies.
<P>
 11.15am
<P>
I should point out that clause 103 contains a reserve power for the Secretary of State to make regulations allowing the mayor to redistribute capital receipts between the bodies. However, as has been said before in Committee, there are no immediate plans to introduce such regulations. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Kingston and Surbiton will not press the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr.Ottaway:</B> I should like to press the Minister a little. Was she saying in her closing remarks that regulations will be forthcoming regarding the proceeds of the sale of properties--[Interruption.] She says that this is not the case. Perhaps she will respond to the central point of my brief introduction--what will happen to the proceeds of sale? How does she envisage that money being used?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> My closing remarks related to clause 103, on which, the hon. Gentleman may recall, we had lengthy debates. It contains a power whereby the mayor will be able to redistribute capital receipts between the functional bodies. That is a reserve power, however, with which the Secretary of State could make regulations enabling the mayor to redistribute capital receipts. There are no immediate plans to introduce such regulations.
<P>
We are considering a mayor whose functional bodies will produce an integrated strategy for London--one of the obvious companion pieces to that is, for example, a properly integrated public transport system, which will be one of the ways of achieving the environmental improvements that are also among the mayor's functions. There could well be a time when one of the functional bodies will not necessarily need its capital receipts in a given financial year, but those receipts could make a marked difference to the programme of another functional body.
<P>
I understand that the basis of the concern of the hon. Member for Croydon, South was that moneys raised from the sale of properties of the type that we discussed should remain within the mayoral Transport for London budget. There will be no money siphoned off by the Treasury. I trust that I have set the hon. Gentlemen's mind at rest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister has not quite set my mind at rest, but I am grateful to her for referring me to clause103. Can she confirm that the money could not be used by, say, the new development agency, which is one of the funcitional bodies?
<P>
<B>MsJackson:</B> As I have just pointed out to the hon. Gentlemen, the powers about which we are talking would be contained in regulations, and we have no plans to introduce such regulations at the moment. However, we believe that it is right and proper to make provision for such a power. The mayor is the power for the functional bodies. They will create, both independently and in co-operation, the kind of improvements that everyone in London wants to see--in transport, the environment, the economy, sustainable development and the overall quality of life. In any one financial year, if the capital receipts of one of those functional bodies is not required by the mayor as part of the strategy for that year, these are powers to make regulations so that the money could be used by another of the mayoral functional bodies to ensure that the overall strategy--improving life for London and Londoners--goes ahead and money does not sit idle when it could produce benefits for Londoners.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. It was different from her earlier reply, which was that the money would be used just for transport.
<P>
<B>MsJackson:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I think that the Minister will find that the record shows that she said, at the end of her penultimate reply, that it would be applied to transport. The money should be applied to transport, so we are not minded to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I had understood that the Minister had allowed for flexibility in the use of the proceeds, and had not determined that they be used for Transport for London. We will all see the record in due course.
<P>
I welcome the Minister's reply and her new-found keenness for flexibility in the financial affairs of the authority. I also welcome her statement that the Treasury will not be allowed to take control of the proceeds. My only concern is that that assurance is not in the Bill. Call me suspicious about the workings of the Treasury, but I can easily imagine it, when paying the annual GLA transport grant which we discussed under clause 86, taking account of the fact that the mayor had made a disposal, and saying that the mayor could use the proceeds instead of receiving the grant.
<P>
My suspicion of the Treasury remains, but I shall take the Minister's assurances at face value, in the hope that she and her colleagues will consider whether they need to be written into the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I express my appreciation of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South for standing firm on the amendment. Transport in London--the tube above all, but also the buses and so on--is in such a deplorable state that Transport for London should utilise the proceeds of the sale of any of its assets specifically for the amelioration of transport within an expeditious time scale. The 12-month limit proposed by my hon. Friend is reasonable and right.
<P>
The argument advanced by Liberal Democrat members of the Committee that it is all right for the authority to exercise its discretion within its jurisdiction to set priorities other than transport would be reasonable, were transport not in such a lamentable state. The Exchequer grants that will be forthcoming for the authority will almost certainly never be enough. It would be inimical to the interests of London if a high precept were to be set by the authority. The more that TfL is encouraged to utilise its own resources by sensible asset sales for the betterment of transport for Londoners, the better for Londoners as a whole. I wholeheartedly support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In response to the concerns of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I shall repeat myself yet again. None of the rules, nor the Bill, allow the Government to take receipts away from the GLA or its functional bodies.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, as I said, the capital receipts will go to the mayor. I have little doubt that in the first instance the exercise of those receipts for TfL will be the priority for the mayor. However, the Bill will set up an authority that will be in place for a considerable period. Further down the line, if one of the mayor's functional bodies has an excessive capital receipt that it does not need to use in a particular financial year, there are reserve powers for the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to empower the mayor to move those capital receipts to facilitate a programme of one of the other functional bodies.
<P>
In response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, the amendment would mean that any idea of a strategic approach to improving transport for London would go out of the window. I have already identified the total imbalance for the purchaser. The amendment would also place an obligation on the mayor to spend the money in a ridiculous fashion. Any long-term investment or long-term plans for improving transport in London would, therefore, go out of the window. I repeat: I trust that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B> Mr. Ottaway:</B> I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify which stocks and shares it is envisaged will be issued under clause 141(c). Are the Government making a privatisation proposal by the back door?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> No, this is not privatisation by the back door. Under clause 141, the mayor and Transport for London will be placed under a duty to ensure that TfL subsidiary companies do nothing that TfL itself has no legal power to do. It would be impractical to place statutory restrictions directly on subsidiaries through legislation. The way in which we propose to handle the matter is set out in the Bill.
<P>
The activities of any company are usually set out in the legal documents that set it up--the memorandum and articles. Clause 141 states that such articles may not override the powers in the Bill. That is a simple and straightforward procedure.
<P>
Under the clause, the mayor and TfL must ensure that a subsidiary of TfL does not do anything for which it requires, but has not received, the Secretary of State's consent; do anything that the mayor has directed it not to do; or raise money by issuing shares or stock to anyone other than TfL or a subsidiary of TfL without the Secretary of State's consent.
<P>
The clause is, in fact, similar to section 33 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984, which places a similar duty on LRT and which was devised by the Government whom the hon. Gentleman supported. I hope, therefore, that he will not feel in the least concerned about the clause.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The clause is important because it signals the end of an era. It is short, but it is appropriate to reflect for a moment on the history of LRT. LRT is unusual because it was one of the Tory party's only nationalisations. The nonsense of the Tories' policy on government was shown by the fact that they set about abolishing the GLC and replacing the transport system with a nationalised industry. I am sure that they went on to regret the abolition of Londonwide government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> They may have wanted to reconstitute it in a different way--
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman has taken a different view. He was not as interested in such matters when he represented Mid-Worcestershire. Now that he has arrived in London, he is clearly arguing a Kent and borough view that is not the view of his party. The Tory party view, as changed by the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir N. Fowler) and by the Leader of the Opposition, is that there should now be some form of Londonwide government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> To avoid doubt, I should tell the hon. Gentleman that my view when I represented Mid-Worcestershire and my view now that I represent Bromley and Chislehurst is that I am suspicious of excessive government and against it in any form. Whether or not my party seems converted to the cause of more government, I am not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am aware that the right hon. Gentleman takes a dissident view in his party--
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> He is a good Member--one of the best.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The right hon. Gentleman clearly needs a lot of support from his colleagues.
<P>
The Tory party has clearly reflected on the folly of its policy during the 1980s, which left it with, among other things, a nationalised LRT. Our one regret about the way in which the Government are proceeding is that they have never clearly thought through their policy of regional government in England, having planned to come to power with it. Having decided to set up the new GLA, they then changed their mind about what form it would take, as we have said before--it went from regional to citywide to local government. They have still not finally decided the context, and they have no clear view about regional government structure for south-east England.
<P>
One of the Government's difficulties is that the abolition of LRT means thinking through a service that does not stop at the boundaries of Greater London but reaches beyond it, as the Minister for Transport in London reasonably accepted the other day.
<P>
It is logical and right that regional transport services go back to regional Government. My hon. Friends and I look forward to the day when regional government arrives. That day will come, and I am also sure that the day will come when England will have regional government that will run regional transport. [Interruption.] Both other parties are slow on the uptake when it comes to accepting constitutional change. The Tories resisted devolution for Scotland, which they now accept. The Labour party also resisted that in the 1970s and 1980s, but when it saw where the tide was going it jumped on the bandwagon, and now supports it.
<P>
Some of us have always believed that regional government in England is important and that regional government should run regional transport. Six other areas in England have passenger transport authorities--the metropolitan areas. The Bill at last ensures that regional transport will come home to London.
<P>
I know that it is unfashionable to do so, but I should like to pay tribute to LRT, which has in many ways done a very good job. If it has failed, it is because of a lack of resources and because it has not been helped by other bits of London government. The reason that buses are often late is not anything to do with the buses; it is to do with the congestion on the roads along which the buses pass and the fact that there has been such slowness in developing a bus priority network. The Government are committed to doing something about that, and we support that commitment.
<P>
The reason that there has been such a problem with the underground is not the fault of London Underground; it is in many ways the fault of lack of investment in the rolling stock, the signalling and the infrastructure. Given the constraints under which the management has worked, I think that it has, by and large, done a very good job. The staff of London Regional Transport, who get no real praise from politicians and the public, have generally served us extremely well and courteously.
<P>
There are one or two other things that have been done extremely well by LRT, such as running the Victoria coach station. Many people who cannot afford to travel by train use coaches.

<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Hitch-hiking?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> There is little hitch-hiking these days, because coach services are cheap and efficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Thanks to privatisation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In many ways, competition has benefited the industry. There has been competition within managed areas for London buses by virtue of having a tendering process. Thank God the Tories did not take up the alternative, and do for London what they did for the rest of the country. There are popular and well-supported routes that have six buses when only two are needed while other areas do not have a bus service.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I should like the hon. Gentleman to know what is the provincial experience of the buses. When I first became a Member of Parliament in 1983-- [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was about to call the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey into order when he started ranging wide of the issue before us. We should confine our attentions in this Committee to London Regional Transport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The last jewel in the crown of LRT is the London transport museum. It is a valued asset to Londoners, particularly youngsters, and I hope that its work will be continued and developed under new management.
<P>
Under LRT, transport has become more environmentally acceptable. It has introduced more environmentally friendly buses and better tube trains. It has tried to make the line that it was told it had to build--the Jubilee line extension--one of the best in the world, and I believe that it will be. I trust that that will be apparent in good time by the end of the year.
<P>
This is the only debate that we are really going to have on the end of 16 years of LRT. I hope that it is not simply written off as an organisation which has always had difficulties. Given the job that LRT has had to do, it has--in difficult circumstances and often not assisted by having a regional government structure--done extremely well. If it had had regional government for the past 16 years, it would have done considerably better.
<P>
<B>Mr. McNulty:</B> That was sponsored by Mogadon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> Not by Viagra.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Croydon, South now has the floor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am sponsored neither by Mogadon nor Viagra. [Laughter.] I paused before rising to see whether the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) would contribute to the debate. I am sure that he is only too well aware that the removal of transport responsibility from the Greater London council in 1984 led to the establishment of London Regional Transport. I must say to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that it is absolute tosh to describe that as the Conservative Government's first nationalisation. London's transport was taken away from the GLC because it was making such a pig's ear of running it.
<P>
The far more important question that I would like to ask the Minister is when will LRT cease to exist? I presume, from the phraseology, that it will be on Royal Assent, although this shortest of all clauses does not make that clear. It that is to be the case, who will run LRT until the mayor is established? What will happen to overhanging matters such as the subsequent demands of the Jubilee line, which will run past the establishment of the mayor in July 2000?
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey began by saying that this, in a sense, represents a moment of history. He then proceeded to rewrite history in terms of the introduction of London Regional Transport. He claimed primacy for the Liberal Democrats, across a wide political spectrum, in advocating regional government. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister would be interested to hear that. The hon. Gentleman insists that our proposals for the GLA represent a form of regional government, although we have made it abundantly clear that we regard it as a citywide government.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman was right to say that clause 142 abolishes LRT which was established as the reconstituted London transport executive by section
1 of the London Regional Transport Act 1984. Hon. Members with long memories will recall that the principal purpose of the 1984 Act was to remove LRT from the political control of the Greater London Council and to transfer that control to the Secretary of State for Transport. The 1984 Act set up LRT as a public corporation, specified its powers--in particular, to provide public passenger transport by rail or bus--and defined its relationship with the Secretary of State. Although LRT will be abolished, its powers and duties will he transferred, by and large, to the GLA and Transport for London. As my hon. Friend the Minister for London said earlier in his parliamentary answer of 11February to our hon. Friend the Member for Eltham, the GLA and TfL will, subject to the enactment of the Bill, assume their responsibilities on 3July 2000.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South asked about what is to happen before July 2000. The Government will table amendments at a later stage to enable us to keep a slimmed down LRT in existence for as long as is necessary to see through the Government's public-private partnership policy. For a short transitional period, therefore, TfL and LRT will exist in parallel. The principles for the handling of those arrangements are very clear. We will transfer as much as possible to TfL from day one. LRT will retain only that which is strictly necessary for the smooth running of the underground and the delivery of the PPP. From the outset, the mayor will control London buses, the GLA road network, London river services, the docklands light railway and Croydon's tram link. The mayor will also have the power to introduce road-user charging and workplace parking levy schemes.
<P>
LRT and TfL will be under a duty of co-operation. Where necessary, we will supplement that with specific provisions: for example, on the safeguarding of the concessionary travel scheme, contracts such as revenue sharing agreements or a memorandum of understanding between the two bodies.
<P>
We are putting these arrangements in place so that it will be the Government who see through the public-private partnership process. This is a short-term measure which will achieve one particular aim. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I can detect at least five private conversations taking place in the Room. It is too distracting. I ask hon. Members to co-operate.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara.
<P>
I emphasise again that we are putting these arrangements in place to ensure that the Government will see through to its conclusion the public-private partnership process. As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has stressed repeatedly, we are not prepared to set a time limit on that exercise, in the public interest. I trust that I have answered the questions of the hon. Member for Croydon, South and that the Committee will support the clause.
<P>
<H5>11.45am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The long and rambling speech of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey led us to believe that this was a historic debate, although not in the sense of studying times past, the establishment of London Regional Transport in 1984 and what has been done in its name ever since.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South asked on what date Transport for London would take effect and LRT's undertakings would be terminated. The question provoked from the Government an admission of the greatest importance: namely, that LRT will continue because of the complete failure of the Government's policy with regard to the public-private partnership. That was central to their manifesto commitment, to their pledges to the electorate on the hustings in London and to their speeches throughout the country, particularly in the House of Commons since they took office. They said that putting to tender the infrastructure of London Underground would elicit moneys from the private sector, which would assume leases of up to 30 years for running infrastructure and services. Thus, funding would be available to modernise the network and make it more efficient.
<P>
Their pledges have been demonstrated to be worthless. Instead, two public bodies will run in parallel, which means a duplication rather than a simplification of bureaucracy. It is an admission of failure unparalleled in the history of this Administration with regard to London's government. The Minister should be ashamed of her admission. Instead of it being made on the Floor of the House in an open fashion, so that Members representing London constituencies and the House as a whole could question what the Government have done, it has been slipped out in response to the very perceptive intervention of my right hon. Friend for Croydon, South.
<P>
I hope that Londoners will take note and that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, who is the shadow Minister, will take advantage of this opportunity to exemplify, if not the mendaciousness certainly the duplicity of the Government in purporting to bring to Londoners a scheme that was going to provide funding amounting to not just tens but hundreds of millions of pounds to modernise the underground. The Government have not achieved that and they cannot provide a date for when Transport for London will take control of the underground system. Their policy is a demonstrable failure and the way in which they have announced it is a scandal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I have no objection to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey reflecting on the historical effectiveness of LRT, but it has now emerged that this is not the moment to have a historical reflection; that will be some time in the future.
<P>
The Minister seems to have admitted that clause 142 means exactly the opposite of what it says. It says that LRT "shall cease to exist", but it should read "shall not cease to exist until the Government terminates it". It is clear that the clause must be amended. The Minister said that she would table amendments, but all I can say in response is that very late in the day, a substantial number of new clauses have been tabled regarding the public-private partnership. I would not have thought it beyond the wit of the Minister to table an amendment to this clause that would enable us to debate what will happen rather than what will not happen. As far as I can tell, subsequent clauses deal with the transfer of property and with transitional provisions. She will have to table amendments to those clauses as well because the transitional provisions will be all over the place if London Regional Transport--LRT--is to continue to operate in parallel. Clause 142 is important because, when LRT ceases to exist, the provisions of clause 144 will start to operate.
<P>
Will the Minister confirm that a series of amendments have been triggered? Might it not be better for the Government to vote against clause stand part and to table a new clause that we can debate in the proper manner. We--and I expect the Liberal Democrats, too--would be happy if Ministers tabled a new clause today and we debated it on Thursday.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The hon. Member for Croydon, South is right to stress the importance of the debate that may be opening up. I note that he, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood and I, are the only survivors of the Committee stage of the London Regional Transport Act 1984.
<P>
The Minister could help us all by clarifying exactly where we are at because the clause is open to interpretation. Once the GLA and Transport for London are set up, if LRT is kept going simply for wind-up purposes as a residuary body such as those established after the GLC was abolished, that will be consistent with the clause. If LRT is not kept going just for wind-up purposes, it might be that the Government are keeping their options open. They might be allowing for the 
<P>
possibility that a public sector operation for some transport could remain. Specific clarification is required--will the body be kept going simply for residuary wind-up purposes or for something more than that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey opened his remarks with a reference to history. My own elegiac comment will be brief. Years ago, in the constituency of the Minister for Transport in London, the Hampstead war memorial was being put up. It was suggested that anodyne words about King and country should go on the wall behind it. My father, who also had some association with London transport, suggested that since Hampstead was so stiff with poets, there should be a poetic reference. That is why, on the wall behind the memorial by Whitestone pond, there are lines of Keats.
<P>
I did not know that the debate would take this form so I have not had time to check, but my recollection is that there is a line of Keats that runs:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To cease upon the midnight with no pain".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That does not seem to me to be an appropriate elegy for the clause. "Midnight" suggests a degree of precision that the Government cannot, so far, provide. "No pain" also seems a totally inaccurate description of what the Government are about.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I begin by saying to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that I found his contribution to be the most personally offensive that I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. I felt an equal sense of personal outrage over his most scandalous allegations about my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government's proposals for public-private partnership.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman alleged that the public-private partnership was an abject failure and that the Government have attempted to hide the fact that we will be tabling amendments at a later stage to ensure that LRT might be running while Transport for London is in place. I remind him that, on Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"once the final bidding process is under way, the Government need to see it through."--[Official Report, 14 December 1998; Vol. 322, c. 631.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If, as now seems likely, the process runs beyond the GLA elections in May 2000, we shall put in place suitable arrangements to involve the mayor during that transitional period. After that, London underground will become the full responsibility of the mayor.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The Deputy Prime Minister led many hon. Members, including myself, to believe that LRT might end between the election and the inception of the authority. It would not run on beyond the inauguration of the authority, which we now know will be on 3 July 2000. Everybody assumed, reasonably, that the assets would be transferred on the day that the authority got under way.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman was going to apologise. However, he is deliberately attempting to blur the issue again for empty party political reasons.
<P>
The Deputy Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport, my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction and I have consistently said, on Second Reading, in Committee and outside, that the Government intend to see the public-private partnership through from beginning to end. We shall not be driven by an artificial time limit; that was the terrible lesson that everyone learnt from the previous Administration's privatisation of our railways. It has always been made abundantly clear that the money would flow in via the PPP process.
<P>
The absurd statement by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood--that his hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South had in some way wormed out a policy that the Government had been attempting to hide--is scandalous. Even if no one had raised the issue, I would have provided details of the transitional arrangements for the public-private partnership. We shall table amendments later, which will facilitate a slimmed-down London Transport that will still be responsible for the day-to-day running of the London underground services. There will obviously need to be a division of contracts in several areas, but most services that at present come under London Regional Transport--for example, the buses and London River Services--will be part of Transport for London. The idea that the Government would, for purely bureaucratic reasons, allow the vital Issue of transport in London to drop down some black hole is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister makes a number of points, many of which have nothing to do with this chapter of the Bill. We have four clauses dealing with the establishment of Transport for London and the transitional provisions. The Minister seems to be saying that she has a speech prepared--I take her word for that--and that if we had not brought the matter up, she would have introduced amendments. If she is capable of drafting a speech to that effect, why on earth is she not capable of drafting the amendments? We have four clauses before us, which we know will be changed. What is the point of the Committee, if the four clauses that we are to scrutinise will later be changed? There is no point in our voting against clause stand part, but I should like to move that the Committee adjourn while the Government get their act together and introduce the clauses that we know will be debated later. Those four clauses make up a whole chapter of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Before responding to the most recent contribution from the hon. Member for Croydon, South , I must respond to the question raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey as to whether London Regional Transport would be a residuary body. That is not our proposal. Our slimmed-down version of London Underground Ltd., which will essentially be London Transport, will be responsible for the day-to-day running of what we know as the London underground, until we have seen through the processes of the public-private partnership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Is it the intention that London Regional Transport, which the Government say will continue "for a period", will have two functions--to run the London underground and to have residuary body functions that are left-overs from LRT? Is that the total combination? I ask in all innocence whether there are other things that the Government contemplate allowing to continue as LRT responsibilities after 3 July next year.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Essentially, no. There are complexities; for example, London buses will be part of Transport for London before London Transport is. There would clearly need to be a memorandum of understanding between TfL and London Transport. There would need to be a division of contracts on matters ranging from the obvious, such as information technology, to others, such as ensuring that travelcards will still be available and accessible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South made a point about introducing amendments, something that we have made it abundantly clear that it will be necessary to do. The abolition of London Regional Transport will be effected by clause 142. I take the strongest possible exception to the slurs that have been directed at the Government by the hon. Members for Croydon, South and for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Minister accused me of casting slurs on the Government by questioning the validity of the clauses. Will she withdraw that remark? I have made no such allegations.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I am not so sure that that is a point of order.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman was most certainly suggesting that the Government, in an attempt to avoid proper debate and scrutiny, were hiding from the Committee a secret agenda about the split between London Regional Transport and the creation of TfL. On that level, I have no intention whatever of apologising for what I said to him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am glad that the Minister does not intend to apologise--neither do I. Why did she not contact Jimmy Knapp and his union to ask them to call off the 48-hour strike that caused such misery in the lives of Londoners last week? The union could have been reassured that the tube would remain part of London Transport and in the public sector for an indefinite period. I think that the Minister is being not only disingenuous, but extremely unstatesmanlike in not acknowledging that the part of the Bill that we are debating is now entirely defective--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman to be making an intervention, which is becoming rather long. He will have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Will the Minister go back and re-examine--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to make further contributions to the debate.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I found those remarks by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about London Transport remaining in the public sector bizarre. There has been no part of Government policy that has been anything other than categorical about our refusal to privatise the underground. The PPP is not a privatisation.
<P>
I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman is suddenly concerned about workers' rights. Yet again, I highlight the fact that my hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has written to every employee of London Transport, assuring them about their terms and conditions, pensions, and transport and travel concessions.
<P>
I am not surprised that the hon. Gentleman was not prepared to apologise for his scandalous remarks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am happy that I am not in dispute with the Minister.
<P>
Do the Government have an end date for the continuation of London Regional Transport? I understand that on 3 July 2000 the new GLA will categorically take over certain responsibilities. Will the Minister reassure me by confirming to the Committee that London buses and the other functions unrelated to the tube will be run by TfL from 3 July? We will come back to the subject of the tube later.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am happy to reassure the hon. Gentleman yet again that London buses will be part of TfL. As has been said, TfL should be up and running and under the control of the mayor in July 2000.
<P>
The end date is inextricably linked with our approach to the public-private partnership. As I have said, in the best interests of best value for the public, we will not be driven by an artificial end date. There are too many bad lessons from the record of the previous Administration, not only as far as rail privatisation is concerned, but in the competitive handing over of the channel tunnel rail link, to lead us to believe that that is not the way to proceed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> To the credit of everybody concerned, the Committee proceedings as a whole have been broadly good-natured until now. We are having a bad-tempered quart d'heure. I intervened earlier with what I freely acknowledge was a grace note about the elegiac element of clause 142. As the debate has progressed, my remarks have taken on slightly more substance than might originally have been thought.
<P>
I support the request of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South for the Committee to adjourn. That would enable us to sort out what the Government are proposing to do.
<P>
Beyond peradventure, I am not accusing either the Minister or the Government of bad faith. I want to place that on record before I say anything else so that we do not spend more time having that point rebutted. However, it is clear from the way that the debate has progressed that the four clauses will be significantly altered at some stage.
<P>
The Minister said that she had a brief with her that would have enabled her to respond to the debate. However, I say in a diffident voice that it might have been a good thing for the handling of the Committee if 687 688 
<P>
she had spoken first on the clause stand part debate and set out what the Government's intentions were and how they would be carried out.
<P>
I understand--and I repeat for the nth time that I am not accusing anyone of bad faith--what the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading. However, Second Reading was more than two months ago, and we would not be having this bad-tempered moment if the Government had been slightly more forthcoming at the beginning of the debate about their intentions.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I thought that the right hon. Gentleman's note was not only of grace, but graceful, mine is not bad-temper, but justifiable anger.
<P>
I am interested in the right hon. Gentleman's idea that I should have opened the clause stand part debate with a statement. I am prepared to accept that that could have been ignorance on my part. It has always been my understanding that the bulk of Committee time can justifiably be argued to be for Opposition parties. The Government have never attempted--and we have publicly stated that we never will attempt--to avoid the closest possible scrutiny of what we regard to be the split between LT and TfL.
<P>
I am not able to say at this stage when the Government amendments will be tabled. I accept the points that have been made about the possibility of an adjournment although it would seem to be a gratuitous waste of the Committee's time. A great deal of examination is still required of the Bill, but I acknowledge the intention behind the remarks of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). In all honesty, that is not a reaction that I could say I have to the remarks of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster alluded to an important procedural point. Chapter VI of the Bill deals with public-private partnership. I do not know what is in the mind of the Government Whip, but it would not be logical, or in the interests of the Committee or of proper debate, to debate that chapter without the Government having laid before the Committee the amendments that relate to the timetable. The two issues go together.
<P>
A future chapter of the Bill is about buses which is, from what the Minister said, unrelated, and another is about rail franchising, which is also unrelated.
<P>
We are sympathetic to the request of the hon. Member for Croydon, South--not necessarily that we break now and do not move on to the next two debates, but certainly that we do not try to debate a whole set of Government new clauses and amendments when the Minister has openly admitted that more are coming down the track. If we do not have those other amendments before us, our debate will be nonsense.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The issues are extremely important. Clause 142 as drafted is wholly nugatory. Would it not be sensible for the Government--I believe that you, Mr. O'Hara, could accede to this request if it were made from both sides of the Committee--to accept a written amendment to the effect that London Regional Transport shall not cease to exist until such time as the Government shall decide otherwise? The Minister has admitted that London Transport will continue in respect of the underground sine die--we are not allowed to use such Latin tags, but it will continue ad infinitum--[Laughter.] I have doubly made my point. It will continue until the Government decide otherwise.
<P>
I do not know what the Government intend. I do not comprehend how we can discuss the Bill when a wholly nugatory clause is fundamental to its text. If the Government will not accept a written amendment to clause 142, they ought to accept an adjournment of the Committee so that they can return with the necessary amendments. If the Government still have no idea when London Regional Transport will cease to run the underground, that may not be possible. Nevertheless, the Government need time for reflection and I for one would be prepared to allow them that time.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I am most grateful for the offer of support from the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, although it is somewhat empty.
<P>
Chapter III will still apply. The only difference will be that abolition will proceed in steps. The abolition of LRT will still take place; there will still be transfers of property to TfL in a staged manner. Chapter III is valid; the clauses are needed. we are approaching many clauses that deal with the specific issues that have been touched on-- the transfer of London buses, and so on. As we have said, abolition will be effected by an order under clause 142. As there are no amendments to be scrutinised about what we regard as a slimmed--down LRT, the Committee would be better engaged in scrutinising the amendments that await our attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Randall </B>(Uxbridge): I find it deeply disturbing that the Government think that we can simply rubber stamp the clauses. I understand that they have a huge majority, and that Government members of the Committee will do as they are told by the Whip. However, I spent time in eastern Europe before the Wall came down, and the idea of voting for something when we know nothing about its time scale is deeply disturbing. [Interruption.] I say to Labour Members who are tut-tutting that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster said, despite our differences, this has up to now been a good-natured Committee, on which I have taken some pleasure in serving. However, I point out to Labour Members who find it such a huge laugh at present that the tables will be turned. When there is a Conservative Government, I will not support my Government taking such undemocratic powers. I urge the Minister to consider an adjournment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I have a suggestion for the Government. We would all sign up to an amendment--which we or the Government can table that said: "London Regional Transport may cease to exist one day." Then we would all be happy.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No. It is quite wrong of the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) to accuse the Government of being undemocratic. When the GLC was abolished, a London regional board ran for many years afterwards. It
 689 690 <P>
is also quite wrong of him to suggest that some kind of rubber stamping is going on. He is confusing the Government's stated policy on the completion of the public-private partnership with the creation of Transport for London. We have made it abundantly clear that we will table amendments that define the slimmed-down London Transport in precise terms. There is no rubber stamp in this Government's remit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Randall:</B> I want to ask the hon. Lady a question that I have often wanted to ask during my brief time in Parliament when I have heard the Government make such arguments. Do two wrongs make a right?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> That would presuppose that the Government's actions in this case constituted a wrong or that an attempt had been made to cloud the Government's intentions. As I said, there is no intention to mislead or to cloud issues. I refer to the remarks that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made on the Floor of the House and to the response that I and my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction continue to give with regard to the Government's approach to the public-private partnership. I said categorically that amendments will be tabled to create a slimmed-down LT. The Committee will face many amendments that relate to the creation of Transport for London, and I repeat that its time would be much better spent on those.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Give us a chance.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> The hon. Gentleman says, "Give us a chance," and we are perfectly prepared to do so. We are only too willing and eager to move on. It is Opposition Members who are most concerned to delay our deliberations.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It will not be possible to discuss amendments to the clause after this debate because the clause will become part of the Bill. I maintain my request for an adjournment because we will be unable to debate chapter III logically otherwise. If you are not minded to grant an adjournment, Mr.O'Hara, Conservative Members will make no contribution to debates on clauses143, 144 and 145. We would rather go straight to clause146. It would make a mockery of the Committee's time to do otherwise.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have given thought to the hon. Gentlemen's proposal for the Committee to adjourn, and my position is as follows. My duty is, first, to ensure the orderly and expeditious disposal of the Committee's business. The quality of that business is not my concern, but that of the members of the Committee.
<P>
Requests for the adjournment of business are extremely rare, although there are occasions on which they may be granted. If a member of the Committee--God forbid--had a heart attack and dropped dead, a material fact would be before me. It is likely that, as a mark of respect, I would accept or even propose that the Committee adjourned.
<P>
In the present case, however, I have before me merely an opinion of the Opposition, to which they are entirely entitled. The hon. Gentlemen's closing remarks seemed the most appropriate. If Conservative Members have reservations about the worthiness of proceeding with debate, and given that I am not prepared to accept a motion for the adjournment of the Committee, the best way for them to show their lack of respect for the quality of business would be to refuse to participate seriously in debate on that business. I will not, therefore, accept a motion for the adjournment of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I do not, of course, want to challenge your comments in any way, but will you consider the fact that part of the Chairman's role is to judge amendments' relevance and to select them in the context of the overall shape of the Bill and of the business before the Committee? Do you accept, Mr. O'Hara, that you are entitled to take a view, as the Committee proceeds, on the relevance and orderliness of what is before it? The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South should be considered in that context. If you judge that the amendment paper has become irrelevant or that the Committee is in danger of dealing with matters that are no longer in order, you may take a view about it. Could not my hon. Friend's suggestion be considered in that light?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I accept the point of order, and I had borne those points in mind. Having taken all considerations into account, however, my considered view is that my first duty is to expedite the business of the Committee. There is a means available to the Opposition if they take a certain view.

<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Croydon, South did not move his amendment, because its drafting is helpful. It would have meant discussing the wording in the first line of the clause, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There shall be transferred to and vest in Transport for London"--
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. What are we debating? I did not move amendment No. 526.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> We are debating clause stand part.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Minister spoke about my amendment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Minister referred to the amendment, but he referred also to the wording of the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that it might help the Committee if I clarified the wording of the first line of the clause, which we now propose should stand part of the Bill. That is the relevance of my remarks. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, proposed to add two letters to one of the words in that line, and I believe that it was intended to help the Committee. The line begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"There shall be transferred to and vest in Transport for London by virtue of".</font></ul>
<P>
I think that the hon. Gentleman believed that the line contained a grammatical mistake and that it should have read "vested in".
<P>
I should explain to the Committee that the technical legal language in which the Bill is drafted means that the line is correct as drafted. If the provision had been expressed as "There shall be transferred to and there shall vest in Transport for London", all hon. Members would have been clear about why the wording is correct. I make the point merely to ensure that any doubt is allayed.
<P>
Sadly, we do not always achieve the quality of the English language achieved by Keats in the passage referred to by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I am afraid that the language in such provisions is often opaque. It is right that the Committee is aware that the clause is correct and accurate.
<P>
The passage from Keats quoted by the right hon. Gentleman is a very elegant piece of language. I hope that it was not a forecast of our proceedings, because
<P><ul><font size=-1>

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I have a brief question, whose provenance the Minister will recognise. Transport for London will decide what constitutes the bus network for London and will be responsible for services. Services that partly operate in London but are not part of the network will be subject to the awarding of a licence by TfL. Will the Minister acknowledge that clarification is needed about whether buses operating rail replacement services, for the docklands light railway, Croydon tramlink or other lines, will be exempt from the definition of bus services in the clause?
<P>
<B>Ms. Glenda Jackson:</B> The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the contingency services that would operate because of the cessation of service on the docklands light railway, the East London line or other such routes. Such services would mainly be part and parcel of the furnishing of services after the split occurs. The buses will transfer to Transport for London, and there will need to be agreements within the memorandum of understanding to have a supply. They will not be bus services in the current meaning of the term, as that has to do with distance and stops. I trust that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's question.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 531, in page 75, line 34, after "safe," insert "profitable,".

<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, and let me say good morning to colleagues on the other side of the Room.

I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 791. Last year, the Government office for London published proposals to bring services operating under the London local service licences within the responsibility of the GLA. The paper went on to discuss the process that the mayor would have to go through in drawing up criteria against which to judge applications for different types of service. In that document, the Government office for London acknowledged that environmental factors would be likely to be a very important consideration for the mayor.
<P>
The amendment therefore seeks to insert into clause 148(1) a requirement that environmental sustainability is one of the matters that the mayor is seeking to promote through Transport for London. We have already had discussions in Committee about issues concerning environmental sustainability, and we believe that they are particularly relevant in respect of this issue. As my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said in a previous debate, there had been moves by London Regional Transport and London Buses substantially to improve the environmental performance of London Buses, but we want such a provision to be included in the Bill to ensure that those seeking to provide services in London will be judged against this important criterion.
<P>
Although there have been improvements, far too many buses are still not running as cleanly as they could be. We think it important that a large public service operator of this sort should give a major push to the promotion and development of low and nil-emission engine technology. It is now becoming available and we think that Transport for London should develop it further.
<P>
My only other comment is in respect of the interesting Conservative amendment which is grouped with ours, and which deals with profitability. My colleagues and I will not be supporting that amendment, because we believe that it would jeopardise socially necessary bus 693 694 services. There are undoubtedly a number of routes in Greater London that will never operate at a profit. If the Government accepted the amendment--although I am confident that they will not--there would be the bizarre situation of Transport for London having to retrench and reduce the number of services that it provided on the grounds that they were not all profitable. I for one would regret that, not least because one of the issues that I and several of my colleagues in outer south-west London have been campaigning on for some time is the 726 bus route, which is one of the few orbital services in outer London. It is undoubtedly unprofitable but, equally undoubtedly, it is very important. It provides orbital links to Heathrow airport which would be lost if the amendment were accepted. Despite being an unprofitable service, it makes an important contribution to the London Transport network.
<P>

</P>
<P>
It is also worth bearing in mind that LT buses are forecasting a &#163;20 million operating loss in the current financial year, although that should be set against the fact that passenger receipts per journey have been rising steadily over the past 10 years. It concerns me and my colleagues that the Conservatives have tabled this amendment, which would add to the clause the word "profitable", thus putting at risk socially important bus services.
<P>
I hope that the Government will indicate whether they are widely to include in the Bill references to environmental sustainability, but that they will reject the profitability amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> We tabled amendment No. 531 to probe whether the GLA will be able to subsidise the bus network. We believe that a profitable bus network is in the interests of Transport for London, as it would protect it from having to bail out lame ducks, I take the point of the Liberal Democrats, however--it would be regrettable if a necessary albeit unprofitable bus service was unable to run. Will the Minister clarify exactly what will happen regarding subsidy for unprofitable buses on the network?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Perhaps I should say at the outset that we Cannot accept either of the amendments.
<P>
Amendment No. 791 would add a requirement for environmentally sustainable bus services. The Government are second to none in supporting the drive to reduce the environmental impact of all road vehicles, and much has already been achieved with bus services. However, the wording of the amendment is potentially contentious and open to misintepretation. Buses are already the best environmental option in terms of emissions per passenger mile. The Government are encouraging the use of cleaner fuels and looking for opportunities in London, as elsewhere in the country, to run buses on alternative fuels, including liquid gas and electricity.
<P>
There are technical and commercial considerations. It would be absolutely impossible, for example, for a fleet to switch overnight. However, three quarters of London's bus fleet already runs on ultra-low sulphur diesel and about 1,000 buses have engines that are fully specified to meet the stringent Euro 2 standards. All new buses have Euro 2 engines, and almost 1,000 other buses are Euro 2 compliant by virtue of being fitted with catalytic converters or continuous regenerating particulate traps. Thus, the proportion of London's buses already meeting EU standards is approximately a third, and it is increasing signifantly as new vehicles are brought in.
<P>
I note that it would be within the mayor's powers to promote a strategy to speed up that process. It may also be possible for him or her to include environmental criteria when granting London service permits, but we do not want to specify in the Bill those kinds of requirements for the mayor. They are decisions for the mayor, and the mayor should make them. In the light of that, I trust that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment No. 531, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South, was criticised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I agree with those criticisms. The amendment would preclude the possibility of the mayor devising any socially necessary services within his or her transport strategy. In terms of the mayor's duty, the overriding requirements are that services must be safe, integrated, efficient and economic and that appropriate safeguards must be in place to ensure that the network is planned wisely. Those requirements, as stipulated in the Bill, are sufficient.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> If the Minister rejects the amendment, it logically follows that the mayor, or TfL, will be allowed to subsidise. Can the Minister confirm that, and explain where the funding is to come from?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I am not quite clear what the hon. Gentleman means by subsidy. TfL will be the executive arm of the mayor. The mayor will devise a transport strategy and will have control of the budgets in terms of deciding how they are spent. The mayor may regard a service that could be seen as unprofitable in harsh commercial terms as being profitable by virtue, for example, the social needs that it meets or its reduction of the number of polluting vehicles on our roads. That will be for the mayor to decide. We should not attempt to preclude the innovations that the mayor will undoubtedly be able to introduce--imaginative approaches towards ensuring that transport, care for the environment and economic sustainability work together.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> What constraints does the Minister believe will be placed on the mayor in the context of transport provision in terms of cross-subsidisation from one service or route to another, or the making of an overall loss in conventional accounting terms? What constraints, if any, will be on the mayor as to the extent of that loss, and how will the loss be made up?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I take the view that subsidies and delivering the mayor's strategies are not exclusively to do with accounting. Buses are already subsidised within the existing London bus network. That will be a possibility for Transport for London in the future: it will, no doubt, be part and parcel of the mayor's strategy. I was arguing for subsidy from the perspective of being able to balance what may be seen in harsh economic terms--that is, the accountancy terms to which the right 695 696 
<P>
hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst referred--as a route that is not profitable with the extremely profitable effects that may arise in terms of delivering a cleaner environment and reducing the amounts of noise and pollution on our streets.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I acknowledge that considerable strides have already been made in improving the environmental performance of London bus services and buses: the figure that was quoted revealed that a third of services already meet European Union standards. That is welcome.
<P>
The mayor will also have responsibility for delivering the air quality strategy to which we will come later in the Bill. The issue before us is, therefore, important in terms of sending signals to major fleet operators in London. It is also important for TfL to highlight through its own good practice its contribution to tackling the level of air pollution and emissions in Greater London. In that way, the mayor could be seen to be doing more on on enviromental matters.
<P>
I accept that the Government office for London consultation document about drawing up criteria alludes to the fact that environmental sustainability is one of the factors that the mayor could take into account. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 533, in page 76, line 6, leave out "provide or".
<P>
Clause 148(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Transport for London shall so far as reasonably practicable provide or secure the provision of the London bus network."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment would delete the word "provide". We have tabled it to find out whether the Government intend TfL to be able, in effect, to nationalise the bus service and to run its own services. That is the logical conclusion that one reaches on the basis of the word "provide". Going back to a state-run bus service would not be an advance.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, the amendment would prevent Transport for London from running bus services itself. However, LT currently holds such a power, and it is entirely right and proper that it should. [Interruption.] From the hon. Gentleman's expression and laughter, I realise that I have given him a piece of information of which he had no knowledge until this moment. It is, however, surely right that TfL should have the same power.
<P>
The number of operators that present their services is declining not only in London but throughout the country. TfL will negotiate contracts that are based on the mayor's criteria and on best value for the people of London. It would, therefore, not be right and proper for it to be placed in a position in which it could be blackmailed by one, two or three operators that refused to provide services other than at prices that they deemed fit.
<P>
I would hazard a guess that the power in the clause will need to be used infrequently, if ever. It is, however, right that TfL should have it. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Croydon, South to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's acknowledgement that the previous Government's policy was so excellent and so satisfactory that the present Government have had to continue with it. Under the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to ask a quick question for which the clause provides the best opportunity. As I understand this chapter of the Bill, it transfers to TfL the procedure that London Transport currently operates in the tendering process for bus services. However, I want the Minister to clarify one issue. Several London boroughs, my own included, have taken the opportunity over the past few years, via planning agreements and so on, to secure funds to enable them to underwrite the potential loss involved in operating mini or hoppa bus services--to extend the London bus network, if I may put in like that. Will the Minister clarify whether the clause would preclude such services from continuing to be developed? They have made a positive contribution to the bus networks of individual boroughs, and I am sure that the Government would want to encourage them. Can the Minister reassure me on that point?
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am pleased to be able to assure the hon. Gentleman that the clause does not preclude the continuation of such services. The purpose of the clause is simply to ensure that where services operate outside the London area, the mayor and TfL must take account of any conditions set by traffic commissioners with regard to services outside London. That is to ensure consistency--which is obviously sensible--but would in no way preclude the continuance of the service mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, we may consider the following amendments: No. 539, in page 77, line 5, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) the frequency of operation".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 817, in page 77, line 5, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(e) the service level.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The amendments are an attempt to tackle consultation. That theme comes up at various points in the Bill and the amendments are intended to ascertain the Government's thinking.
<P>
The amendments would require Transport for London to consult when it proposed to change service levels. They are intended to widen the issues on which consultation takes place to include hours and days of operation. At present, London Regional Transport is not required to consult on the level of service to be provided, yet changes to service levels may most seriously affect passengers. The quality of services and changes to services are the subject of the strongest representations to hon. Members. The amendments would widen the scope of the consultation that Transport for London would have to undertake. We hope that the Government will accept the amendment--or, if they cannot, that they will in due course table an amendment using an appropriate alternative form of words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 539 invites the Government to consider whether frequency of operation should be taken into account in varying a network service. Frequency is relevant, and including consideration of it would lead to a better bus service.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Frequency was an issue raised by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster earlier--I believe that it was during our debate on clause 134. I promised the right hon. Geneleman a reply, so I will use this opportunity to deliver it.
<P>
Clauses 134 and 150 both simply carry forward the form of words used in existing legislation. I draw the Committee's attention to the distinction between clause 134, which refers to the general level of provision of services, and the consultation provisions in clause 150, which relate to specific bus routes--and, therefore, the frequency of buses.
<P>
Together, the amendments would impose an additional consultation requirement concerning additions or variations to a network service. The clause carries forward existing provisions, which may well be regarded by the mayor as a minimum. He or she may well require TfL to consult in more detail. However, again, we believe that it should be for the mayor to make changes if that is desired. I would be reluctant to change the wording from that of current legislation because of concerns that have been expressed to me about the length of time that it already takes to make changes to existing services. It could be argued that a requirement to lay yet another layer of consultation on TfL would lengthen that process.
<P>
In the light of my comments, I trust that the hon. Members for Sutton and Cheam and for Croydon, South will not press their amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> In the spirit in which the Minister made her points, I am happy to withdraw the amendment. However, I should like to raise just one point. From a quick re-reading of the clause, I am not confident that the mayor would necessarily be able to exercise the discretion that the Minister suggested he or she could in deciding to widen the range of issues on which he or she may wish to consult.
<P>
I take the point about complaints; I myself have heard complaints from time to time about how long it takes to make changes to services--changes that are often beneficial to passengers. We would not want to add to the procedures in such a way as to delay the arrival of improved services. I shall withdraw my amendment, but I hope that the Minister will reflect on whether the clause as drafted from previous legislation really gives the mayor the discretion that she claimed.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I shall respond briefly, As I said, we are simply transferring the existing minimum requirements. If the mayor should decide that wider consultation were needed, it would be within his or her powers so to direct TfL. The assembly's scrutiny of TfL is a further safeguard, and there will also be a London transport users' committee. Again, if consultation were necessary, the relevant bodies would be available to put forward such proposals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In responding to the amendments the Minister alluded to my speech on clause 134 in column 640 of the Committee's proceedings. On that occasion she said that my contribution was brief, but of such complexity that she was tempted to ask me to write to her. I am extremely grateful to her for remembering that I had asked that question and I appreciate her response.
<P>
<B> Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 150 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B><center>Clause 151</center></B><P>
<P><center><b>Discontinuance of a network service</b></center>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The clause deals with the discontinuance of a network service. Those of us who live in London regularly hear, usually via a constituent, that a bus service is about to be withdrawn or varied. Rarely is one notified of that in advance by London Regional Transport, London Buses or the appropriate authority.
<P>
I should simply like to put down a marker--I hope that TfL will take a more user-friendly approach to the variation of bus services. Such variations happen continually in south London and the authorities take a highly aggressive stance. For instance, a bus service that used to take children from the south of the borough of Croydon to the north of the borough was changed with the result that children had to stand at intersections for up to half an hour on the way to or from school waiting for the next bus to come along. If anyone from the future TfL should read these remarks, he or she should note that a more user-friendly style of consultation would be much appreciated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman raises an issue of obvious significance to any London Member of Parliament. All of us have experienced problems when changes of services have been introduced in a way that did not appear to be sensitive to, or pay sufficient regard to, the views of the local community. That, as he quite rightly stresses, causes a lot of irritation, and we should ensure that TfL does better in the future than LRT has done in the past. I share that concern. We have made clear commitments to consultation, but the requirement to consult depends greatly on the consultation being conducted in the spirit in which we would like to see it done.
<P>
Inevitably, in a city like London, where a lot of changes take place, there will be a constant need to reassess the effectiveness and appropriateness of routes, and to change routes to provide a better service. This will inevitably be a continuing process. I can only endorse the hon. G's concerns that there is effective consultation, and that the letter of the law, which we are approving in the clause, should be interpreted in a spirit that pays heed to the real concerns of people all over London about having a say with regard to the services on which they depend and which are provided for their needs.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"consult the Assembly before preparing and adopting".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments:
<P>
No. 819, in page 77, line 41, leave out from "and" to end of line 42 and insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shall consult the Assembly before making any revisions".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 608, in page 77, line 42, at end insert "after due consultation.".
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> Amendments Nos. 818 and 819 would insert in the clause an obligation on the mayor to consult the assembly when drafting and revising the guidance document that sets out the criteria by which applications for a London service permit will be considered. When we debated clause 148, we discussed the possibility of environmental factors being a consideration. In drawing up his or her criteria for assessing whether a permit should be granted, the mayor should seek the assembly's view.
<P>
We hope that the Government will be minded to accept the amendment or, in terms of the general undertaking given previously about consultation, that they will come back with an appropriate form of wording. We believe that this is a legitimate role for the assembly, not least because of its role in respect of appointing the London Transport users committee and its continuing scrutiny of the activities of Transport for London. We hope that the requirement to consult on the guidance will be acceptable to the Government.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendment No. 608 is similar to those tabled by Liberal Democrat Members, except that theirs go down the well-rehearsed route of seeking to consult the assembly. We have got the point, I have to tell them. Our amendment would simply introduce the process of consultation with the arrangements set up by the Minister.
<P>
I am slightly surprised that there is no consultation requirement in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> It is in clause 158.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> Why did you tell him?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am not sure which Minister I should be addressing. No doubt the Minister for Transport in London will take her usual pleasure in trying to put me down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I support the Liberal Democrat amendments. They strike me as eminently sensible. The assembly ought to be consulted over the general policy guidelines, the guidance document, the criteria for issuing service certificates and for the revision of such documents. If the assembly is to have any meaningful purpose--the Minister said that it will be scrutinising TfL--this seems to be a due process of consultation, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, that the Government should accept.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I regret to inform the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that the Government cannot accept the amendment. We have no argument with consultation and openness. However, we share the perception of the hon. Member for Croydon, South that this is another attempt by the Liberal Democrats to divide the powers. We have made it abundantly clear that the mayor is the power and the assembly is the scrutinising authority. I must say to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that there would be a conflict of interests if there were a requirement for the assembly to be consulted on an issue when it would have to scrutinise the decisions that were taken.
<P>
Let me reassure the hon. Member for Croydon, South by reiterating what my hon. Friend the Minister said from a sedentary position. Clauses 158 and 159 contain details of arrangements for appropriate consultation. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I shall be happy to do so, but I draw attention to clause 158 and the fact that the London Transport users committee reports to the assembly. Therefore, there will be problems with consultation feeding back to the assembly.
<P>
