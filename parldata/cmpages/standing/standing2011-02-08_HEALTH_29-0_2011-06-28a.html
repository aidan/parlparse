                  </strong> Good morning. Before we begin, I have a few
preliminary announcements. Members may, if they wish, remove their
jackets during Committee meetings. It is pretty warm today, so that is
a kind gesture on my part. Would all Members please ensure that their
mobile phones, pagers and so on are turned off or switched to silent
during Committee meetings? As a general rule, my fellow Chair and I do
not intend to call starred amendments that have not been tabled with
adequate notice; the required notice period in Public Bill Committees
is three working
days.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000007">&#160;</a>

shall briefly explain how we will proceed. The Committee will first be
asked to consider the programme motion on the amendment paper, for
which debate is limited to half an hour. We will then proceed to the
motion to report written evidence and the motion to permit the
Committee to deliberate in private in advance of the oral evidence
sessions. Assuming that those three motions are agreed to, the
Committee will move into private session. Once the Committee has
deliberated, witnesses and members of the public will be invited back
into the room and the oral evidence session will begin. If the
Committee agrees to the programme motion, we will hear oral evidence
this morning—the session with the first set of witnesses must
finish at 11.30
am.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000008">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> The Government’s amendments have been
tabled at extremely short notice. Such short notice is unprecedented,
and it is unfair, unnecessary, impractical and undemocratic for the
Government to behave as they are.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000019">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
Government’s tabling of 180 amendments at
5 o’clock on Thursday evening, allowing two full
working days before the Committee’s first sitting, means that
there is insufficient time for those amendments to be properly read
through and for proper work to be done so that we can scrutinise the
Bill in the way that the Bill and the national health service deserve.
We should, therefore, amend the programme motion to allow more time for
witnesses to read through the amendments, to consult their members and
to give proper evidence to this Committee. Our amendments would
allocate today, Thursday and next Tuesday for the Committee to hear
from witnesses.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000020">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In passing, I
should say that it is completely inappropriate for there to be only one
hour to hear from patient groups. If the national health service is
about patients, it is unfair to allow patients one hour to give
evidence with two days’ notice of 180 amendments. In reality,
patient groups do not have the same resources as, for example, the
Government, so it is not possible for them to consult. The Committee
may know that the British Medical Association is beginning a
conference, and we think that it is important for it to be able to
consult its members before giving evidence to the Committee. If we want
to scrutinise the Bill properly, we suggest that that should
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000021">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
agreed with the Prime Minister when he said that it would take about 10
days to scrutinise the amendments, but 10 days have not been granted
under the programme motion that the Government tabled. Our solution is
to spend three days listening to witnesses, to give them more time to
look at the amendments and talk to their members, and then to have many
more days of scrutiny with longer hours and without knives at the end,
so that we can look at this properly. We also fundamentally disagree
with the fact that only part of the Bill is being re-examined in
Committee; it is not only a matter of looking at the 180 amendments,
but of looking at them in the context of the entire
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000022">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
know that we are short of time and we do not want to cut into the time
available to witnesses, but we work with the programme that the
Government suggest unless we can amend it today. In summary, the kernel
of our objections is that the proposed programme is undemocratic, is
not in the interests of the NHS and does not allow for proper scrutiny.
I urge Members to consider carefully the amendments that I have
tabled  to the programme motion.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000023">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I urge my
hon. Friends and other hon. Members  to oppose amending the
programme motion. As the Committee is aware, the Government have been
extremely anxious from the start to give full scrutiny to the
legislation. At the end of the original Bill Committee, the hon. Member
for Halton (Derek Twigg), who led for the Opposition, said in his
concluding remarks that “every inch of the Bill” had been
examined.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000025">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
we all know, the Government accepted the core recommendations of the
independent NHS Future Forum following its review. To fulfil the
changes recommended to strengthen and improve the legislation, it is
right to recommit the parts of the Bill that we seek to
amend. I will not rehearse the debate on
recommittal, but I believe that the timetable we
are offering the Committee 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 5<a class="bkMark" name="Column5">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is more than generous. In fact, it is double the time of the Committee
stage of the last Government’s Health Act 2009, in that we are
offering 12 sessions; for that Act, the Committee was offered six
sessions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000026">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Similarly,
I believe that the attempt to amend the programme motion is a red
herring and part of a delaying process, because the Opposition have
made it clear from the outset that they want to delay—their
original motion was to stay in Committee until 18 October.
We had a full discussion in the Programming Sub-Committee yesterday,
where we thrashed out and voted on the issues. The Opposition are
seeking to live up to their original line, conveyed at the outset of
the proceedings to discuss recommittal through the usual channels, that
they would oppose everything.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000027">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As the hon.
Member for Islington South and Finsbury has said, the Government
amendments were tabled on Thursday, but she did not tell the Committee
that the Labour party tabled a host of amendments yesterday, three days
after the Government. If she does not think that there is enough time
to consider the Government’s amendments—I do not share
that view—she must think that there is even less time to
consider the Opposition amendments. On those grounds, I regard the
argument as bogus, and if the hon. Lady decides to divide the Committee
on amending the programme motion, I urge my hon. Friends and any other
reasonable hon. Member to join us in voting it
down.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000028">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> This Bill is of a completely different nature
to the 2009 Act; I challenge Members to list the five most
controversial clauses in that legislation. This Bill has had the
national health service up in arms. The Government say that they have
listened and that they want to put into law the challenges and concerns
that have been well expressed by the NHS, but if the Government believe
that they are doing that, what are they afraid of? Why will they not
give us all sufficient time to scrutinise the Bill properly? I
appreciate that the Government might find it inconvenient if the
Opposition wish to look at such things, but that is democracy. We are
doing our job properly, and we, the national health service and all the
groups involved need to be able to scrutinise the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000029">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is a red
herring—again, we are talking about red herrings—to draw
any parallels between this Bill and the 2009 Act. In some written
evidence that has been submitted—of course, not all
organisations have had the opportunity or sufficient time to write
evidence—it is clear that various groups, and I pray in aid the
Royal College of Nursing and the BMA, have not had enough time to
discuss the changes in anything other than generalities. That is
wrong.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000030">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There would
have been nothing wrong with putting this matter back to 18 October.
Unfortunately, we have lost that opportunity, and we are now working
within the constraints of the decision that was made. We are prepared,
however, to work all hours to get this out of Committee within the time
frame that has now been set. To do that, we need more time to hear from
the NHS and its representatives, and we then need sufficient time to
scrutinise the Bill properly and still get it to Report by Thursday 14
July. It will take a lot of time and a lot of work, but the national
health service is worth it.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000031">&#160;</a>

quickly, there were no internal knives in the Committee stage of the
2009 Act, so the debate could go on, whereas this has been
time-limited. If the Government thought that the time allocated was
adequate, why did they include knives? There were none in the previous
Committee stage on this Bill, which had 28 sittings. The knives have
been included, because the Government want proceedings to end when they
say, and because they know that there is insufficient time to discuss
all the proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000032">&#160;</a>

not a completely different Bill. Substantial changes have been made to
strengthen and improve the Bill, as a result of the recommendations
from the NHS Future Forum. As a Government, we believe that the
Committee should have significant and ample time to consider the
changes. That is why we have re-committed the relevant clauses and some
others to give context, so that the Committee can do its work and fully
scrutinise the new parts that are a result of the Government’s
amendments. It is palpably absurd to suggest that we are not giving

recommendations with the Government’s oral and written responses

areas the Government have gone further than we suggested in our five
parts of the report, and in some areas they have not gone as far as we
suggested. I can understand why, but generally I am extremely pleased
at the way Government have responded. Particularly in areas such as
cherry-picking, people have come up with lots of suggestions. We did
not believe that it was our job to go through the Bill as part of the
listening exercise and look at each section and provide amendments
ourselves; we thought that that was your job. Our job was to listen to
thousands of people out there in the NHS speaking not only about their
concerns but about where they were happy with the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000134">&#160;</a>

                  </em>First—off the top of my
head—looking at the openness of board meetings, I believe that
there should be a level playing field for all providers of health care.
I strongly believe that, as a taxpayer, I should know where my money is
being spent, and that was the feeling that people gave back to us in
the listening period. Open foundation trust board meetings have been
accepted, but I believe that private providers of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 9<a class="bkMark" name="Column9">&#160;</a>
                  </div>NHS services should also be on the same level playing field as
foundation trusts. I can understand why that cannot be put in an
amendment to the Bill, but it does say that ways, through contracting
or whatever, can be explored, so that is really a minor issue. The vast
majority of the paper has been accepted in its
entirety.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000136">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
one particular area about demonstration sites for some integrated care
between health and social care, the wording is slightly different from
what we suggested. However, as a global answer to your question, it is
remarkable how the Government have listened to what are a lot of
recommendations from us and have come back with more ideas and
suggestions in the amendments than we had asked for. We are pleased
with that, and Kathy would probably
agree.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000137">&#160;</a>

forward quickly to give patients more control. There is no mention of
the time frame in the paper. There was a lot about public health and
establishing Public Health England as an independent organisation. That
has been accepted, but the Government have said to us that more work
needs to be done looking at public health in the NHS. That has been
suggested for us to carry on with during the listening exercise over
the next 12 to 16 weeks. Where the Government have not followed what we
suggested, I believe it is for legitimate reasons, and extra work has
been suggested to help them. If you read the original Bill, which you
all know well, it is remarkable how the Government have responded in
such a constructive way to what were quite challenging
recommendations.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000139">&#160;</a>

you referred to the fact that you no longer wanted Monitor to be an
economic regulator, and that you wanted choice to be emphasised and
competition to be played down. Are you not disappointed, therefore,
that part 3 of the Bill, which relates to competition, is still called
“Economic regulation of health and adult social care
services”? Are you not also slightly concerned that the shift of
emphasis in the wording of the amendments from promoting competition to
preventing anti-competition, which I contend is pretty much the same

probably caused more discussion than any other part of the Bill during
our listening exercise. We are pleased with how the Government have
responded in the proposed amendments to the Bill. You have read out one
part of it. There are a lot more. If you take them all in context, our
belief is that competition, as Stephen Budd would say if he were here,
is not a disease. Competition is needed in the NHS. Indeed, it has been
there right the way from the start of the NHS over 60 years ago.
General practices are competitive, as are dentistry, pharmacies and
hospitals. Competition is not a bad thing. What we did not want to see
was promoting competition being the main role of Monitor. On the one
hand we believe that choice is important and through our
choice mandate we also believed that creating a market in some
circumstances is important as well. So we are satisfied with how the
amendments are
laid.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000165">&#160;</a>

patient choices. We do not want to close down competition, but we
do not believe that Monitor’s prime aim
should be to promote competition. It should be about encouraging the
best quality, most efficient, effective health care possible. In some
cases that will encourage integrated care between health and social
care. In other areas it will be about suggesting that more competition
should be there. I think the wording changes completely the emphasis on

                  </em> We had long discussions with people out there
in the NHS, with Monitor, and with the people who wrote the original
part of the Bill, and we discussed the issues of a sector regulator and
how that sector regulator’s role should be just about health and
not about a broad group of utilities. We felt it was wrong that in the
early discussions Monitor was described as a utility regulator like
that for water. We felt that set the wrong tone. We felt that there
should be a regulator that looked at competition, but also encouraged
choice and integration. The wording we suggested there was about sector
regulation. It was about removing the initial promoting of competition.
It was about inserting words about collaboration and choice. So we
wanted to say that we felt Monitor should exist, but should not have

We had a lot of discussion about European law and we even asked for

that in a way having Monitor as a specific sector regulator protects
you from the OFT, because the alternative would be to let the OFT take
on responsibility for everything, and perhaps it would never get round
to health because it was so busy. We felt that being explicit and tying

on the same theme. The concern on the Opposition side of the Committee
has been about Monitor as a potential Trojan horse for introducing
competition into the heart of the NHS. One of the NHS Future
Forum’s recommendations was about raising concerns about
promoting competition as an end in itself, which was set out in the
original Bill. You recommended that Monitor be stripped of the
competition duties and no longer be an economic regulator. I am
surprised that you said that looking at the Government amendments you
were not concerned that there is no provision to remove the role of
Monitor as the economic
regulator.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000177">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">I
want to consider the costs of Monitor because the Minister of State,
the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, indicated in evidence to the
original Bill Committee that the costs of Monitor would be between
£40 million and £130 million a year. It is a huge
bureaucratic machine. Given that its powers are being diluted, is there
an argument for asking why we need it? Could its powers not be
transferred to the Care Quality Commission, HealthWatch England or
another organisation in the new architecture that the Bill
establishes?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000178">&#160;</a>

people suggested that we should have one regulator that included the
CQC, but the overwhelming number of people we spoke to when that was
raised felt that the CQC should do its job properly as its prime
directive, rather being merged with Monitor. Merging two organisations
certainly would not help now when the CQC has a lot of difficult issues
on its plate, so when we discussed it with people the feeling was that
Monitor should be
separate.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000179">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">We
do not believe that competition is bad; it can be bad, as can
integrating a health care service and fossilising it, so that the
service quality decreases. Choice can improve quality of care. There
needs to be some mechanism for managing those issues, and therefore,
from a regulation point of view, there is a role for Monitor. We did
not believe that the prime role was about promoting competition.

one hand, many of the foundations trusts were saying that the private
patient cap was unreasonable. One strong representation was from
University hospital Birmingham, which is capped at around 1%, whereas
the Royal Marsden is capped at around 30%, so University hospital
Birmingham could not bring money in that would actually help its NHS
services. On the other hand, if you opened the cap, it made you more
likely to be under attack from EU law, competition and Monitor, so when
we weighed up the proposals and the problems that might arise, we chose
not to go into any great detail.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000189">&#160;</a>

a gut feeling for what was happening in the listening, the feeling was
that the private cap should actually stay, because people felt that
that would provide a protection. However, it should be reviewed and set
at a reasonable level, whereas it is unreasonable in some

in the document, because it was

The key issue that we have picked up on is about the integration of
services, competition and patient choice. We have talked also about
reconfiguring services, which you mentioned briefly. Do you now feel
that the Bill is well suited to doing that? Obviously, there are
different challenges in different parts of the country; perhaps better
integrating adult social care with NHS care is a challenge where there
are more elderly populations with health and services issues. In the
Bill as it now stands, how do you see Monitor’s role in
promoting that sort of integrated
working?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000199">&#160;</a>

system. Monitor is described as an economic regulator in the title of
part 3, but when you read further down that section the amendments talk
about promoting collaboration and so on. It is part of Monitor’s
role to make sure that that happens, and if you read some of the other
amendments to do with the commissioning board they also talk about
integration and services around the patient. We talk about health and
well-being boards and their important role, and we talk about pilots

that you made earlier? One thing that you thought had not quite been
embodied in the legislation and that was demanded by some contributors
to the listening exercise was a demand for greater transparency with
regard to private sector providers. The Government have the laudable
intention of trying to secure a level playing field, but clearly,
without financial transparency, you could get a private provider
behaving in a predatory way—trade at a tariff but at a loss for
a period of time to remove a hospital unit that is thought to be
fragile, or whatever. Is that a problem that people wanted TO be
addressed? Were there any obvious solutions coming from the Future
Forum, or that have been, as you can see, embodied in the legislation
to deal with that issue? It is obviously a tricky problem, because
private firms are not very good at letting people know precisely how
their finances stack
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000224">&#160;</a>

posed was about transparency, and overwhelmingly, the feedback was that
foundation trusts should have open board meetings, consortia should
have open meetings, and all the minutes should be published. Nurses,
doctors and patients also wanted those providing NHS services, which
might be the third sector or a hospital, to have more transparency.
Many said that open board meetings would be a good thing, because that
would create a level playing field with NHS providers. It is difficult
legally to make that happen. You might do it through the commissioning
process, by writing it into contracts. I can fully understand why the
Government did not go as far as we were suggesting, because it is very
difficult in law, I gather, to make that happen. There are other parts
of the Government’s response that reassured me, and I knew that
I was pushing harder than I might get an answer

me in the past few months regretted the unsightly political football

privatisation of the NHS—we will call that option A—and

public face was “Save the NHS from being privatised”.
That was in the press. When we met with organisations and individuals,
and once you got past the privatisation and talked about the detail,
there was a genuine understanding from lots of people that the NHS had
to change. When we talked about the reasons for change, such as the
ageing population, or the cost of fantastic medical advances that the
NHS has brought about, people genuinely felt that the NHS had to move
on from where we are now, which is hospital-based, to something more
community-based and preventative. When we started to ask questions
about the principles underlying the Bill, there was overwhelming
support for the principles of clinical leadership, which had not been
apparent in many of the PCTs in the past—that led to stagnation
and a lack of development of commissioning, and all of that is on
record—as well as for more meaningful patient and public
engagement, and for the outcomes framework, building on Lord
Darzi’s brilliant work on quality. Therefore, it was more
complex. It quickly became apparent that those people who were aware of
the NHS constitution and its first words owned the NHS almost like a
religion and wanted us to safeguard the
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000228">&#160;</a>

extent to which the real issues it is facing on a day-to-day basis are
not going away. In fact, the uncertainty of some of the key players in

                  </em> The sense we have from our members is that
the key decisions that need to be taken in the next two years will be
seminal for the future of the national health service. A number of the
reforms will have a future impact, but some of them will not take
effect until 2013. Our worry is that in the short term some of the
people taking decisions are doing so without understanding what their
position will be in the future or, indeed, whether those organisations
will be around to deal with the consequences of those decisions. We
recognise the immediate issue that the NHS faces in managing the
financial crisis. Think about re-profiling services, think about where
capacity needs to come out of the system and think about where pay
deals might need to be done with staff to support job security against
the overall costs. There are a lot of immediate issues that have to be
tackled. At the moment, many of the people who are in place are
uncertain of their accountability for some of those decisions. That is
a worry for our members, yes. It is a significant
worry.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000235">&#160;</a>

that a number of people will say this today—is that the

that I will give you to the best of my ability today my interpretation

Report, which is significant in terms of failure. All I would say today
is that I can answer to the best of my ability with the time that has

               <p class="tabbed">On
mergers and acquisitions, our sense is that sector-specific oversight
is better than general oversight, given that the nature of health is
different from that of other industries. Our people would support a
more practical approach to supporting relationships between
organisations, not just mergers and acquisitions; it is about being
able to support organisations working together to become more efficient
and to improve and maintain quality standards. Our experience to date
in the health service has been that those kinds of processes have been
very lengthy, they cost a lot and it takes an awfully long time before
you get better value for patients. The general, rather than the
specific, point to make is that we need something that is sensitive to
the needs of the health service, and effectively to understand that, in
some cases, you will have to bring together providers and you should be
able to do that swiftly, transparently and clearly so that patients
benefit.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000249">&#160;</a>

Enterprise Act 2002. Are you comfortable that this and other clauses

               <p class="tabbed">The first
question is whether there is a role for competition in health care,
particularly in the NHS. If the answer to that in policy terms is yes,
inevitably you need to have some way of regulating the market in health
care. The next question is: do you expose the NHS to the existing
economic regulators, such as the Competition Commission and the OFT,
without a sector-specific economic regulator, such as proposed in the
Bill, which might, if it works well, have a detailed understanding of
the complexities of health care and the need to apply competition
principles in a way that is sensitive to those complexities? Given that
the policy says, yes, there is a role for competition and you have to
some way of regulating the market, our view is that it is better to
have Monitor as the economic regulator with concurrent powers with the
OFT and the Competition Commission than not to have a sector-specific
regulator. People will differ on the answer to the first question,
which is whether there is a role for competition.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000254">&#160;</a>

Ham about reconfigurations of hospital services. In the previous
session, we heard from Professor Field that the whole Bill is focused
on a move from a hospital-based system to a more community-centred,
preventive role of delivering health care. He felt that the Bill in its
previous incarnation went some way towards achieving that goal and that
the Government’s amendments had moved that means to that end
forward. In its written evidence the King’s Fund states that it
remains<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000256">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“concerned
about the lack of clear responsibility for driving forward major
reconfigurations of hospital
services.”<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000500">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p>Could
you expand on that? It will clearly be a fundamental issue in the
coming
years.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000257">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Professor
Ham:</strong>
                  </em> Absolutely. We fully endorse what I believe
Steve Field said this morning. We need to move as quickly as we can
towards less emphasis on services being delivered in acute hospitals to
making a reality of prevention, consistently high standards of primary
care, and<em> </em>more care<em> </em>closer to home. We have argued that
over many years and it remains an aspiration rather than a reality.
Inevitably, that means looking at the current organisation of hospital
and specialist services and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 22<a class="bkMark" name="Column22">&#160;</a>
                  </div>taking some tough, but necessary, decisions about concentrating some of
those services in fewer hospitals. First and foremost, that should be
done on quality and safety grounds, because that is a better way of
getting word-class outcomes, to which I suspect we all subscribe. The
debate about paediatric heart surgery is one example of that, and the
concentration of specialist stroke services in fewer hospitals to get
better results is another
example.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000258">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
concern, against a background of generally welcoming what the Future
Forum has said and what the Government say in their response about the
modifications to the Bill, is that if you add in the changes,
particularly in relation to the powers of the health and well-being
boards, the as yet ill-defined role of the new clinical senates and the
role that clinical networks might have, there are more checks and
balances built into the modified Bill than were in the original Bill.
That could bring some benefits such as a bigger role for local
authorities and community involvement in some of those important and
complex decisions, but it is likely to slow down some of those
decisions at a time when the NHS needs to move really rapidly to grasp
the nettle of how we can improve outcomes by reconfiguring hospital
services, in particular, to deliver better care on quality and safety
grounds. Our concern would be the risk of too much bureaucracy being
built into the process, rather than too
little.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000259">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Mike
Farrar:</strong>
                  </em> That is one of the concerns, which we raised
in our evidence, about the relationships between the players that are
now making decisions at local level, and we echo the point that Chris
just made about the potential for several organisations effectively to
have to agree on a particular course of action. It is not at all clear
what the hierarchy is. For example, we do not support, as is currently
set out, the notion that clinical senates and clinical networks would
effectively be part of the national commissioning board. We think that
they should play an advisory role to local consortia, to emphasise the
localism of decision
making.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000261">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We
also worry about the default position wherein consortia are not ready
to take on budgets and they are being deployed by a national body.
Again, there is a risk that, in that organisation trying to have
relationships with health and well-being boards and its clinical
senate, which, by the way, it also hosts, there is an enormous amount
of confusion when it is supposed to be setting the strategic framework
and then holding people to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000262">&#160;</a>

more complex Bill than the original draft, because it has taken on
board many of the recommendations of 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 23<a class="bkMark" name="Column23">&#160;</a>
                  </div>the Future Forum. Equally, it will lead to a more complex—you may
want to call it more bureaucratic—structure than was originally
proposed. Some of that is beneficial, and some of that will have the
effects that I was describing and will slow down necessary decision
making. Once the dust settles on the recent debates, I hope it will be
clear how we can avoid that risk of everything being slowed down,
because there are so many players on the pitch, where we need to act
quickly to take some really important
decisions.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000265">&#160;</a>

more successful attempts at reconfiguration, more involvement of local
groups was necessary in order to get change. Some of the unsuccessful
ones have been those where they have communicated less and involved
fewer people, so, paradoxically, it could have the opposite

of the process. Focusing on patients and given the efficiency savings
that the NHS is being asked to make, what might be the effect on the
delivery of services for
patients?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000268">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Professor
Ham:</strong>
                  </em> I think that the impact on patients will be much
more felt from the Nicholson challenge and finding the £20
billion of efficiency savings in the next year or two, rather than from
the effect of the Bill and the reforms in the medium term. We are
already seeing the pressures of that on the ground—we are only
three months into this financial year, the first of four years of real
financial pressure on the NHS—and add to that the pressures that
we know about of social care impacting on services for older people,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000269">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our
reading is that we are moving into a period in which this is bound to
impact on patient care. However well managed the NHS is, and whatever
scope there is for being more efficient with £105 billion of
public money, the likelihood is that over time there will be pressure
on maintaining the waiting time improvements that we have seen in the
past decade. The Prime Minister has made a clear commitment that that
will not happen, but the financial pressures may drive it to happen. We
may find, therefore, that patients have to wait longer for their care
if we cannot move quickly on some of the reconfigurations that we need
to make on quality and safety grounds, particularly those impacting on
maternity and A and E
services.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000271">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">These
are complex and difficult issues. The challenge will be whether we can
really give a copper-bottomed guarantee to the populations we are
serving that they will be treated by services that are safe and deliver
the quality of care that we expect and that they have a right to
expect, too. That is not primarily an issue of money, although money
will underpin the quality and safety
challenges.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000272">&#160;</a>

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 24<a class="bkMark" name="Column24">&#160;</a>
                  </div>difficult, and it is a concern that we all share. It is probably
inevitable in any large period of managing structural and
organisational change. Would you agree that, if anything, that is an
argument for not spending too long navel gazing about what we are going
to do and for actually saying, “Once you make the decision, the
impetus is then to get on and implement the changes quickly to reduce
that period of
uncertainty”?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000273">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Mike
Farrar:</strong>
                  </em> This is the fourth reorganisation of the
national health service in the past 12 years, but it is the biggest.
The people on the front line who are trying to take decisions feel
rather confused, but there is a sense in which they feel they are doing
a good job of improving the NHS.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000274">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">This rather
took people by surprise at first. There are some good reasons why you
should be reforming health services on an ongoing basis. Many of those
reasons are about trying to engage people and requiring primary care to
be more engaged. Most of our members support the principle of primary
care being responsible, particularly given that when GPs make decisions
on referrals and prescribing they are effectively the major spenders of
the budget. So that is a sensible move, as is the move on local
authorities having more responsibility, alongside the health service,
for health improvement. That is the 15 to 20-year type of benefits that
you get out of that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000275">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Our members
want to find some real clarity and certainty, but they want to find
clarity and certainty in a system that works. So this business about
pace is very important, but, equally, it is important that the
decisions that are taken on the complexity are clear. There is no point
in running very fast if you run into systems in which nobody is quite
certain whether the clinical senate can second-guess a consortium or
whether a health and well-being board can appeal to the NHS
commissioning board if a system does not reflect local need.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000276">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There are two
responsibilities here: one is to move at pace, but the other is that
the legislation is as clear as it possibly can be, so that as we enact
it everybody understands the decisions that are made. The decisions
should not be subject to appeal or somebody saying, “Well,
that’s not the way the system should work.” We need real
clarity, and we need
pace.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000277">&#160;</a>

                  </em> Pace needs to be judged according to the ability
of the new clinical commissioners to take on the responsibilities being
offered to them. I could point you to some parts of the country in
which the GPs, because they have been in the pathfinders, are almost
ready to go. Why would we hold them back? There are some excellent
examples around the country, but there are many others, often next
door, where that is not the case. So pace has to be judged in relation
to the ability of people to take on the responsibilities being put in
their
direction.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000279">&#160;</a>

received yesterday tea time as well, the Government identify how they

of the ways in which they suggest that that might be done is through a
more complex tariff system. Both Mr Farrar and Professor Ham have
raised concerns about the new 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 25<a class="bkMark" name="Column25">&#160;</a>
                  </div>bureaucracy and the complexities that that will bring into the system.

given that their admin costs are capped elsewhere?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000280">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Mike
Farrar:</strong>
                  </em> Cherry-picking is a very complex issue. The
current tariff does not reward accurately the costs of care. From the
work that we have done with our members, there is quite a wide range of
things, such as older people’s care and general surgery, that,
generally speaking, are subsidised by some of the more sporadic
elective pieces of work, such as cochlear implant, where trusts can
often effectively do better under the tariff arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000281">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is quite
a significant set of complex interrelationships, and if you start
allowing individual bits of service to be taken away, you can
destabilise services. We think that the tariff is the right way to do
it, but we know from the tariff to date that a couple of times when it
has been road-tested in its current form it has had to be taken back
and adjusted. Going for a more sophisticated tariff probably is the
right solution, but we do not underestimate the effort that it takes to
do that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000282">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We do not
think, however, that you can restrict patients to receiving care from a
poor-quality provider, and therefore we think that you have to attack
this. There are two principles at stake here. One is not destabilising
important services that have co-dependencies and relationships. The
second is making sure, as far as we possibly can, that patients can
always have the option to get the best provider. This is quite
technical and difficult, and it is easy to get perverse consequences.
We feel that we need to work quite hard on this issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000283">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We saw in the
Government’s document yesterday a statement of how they might
tackle that through things such as trying to redesign tariff and go for
a more sophisticated tariff, but the devil really is in the detail and
it takes a lot of testing and a lot of understanding. The situation in
a large teaching hospital regarding what it is subsidising and what it
is benefiting from might be different in a district general hospital,
in a rural area or in community services. This is quite a complex area,
and we would certainly counsel a significant investment in
understanding and developing it. We suggest bringing our members in to
play rather than doing it in an academic way, because our members can
reflect from their current experience where you are getting some of
these variations.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000284">&#160;</a>

groups—their ability and the management cost constraints on
them. I would say that it would be totally inefficient and the wrong
way to go to expect 200, 300 or however many clinical commissioning
groups to find local solutions to refining the tariff to avoid
cherry-picking. That needs to be done properly once by the NHS
commissioning board to create some national, off-the-shelf solutions
that commissioning groups can pick up and adapt.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000285">&#160;</a>

In the amendments, the Government are clearly seeking to create a more
sophisticated national tariff. In so doing, they are trying to do what
they say they want to do, which is to prevent price competition. In a
new NHS, where we have this more labyrinthine set of rules about
setting tariff, is there anything in the amendments that you have seen
that would stop price competition? Is it not actually more
likely?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000290">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
substantive change on the face of the amendments is that commissioners
have to publish information when there is a variance from tariff, so is
having that new information in the system and in the public domain not
more likely to mean that there will be price competition in the NHS,
once a whole variety of different prices is out there in the public
domain?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000291">&#160;</a>

that there should not be price competition. There is still the option
in there for price flexibility under certain circumstances, and that is
probably as far as can be gone with this issue. I am clear that the
spirit is not to have price competition, but there is scope for price

information available about the outcomes and quality of that service,
and I think David Nicholson was clear about that in his evidence to one
of the Committees. That is broadly the intention, but it would have to
be assessed regularly to make sure that it was not being abused, which

greater detail, with more authority than I can, but at the moment, PCTs

Dixon:</strong>
                  </em> More broadly speaking, the idea of the
clinical commissioning groups taking on responsibility for the quality
of primary care is a very positive move. In scrutinising expenditure on
the budget for hospital care, they will have an incentive to be looking
at out-of-hospital care provided by practices that are on their patch.
For the first time, that creates a really nice mechanism for proper
peer review of the quality of primary care locally.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000299">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">May I just
add that the biggest issue facing the service is provision? It is not
directly addressed in the legislation—nor should it be,
probably—but the quality of primary care and the administration
around that is at least addressed indirectly through the commissioning
consortia.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000300">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Professor
Ham:</strong>
                  </em> We have always been concerned about the
proposal—as far as I understand it, this has not
changed—that responsibility for commissioning primary care
provision should rest with the NHS commissioning board. It would
probably be done through the regional offices—clusters, or
whatever they are to be called in future—and the concern is that
they would not have the depth of understanding of current standards of
primary medical care provision to be able to exercise that power
effectively.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000301">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">That is not
to say that PCTs in the current system have done a fantastic job.
However, there are some notable exceptions, where PCTs have used the
levers available—Tower Hamlets is a really good
example—and have got in there among the practices to improve
quality and reduce the variability of primary medical care provision.
We do not see why that should not be a clear responsibility of the
clinical commissioning groups, working in association with the NHS
commissioning board, because they will be much better placed to
understand what is currently delivered, where the weaknesses are, and
they have the right kind of expertise to exert peer pressure on poorly
performing practices to improve. That has to be a key part of the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000302">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Mike
Farrar:</strong>
                  </em> Our sense is that there are some very
positive things for the development of primary care, but some things to
watch out for. A positive development around primary care is
effectively giving clinical commissioning groups the resource to deploy
around secondary care; the way in which they will become managers of
demand is largely by developing alternatives to secondary care<em>.</em>
In our view, there are some issues about supply-induced demand that can
be tackled, but an awful lot of the way that we can deflect work from
secondary care is by having an alternative available. In fact, a lot
ends up in hospital because there is not primary care.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000303">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I very much
agree with the point about peer review of primary care. There has been
data available to help us look at primary care and we have probably not
exploited that to its full potential. We could do more and should do
more. We very much support the view that Chris  
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 28<a class="bkMark" name="Column28">&#160;</a>
                  </div>just expressed. It is very important that the clinical commissioning
groups have a relationship with their practices. If primary care
contracting is too remote from them, first, you will not get the local
understanding that you need; and secondly, you will not have the
leverage over practices that are behaving in an aberrant way in the
sense of not complying with some of the things that the commissioning
group might think are sensible. They are all potential positives if we
can do the latter.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000304">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The downside,
and one of the things that was a significant concern to me in my
previous role in the north-west, is that we were struggling to have
primary care capacity sufficient to do the work that could and should
have been done in primary care. Clearly, taking some of that capacity
away from primary care provision into the commissioning arrangement
could detract from your key principle. Therefore one of the things that
is worth giving due consideration to in the implementation of this is
where will that capacity be sourced and is it a catalyst for bringing
more multi-disciplinary work into primary care? Are there things that
we can do to deflect work away from primary care? But that resource is
very precious at the moment in terms of providing high-quality primary
care, particularly in deprived areas with high health
need.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000305">&#160;</a>

fundamentally change the way in which this operates at the moment. The
big issue on reconfiguration of services is largely about the extent to
which we communicate with the public about change. One of the silver
linings to the cloud of the big political debate, if I can put it that
way, has been that at a political level there is more engagement with
some of the difficulties around the health service and making
changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000311">&#160;</a>

to some MPs who understand in private the case for change, but feel

not help any of us. It would be enormously helpful if, on the back of

mature conversation, with political leadership and the NHS working

out a good report recently on incentives in the NHS. It found that the
current system of incentives does not really
incentivise dealing with health care inequalities, as set up around the
QOF payment, or with the big challenge of supporting people living
longer with many medical co-morbidities. The focus is now on
commissioning boards, so, to start with Professor Ham, do you think
that it is a good way to tackle some of the key issues around health
care inequalities and to deal better with looking after people in the
community and preventing unnecessary acute hospital
admissions?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000313">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Professor
Ham:</strong>
                  </em> Yes, if two conditions are fulfilled. First, the
commissioning outcomes framework, which has not been mentioned so far,
will reward clinical commissioning groups depending on how well they
perform, and it could create the right kind of incentives for clinical
commissioning groups to focus exactly on tackling health inequalities
and avoiding avoidable hospital admissions. We do not yet know what
will be in the commissioning outcomes framework, so we, and I am sure
you, will follow that very closely to see what the groups will be
rewarded for. What gets measured gets managed, and clinical
commissioning groups will be no different.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000314">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly, the
relationship between the new public health function located in local
government and the clinical commissioning groups will be critical.
Primary care teams are in many ways the foot soldiers of public health
and prevention. Putting public health into local government could bring
some real benefits, but we must ensure that it does not detach public
health from primary care, because we need the two to work together to
address the agenda you have identified.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000315">&#160;</a>

                  </em> On whether the Bill helps, there is a risk on
the commissioning side that CCGs will be pretty inert, apart from in
one or two go-ahead areas. Remember the phrase about practice-based
commissioning—it is a corpse in need of resuscitation, or not.
The big risk is that commissioning will not fire, so what is in the
Bill to fire up the provider side, which should be integrating to
provide the seamless care we all want? There is the promise of
integration—the promotion of it—but not much else. It
probably rests with the payment mechanism that is constructed around
the providers to help fire up and motivate them to provide more out of
hospital care. To return to the red tape and the complexity on the
commissioning side, there is a risk of inertia on the CCG side that
will not act to promote the integration we
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000316">&#160;</a>

will come down to how clinical commissioning groups see the voluntary

voluntary sector. It has a way of engaging people that should be part
of the transformation of the service, so that it can deal with the
long-term financial challenges by engaging people more in thinking
about their own health and use of resources. Through the process of
implementation, we should ensure that we support the voluntary sector
to be a bigger provider of services over time to the health service. I
do not think that it is necessarily supported or otherwise by the
legislation at the moment. The biggest challenge for the voluntary
sector is the short-term contracting and financial pressures on the
system. We should try very, very hard to secure a long-term position
for the voluntary sector as a provider of health and social

We have particular concerns about the extent to which the Bill promotes
the integration of health and social care. We are concerned that the
proposals promote the integration of the health service, but not
necessarily the integration of health and well-being. It misses the
concerns that we raised in evidence to you before about Cinderella
services, particularly in relation to amendment 59. That amendment
talks about the responsibilities of commissioning groups for emergency
care, but we feel that it misses wider responsibilities in relation to
things like safeguarding emergency mental health services or services
for homeless people, for example. That is one

about. The first is the slowing down of the progress to a whole
foundation trust sector. The Bill, as a whole, is a real endorsement of
the foundation trust model as the way forward for public provision
within the NHS. We are concerned that the ending of the drop-dead date
in the Bill should not stop the focus and momentum towards foundation
trust establishment, so we were pleased to see that the taking away of
the NHS trust, as a format, in future is to be retained in the Bill. We
think that that will help to keep the momentum and the impetus. We are
concerned that, because of the financial challenges—the
Nicholson challenge—of needing to get £20 billion out of
the system, driving towards more efficient provision is going to be
enormously
important.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000330">&#160;</a>

has not changed. I think that the proposals in the revisions are the
same as they were originally. What has changed is that in addition to
the Competition Act there are the sector-specific regimes. There is one
today, the principles and rules for co-operation and competition, as
looked at by the co-operation and competition panel. The proposal is
that they continue to form the foundation of the new sector regime. The
original intention was that there would be a sector regime, and this
makes it clearer that it is a continuation of the current regime. But
in the application of that regime now, we will be subject to tougher
requirements in terms of burden of proof, for example, when we think
that it might be appropriate to introduce further competition. Those
are the changes, but the concurrency with the Competition Act remains
as it
was.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000358">&#160;</a>

                  </em> This is a complex area, but fundamentally
the original proposals did not extend the application of EU, or indeed
UK, competition law to the health sector. UK, and therefore EU,
competition law applies across the whole of the UK economy; it does so
today, and it will in the future. Giving Monitor concurrency means that
as competition regulations, whether sector specific or the Competition
Act, are applied to the sector, they are being applied by a body that
has sector-specific knowledge today; the Office of Fair Trading
oversees 
<div class="columnNumber">

                     <strong>Dr
Bennett:</strong>
                  </em> Again, I will pass this on in a moment
because the technicalities will get very complex. Today, if the private
sector wanted to go to the OFT and make a complaint under the
Competition Act, which embodies European competition law, it could, and
the OFT is indeed dealing with a complaint today. What is proposed is
that in addition to the OFT having that power—its normal
power—we would have concurrent powers under the Competition Act.
What that should mean is that if someone wanted to make a complaint
under the Act they would come to us first. The advantage of that is
twofold. First, it means that it has been looked at from the point of
view of a sector-specific regulator, which has, I hope, an in-depth
understanding of the sector, rather than being looked at by a general
regulator. Secondly, it means that we are looking at it alongside the
sector-specific regime, the principles and rules for co-operation and
competition, which is being continued. If you were fearful that the
Competition Act might be applied in an undesirable way to the health
sector—we do not really know the extent to which it is
applicable because it has not been tested; in the way these things
work, until you have had cases in the courts to determine exactly what
applies where, you cannot be sure—the fact that you have a
sector regulator with concurrent powers able to look at those issues
means that the Competition Act is more likely to be looked at through a
sector-specific lens than applied in the same way as it would be to any
other
sector.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000362">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> I have two questions, the first to Dr
Bennett and Sonia Brown. You said that the focus was going to be on
achieving value for the NHS and promoting integrated care. There are,
obviously, considerable health care economic arguments as well as
patient arguments for supporting integrated care and preventing
unnecessary hospital admissions, as we heard earlier on. In
Monitor’s role as part of integrated care, would you be looking
specifically at community-focused care and providing more joined-up
thinking in that part of health care?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000363">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Sonia
Brown:</strong>
                  </em> Absolutely. The Bill is clear in asking
Monitor to do two things. The first is to think, from a patient
perspective, about having no boundaries in care in the integration
across care setting boundaries for Monitor. The second is to think very
hard about the efficiency arguments. Of course, sometimes the two
things can actually work together and they are not necessarily in
trade-off with each other.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000364">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> My second question is to our colleagues from
local government. On the idea of integrated care, in my experience
there is often a lot of silo working between social services and the
NHS. At the moment, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 36<a class="bkMark" name="Column36">&#160;</a>
                  </div>we do not always see enough integrated care, in my view. For example,
someone may have an acute event—a stroke—that will
require NHS care for some of the time and social services care later
on. One of the key challenges is for funding and support to follow the
patient rather than the institution. How do you see this Bill
supporting that
objective?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>

                  <em>
                     <strong>Councillor
Dr Barnard:</strong>
                  </em> First, it builds on some existing very
good work that has taken place. Admittedly, in some places that has
been better than others, but overall the journey has been in the right
direction. A number of things in the Bill really help from the
perspective of local government, particularly in the amendments that
have been tabled. The first is the recognition of coterminosity,
because you are starting to work on an approach that has common
boundaries and therefore a common population and understanding, so you
can use local information to plan the services more effectively. That
fits very well with the role of the health and well-being board, which
has been further explored. That is something that we felt was very
positive about the Future Forum and it helped feed into that.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000368">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We also need
to strengthen the transparency and the public accountability of NHS
bodies, because if there is greater openness and understanding it will
be easier for patients and the public as a whole to understand what is
going on. When you link that not only to significant major events but
to whole population planning—putting in preventive services for
those in your local community who are more vulnerable and in most need
of those services—it works very well.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000369">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">What we find
very helpful about the changes that have been made is the golden thread
that now goes right through the Bill in terms of public and patient
engagement. That is very important, because it helps in various
situations by opening up dialogue. In practical terms, we see the role
of the health and well-being board, and the commissioning groups, as
absolutely core to that. Preventive work goes on; a very small example
is work to prevent falls, which can be done very locally in the
community and which involves, for example, making sure that older
people wear the right sort of footwear so that they do not slip over.
Things like that help. That is at a very local level, but the Bill
really has helped in beefing up the health and well-being board. Can I
link that with scrutiny, which is something that local government is
quite passionate about these days? The strong reference to the
independent health scrutiny that will take place is the sort of forum
where the very question that you posed will be examined in a local
setting. It opens it  all
up.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000370">&#160;</a>

colleagues on both sides. However, there is one bit that is missing. We
are saying that it is in the interests of patients to have integrated

right place at the right time with more control and empowerment over
the management of their own conditions, and that

driver as well and, as Sonia said, those two things can work hand in
hand. However, they only work hand in hand if we then allow the
reconfiguration of services in the secondary sector. If we do not
recognise that that will mean the closure of some things—whether
it be services or whole organisations—and we do not allow that
or enable it to happen, we will drive the secondary organisations to
failure themselves because they will not be sustainable unless they can
reconfigure.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000372">&#160;</a>

said—please tell me if this is a misinterpretation—that
competition law in the national health service is covered at the

competition law. One of those clauses, which remains unamended
at  the moment, gives you the power under part 4 of the
Enterprise Act 2002 to refer any mergers between NHS trusts or mergers
between NHS trusts and other businesses to the Office of Fair Trading
or the Competition Commission. Under what circumstances do you think
that you would use those powers? Could you give us an example of how
you think that they will be used by Monitor in
future?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000375">&#160;</a>

                     <strong>Dr
Bennett:</strong>
                  </em> I might pass the merger question to Sonia.
Let me take the first bit. The NHS today is covered by competition
rules in two fundamental ways. First, the UK Competition Act, which
embodies EU competition law, applies across the whole of the UK
economy. The extent to which it applies is untested because no one has
actually tried to apply it in detail. In principle, it is there today.
The second way in which there is already a competition regime in the
NHS is through the principles and rules of co-operation and competition
established by the previous Government. Those set out rules that
determine, among other things, how competition should be applied in the
health sector. 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 38<a class="bkMark" name="Column38">&#160;</a>
                  </div>The Co-operation and Competition Panel today looks at the application of
those rules, hears complaints if people are concerned that they are not
being followed, and will take a view. Today it advises either us, as
the foundation trust regulator, or the Department of Health if it falls
in its area, where it sees an infringement of the rules. Then we or the
Department decide what to do about it. Those things are true today and,
in principle, they do not change under the new
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000376">&#160;</a>

12 months. Commissioning bodies will have limited money. One
of the matters raised is, do you think that health and well-being
boards, given that they are looking at the wider strategy of health and
well-being in communities, should have the power to veto commissioning
groups’
plans?<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000384">&#160;</a>

Dr Barnard:</strong>
                  </em> I do not like the word
“veto”. If you look at the way that health and well-being
boards will work, I would like to base it on the experience of
children’s trusts, for example—the idea that when you
come together to commission services, if you start with the established
health needs of the area, you have the joint strategic needs
assessment, which will clearly set out the key determinants of health
in the area. If you cannot come to an understanding and agree at that
point—on the health and well-being board and then look at the
commissioning plans—if they don’t tie in, rather than
veto something, you need to go back and review where you have got
to.<a class="bkMark" name="11062840000385">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
co-operation and collaboration go back to the question around care
trusts. Where they have worked, it is because at below chief executive
level, everyone has worked together. That is far more important. If you
start putting that level of power and authority into a board to do
that, you rather move away from the core function, which is to agree a
local plan within the available resources and meet the needs of the
whole population. That is clearly going to mean that you have regard,
if you are doing population planning, for what

other groups, which is more important. They will have to be included. I
am not convinced at this point. The way it is set
out and how the Bill will make it happen, with the guidance that is in

mean something that happens in a rather opaque way in relation to
providers of services where the services may be essential but the
providers, frankly, may not be doing a very good job. They may be
inefficient. Sometimes there are even questions about the quality of
the service. Today, in certain circumstances, those providers
can  be kept going through hidden bail-outs. No one really 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 40<a class="bkMark" name="Column40">&#160;</a>
                  </div>knows how much that is costing. It never really puts proper incentives
on the people managing those services to sort out the problems. An

hidden bail-outs and ensure that everything that is done is done

a service needs to be subsidised in some way because it is an essential

agreed, by the commissioners, of course, because they are the ones who
have to pay it. Then the service is protected in that way. That is
another key

for patients without protecting the provider, because the whole point

the investment for good-quality NHS services in the future. If we do
not have a provider regime—a failure regime—that
understands where that capital will come from in the future, we starve
ourselves of investment in new plant and machinery in the health
service in the longer term. The short term—the immediate
term—is about the protection of patient services. The longer
term is about the impact that the lack of a failure regime is likely to
have on getting capital into the NHS as a public service, when we know

Dr Bennett, do you believe that the statement that the Minister, Paul

60, 64 and 65, which hold the real power in terms of competition law

There is no doubt that a lot of people were concerned that the original

ask a couple more questions of Ms Slipman about the cap on

facilities will be used by private patients; they are worried that they
may have to wait longer for treatment as a result of private patients
being treated before them. Where are the safeguards in the Bill that
will ensure we do not end up with a two-tier health service in which
someone can pay to have a hip replacement and jump the queue? Not that

               <p class="tabbed">The
safeguards are in the system itself. The first safeguard is the primary
purpose of a foundation trust, which is to serve its NHS patients. That
is covered under the terms of authorisation by Monitor, so there is 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 41<a class="bkMark" name="Column41">&#160;</a>
                  </div>a regulatory interest. If patients were not being served under the terms
of authorisation, there would be a whole range of scrutiny and overview
for the kinds of activities that hospital organisations undertake at
local level. But perhaps the most important safeguard is the elected
governors of a foundation trust, who are there to represent patients.

                  </em> We have a general concern about the concept
