welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Chope. I am sure that I say on
behalf of the whole Committee how very much we are looking forward to
your guidance in our deliberations. When I first glanced at the
membership of the Committee and saw your name beside a little
passport-sized photograph, I thought we would be in for a long, hot
summer&#151;we might still be. I then realised that you were in the
Chair, which I thought was a bit like Barcelona having Ronaldinho as
the referee rather than leading the attack.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column4" />Column number: 4</div><a name="08061787000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all
those who have been involved in the Bill&#146;s deliberations so far.
We have had extensive consultation with businesses, regulators and
those in many local authorities&#151;all of whom have contributed
extensively, for which we are grateful. The Bill was also subject to
extensive and constructive debate in the other place and it comes to us
improved by the work of colleagues there. It will change how we enforce
regulations throughout the country, and it will create an expert body
for the improvement of regulations at local level. It will create a
framework for a more targeted and proportionate sanctioning of
non-compliance with regulation, and it will assist in the reduction of
the imposition of unnecessary burdens by our regulator. I am sure that
we shall debate all such matters in significant detail over the coming
weeks, and I look forward to those
deliberations.</div><a name="08061787000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061787000452"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Prisk</b> (Hertford and Stortford) (Con): I add my
welcome to you, Mr. Chope. I know that you will provide us
with firm and fair guidance from the Chair as we consider the matters
before us. I also welcome the Minister. I am sure that we shall have a
positive dialogue, and I hope that we can provide him with some relief
from the endless debates on post office closures that have, I suspect,
been a darker period for him. I hope we can provide him with a little
relief from that in our social responsibility role on the Conservative
Benches. I welcome the fact that no knives or guillotines are contained
in the programme motion and I know that as a staunch parliamentarian,
Mr. Chope, you will welcome the fact that there are no such
limits on our ability to consider the matters in their full. That is
important because sometimes Labour Members take a heavy-handed
approach, which can limit our ability to explore the unintended
consequences of such
issues.</div><a name="08061787000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the Minister said, the Bill began in the other place and, to use his
words, it has been improved. The Government have been forced to accept
more than 12 major concessions, and I put on the record my sincere
congratulations to all the Members of the other place who participated
in that process, particularly my Conservative colleagues who engaged
actively in that scrutiny and did their job extremely well. However,
there remain some worries and the Minister referred to one or two of
them, which is why the programme motion is
important.</div><a name="08061787000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are concerns about the powers and scope of the Bill, about
accountability, about the potential for injustice in what might be seen
as a parking fine approach to regulation in part 3 and about whether
the Bill can achieve what Ministers are promising. However, given the
concessions already made in another place, my aim in the debate is to
be precise in my scrutiny and concise in my remarks, so I have no
intention or wish to oppose the
motion.</div><a name="08061787000045"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061787000453"></a><b class="B">Lorely
Burt</b> (Solihull) (LD): Last but not least, I welcome you to
the Chair this morning, Mr. Chope. I add my thanks to the
bodies that so kindly advised our team, including the CBI, the Local
Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services and the British Retail
Consortium; they have helped us tremendously in understanding some of
the practical implications of the Bill. As my Conservative colleague
said, the Bill has been much improved in the Lords. The contribution of
my colleagues in the Lords has been a valuable help in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column5" />Column number: 5</div>making the Bill stronger, so that it will balance the needs of business
with the local requirements of enforcers on the ground&#151;at the

democracy.</div><a name="08061787000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061787000051"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000455"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is a simple one, establishing the
Local Better Regulation Office as a corporate body. There are a number
of amendments tabled to the accompanying schedule 1, which sets out in
detail how LBRO is intended to be established in statute. I shall
reserve my main comments for those amendments, which attempt to alter
in various ways the establishment of LBRO. The central part of the Bill
is to establish the body, to carry out a number of functions to do with
better regulation&#151;advice to local authorities and central
Government and adjudicating in certain ways between primary and
enforcing authorities around the country. The clause is one of the
central building blocks of the Bill, establishing LBRO to further the
better regulation agenda at local
level.</div><a name="08061787000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000456"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those brief but
helpful opening remarks. He said that the clause is short, but
equally&#151;in his words&#151;it is essential. It establishes the
Local Better Regulation Office, which we will perhaps shorten to LBRO
with your permission, Mr Chope. The provision follows from the Hampton
review, which looked at the whole way in which risk-based regulation
should proceed. It is, in essence, the Government response to the need
for raising quality and improving the narrowing wide variance in how
local authority regulatory services
operate.</div><a name="08061787000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are looking at not just trading standards, but environmental health and
matters such as licensing. There are several concerns, not least the
fact that we are being asked to believe that a single
organisation&#151;a reasonably small organisation&#151;will be able
to deliver a significant change in regulatory practice for nearly
500 different local authorities. Effecting the kind of
improvements that Ministers seek, especially for the worst regulators,
would need, in my view and the view of many of those involved, a
considerable change in the internal management, training and culture of
those organisations. We are being asked to agree to a small 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column6" />Column number: 6</div>organisation taking on what is a very significant task. My question to
the Minister, therefore, is how will the LBRO deliver that change to so
many different
organisations?</div><a name="08061787000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000457"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to
respond?</div><a name="08061787000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000458"></a>Mr.
McFadden</b> <i class="I">indicated
dissent.</i></div>
<a name="08061787000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000459"></a>The
Chairman:</b> It is not compulsory. If the Minister does not
rise I presume that he will not be responding and we shall move
on.</div>
<a name="08061787000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000460"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I was rather anticipating that as a question was
asked from the Opposition Benches, the Minister might provide an
answer. I hope that he will be able to do
so.</div>
<a name="08061787000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000461"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to elucidate further upon LBRO and
how it will do its job. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to root
the discussion in the Hampton report, which was carried out three years
ago. Hampton identified two basic problems in local better regulation.
The first was inconsistency. Different advice was being given to
businesses operating around the country; a business might get a green
light in one local authority area, but a red light in another. Hampton
found that to be costly and cumbersome to business. The second major
flaw he identified was inflexibility in how regulation was enforced,
particularly in the penalty regime. That applies more to part 3 than to
clause 1, but those were the two issues that Hampton
identified.</div>
<a name="08061787000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our response
is to establish the Local Better Regulation Office. The hon. Gentleman
is right: local authority regulators sit at the centre of a complex
system. His question is: how will a small organisation deal with the
two quite major issues that Hampton identified? The first thing that I
point him to is the board of LBRO. The LBRO has already been
established as a company and a board has been appointed, and I hope he
agrees that the board represents significant expertise from local
authority, trading standards and business backgrounds. That expertise
will be of significant help in enabling the LBRO to deliver its
aims.</div>
<a name="08061787000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LBRO will
work closely with national regulators, local authorities and
businesses, seeking their assistance and co-operation in delivering
better regulation. It has a relatively small budget of about
&#163;4.5 million a year, but part of that will enable it to provide
a level of financial support and assistance to local authorities in
carrying out those functions. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that
it is a relatively small organisation, but it will occupy a pivotal
role at the centre of a complex system of regulation. The expertise of
the board and the work it will do with all the different
players&#151;regulators, local authorities and businesses&#151;will
enable LBRO to carry out the job that we hope it will
do.</div>
<a name="08061787000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000462"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for going into the
background. What I am trying to tease out is a practical issue that I
have a degree of scepticism about&#151;the practical reality of a
single, small organisation being able to effect cultural change in
nearly 500 organisations. The Minister is a former special adviser to
the former Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. I think the phrase
used by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column7" />Column number: 7</div>Mr. Blair in those days was that he had the scars on his back
from trying to effect change in Whitehall. The Minister will therefore
be acutely aware of the difficulty in achieving the kind of change that
I suspect he, most of business and I want to see. Does he recognise
that it will be a significant challenge, and is he confident that the
resources and powers in the Bill are
sufficient?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000463"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I recognise the challenge. My old boss, the
former Prime Minister, was referring to the great Whitehall machine
when he talked about having scars on his back. In the Bill, what we are
talking about is important but in a different way. It is about how
local authorities and organisations enforce regulation. The challenge
for LBRO is to ensure that the two weaknesses identified by
Mr. Hampton, those of inconsistency and inflexibility which
I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, can be dealt with. Not all of that
is done through the clause and we will go on to talk about the
different powers that the LBRO uses to carry out its
functions.</div>
<a name="08061787000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe
that it should be an organisation with teeth and I welcome the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s indication that he agrees with that. Some of the
amendments before us might, if passed, reduce the LBRO&#146;s powers
to be effective and could leave us with a weaker organisation. I do not
want that to happen. The message from business is very important.
Business wants to see clarity and consistency in the enforcement of
regulation. It is one thing to have a debate about the substance of a
regulation and whether it is necessary, but it is another to lack
clarity about how that will be enforced in different parts of the
country. That issue is an essential part of LBRO&#146;s
work.</div>
<a name="08061787000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it
is not just about how LBRO works at local level. An important part of
its job will be to speak to the regulators and to central Government
about the regulations. It is not only an &#147;eyes downward&#148;
organisation at local level; it has an important upward voice. The
Government believe that currently there is a gap there, which LBRO will
be able to fill. It has an important role, both in advising central
Government and in ensuring consistency in the application of regulation
at local level.</div>
<a name="08061787000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000464"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister; it has been a useful
exchange. Clearly, the LBRO is one of the principal elements of the
Bill, and all the powers and subsequent clauses in part 1 relate to
whether it will be able to fulfil its task. I remain sceptical about
its ability to fulfil that role, but I hope that it achieves it. I hope
that the Minister&#146;s sunny optimism will be proven right and I
would be more than happy to&#151;I was going to say buy him a pint of
Guinness, which perhaps after Friday&#146;s marvellous result would
be even more appropriate. I am happy to be proven wrong, but at the
moment I am not entirely convinced. However, the clause is there and I
am grateful to the Minister for putting on the record the
Government&#146;s confidence in the ability of LBRO to do this with
the resources and powers that it has. On that note, I will delay the
Committee no further.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000469"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> These are probing amendments and seek to put
certain details on the record, which I hope will enable the
implementation of the legislation to be improved. Amendment No. 17
seeks to delete subsection (3) on page 38. Its purpose is to ask the
Minister what we mean by Welsh Ministers. Are they members of the Welsh
Executive, Ministers of the Crown, or both?</div>
<a name="08061787000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
18 is another probing amendment, which relates to paragraph 3(5) of the
schedule. It
states:</div><a name="08061787000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;LBRO
is to pay to or in respect of the ordinary members such sums as the
Secretary of State may determine by way of or in respect of
remuneration allowances, expenses, pensions or
gratuities.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061787000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not entirely clear
what that text means; perhaps there is an additional or a missing word,
or a typographical error. I am not sure, but I shall be happy if the
Minister would clarify that. I have three or four different
interpretations of it, and I would be interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s reply as to whether there is an additional
&#147;to&#148; in
there.</div><a name="08061787000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly,
amendment No. 19, relating to paragraph 3(6),
reads:</div><a name="08061787000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
the Secretary of State thinks that there are special circumstances that
make it right for a person ceasing to be an ordinary member of LBRO to
receive compensation, LBRO must pay to that person such compensation as
the Secretary of State may
determine.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can
the Minister explain what he regards as those &#147;special
circumstances&#148;?</div><a name="08061787000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000470"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am a little confused by these amendments. I am not
entirely sure why the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford maintains
that they would make enforcement more effective by taking out any rules
regarding how the LBRO should be composed. If amendment No. 18 means
that LBRO members would not be civil servants, why does he want to
delete
that?</div><a name="08061787000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000471"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> These are entirely probing amendments. I have no
wish to delete them, and it is not my wish to move them. My purpose is
clarification of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061787000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000472"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> That is fine. I wait with bated breath what the
Minister has to say in
response.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column9" />Column number: 9</div><a name="08061787000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000473"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We had a debate about the basic purpose of LBRO,
and schedule 1 gives significant detail on how the organisation is
proposed to be established and run. I shall briefly answer a couple of
the questions asked directly by the hon. Member for Hertford and
Stortford. The term &#147;Welsh Ministers&#148; means members of
the Welsh Executive.</div>
<a name="08061787000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">He asked
about the wording in paragraph 3(5) of the schedule. As I understand
it, this is absolutely standard wording for describing payments to
people doing this kind of work, so we see nothing unusual about that
wording. The whole schedule is designed to give effect to LBRO and to
enable it to carry out its work, in seeking to support local
authorities in developing an approach consistent with the principles of
better regulation.</div>
<a name="08061787000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
schedule&#151;or rather, the Bill&#151;will, as well as the
functions that we have talked about, also help to give LBRO a role in
preparing lists of priorities for enforcement for local government,
which can be an issue, given the number of different priorities that
central Government gives. In terms of the specifics of the amendments,
I am glad to see that they were probing, because the effect of
approving the amendments would be to neuter the body from the
beginning, so I hope that the answers that I have been able to give on
the subjects of payment and Welsh Ministers have been
helpful.</div>
<a name="08061787000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me turn
to the third of the amendments, amendment No. 19, which asks about
&#147;special circumstances&#148;. We have deliberately set up the
body to operate independently of Government, bringing the expertise of
its members to bear on issues raised by local authority enforcement.
The wording of &#147;special circumstances&#148; follows well
established precedents, and I shall mention just a few. For example,
similar measures were included in relation to board members of Natural
England in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The
Value Added Tax Act 1994 specified that there can be
compensation:</div><a name="08061787000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If
a person ceases to be a chairman of VAT tribunals and it appears to the
Lord Chancellor that there are special circumstances which make it
right that he should receive
compensation&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is similar wording in the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The Bill follows
those models and provides for the possibility of cases where the
provision of some form of compensation is appropriate. Such
circumstances would be
rare.</div><a name="08061787000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I can clarify things for the hon. Gentleman. We do not
believe that there should be a presumption for compensation to be paid.
That is why &#147;special&#148; is used. Board members will come to
the end of their contract naturally or could be removed for any of the
other reasons set out in the schedule, including committing a criminal
offence or failing to comply with the terms of their appointment. In
the vast majority of cases, it would not be right for compensation to
be paid. However, it seems prudent to us for the Bill to allow for
unknown contingencies. The reasons for that inclusion means that we
have used &#147;special&#148; to describe circumstances in which
compensation might be paid. I hope that that helps to clarify the
point.</div><a name="08061787000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000474"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for providing those
clarifications. As he knows&#151;I know you know, Mr.
Chope&#151;one of the purposes of probing amendments is not
necessarily to change the legislation, but to make sure that those
putting it into practice understand the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column10" />Column number: 10</div>Government&#146;s intention. Often the Bill cannot provide that.
Therefore, the purpose of the three probing amendments and of a good
number of others is to use our deliberation to get that clarification
on the
record.</div><a name="08061787000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful about amendments Nos. 17 and 18. I am particularly grateful
for the recognition and clear statement that there should be no
presumption about payments under sub-paragraph 3(6). On that
basis&#151;the hon. Member for Solihull can unbate her
breath&#151;I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061787000089"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000475"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 20, in
schedule 1, page 39, line 39, leave
out subsection
(1).</div><a name="08061787000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000476"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 21, in schedule 1,

(2).</div><a name="08061787000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.
22, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000477"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> These are, again, probing amendments&#151;bated
breath or otherwise. Let us look at page 39, dealing with paragraph 8,
on committees surrounding the operation of LBRO. Amendment No. 20
removes the provision for LBRO to establish &#147;one or more
committees&#148;. The provision is perfectly reasonable, but it would
be helpful to know the Government&#146;s intention or wish concerning
the scope of those committees. It would help us to know the
limits.</div><a name="08061787000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 21 is similar. It seeks to delete sub-paragraph
(2):</div><a name="08061787000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
committee established under this paragraph may include persons who are
neither members nor employees of
LBRO.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause permits anyone to be on such a committee and, as we learn later,
that is a paid position. Money comes from the public purse. Who
appoints? What will the basis of those appointments
be?</div><a name="08061787000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 22 is about paragraph 8(4), which is at the top of page
40:</div><a name="08061787000392"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;LBRO
may pay sums by way of or in respect of expenses to or in respect of a
person who is a member of a committee or of a sub-committee established
under this paragraph but who is not a member or employee of
LBRO.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is a wide statement. Given the heightened public interest in expenses,
to what are the rules for those arrangements subject? What independent
oversight might there be, should things go
awry?</div><a name="08061787000422"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08061787000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000478"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The amendments relate to the capacity of the
Local Better Regulation Office to appoint sub-committees. One example
of an important sub-committee that one would expect an organisation
like this to appoint is an audit committee. We would also hope to allow
the appointment of expert advisers to that committee and to pay its
members. This is an independent body, operating at arm&#146;s length
from the Government, and it needs that independence to create the right
governance arrangements for its statutory role. If I may refer to
similar organisations and parallels in other legislation, both the
Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, created by the
Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, and the Serious
Organised 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column11" />Column number: 11</div>Crime Agency, created by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act
2005, have similar powers to create
committees.</div><a name="08061787000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
LBRO will not necessarily stop with an audit committee; it might wish
to appoint an advisory committee, to advise it on issues raised by one
or more of its functions. It should be a matter for the LBRO to decide
whether it wishes to go down that road, but it may set up committees
that will help it achieve its objectives. I hope that that gives some
clarity on the purpose of the measure.</div>
<a name="08061787000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman asked a couple of specific questions. LBRO itself would
appoint the individuals. Payments would be governed by the usual public
money rules. As will be discussed later, LBRO has to account to both my
Department and Parliament for its expenditure in the normal way. It has
been granted a budget for the next few years, pending the approval of
the legislation in Parliament, but any expenditure on paying people on
its committees will have to come out of that
budget.</div>
<a name="08061787000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000479"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for responding. I
have no wish to try to instruct the LBRO in advance regarding specific
committees. Our purpose is to clarify exactly how this will work and
what recourse there would be for Government, and thence Parliament, to
ensure that it is operating in an effective way. I am not overwhelmed
by the Minister&#146;s response. I accept that there is an
established principle and I presume that Nolan was the process that he
was referring to as regards public deliberation. I do not know whether
he wishes to consider that. I have no wish to press the amendment to a
vote because I am well aware that it would prove a nonsense, but it
would be helpful if the Minister reflected on clarifying which
particular rules he refers to and whether he feels able to consider any
advice that may be forthcoming. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061787000102"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,
by leave, withdrawn.</i></div>
<a name="08061787000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000480"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in
schedule 1, page 41, line 2, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;no later than 30 days after its
receipt&#146;.</div><a name="08061787000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000481"></a>The

amendment No. 24, in
schedule 1, page 41, line 25, at
end insert</div> <div class="hs_brev">&#145;no later than 30 days after its
receipt&#146;.</div><a name="08061787000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000482"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> These two amendments deal with our ability to hold
the LBRO to account. Members of the Committee will realise that the
annual report of the LBRO is the principal document that the House will
have in order to consider the performance of the organisation that the
Bill establishes. I am trying to ensure that our scrutiny is timely. I
therefore wish to insert a phrase to both paragraph 12(5) and paragraph
13(6). Paragraph 12(5) of the schedule
states:</div><a name="08061787000106"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of Sate must lay before Parliament a copy of each
report&#148;</div><a name="08061787000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">&#151;that
is, the annual
report&#151;</div><a name="08061787000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;received
under sub-paragraph (2)(a).&#148;</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column12" />Column number: 12</div><a name="08061787000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment would
insert the
phrase,</div><a name="08061787000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
later than 30 days after its
receipt.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that it is not the intention of Ministers to unduly or
deliberately lay such documents significantly later than
that&#151;six months or a year or so&#151;but if we are to
scrutinise these matters as a House, it is important that we have the
documentation within a reasonable time. I think that 30 days is a
perfectly reasonable time within which we could expect those documents
to be forthcoming. If scrutiny is to be effective, it must be timely. I
hope that the Minister will treat the amendments in a positive way, as
these are matters that should be pressed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000483"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> After listening to the argument made by the hon.
Member for Hertford and Stortford, it seems entirely appropriate that
the laying of the report before Parliament should be timebound. I will
be pleased to support the measure, and perhaps the Minister could see
his way to incorporating it within the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08061787000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000484"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The amendments are, quite fairly, concerned with
ensuring that there is no undue delay in laying the accounts before
Parliament. As the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford noted, the
relevant section of the schedule says:</div>
<a name="08061787000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State must lay before Parliament a copy of each certified
statement and report
received&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments add a time limit on the Minister&#146;s duty to lay a copy
of the LBRO accounts before Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. In
principle, we recognise the importance of timing in the interests of
proper public accountability. The hon. Gentleman said that scrutiny was
improved with speed&#151;perhaps that was not quite the word, but
certainly without undue delay&#151;and our intention is for copies to
be placed in the House as soon as the accounts have been signed off by
the auditor. However, in practice, such time limits laid down in
statute are uncommon. Although the hon. Gentleman is right to say that
there should be no undue delay, it is accuracy that is ultimately
important. The Government hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press
the amendment, as a statutory deadline might work against the
overriding objective of accuracy.</div>
<a name="08061787000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">The wording
of the amendment might unintentionally create inflexibility. The
requirement to air the accounts in this way might mean that they could
only be made available on dates when the House is sitting. That might
make a 30-day deadline difficult to meet, for example, if accounts were
presented early in the recess. We could even inadvertently cause a
delay as we may need to refuse them in order not to fall foul of the
statutory requirement. I am sure that that is not the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s intention, but the way that it might fall could
inadvertently slow the process down.</div>
<a name="08061787000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In previous
debates I referred to a couple of precedents, and I hope that the
Committee will bear with me if I do so again. For example, the Natural
Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006, which set up Natural
England, does not set time limits for the agency&#146;s accounts to
be laid before Parliament. The Education (Schools) Act 1992, which set
up Ofsted, also specified no time period for laying the chief
inspector&#146;s report before Parliament. I sympathise with the
intent behind the amendment. The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford

<div class="Column"><a name="Column13" />Column number: 13</div>is absolutely right: there should not be undue delay in these matters
and the Government do want to see accounts dealt with
promptly.</div>
<a name="08061787000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000485"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The Minister says that he accepts the principle
behind the amendment. If the Government are willing to bring forward a
different time period, or an adjustment in the words, I would be happy
to withdraw the amendment. It may be that actually, the Minister does
not want any time limit at
all.</div>
<a name="08061787000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000486"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I cannot promise the hon. Gentleman that I will
bring forward a different time limit. While he is right to stress that
the accounts should be laid before Parliament as soon as possible, the
overriding objective must be accuracy and I would resist putting a
number of days in the Bill. I hope that he will not press the
amendment. If he does, I would ask my colleagues to resist him for that
reason. However, I understand exactly his point about the desirability
of avoiding undue delay. That is certainly the Government&#146;s
objective, but we also have the overriding objective of making sure
that the accounts are
right.</div><a name="08061787000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061787000487"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): My hon. Friend will be
asking us to vote no to a time limit. He has given a list of other Acts
of Parliament that have a similar requirement with no time limit. Has a
rule, a convention, a practice or a rule of thumb been developed under
which there is a time that Departments aim for when they submit such
documents to
Parliament?</div><a name="08061787000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000488"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend asks whether there is an informal
rule outside 30 days. We certainly try to deal with matters each year
before we go into recess. We do not do so by a number of days, but we
try to avoid undue delay. The precedents that I quoted in respect of
Ofsted and Natural England do not have such time limits. I completely
agree with the sentiment of avoiding undue delay, but to put a number
of days in the Bill might lead us, for the reasons that I have
explained, to unintended consequences. I hope that accuracy would be
accepted as the main objective, and if the accounts are accurate there
should certainly be no undue delay in tabling
them.</div><a name="08061787000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061787000489"></a><b class="B">Judy
Mallaber</b> (Amber Valley) (Lab): In the event that the
reports or accounts were published at the start of the summer recess.
and thus would not be before Parliament for a period, would they still
be published in some form so that people could see them or would that
have to wait until Parliament sits
again?</div><a name="08061787000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000490"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My fear is that the effect of the amendment
would be that if the accounts were coming to us shortly before the
summer recess, we might say that we do not have the 30 days and that it
would be better to receive them after the summer recess. That would
cause an inadvertent and unintentional delay. I absolutely respect and
agree that there should not be undue delay, but I am not quite sure
that setting down a time limit of 30 days is the correct way to ensure
that.</div><a name="08061787000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000491"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister and hon. Members for
the debate because it is important that we can ensure that our scrutiny
is effective. The presentation  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column14" />Column number: 14</div>of documents to this place must therefore be timely. To say that
something is uncommon is one of the weakest arguments that I have come
across. It is uncommon, dare I say it, for England to win the World
cup, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a bad
thing&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I shall leave that to
the Scots to debate among themselves. I have veered into dangerous
territory. The fact that something is uncommon does not mean that it is
bad. That was a fascinating but rather irrelevant
argument.</div><a name="08061787000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that he recognised the merit of the fact that we need to
have documentation in a timely way. I do not buy the argument that
somehow inaccuracy will result. We are discussing the annual report
that the LBRO is required to present to the Secretary of State. We are
not talking about a time limit for the LBRO to get its accounts right,
but the time from when the Secretary of State receives the documents
and when he or she decides to place them in the Library of the House of
Commons. The accuracy argument does not work. It might work if it was
about 30 days for the preparation of the accounts. That is a perfectly
legitimate argument, but it does not work in the context under
discussion.</div><a name="08061787000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise fully that 30 days is not a perfect answer, but I accept that
quite understandably Ministers wish to have no trammels on their
ability to act. However, we should not simply accept that. The hon.
Gentleman is an honourable man. I am sure that it would be his wish and
intention to present the documents in time, but we might not
necessarily be dealing with him. We need to think of future Ministers
and other circumstances, and need to ensure that the House can pursue
its scrutiny effectively. Unless he can offer me something that would
show recognition with a time limit perhaps on Report, it is not my
intention to withdraw the
amendments.</div><a name="08061787000423"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.15
am</div><a name="08061787000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000492"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> The debate has raised an interesting point, and I
am as surprised as the hon. Gentleman that major bodies, such as Ofsted
and Natural England, send reports to the Secretary of State, who then
apparently has no time limit at all in which to lay them before
Parliament. That is a serious omission in Parliament&#146;s
administration. If we think of something such as a Select Committee
report, Ministers are required by convention, rather than a rule, to
reply within two months. That would perhaps get us over the
Minister&#146;s main objection about recesses. Does the hon.
Gentleman think that if he presses the amendment to a vote in the
Committee, whatever the result, maybe the Procedure Committee ought to
be looking more generally at all such reports and a time scale for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000508"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 46, in
schedule 2, page 43, line 30, leave
out paragraph
3.</div><a name="08061787000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is purely a probing amendment, so we seek not to delete, but to
clarify. Paragraph 3 relates to matters of tax, including stamp duty
land tax. Can the Minister tell us whether the effect of the paragraph
is intended to be
retrospective?</div><a name="08061787000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000509"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> As the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford
says, the provision is about the tax treatment of the LBRO as it
becomes a statutory body. We are keen to make the transfer from the
operation as a private company to a statutory body as smooth as
possible. The creation of LBRO as a company last year has enabled a lot
of good preparatory work to be done to make it ready for that
transition. However, the Bill needs to provide for transfers to the
statutory corporation when it comes into existence, and that involves
the transfer of property, which would have tax consequences, whether
through income or corporation tax, or stamp duty.</div>
<a name="08061787000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The transfer
of assets and liabilities from the LBRO company to the LBRO could
result in inappropriate tax consequences for the transferor or
transferee, which would arise solely because of the transfer. For
example, property transferred for no consideration could be treated as
transferred at market value for capital gains purposes. Paragraph 3
addresses those consequences by providing tax neutrality. It ensures
that a transfer will not give rise to a tax change or confer a tax
advantage on either the transferor or the transferee. This is about
ensuring that the transition between the private company and a
statutory body can operate without unintended tax consequences. In
terms of retrospection, I am not clear what the hon. Gentleman is
driving at, given that we are talking about a transfer that is to take
place if the Bill is approved by Parliament. The schedule deals with
the tax implications of the transfer at the point that it takes
place.</div><a name="08061787000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000510"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> My concern is that the LBRO company will engage in
a series of activities, assets and so on, possibly including real
estate, which would, on transfer 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column16" />Column number: 16</div>to the new body, create a potential tax liability&#151;stamp duty land
tax being the obvious example. Many of those taxes relate to the change
in value from the original purchase. Does the measure address the
liability at the point of transfer solely, or is it concerned with the
tax matters since the incorporation of the LBRO company, and thus
retrospective?</div>
<a name="08061787000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000511"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My understanding is that there should not be an
issue with the change in value of assets that the hon. Gentleman
describes. I am happy to give him further detail about that, but the
schedule deals with assets at the point of transfer. That is the key
point. The schedule seeks to avoid unintentional or unwelcome tax
consequences that could arise as the result of a move from a private
company to a statutory
body.</div>
<a name="08061787000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000512"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It is a hideously complex prospect, but one that it
is important to clarify. I am grateful to the Minister for offering to
write to me and, I presume, the Committee members, to clarify the
matter. I appreciate that it may be something that is beyond his
immediate knowledge. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

No. 1 would insert a new paragraph (d) to clause 5. Its purpose is
expressly to include Hampton principles in the LBRO&#146;s
objectives. The reason goes back to the origins of the Bill, namely,
the Hampton review of regulatory enforcement. The principles include
co-ordination, consistency of regulatory enforcement, a risk-based
approach&#151;targeting the rogues and not the individual who has
made the odd error&#151;and, most important, securing compliance with
rules rather than just chasing prosecution. Those principles are
supported by Opposition Members and by many businesses. Indeed, the
amendment has the support of a number of businesses and their
representatives, including the British Retail Consortium. Although I
appreciate that subsection (2) lists some of those principles, it is
neither explicit nor complete. The amendment would strengthen the
clause, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s reply as to
why he thinks the reverse, or whether in fact he is only too delighted
to accept the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000514"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I am happy to support the Conservative amendment. It
seems a sensible way of strengthening the intentions of the
Bill.</div>
<a name="08061787000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000515"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Clause 5 is important as it sets out the
principles of better regulation to which the LBRO will have regard. As
the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford mentioned, subsection (2)
sets out its functions stating that</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column17" />Column number: 17</div><a name="08061787000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulatory
activities should be carried out in a way which is transparent,
accountable, proportionate and consistent...targeted only at cases
in which action is
needed&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
of us with history in such debates are familiar with those five
principles, which have become an important part of the policy framework
regarding better regulation. The amendment deals specifically with the
regulators compliance code, recently issued under section 22 of the
Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The scope of the code in
respect of local authorities coincides closely with parts 1 and 2 of
the Bill. It applies to local authorities in their exercise of trading
standards, environmental health, licensing and fire safety functions.
The LBRO will, therefore, take an interest in the performance of local
authorities when delivering its duties under the code.</div>
<a name="08061787000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
including a provision in the Bill that requires LBRO to ensure that
local authorities act in accordance with it could cause confusion for
businesses and local authorities. Although I understand the intention
behind the amendment, its effect would be to place local authorities
under two contradictory legal obligations. The provisions in section 21
of the 2006 Act and the legislative and regulatory functions order
under which the code was issued, require local authorities to have
regard to the code. Legally, that means that in certain circumstances,
a local authority can take the code into account but decide not to
apply it.</div>
<a name="08061787000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
1 would require LBRO to ensure that local authorities act in accordance
with the code. Under that requirement, the circumstances in which a
local authority could decide not to apply it are limited almost to
none. It would be undesirable to have those two contradictory legal
requirements running side by side.</div>
<a name="08061787000164"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000516"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I would like to clarify something. Subsection
(2)(b)
says</div><a name="08061787000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulatory
activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed&#148;.</div>
<a name="08061787000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it the
Government&#146;s intention&#151;this may be helpful in the debate,
certainly to those who are concerned about the matter&#151;that the
measure would seek to implement the full Hampton-compliant, risk-based
approach?</div>
<a name="08061787000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000517"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Certainly, these are known as the Hampton
principles. They are an important guide for regulators and Government
in framing regulation. My point and, to use more colloquial language,
the Government&#146;s view is that subsections 2(a) and (b) cover
what should guide the functions of LBRO under the clause. Our problem
is that amendment No. 1 would have local authorities not only having
regard to LBRO, but acting in accordance with it, which would present
them with two potentially contradictory legal requirements running side
by side. It would require them to do that bit more by amending the
objectives of a different body altogether. I am not sure that is the
best way to
legislate.</div><a name="08061787000424"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000518"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> Is the Minister saying that the Government believe
that, together, subsections (1) and (2) would require local authorities
to be wholly compliant with Hampton? Is that correct or not? If it is
correct, it would be immensely helpful.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column18" />Column number: 18</div><a name="08061787000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000519"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The provision requires local authorities to
conduct their business according to the five principles set out in the
clause. I hope that I have been helpful to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="08061787000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000520"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I think that we have got there in the end. The
purpose of the amendment was to establish explicitly what would happen.
I fully understand that subsection (2)(a) on the key points of
transparency, accountability, proportionality and consistency is
important, but the risk-based issue is unclear under subsection (2)(b).
Several businesses that will be affected by the provision have wanted
matters clarified. The Minister may have just provided that clarity,
and I am grateful to him for that. In a charitable sense, I say that
the hon. Gentleman has made progress by covering such matters, and I
beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08061787000170"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000521"></a>Lorely

clause 5, page 3, line 42, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) regulatory
activities should be carried out on the basis of a risk assessment of

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000522"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 50, in
clause 13, page 7, line 9, at
end add&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) regulatory
activities should be carried out on the basis of a risk assessment of
the regulated person which should include their propensity to comply
with the
regulation.&#146;.</div><a name="08061787000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000523"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> The Hampton review recommended that all regulatory
activity should be based on a clear, comprehensive risk assessment. The
LBRO should have the power to ensure that any sanctions or inspections
should follow a risk assessment via the regulator or local authority.
If they target those that present high risks, it would give more
freedom to target rogue traders. It would free up resources and it
would reward compliant companies with a light-touch regime, which is
the reasoning behind the
amendment.</div><a name="08061787000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000524"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We are in similar territory to that of the
previous amendment. Under clause 5, LBRO is required to secure that
local authorities exercise their functions in a way that is effective,
does not give rise to unnecessary problems and complies with the five
principles under subsection (2) that we discussed a moment or two ago.
They are the principles of better regulation, which inform policy in
such areas, and they are becoming increasingly integrated into the
legislative framework for regulators. They feature, for example, in
Ofcom&#146;s primary legislation and many regulators are required
to have regard to them under the Regulatory Reform Act
2001.</div><a name="08061787000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree with the hon. Lady that the assessment of risk should be at the
heart of regulatory activity, but so should many other commendable
practices, such as giving clear advice to those who are subject to
regulation and others, too. I am not sure that it is wise to single out
this particular issue when the principles of good regulation already
address the point. In particular, subsection (2)(b) says:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column19" />Column number: 19</div><a name="08061787000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;regulatory
activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is
needed.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
key ideas behind the five principles are probably targeting and
proportionality, reflecting the view that regulation should be based on
an assessment of risk. The Better Regulation Task Force publication
&#147;Principles of Good Regulation&#148; expanded on the
principles and on the best means of implementing them in practice. The
guidance covers the issues raised in the amendments, and it may help
the hon. Lady if I quote from it. The guidance says that targeting, for
instance, demands that enforcers
should</div><a name="08061787000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;focus
primarily on those whose activities give rise to the most serious
risks.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue is therefore covered in Government guidance.
</div><a name="08061787000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
inclusion of the principles in clauses 5 and 13 deals with the issue
raised in the amendments and makes them unnecessary. I hope that that
gives the hon. Lady some reassurance that a risk-based approach is very
much built into clause 5.</div>
<a name="08061787000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000525"></a>Lorely

where else in the Bill I should seek reassurance that the risk-based
approach is included. With that reassurance, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000526"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Clauses 6 and 7 are important to the functioning
of the LBRO, so I hope that the Committee will not mind if I delay it
for a short time to set out some of the issues.</div>
<a name="08061787000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6
gives the LBRO the power to issue guidance to local authorities setting
out how they should exercise their relevant functions. Once again, the
clause requires authorities to &#147;have regard&#148; to guidance
given under it. It will give the LBRO the right to disseminate best
practice on the full range of trading standards, environmental health,
licensing and fire safety regulations that come within the scope of
part 1. That will be critical to the LBRO&#146;s objective of
promoting better regulation at a local level.</div>
<a name="08061787000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means,
for example, that the LBRO could issue guidance to all local
authorities regarding best practice in implementing legislation on
trading standards. It could also issue guidance to a select number of
local authorities regarding their approach to the implementation of
risk-based regulatory enforcement, which we have just discussed.
Equally, it could issue guidance to one authority regarding its
approach to encouraging compliance among small businesses. Before the
LBRO can issue guidance, however, the clause requires it to consult
business or business representatives, local authorities and such other
persons as it considers appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column20" />Column number: 20</div><a name="08061787000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">That guidance
function is important and goes beyond the referee or arbitration
function, which I am sure that we will discuss in part 2. Indeed, one
of the key reasons for setting up the LBRO is that there is currently a
gap in the provision of sufficiently clear guidance to local
authorities about how legislation is to be interpreted and enforced.
The clause is therefore important.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000529"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks on
clause 6. They are also relevant to clause 7, so it is helpful to have
them on the record.</div>
<a name="08061787000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7
gives the LBRO the power not merely to offer local authorities
guidance, which the Minister referred to, but to direct them. As such,
it creates a significant precedent: namely, that a public body that is
not directly accountable to this House can direct any of our local
authorities in relation to more than 140 enactments. If Committee
members have not yet had the chance, it would be worth looking at
schedule 3 on page 44, which shows the number of pieces of legislation
that we are dealing with. The gamut of legislation ranges widely
through employment, criminal justice, the environment, animal welfare,
antisocial behaviour, licensing, local government, mining and office
arrangements.</div><a name="08061787000201"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000530"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right that a large number
of enactments are listed under schedule 3. It is important to clarify
for the Committee that those encompass the key functions of local
authorities with regard to regulation. They could be brought together
under the headings of trading standards, environmental health,
licensing and fire safety. Schedule 3 is the Government&#146;s way of
illustrating the enactments that cover the key headings for local
authority enforcement. There is coherence in what is encompassed by
schedule 3.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column21" />Column number: 21</div><a name="08061787000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000531"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful for that information. The Minister is
right to say that it is a helpful list. That is why I wanted to draw it
to the attention of the Committee. There is a natural assumption that
we are dealing with the Bill before us and no other legislation.
However, we are dealing with a series of Acts that deal with the
involvement of local authorities. My point is that the Bill has
wide-reaching implications and that it could undermine local
democracy.</div><a name="08061787000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
proposal has understandably attracted considerable concern, not least
when it was debated in the other place. It was notable that not just
peers from my party, but those from all parties represented on the
Committee and from the Cross Benches expressed their concern about the
potential effect of the Bill. Lord Eccles rightly questioned Ministers
about the reasoning behind the unprecedented nature of this
step.</div><a name="08061787000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
the benefit of the Committee, I will clarify what has happened in this
area. As I understand it, to date directions have been Executive orders
made by Ministers, usually as a last resort and limited to
administrative matters. Those Ministers are directly accountable to
this House. I have no problem with that process because it is targeted
and
accountable.</div><a name="08061787000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
response to the criticism of this measure, Ministers in the other place
argued that it is not a precedent. They argued that the food Act
established the rules in this matter. That Act allows the Food
Standards Agency to issue directions to local authorities about the
implementation of that Act. To date, the FSA has issued a code of
practice concerning EU and UK regulations, but no direction has been
issued. Such arguments that have been put forward by Ministers are
therefore
incorrect.</div><a name="08061787000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
food Act is very different from the Bill before us. It permits
directions only about the law. The Bill will permit the LBRO to direct
all of our local authorities with regard to its guidance. That is a
very different matter. In my view the situation is compounded by the
LBRO being largely untested as it is a new organisation and its
guidance being unpublished. We have no means of judging how its
directions might work, yet we are being asked to grant the power in
advance.</div><a name="08061787000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings me to the amendments. In some ways, I would prefer to delete the
clause altogether, but we try on the Conservative Benches to be
positive and to improve legislation where we can. I am offering the
Minister a compromise. Instead of simply scrapping the clause,
amendments Nos. 2 to 11 would switch the power of direction back into
the hands of the Secretary of State. That would at least create proper
accountability, given that the powers potentially affect every one of
our local authorities in relation to 140 different pieces of
legislation.</div>
<a name="08061787000425"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="08061787000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a positive set of amendments. I look forward to hearing the Minister
explain why the power of direction is needed and why, for the first
time, a non-departmental public body is being granted such a power in
advance.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000532"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I tabled an amendment to delete the clause, but
although the amendments are something of a compromise in transferring
the LBRO powers to the Secretary of State, I would be happy to support
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column22" />Column number: 22</div>hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford if he decided to press them to a
Division. It is fair to say that none of us is happy with giving
directive powers to non-elected bodies over elected bodies&#151;in
other words, over local authorities.</div>
<a name="08061787000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 6
gives the LBRO the power to issue guidance to local authorities on the
exercise of their regulatory functions. Local authorities are required
to have regard to such guidance. In addition, every local authority has
to have a published enforcement policy, and will be required to comply
with the new statutory regulations compliance code, which requires them
to exercise their regulatory functions in a clear, proportionate and
transparent manner. We therefore believe that clause 7 is not
necessary.</div>
<a name="08061787000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a local
authority does not pay due regard to the guidance issued by the LBRO, a
range of mechanisms are already available to the LBRO, another local
authority or a regulated person or entity in order to hold them to
account for any failure. Those mechanisms include legal appeal
mechanisms if the failure results in any form of enforcement action,
and the corporate complaint procedures that every local authority is
required to publish; and there is the independent local
ombudsman.</div>
<a name="08061787000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 7 was
amended in the other place to add subsection (4), which requires
directions that affect more than one local authority to be subject to
the negative procedure; it also added subsection (5)(a), which requires
the LBRO to consult the local authority that it intends to direct
before issuing the direction. Under subsections (2) and (3), the LBRO
must obtain the consent of the Secretary of State or Welsh Ministers
before issuing a direction.</div>
<a name="08061787000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, none
of those safeguards alters the fact that, because local authorities
have to have regard to LBRO guidance under clause 6, the possibility of
issuing directions will arise only if authorities have good reason for
acting differently. It is most likely to arise if the authority feels
that the LBRO guidance runs counter to its statutory obligations. The
power could therefore give rise to lengthy legal difficulties over
whether its guidance can take precedence over an Act of
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08061787000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000533"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I begin by agreeing with the hon. Member for
Hertford and Stortford that clauses 6 and 7 go together and are
probably best seen in the same light. Our discussion takes me back to
the first question that the hon. Gentleman asked this morning, which
was whether I and the Government were confident that a relatively small
organisation such as LBRO would have the teeth to do the job. That is
what clause 7 is about.</div>
<a name="08061787000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">One obviously
believes that guidance will mostly be observed, but if not the question
is whether there should be a power to issue directions in some
circumstances. It is intended to be a backstop power that might be
used, for example, where one or more local authorities persistently
disregard a particular piece of guidance to the detriment of business
or the general public.</div>
<a name="08061787000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The LBRO may
use the power only with the consent of the Secretary of State or Welsh
Ministers and after consultation with the local authorities to whom the
direction is being given, any relevant regulator and such other persons
as LBRO considers appropriate, including, for example, representatives
of bodies such as the Trading Standards Institute or the
Chartered Institute 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column23" />Column number: 23</div>of Environmental Health. Where LBRO gives direction to two or more local
authorities, ministerial consent must be given in an order. I believe
that that provision came about partly as a result of the
recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee, which was keen to ensure proper procedures for issuing such
directions. There was considerable debate on the issue in another
place. The clause has been amended to take account of those
discussions, and I think that it has been improved by it.</div>
<a name="08061787000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument
is that the powers are unprecedented and that there is a lack of
democratic accountability in how they work. To give a bit of
background, we started consulting on them last year. The consultation
made it clear that a number of stakeholders were concerned to ensure
that the body would have real teeth in carrying out its functions. We
proposed the backstop power to be used in circumstances like the ones
that I have
outlined.</div><a name="08061787000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford took issue with the comparison
with the Food Standards Agency quoted in this debate. It is not an
exact parallel, but it is the closest precedent. Under section 40 of
the Food Safety Act 1990, the agency may give directions to a local
authority to take steps to comply with a code of practice, much as the
LBRO may require a local authority to comply with its guidance. It is
also true, however, that the Food Standards Agency has extensive other
powers to which LBRO will not have access: for example, the power to
audit local authorities&#146; performance of their functions or even
to take over the management of local authorities&#146; relevant
functions directly at the request of the Secretary of State. I am not
sure that what is proposed in the measures is a constitutional
precedent that goes beyond what happened before. It is important and
right that clause 7 should contain safeguards, partly in response to
some of the concerns raised.</div>
<a name="08061787000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The use of
the powers of direction is subject to the consent of the Secretary of
State. The example quoted from the Food Standards Agency is weaker, as
the Food Standards Agency must only consult the Secretary of State.
That falls short of the strict requirement in the clause to secure the
Secretary of State&#146;s consent. LBRO, as I said, must also consult
any local authority subject to directions, and parliamentary approval
will be required where the directions affect more than one
authority.</div><a name="08061787000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford would
transfer the power from LBRO directly into the hands of the Secretary
of State. The issue is clearly one of democratic accountability and
ensuring that LBRO gives directions to local authorities in a proper
way. He believes that that should be done only by an elected person. We
believe that the requirement in clause 7 for ministerial consent is an
important democratic safeguard. Hopefully, it will have the effect that
he wants, which is to secure democratic accountability in the exercise
of the power. LBRO will be able to propose directions, but the decision
to approve their use will rest firmly with Ministers. From the
accountability point of view, the effect would, in the end, be the same
because Ministers would effectively be responsible for any use of the
directions. However, the amendments would make the provision work in
quite a different way because transferring the power to direct into the
Secretary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column24" />Column number: 24</div>of State&#146;s hands would undermine LBRO&#146;s position as the
expert body on regulatory guidance, and would place the Secretary of
State in a more active decision-making role. Although he might, of
course, argue that it is open to LBRO to give advice to the Secretary
of State on when or whether to direct, making the Secretary of State
the decision maker would change the way in which LBRO&#146;s role is
perceived in practice. Doing so would ultimately undermine the
provision, which is importantly and rightly surrounded by proper
democratic
safeguards.</div><a name="08061787000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
provisions in clause 7 are important to enable LBRO to achieve its
objective, and sufficient safeguards are in place to ensure that LBRO
uses its power to direct compliance with guidance in a responsible
manner. The idea of direction has support from a number of groups. I
shall quote one or two of them. For example, the British Retail
Consortium
said:</div><a name="08061787000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
our view, the LBRO should be able to decide the strength of the
guidance&#151;i.e. it should decide whether authorities must comply;
whether they should have regard to the guidance; or whether it is
merely
advisory.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is not just business groups that say such things; the National Consumer
Council has said:</div>
<a name="08061787000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Although
we recognise the concerns of local authorities, we consider this
measure is necessary to ensure that consumers do not experience a
postcode lottery.&#148;</div>
<a name="08061787000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Trading Standards
Institute has stated:</div>
<a name="08061787000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;TSI
believes...it is necessary that LBRO has the power to direct local
authorities that are at odds with central guidance in order to ensure a
consistent regulatory
environment.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI said.</div>
<a name="08061787000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we would
welcome moves to maintain the powers of the Local Better Regulation
Office (LBRO). Business has been promised a better regulatory
environment if regulators are awarded new powers. But this requires
regulators to deliver on this, and we think it important that the LBRO
is given the appropriate powers to ensure that local authorities do
just this. Maintaining Clause 7 as currently drafted, which gives the
LBRO powers of direction, would help achieve
this&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
a significant number of voices are saying not just that there should be
a power of direction, but that the LBRO should be the body using that
power.</div><a name="08061787000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000534"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> My hon. Friend referred to the National Consumer
Council. Will there be provision for consumer organisations to be
consulted as part of the process, because that is not in the Bill?
There has been concern that businesses get consulted but that the
consumer&#146;s voice does not get
heard.</div><a name="08061787000227"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000535"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is certainly possible. I refer my hon.
Friend to subsection (5), which states:</div>
<a name="08061787000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Before
giving a direction under this section LBRO must
consult&#151;</div>
<a name="08061787000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) the local
authorities in England or Wales to whom the direction is to be
given;</div><a name="08061787000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) any
relevant regulator,
and</div><a name="08061787000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) such
other persons as LBRO considers
appropriate.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,
it is certainly open to the LBRO to consult the National Consumer
Council&#151;although I do not pretend that that is written in the
Bill in every instance.</div>
<a name="08061787000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am coming
to the conclusion of my remarks. I quite understand why both the hon.
Members for Hertford and Stortford and for Solihull asked questions
about the power for an organisation, such as LBRO, to direct 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column25" />Column number: 25</div>local authorities. What is the Bill about in the end? It is about
ensuring that there are teeth in the better regulation effort at a
local level. It is fair for hon. Members to say that with teeth should
come some democratic accountability. As drafted, clause 7 meets that
democratic test without setting up a system that hampers the
LBRO&#146;s work. It contains provisions relating to consultation,
and the consent of the Secretary of State, and provisions for consent
to be given by order where a certain number of local authorities are
involved. That is the balance that we have to strike in the
clause.</div>
<a name="08061787000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The powers do
have some precedent in the example that has been quoted. I believe that
business wants these powers and other organisations such as the Trading
Standards Institute and the National Consumer Council have also said
that they support them. The amendment would not provide a gain in terms
of democratic accountability&#151;that is a fair question to ask, but
it is something that we have covered. The amendment might actually make
that more difficult to operate, not in everyday situations, but on
those occasions when guidance is not enough and it is necessary to
exercise the teeth that we began today&#146;s proceedings by calling
for.</div>
<a name="08061787000426"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08061787000231"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000536"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> It has been a useful debate, but I am not convinced
by the Minister&#146;s arguments. He is right to say that the clause
has been significantly improved. It was improved in the other place by
the efforts of Members of that House and there are certain measures,
which he has referred to, that have made it a better clause. However,
there remains the question of a precedent. He has only been able to
cite one example: the Food Standards Agency. As I have demonstrated,
that agency seeks to direct the implementation of an Act, not of
guidance, and that is an important difference. Unless he has three
other good examples, I have not heard from him where this is not a
precedent. We remain clear, therefore, that although the example that
has been offered has some relevance, it is not directly the same, and
that therefore a precedent has been established.</div>
<a name="08061787000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">What about
the question of teeth? The purpose of my amendment is not to remove the
power to direct&#151;it could be quite legitimately argued that that
would remove the teeth. To continue the metaphor, and I shall probably
stop it at that point, the teeth remain. I am concerned with how they
are harnessed and the accountability. The clause already asks that
where the LBRO seeks to make a direction, it goes to the Secretary of
State. That does not solve the problem that although that body is
accountable to the Minister, it is not accountable us in this House. I
understand, therefore, that business will take the view that it does
and I do not disagree with that view. Looking at how businesses
responded to the Bill, I have a string of quotes here about their
concerns about it. The CBI, which the Minister referred to, said on
21
May:</div><a name="08061787000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
Bill requires business to take a leap of faith: it proposes that
regulators be awarded additional powers to sanction business in
exchange for the promise of a better regulatory
environment.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
could trade quotes as to who is in favour of which bit or whatever; the
fundamental question is whether this power needs to be in the hands of
an unaccountable non-departmental public body.</div>
<a name="08061787000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the first
time, we have no sight of the guidance that we are supposed to be
providing direction powers 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column26" />Column number: 26</div>for. We are not able to say that this is a long-standing, tried and
tested public body that is known to this House, that has established
principles and procedures and with which we are familiar. We are being
asked in advance to give a body with which we are not familiar, which
is not directly accountable to us, the ability for the first time to
give directions on its guidance and not on legislation. There is a
fundamental difference with any precedent that has been established. On
that basis, I am not convinced by the Minister&#146;s arguments and I
therefore seek to press the
amendment.</div><a name="08061787000235"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000551"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I do not want to delay the Committee
unnecessarily. We have been talking all morning about the job that LBRO
is set up to do and whether it fills gaps in the current regulatory
market. One such gap is regarding advice to Ministers, which is covered
by clause 9. The Hampton review recognises that many of the
difficulties that regulatory enforcement poses for business, arise not
from any failing by the local authorities, but from the complexity of
the system that they sit at the centre of.</div>
<a name="08061787000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">We expect
that LBRO will work to bring better co-ordination and intelligence to
the way that Government Departments and the national regulators work
together in setting the framework for local authority enforcement. LBRO
will have an insight into how regulation is enforced by local
authorities from the perspective both of those local authorities and
the businesses subject to the regulation. It is important that the body
has the power to advise Government on such matters, and perhaps to
challenge the various players in the field in order to make the system
more coherent and streamlined. Clause 9 provides such a power and makes
provision for LBRO to</div>
<a name="08061787000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;give advice or
make proposals to a Minister of the
Crown&#148;</div><a name="08061787000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">regarding
the way that local authorities exercise such functions, the
effectiveness of the legislation, whether it would be appropriate for
other regulatory functions to be exercised by local authorities and
other matters relating to that. That is part of LBRO&#146;s job, and
its advice function will be an important
one.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000552"></a>Judy
Mallaber:</b> This is potentially an extremely useful part of
the Bill. Will my hon. Friend advise us on how open it would be for
local authorities to use this measure to express their concerns about
regulatory functions? For example, will they be able to talk about the
way that other Government agencies, besides those with which they are
directly involved, exercise their regulatory functions, or will they be
able only to comment and pass advice via LBRO back to Ministers
specifically in relation to their own regulatory functions?
Potentially, it could be an extremely useful mechanism that provides a
sounding board and guidance to Ministers across a broad range of issues
in relation to a regulatory regime that impinges on a local
authority&#146;s constituents.</div>
<a name="08061787000260"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000553"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The local
authority voice is very important. As I have tried to explain, in LBRO
we seek something that sits at the centre of the regulatory system,
which involves central Government, local government, regulators and
business. Sitting at the centre of the system, LBRO will have an
important advice function. The local authorities that LBRO will deal
with on a day to day basis will be able to raise any relevant
issue&#151;as in fact they already do in LBRO&#146;s current form
of a company, and I am sure that that role will continue. The advice
function is important, which is why I wanted to draw it to the
attention of the Committee.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000554"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This clause is also important because it deals
with the priorities for regulation at a local level. Over the years,
different priorities have been given to local authorities to enforce.
Local authorities have said to us in the past, quite fairly, &#147;We
are being asked to do a lot of different things. A list of things that
we are asked to do by all the different Departments would be
long.&#148; With that in mind, the Government recently asked
Mr. Peter Rogers to conduct a review of the different local
authority enforcement priorities, and to give some sense of priority to
the priorities, if I may put it that way. He produced an extremely
valuable list, and the clause will ensure that it is updated over
time.</div><a name="08061787000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000555"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Chope. The
Minister is referring to a list of lists. It sounds fascinating, but I
am not privy to it, and I do not know whether other Members are,
including the hon. Member for Solihull. We are not aware of what is on
the list of lists, and it would helpful if it could be made available
to the
Committee.</div><a name="08061787000273"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000556"></a>The
Chairman:</b> That must be a matter for the
Minister.</div>
<a name="08061787000274"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000557"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Absolutely. This is a public document, so I am
happy to furnish the hon. Gentleman and other members of the Committee
with the fruits of Mr. Peter Rogers&#146;s work.</div>
<a name="08061787000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause is
important because it was a valuable piece of work. Local authorities
will welcome some sense of what they are expected to concentrate on.
The clause gives LBRO the job of ensuring that the list is kept up to
date, but I am happy to furnish the hon. Gentleman with a copy of
Mr. Rogers&#146;s
report.</div><a name="08061787000276"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000558"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to
provide us with that report, not least because one of my questions was
how prescriptive such a list would be. Clearly, the Minister is ahead
of the legislation.</div>
<a name="08061787000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
clause 11 is important, but will the Minister say where there could be
dilemmas? In particular, if a local authority has chosen to focus on a
particular problem in its area, why should the LBRO interfere, and how
would it do so? That question would certainly be asked by some of our
constituents.</div><a name="08061787000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us take, for example, Wolverhampton, given that it is familiar to the
Minister. If the good burghers of Wolverhampton felt that sorting out
bad licensees was their No. 1 priority, how would the requirement to
&#147;have regard to&#148; a national list work? Who resolves
whether or not Wolverhampton is completely ignoring the aforementioned
list of lists because it is determined to resolve bad licensees? How
does Wolverhampton allocate its resources to square the circle that the
Minister described? On the one hand, it must be able to deal with the
problems that it faces in its own area and, on the other, to
&#147;have regard to&#148; what would clearly be national
priorities. Who resolves such a
conflict?</div><a name="08061787000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000559"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The phrase &#147;have regard to&#148; is the
key to the problem. The measure is not a power of direction like the
one we discussed in our debate on clause 7. It says to local
authorities, &#147;The Government understand that you are often asked
to do many different things by different Departments. We hope it will
be helpful if we publish a list of all the things that we want you to
have particular regard to, to give you some sense of
priority.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div>
<a name="08061787000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman used the example of the fine city of Wolverhampton and
circumstances when a Wolverhampton council would wish to prioritise
licensing. As coincidence has it, licensing is one of the areas
highlighted by Peter Rogers. The others were air quality, hygiene of
food businesses, improving health in the workplace, fair trading, and
animal and public health. I do not wish to rest the case just by saying
that the example that he cited happened to be on the list. Let us 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column29" />Column number: 29</div>say that Wolverhampton wished to do something that was not one of those
six
priorities.</div><a name="08061787000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not talking about the power of prohibition, but the list is a
welcome guide to Wolverhampton city council and other local authorities
saying, &#147;Of all the different things that central Government ask
us to do, what do they really think that we should be spending our time
on in enforcement?&#148; It does not prohibit a local authority from
looking beyond the list and saying that the six areas are fine, but
they have a problem with area No. 7. The list is not a prohibition. It
is something that may change and evolve over time, which is why clause
11 is part of the
Bill.</div><a name="08061787000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000560"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister. When focusing on the
delightful city of Wolverhampton, it is such a pleasure to hear the
gentle lilt of the Wolverhampton
accent.</div><a name="08061787000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for Wolverhampton&#146;s priorities, one of the issues that we looked
at under clause 7 was the power of direction. Can the hon. Gentleman
confirm that that power does not relate to anything under clause
11?</div><a name="08061787000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000561"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the local
football team in Wolverhampton is called the Wanderers, so perhaps I am
not the first wanderer to have arrived in the
city.</div><a name="08061787000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
7 does not apply to the Rogers list. It is not a power of direction. It
does not apply in that way. I shall not go over the ground again. The
Rogers list and that sort of exercise is valuable to local authorities,
and the provision is about making sure that that value is maintained as
time goes
on.</div><a name="08061787000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000562"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I want to pursue the relationship between the LBRO
and other regulators. The clause does not deal with local authorities,
but other regulators such as the Environment Agency, the Food Standards
Agency, the Gambling Commission, the Health and Safety Executive and
the Office of Fair Trading. We all know that those bodies all have
other duties beyond the specific regulatory matters dealt with under
the Bill. To put it briefly, what happens when the LBRO&#146;s
priority or guidance is perceived by those regulators as being contrary
to their work or in danger of being in conflict with other duties? A
classic example could be the Environment Agency, which clearly has
other duties under law beyond the immediate regulatory issues that are
before
us.</div><a name="08061787000290"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000563"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> There are two main points to make about the
clause. Subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="08061787000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;LBRO
and a regulator to which this section applies must enter into a
memorandum of understanding with each other as to how they will work
together&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause then lists the regulators under subsection (2).
Organisations such as the Environment Agency and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column30" />Column number: 30</div>Food Standards Agency are major national regulators. They were keen to
establish that, when LBRO was set up, there was an understanding of how
they should work together. It is envisaged that the documents will set
out the ground rules for mutual consultation and so
on.</div><a name="08061787000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is that the clause is permissive in the sense that other
MOUs could be conducted with other organisations. The hon. Gentleman
also asked what would happen if a conflict arose, the bone of his
question. I stress that the organisations listed would retain their
statutory independence. They will have to discuss matters maturely. I
do not want the hon. Gentleman to feel that there will be some kind of
takeover of these organisations by the LBRO. We are talking about
memorandums of understanding, and the organisations concerned will
retain their statutory independence under the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000564"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000566"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> These are merely probing amendments, and I do not
intend to press them further, but I do want to ensure that there is a
degree of clarity.</div>
<a name="08061787000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 7,
with regard to guidance, we debated the precedent of a non-departmental
body being able to use directional powers. Clause 15 prohibits the
Secretary of State from directing the LBRO with regard to
its clause 7 powers. I wanted briefly to explore with the Minister the
thinking behind that exclusion.</div>
<a name="08061787000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000567"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> Part 1 specifies two distinct direction-giving
powers. The first, which we have discussed, is LBRO&#146;s right to
give local authorities directions to comply with guidance under clause
7. The amendments deal with the second power, which relates to a
Minister&#146;s right to give directions to LBRO. It is intended as a
reserve power. LBRO needs to be independent, but as the hon. Gentleman
rightly said on an earlier point, Ministers remain accountable to
Parliament for its work. If we found ourselves in a situation where
LBRO was acting against the public interest, we would need to exercise
such a power. It is unlikely that the power will be used, but it is
perhaps prudent to have it in case it is needed.</div>
<a name="08061787000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue was
included in response to a recommendation by the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee. The Committee drew attention to the
potential uses to which the two directional powers could be put in
combination. It was concerned that Ministers could direct LBRO to
direct multiple local authorities and that that would give the power a
quasi-legislative character. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column31" />Column number: 31</div>It felt that the issue needed to be dealt with and recommended that
parliamentary scrutiny be applied where LBRO used its directions for
more than one  local authority and where Ministers had
instructed it to do so. Following amendments to implement those
recommendations, both can be done only with parliamentary approval.
Ministers are unlikely to use their direction-giving power in the sense
that I have set out, but a safeguard should be in place.</div>
<a name="08061787000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
clarifies that, in phrasing the clause in the way that we have, we are
responding to concerns raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee.</div>

because it is now on the record and will help people to understand the

operate, and that is what the clause does.</div>
<a name="08061787000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s impact assessment process requires that all new
policies be reviewed to establish their actual costs and benefits and
the extent to which the aim behind them has been achieved. The clause
commits us to carrying out such a review after three years. It places
that commitment on a statutory footing and requires the Secretary of
State to review LBRO&#146;s discharge of its functions three years
after part 1 of the Bill comes into force. The review should consider
whether LBRO is discharging its functions effectively and the extent to
which it has attained its policy
objective.</div><a name="08061787000312"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
the Secretary of State must consult Welsh Ministers and such other

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000570"></a>Mr.

think that he will acknowledge that the clause represents a significant
concession that the Government made in the other place, both in

that that review is laid before both this House and the National
Assembly for Wales. I commend my noble Friends for their work in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000572"></a>Mr.

not think that the review makes clause 17 a sunset clause, as the hon.

sunset clause, although it is not one in the normal understanding of
the
term.</div><a name="08061787000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause provides the power to dissolve LBRO. It will be an organisation
with ambitious objectives, but it is possible that a day will come when
its work has been achieved. As another matter of prudence in such
legislation, the clause makes provision for the dissolution of LBRO by
way of an order subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. That
order could also make provision for the transfer of property rights,
liabilities and so on to another
person.</div><a name="08061787000320"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000574"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> It is probably prudent to pause for a moment at
this point to talk about part 2 of the Bill, to which clause 22 takes
us.</div><a name="08061787000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
far we have discussed the establishment of the LBRO. We have discussed
its powers in relation to advice and guidance to local authorities; we
have discussed the make-up of its board, payments to its members, and
so on. Part 2 takes us into slightly different territory: its 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column33" />Column number: 33</div>application to regulated persons that carry out an activity in two or
more local authorities. This speaks to the very heart of the Hampton
report.</div>
<a name="08061787000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">We began this
morning&#146;s deliberations by talking about two issues identified
by the report as problems in the regulatory system as applied at a
local level. One of those problems was inconsistency and the other was
inflexibility. Inconsistency is at the heart of part 2 of the Bill.
Clause 22 limits access to the primary authority scheme to
persons&#151;be they business, charity or other
organisation&#151;that are regulated by more than one local
authority. The intention is to include multi-site retailers and
businesses that operate indirectly across local authorities, including,
for example, internet sales operations and manufacturers whose goods
are sold by another party in a number of local authorities. It will
also include some franchises, where the franchisor has extensive
control over the compliance standards of its
franchisees.</div><a name="08061787000329"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000575"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> If an internet business is based offshore, but
trades across that, would I be right in assuming that it would not be
incorporated?</div><a name="08061787000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000576"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My instant response is that he would be right.
This can be directed only at businesses that operate in the UK. It is,
however, intended to cover businesses that operate in a number of
different local authority areas in the
UK.</div><a name="08061787000331"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000577"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> The Minister said &#147;the UK&#148;. If we had
a business in Aberdeen, would the point I made be the same? My
understanding is that this is principally to do with England and Wales.
Will the Minister clarify
that?</div><a name="08061787000332"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000578"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is not quite right. Part 2 of the Bill has
a different territorial scope from part 1, and the business in Aberdeen
would be covered by part 2 of the Bill, although it would depend to an
extent on whether the regulatory function was a reserved or a devolved
matter. We may debate this at greater length if the hon. Gentleman
wishes, but on the basic point of territorial extent, part 2 of the
Bill extends to Scotland and Northern Ireland in a way that part 1 does
not.</div><a name="08061787000333"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000579"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I do not necessarily need to delay the Committee by
deliberating on the matter, but if it were the Government&#146;s wish
to clarify it at some point in due course, perhaps in writing, members
of the Committee and those seeking to understand this legislation might
find that helpful. There is a danger of a little lack of clarity, and
while I appreciate that a response may not be at the tip of the
Minister&#146;s tongue, it would be
helpful.</div><a name="08061787000334"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000580"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to do as the hon. Gentleman asks, but
I will also point him to clause 24, which defines &#147;relevant
function&#148;, and under subsection (3)
states:</div><a name="08061787000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
order under subsection (1)(b) may not specify a regulatory function so
far as exercisable in Scotland, if or to the extent that the function
relates to matters which are not reserved
matters.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a similar provision for Northern Ireland. So there is clarity in the
Bill in terms of its territorial scope.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column34" />Column number: 34</div><a name="08061787000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would also
refer him to the&#151;hopefully helpful&#151;guide to the Bill
produced by the Department, where on page 7 the territorial scope is
very clearly set out. It says that part 1 applies only to England and
Wales, and this means that LBRO may issue guidance to which local
authorities in both England and Wales must have regard. Parts 2, 3 and
4 apply in England and Wales, and there are specific procedures for
matters in Wales in respect of which Welsh Ministers exercise functions
that we have touched on. Parts 2, 3 and 4 also apply in Scotland in
respect of matters that are reserved, and in Northern Ireland in
respect of matters that are not transferred. The Bill therefore has a
significantly different territorial scope in parts 2, 3 and 4, compared
with part 1. I hope that that clarifies the situation; it is set out in
both the guide and the
Bill.</div><a name="08061787000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I return briefly to clause 2? As I was saying, the clause and part 2 in
general, set out the relationship that we wish to establish between
multi-site businesses and the local authorities that regulate them. We
shall come on, I am sure, to discuss primary authorities, enforcement
authorities, and LBRO&#146;s role in ensuring that that relationship
works as smoothly as possible. This is a difficult area that was at the
heart of Hampton. We are trying to ensure consistency in enforcement in
a way that respects both local authority and, in a way, ensures that
businesses get the clarity that they desire from the regulatory system.
This is attempting to address the problem of inconsistency, which was a
very important point emphasised by Hampton in his
report.</div>
<a name="08061787000338"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000581"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for those remarks,
which I hope will clarify matters for those whom they will affect. The
Minister is right to say that part 2 of the Bill, of which clause 22 is
the first clause, seeks to aid businesses that trade in more than one
local authority area. The most obvious example of the national business
that we would think of is Tesco, which trades in hundreds of local
authority areas, and has to cope with a wide variety of different
approaches, not just the nature of the rules, but the way in which they
are implemented. Understandably, that creates significant difficulties
for such enterprises. It is that lack of consistency that the
Government are absolutely right to try to address.</div>
<a name="08061787000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have one
fundamental difficulty with that, with which I hope that the Minister
can help, although I suspect that the Government have struggled with
it. That is that there is an unintended consequence of this, which
affects most UK businesses. As the Bill is currently drafted, it would
in effect create two regulatory environments: one for multi-site,
larger businesses&#151;the Tescos of this world&#151;and one for
the small, independent family businesses trading from a single
location. Multi-site businesses will be able to select a primary
authority, and in doing so, would hopefully have the intention of
ensuring that they enjoy a better regulatory environment.</div>
<a name="08061787000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">One single
example&#151;let us take Tesco&#151;would be that its chief
executive would, quite naturally, want to move on from the current
local authority arrangements, and would identify what they regard as
the most efficient local authority. It might be Wandsworth, or it might
be, as its headquarters currently lie, in Hertfordshire. That is not
far from my own constituency. What would happen is that the Tesco chief
executive would say to the local authority chief executive, &#147;Let
us have the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column35" />Column number: 35</div>most efficient, streamlined, best possible arrangement that we can
have.&#148; Quite understandably, the local authority would look at
that as an opportunity to set its standards, and would be very keen to
oblige.</div>
<a name="08061787000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meanwhile,
the small independent retailer in one site would be stuck with its own
authority. In good local authority areas, that would not necessarily
really matter. However, what about those people who are stuck in
Haringey, or&#151;dare I say it?&#151;the city of Liverpool, not
because they are unpleasant areas, because they are delightful and
charming areas, but because there is a concern there about the
efficiency of their
regulators?</div><a name="08061787000342"></a><div class="hs_Para">Locally,
it could mean that on the high street, a small independent retailer has
one regulator, but Tesco enjoys a streamlined super-duper, all singing,
all dancing, and efficient regime. In other words, there is one law for
the big chains, and another for small family businesses.</div>
<a name="08061787000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
characterising it in reasonably simple language, but it is important to
look at the potential unintended consequence. The Minister will, quite
rightly, have realised that the critical issue of the clause&#151;as
I am sure you will have spotted, Mr. Chope&#151;is
consistency. It would be quite right to say, &#147;Mr.
Prisk, the lack of consistency that you are suggesting is utter drivel,
because if you are on one site only, perhaps consistency will have been
achieved.&#148; However, it may be consistency of bad regulation that
that business has to suffer.</div>
<a name="08061787000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">What I want
to explore with the Minister is: what consideration have Government
given to what this could mean, not least given the very great pressure
on small businesses on our high streets, and the competition that they
face from the larger supermarkets? How are small businesses meant to
benefit from this measure? What, in the Government&#146;s view, are
the options available to them if they find themselves at a
disadvantage? There may not be a huge disadvantage, but in competitive
terms every incremental difference matters. In regulatory terms, if one
small family business were at the behest of the clipboard mentality,
while Tesco just up the street was enjoying a much lighter, better
regulatory environment, there would an injustice that I am sure the
Minister would wish to
address.</div><a name="08061787000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000582"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I should like to make a couple of points in
response to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions. I am sure that I
detect no tone of partisanship in his citing Tesco, given the warm
relationship that he enjoys with his local
authority.</div><a name="08061787000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current discussion takes us into an interesting area in respect of
whether we can criticise any legislation for not doing a job that it is
not intended to do. The principle of part 2 is to do with ensuring
consistency for multi-site businesses. Let us pursue the example of
Tesco, since we are on that subject. Tesco operates in most, if not
every, local authority area in the country. There is a particular need
for clear enforcement advice in respect of such a national, well-known
chain. The shop on the corner operating in one local authority area
only needs clear advice, but of a different kind, because it does not
face the same issues that arise with a chain of outlets, where
conflicting advice may be given between one local authority and
another. I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman is comparing exactly the
same situations.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 36</div><a name="08061787000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman suggests that there might be something in the Bill for big
business, but asks, what is in it for small business? I would not want
small businesses to think that there is nothing in the Bill that would
benefit small business. Under schedule 3, with its long list of
enactments under the different headings dealing with trading standards,
fire and safety, and so on, LBRO will be promoting better regulation
across all those fields, regardless of business size. If that helps to
lighten the burden of regulation, it will help businesses, large and
small.</div><a name="08061787000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
businesses are in between the size of Tesco and the single,
family-owned corner shop. For example, a car dealership with outlets
across the four boroughs of the black country is not a national outfit,
like Tesco, but it might welcome the consistency of advice across three
or four quite closely linked local authorities. To local
government&#146;s credit, there are existing examples of that. The
hon. Gentleman mentioned Liverpool. If memory serves me
correctly&#151;I am sure that Committee members will correct me if it
does not&#151;on the trading standards front there is quite a
successful partnership involving authorities in the Merseyside area,
where something like that is already happening. There are benefits to
small business and the national chains and to those in between with,
for example, half a dozen or so
outlets.</div><a name="08061787000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have traded a few quotes today. The Federation of Small Businesses has
welcomed, if not pressed for, the creation of LBRO. I hope that this
measure benefits small businesses. However, part 2 of the Bill is not
designed to do a different job from the one that I set out; it is about
consistency for those business organisations or others who operate
across a number of local authorities and seek the right set of
relationships to ensure consistency. I am sure that we will soon
discuss primary authorities, enforcement authorities and how things are
to be
done.</div><a name="08061787000350"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000583"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The clause is important because it deals with
the establishment of primary authorities. As I said, it is important
that all businesses operating across multiple local authorities have
some access to this scheme. The Hampton report highlighted two
problems. First, not all local authorities are prepared to take on the
role, leaving some businesses without an effective regulatory partner.
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford talked about the importance
of that. Secondly, the division of labour between local authorities is
sometimes unfair, with some councils taking responsibility for a large
number of partnership schemes to the advantage of local authorities
elsewhere that may host
none.</div><a name="08061787000354"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is designed to tackle those problems by giving businesses more
certainty and allowing LBRO to facilitate a fairer distribution of
responsibility for hosting the primary authority partnerships. The
relationship of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 37</div>primary authorities and enforcement authorities is at the heart of part
2 of the Bill. The clause and those that follow are particularly
important in setting up that
relationship.</div><a name="08061787000355"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08061787000584"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Drew</b> (Stroud) (Lab/Co-op): I agree that this is an
important clause, but does the Minister agree that it would be better
if services were delivered under one authority, particularly in the
areas of trading standards and environmental health? There is a strong
argument for unitary
authorities.</div><a name="08061787000356"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000585"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We have made relatively speedy progress this
morning, Mr. Chope. I suspect, if not fear, that pausing for
a discussion on which form of local authority is best may detain us for
some time. In the fine city of Wolverhampton, we have a single unitary
authority. In other parts of the country, we have a different system. I
will resist the temptation to pronounce on which model is best. That is
a debate for another
day.</div><a name="08061787000357"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause is designed to do something a little different, which is to
begin setting out in the Bill how the relationship of primary authority
and enforcement authority is to
run.</div><a name="08061787000358"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000586"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s opening
remarks on the clause. It is important and establishes the principle of
primary authorities. Key to this matter is moving on from the familiar
and established procedure of home authorities. If I made an unkind and
unnecessary remark towards the city of Liverpool, I am more than happy
to withdraw it. It is good to see that there are collaborations. I
gather from the Minister that there are collaborations in the west
midlands. The car dealership that he referred to, which we will now
know as McFadden Motors, will clearly be able to trade across the west
midlands with some
confidence.</div><a name="08061787000359"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
primary authorities established by the clause lead me to the written
evidence submitted by Hertfordshire county council, which I saw this
morning. It raises a good and practical series of points. There is one
particularly important point on the practical and resource implications
of changing from the home authority to the primary authority. I am a
Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire and county hall is in Hertford
in my constituency. For those who are not familiar with Hertfordshire,
it is already established as a home authority for Tesco, Dixons,
Nissan, Renault and Orange. It has three dedicated offices working on
that
role.</div><a name="08061787000360"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer hon. Members to the first page of the document from Hertfordshire
county council. It
states:</div><a name="08061787000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under
the current proposals in the Bill it is estimated that this
resource&#148;&#151;</div><a name="08061787000361"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
resource in terms of homes for primary authorities&#151;</div>
<a name="08061787000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;would need to
increase by at least 100% assuming that only the largest businesses
take advantage of the Bill's provisions. If smaller businesses take
advantage of the primary authority provisions in the Bill, this
increase could be multiplied several times. We estimate that up to
twelve full time officers would be needed to service the increased
needs of the thousands of businesses based in Hertfordshire under the
requirements of the
Bill.&#148;</div><a name="08061787000362"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
officers are currently required, but that figure could rise to 12. Even
if only the largest of the businesses&#151;say only six of
them&#151;currently working with the council 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column38" />Column number: 38</div>as a home authority continue to work with it when it is a primary
authority, the latter&#146;s resource commitment will
double.</div><a name="08061787000363"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister and most Committee members will be aware of the long-held
understanding between the Local Government Association and Her
Majesty&#146;s Government that additional duties placed on local
authorities, in legislation, will be reflected in formula funding. Will
that understanding be honoured? Will any duties placed on local
authorities under this Bill be directly reflected in their formula
funding?</div><a name="08061787000364"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000587"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising
the submission given to the Committee by Hertfordshire county council.
I read it with interest last night, and discussed it with Bill
officials. Some were surprised by the submission, given how closely
that council was involved in the Bill&#146;s development over some
months. I shall not take issue with its figures for the number of such
staff currently employed, but it is very different from that understood
by the Bill team.</div>
<a name="08061787000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
council&#146;s note, however, fails to make reference to the
provisions in clause 31, which allows primary authorities to recover
costs incurred in the carrying out of its new tasks. The
council&#146;s central point is that there are resource implications
for local authorities in exercising their functions as primary
authorities, which is only right. Clause 31 takes account of that by
allowing for cost recovery, the principle of which has resulted in
small businesses giving a warmer welcome to the Bill than might have
been the case. Without that provision, they might have been concerned
that the resource implications would result in too much attention being
given to the national chains and not enough to their own. I believe,
therefore, that Hertfordshire council&#146;s concerns are met by
clause 31. As I said, we were quite surprised to receive such a note
from a local authority that has been so heavily involved in the
consultation and discussions on the development of this
policy.</div><a name="08061787000366"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Clause
26</h4><a name="08061787000019"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Nomination
of primary

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000588"></a>Mr.
Prisk:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 16, in
clause 26, page 13, line 3, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(c) the
regulated person gives 3 months notice that it wishes to terminate the
nomination&#146;.</div><a name="08061787000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
central purpose of this probing amendment is to enable businesses to
terminate the primary authority nomination. As Members will be aware,
clause 26 deals with the nomination of primary authorities, but, under
subsection (5), it also deals with revocations, which are permitted by
the LBRO either where the LBRO considers an authority to be &#147;no
longer suitable&#148; or
where</div><a name="08061787000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it
considers it appropriate to do so for any other
reason&#148;.</div><a name="08061787000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
latter provision is found in subsection (5)(b). Amendment No. 16 would
give a business the ability to indicate its wish to end that
nomination. After all, clearly primary authorities will secede only if
there is a two-way relationship. It is important for a regulated
business to know that, if it no longer wishes to proceed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column39" />Column number: 39</div>with that relationship, it has the ability to seek a termination, but
the clause does not make that clear. It would be most helpful to the
businesses concerned if the Minister assured us that subsection (5)(b)
will give them that
ability.</div><a name="08061787000371"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000589"></a>Lorely
Burt:</b> I have growing concerns about the clause. The
problem is that the LBRO can nominate a local authority to be a primary
authority without its consent. Under the clause, a democratically
elected local authority will not have the right to decide on the
service provision that would best suit the needs of the local
population and economy. Does the Minister agree that the LBRO having
the power to decide how a local authority should deliver services is an
undemocratic and unnecessary centralisation of control, which runs
counter to the principles of the system of local area agreements?
Furthermore, surely a forced relationship between a council and a
business would not be productive or effective for either party. Surely,
a primary authority relationship will work only if both parties want to
participate.</div><a name="08061787000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08061787000590"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> This is an important discussion, because how
such relationships will work is at the heart of part 2 of the Bill. As
the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford pointed out, the clause
deals with how the establishments are to be set up and revoked. They
could be ended for several reasons. For example, LBRO might consider a
local authority to be no longer suitable for the task, or a business
might relocate its headquarters from one local authority area to
another and request 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column40" />Column number: 40</div>that a nomination be revoked so that it could enter a new primary
authority partnership. There might be a takeover of one supermarket
chain by another, as has happened in the past, in which the supermarket
that is taking over the other already has a relationship with a primary
authority. Alternatively, a business and its primary authority might be
abusing the provisions and LBRO might wish to change their
partnership.</div>
<a name="08061787000373"></a><div class="hs_Para">This issue
was raised on Second Reading when sweetheart deals, in which relevant
businesses and local authorities have cosy relationships but
enforcement authorities have a problem, were discussed. There has to be
a mechanism for dealing with such situations, but the amendment would
not put LBRO under a duty to change the situation. The examples that I
have given involve situations in which a business or a regulated person
requests that a nomination be revoked and it is open to LBRO to do
that. The amendment would not put LBRO under a duty to do so, but would
allow it to. That is already within its power, but it raises questions
about whether there are circumstances in which LBRO could refuse a
request from a business to put an end to a partnership. The Bill should
allow LBRO flexibility to work with a business and a local authority to
put a matter right if the relationship is not working. It would not be
helpful, in all cases, to have a statutory requirement on LBRO to put
an end to a partnership without question. I understand what the
amendment is trying to do, but I am not sure that that is the right way
to do it.</div>
