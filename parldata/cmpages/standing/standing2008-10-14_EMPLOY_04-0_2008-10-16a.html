individual&#146;s application for membership of the trade union the
party remains on such a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000363"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> We are still on clause 18 and we are looking at
ways in which more security can be put into the clause to protect the
rights of employees. Amendment No. 17 aims to limit how far back into a
member&#146;s past a trade union is entitled to look to find reasons
to exclude or expel. I accept that this is a question of balancing
interests proportionately and in a common-sense fashion. However, the
views and opinions that we hold in our youth are often bred of some
degree of naivety and optimism for the world and those who inhabit it.
Likewise, youthful ideals may have made some of us intolerant of
others, but with time, some people change. Their views change and
actions are
adapted.</div><a name="08101676000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
instance, we must all accept that membership of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament as a student in the 1960s should not automatically
enable a 50-year-old to be expelled from a trade union that represents
workers in the nuclear industry. Without great caution, it seems that
this could be extended further. What happens if an over-zealous parent
had a teenage child signed up to an extreme party membership? Should
the beliefs of the parent be used to punish the son? Of course
not.</div>
<a name="08101676000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
provision seems at odds with a person&#146;s human rights. The
amendment seeks to address the wrong by saying that the party
membership must have been within the last 12 months. My hon. Friend the
Member for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 78</div>Northampton, South made a powerful case, albeit slightly earlier than he
was meant to, as to how unacceptable it would be for his party
membership some years ago to be taken into account now. He may wish to
come back and finish his remarks.</div>
<a name="08101676000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
18 goes to the definition of a political party. I have previously
stated how we view this clause as an attack on civil liberties in many
ways, but that we recognise the need to address the issue by virtue of
the European convention on human rights. As things stand there is no
definition of a political party in the Bill, so we need to ask at what
point a person&#146;s political views constitute membership of a
political party. If someone votes for the Socialist Workers party, or
strongly or openly espouses some of its views, but is not a member of
that party, could that person be banned from union membership? This is
why we see the key issue as being conduct, not party membership. This
whole area could be a recipe for disaster.</div>
<a name="08101676000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
to all hon. Members who are worried about the British National party
today&#151;I agree that we all need to be worried&#151;I say that
they are missing the wood for the trees. We should keep in mind that
the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)
supported the original legislation here in order to protect communists
and their fellow travellers from being hounded out of unions. The hon.
Member for Broxtowe made the same point in relation to a German
union.</div><a name="08101676000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
can talk about countering the BNP but we should not think that this
legislation is necessarily the format to use. Many other organisations
could be caught in the net. Given the position we find ourselves in, we
need to regulate carefully who will be caught in the definition of
political party. That is why we suggest that we limit the expulsion
right to members of political parties that are registered. When a
similar amendment was moved in another place, the Minister noted that
the employee may belong to a foreign party. The amendment now caters
for that
eventuality.</div><a name="08101676000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps
the amendment&#146;s drafting is not perfect, but I find it difficult
to believe that the Government will be unable to draft an appropriate
definition of a political party. When we come within the wide
parameters of democracy, the spectrum of beliefs is very broad and the
question is where we draw the line and who draws it. While exclusion
for membership of the BNP may seem reasonable, at what point do we
stop? Baroness Miller
said:</div><a name="08101676000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Could,
for example, a union involved with workers in the nuclear or
coal-mining industry exclude a member of the Green
Party?&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7
January 2008; Vol. 697, c.
671.]</div><a name="08101676000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I fear
that we may end up with trade union witch hunts in which hon. Members
who show even the slightest diversion from a party line find themselves
out on their ear. The Orwellian undertones are frighteningly apparent
in their
potential.</div><a name="08101676000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
once splits appear along political lines, how soon will it be before we
see the internal fragmentation of trade union membership? What will
stop those with differing political leanings from creating their own
splinter groups? Increasingly, politics is an issue-driven playing
field. The traditional affiliations of parties have been blurred and
the electorate has become a more homogenised group as the parties head
to the middle ground. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>will present further problems should trade unions be able to bar
membership on the basis of membership of the Countryside Alliance,
Greenpeace or Amnesty International. How are we to categorise such
groups? Are they political parties for the purposes of this Bill? As
the fractures materialise, there could be further claims. We will then
end up back here debating the  same points after another slap
on the wrist from Strasbourg. For those reasons, I am happy
to move the
amendment.</div><a name="08101676000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000364"></a><b class="B">Dr.
Nick Palmer</b> (Broxtowe) (Lab): I want to raise a few points
on the amendments. First, we have a briefing from Thompsons Solicitors,
which acted for ASLEF in the court case that has given rise to this
particular piece of legislation. It is critical of clause 18 as a
whole, but its argument is slightly different from the ones mentioned
so far. I will relate it to the amendment under discussion. Its concern
is that even if a union could exclude members of the BNP, the party
could change its name or have a slightly different variant every year
to evade the exclusion. I am not sure how realistic that is because in
practice, any serious political party would find it very difficult to
change its name every year.</div>
<a name="08101676000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same
difficulty arises with amendment No. 18 in which the hon. Gentleman
seeks to limit the exclusion to parties that are officially registered.
However, the overtly neo-Nazi group Combat 18, which seeks to prepare
for racial war, is not a registered political party. It stretches
tolerance to the point of insanity if we say that we should force trade
unions to associate with members of a group that is preparing for
racial war. The issue is not really whether it is a political party as
defined in the amendment, but whether we should enable trade unions to
draw the line somewhere in a reasonable
manner.</div><a name="08101676000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">With
regard to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point about limiting the period
of membership to 12 months, I have to declare an interest. I was a
communist when I was young, although I was not a party member. I was
quite open about it. I can imagine a situation in which that could be
used against me professionally&#151;outside my current profession
perhaps.</div>
<a name="08101676000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
about fairness is relevant. Proposed new subsection (4G)(b) requires
that any decision be taken fairly. In my case, the involvement was 40
years ago. Reference was made to the possibility of the parents being
involved. Any court would rule in practice that such an association had
long lapsed and that it was not fair within the meaning of the common
law to use it against the individual.</div>
<a name="08101676000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
today&#146;s society, trade unions are voluntary associations of
people who come together for a common cause. It is open to anyone to
form a separate trade union. The hon. Gentleman suggested that there
was a danger that someone might do so under the Bill. Well, the BNP has
already set up the trade union, Solidarity, for people who do not wish
to be part of the TUC. It has a right to do that. As long as the party
is legal, I do not have a problem with it setting up its own trade
union. It is a reasonable solution to the
problem.</div><a name="08101676000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
long as being a member of a particular trade union does not carry with
it significant career and financial implications&#151;it does not
under the Bill&#151;it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>should be a matter of freedom of association to allow people to join
unions whose objectives are similar to their own. It is reasonable to
allow unions to exclude people whose objectives conflict directly with
their own, in the same way that I might have difficulty were I to apply
to join the Conservative party.</div>
<a name="08101676000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000365"></a><b class="B">John
Hemming</b> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD): The principle in
amendment No. 17, which is that only trade union membership in the
immediate year before or during the membership period should matter, is
reasonable. It is the drafting that is problematic. I understood the
amendment to apply only to membership of a political party during the
12-month period prior to applying to be a member of a union, so if
someone was a member of the union and then joined the party that would
disqualify them, that would not count. I cannot back the drafting of
the amendment, but its principle is
good.</div><a name="08101676000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 18 is also good because that again refers to a form of conduct, but
membership of a political party or standing for a party is a definable
act. The Committee knows that I am sympathetic with the underlying
principle of freedom of association. I have no problem with that. As
the hon. Member for Broxtowe explained, people can take other routes if
they do not like that one. The principle of amendment No. 17 is good,
even if the wording needs to be sorted out. Amendment No. 18 is very
good.</div><a name="08101676000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000366"></a><b class="B">Natascha
Engel</b> (North-East Derbyshire) (Lab): I am sure that some
of my lawyerly friends will speak more about the matter, but an
arbitrary 12-month period in which lawyers will have to prove that
someone has been a member of a political party for 12 months prior to
applying to be a member of a trade union seems completely
unenforceable. It would take for ever to prove how long someone has
been a member. Was it from when they filled in the application form?
Was it from when the application form arrived? It seems completely mad
to have something so specific, when we are talking about much broader
principles in respect of freedom of association, and membership of
political organisations and trade unions. I should like an explanation
of the
provision.</div><a name="08101676000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000367"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Brian Binley</b> (Northampton, South) (Con): I support the
clause wholeheartedly. I wish that it went further. It does not, so I
shall speak to the amendment itself. I do not like the fact of making
decisions that are based on a person&#146;s association, particularly
with a political party. Parties are broad churches and for a trade
union to be able to assume that it can take such action, be it to take
into account membership of a political party for 12 months or
otherwise, seems to be a dangerous
premise.</div><a name="08101676000044"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000368"></a><b class="B">Michael
Jabez Foster</b> (Hastings and Rye) (Lab): Has the hon.
Gentleman noted the wideness of the BNP&#146;s policies? I have not
noted them to be in any way integrationary or prepared to consider
having members of different creeds unless they maintain the white
supremacy rule. That is not the sort of party that most trade unions
want to have in their
path.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="08101676000332"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="08101676000045"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000369"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I will be delighted to answer that. My record of
standing up against the BNP is second to none. I do not like any
implication that it might not be, and I will not accept
it.</div><a name="08101676000046"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000370"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Will the hon. Gentleman give
way?</div>
<a name="08101676000047"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000371"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Hang on. I will finish the answer to the question,
which I found frankly offensive. Many good people in this
country&#151;this point has been raised&#151;were members of the
Communist party at a time when Stalin was killing 16 million people.
Are we to say that, because of that association, they should not be
members of the Law Society, of a trade union or indeed of any
organisation with an impact on employment? I would argue that that is
not the case, but my point is that we should be dealing with the
individual and the individual&#146;s characteristics, not with what
might be said about the people with whom they associate. Freedom of
association is an important factor in that respect too, and it seems to
me that the balance struck has not taken that perspective into account.
I argue for all our freedoms in that respect, and I would have hoped
that the hon. Gentleman would see that to be the
case.</div><a name="08101676000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am also concerned that the amendment, which I will support as the
lesser of evils, recognises that when dealing with such membership, a
person&#146;s association can be noted rather than their own standing
and beliefs, recognising that political parties are broad churches.
That could swing round and hit all of us where it hurts if we are not
careful. The thin end of the wedge, in that respect, is dangerous.
Before I am questioned again, I repeat that I have stood alongside my
colleague the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble) when we
were threatened with a BNP march, waiting for them to come to the
station. The whole ethos of the British National party horrifies me, as
does much of the ethos of the Communist party.</div>
<a name="08101676000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">My point is
about judging an individual on his own worth, not on the basis of
association, which we all choose for good or bad. There are a number of
things that I do not like about the Conservative party, but I make a
decision. I am sure that there are lots of things that the hon.
Gentleman does not like about the Labour party, but one makes a
decision. Let us judge a person on his individual character and views,
not on the groups with which, for one reason or another, he might
associate
himself.</div><a name="08101676000050"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000372"></a>The
Minister of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b> These two amendments
deal with the issue of when someone is a member of a political party
and the definition of a political party for the purposes of the clause.
Were the amendments to be passed, those definitions would of course
apply across all the various subsections of section 174 of
the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992.</div>
<a name="08101676000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
17 deals with the definition of party membership in terms of time. The
amendment would limit trade unions&#146; ability to expel or exclude
people by requiring the unions to disregard any party membership that
ended more than a year&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div><a name="08101676000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000373"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Hugo Swire</b> (East Devon) (Con): Will the Minister indulge
those of us on the backest of the Back Benches by speaking up a little
bit, so that we can catch every
word?</div><a name="08101676000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000374"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am happy to speak more loudly, although I was
trying to calm the Committee down after the last exchange.</div>
<a name="08101676000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said,
the amendment involves disregarding any party membership that ended
more than a year before the person applied to join a trade union. The
issue was also raised in the other place when the Bill was discussed
there. I appreciate what is being said with genuine feeling in the
Committee about freedom of belief and the important principle enshrined
in that. We all hold that dear. The judgment that gave rise to the
legislation was about balancing the freedom of such belief with freedom
of association and the rights of union members to have a view on with
whom they wished to associate. So, there is a balance of freedoms here.
The judgment concluded that unions should be free to decide, in
accordance with their rules, questions concerning admission and
expulsion.</div><a name="08101676000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall quote from the judgment, as I did this morning. The judgment
noted that unions often hold particular views. Paragraph 39
states:</div><a name="08101676000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Article
11 cannot be interpreted as imposing an obligation on associations or
organisations to admit whosoever wishes to join. Where associations are
formed by people, who, espousing particular values or ideas, intend to
pursue common goals, it would run counter to the very effectiveness of
the freedom at stake if they had no control over their
membership.&#148;</div><a name="08101676000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
as political parties have some control over membership. In my party,
over the years, we have expelled people for various crimes. I remember
that particularly a couple of decades ago, when I was starting out in
politics and party membership. Of course there has to be due process,
natural justice and so on, but it is not beyond the bounds of reason
that a collective organisation, such as a party or trade union, could
expel or exclude an individual. The judgment was drawing attention to
that kind of
balance.</div><a name="08101676000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000375"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I make the point that when ASLEF appealed its case
it was for a member who had been expelled because he was a member of
the BNP at that time. Indeed, if that were the case in point, that is
fine&#151;there is protection there. My concern in this
respect&#151;although I understand that my concerns overall are stand
part arguments&#151;is that there is no time limit to all of this. In
given instances, the union can be vindictive and victimising just as
much as an employee can. It is the time frame that allows that to
happen, and not the actual membership. If the provision was restricted
to membership, I would understand it more, but if the union has an
open-ended option to take action on the basis of what is said to be a
given history, I find that much more difficult to
accept.</div><a name="08101676000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000376"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I shall come on to the issue of former
membership. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. In the case
of former members, it may be that someone&#146;s views remain exactly
the same, even though they are no longer a member of a particular
political party. It may be that their views have changed. Either case
could be true. In the latter case, provisions in clause
18(2)&#151;the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>proposed new subsections (4G) and (4H) of section
174 &#151;would apply. Those provisions require a
trade union to act in accordance with its rules; they say that there
should be &#147;a fair opportunity&#148; to make representations,
which should be &#147;considered fairly&#148;. That is, precisely,
the natural justice point made by Lord Morris of Handsworth that I
quoted this morning. If, for example, someone had had a brief
flirtation with an extremist party in their youth, many years before,
as the hon. Member for Huntingdon said could be the case, but that this
was very different from their views today, that would be properly
considered under the protections and provisions in the
clause.</div><a name="08101676000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a further point. The effect of the amendment would be that anyone
joining the BNP or a similar organisation after they had joined the
union would be in a position where it would not be legal to expel them,
because the emphasis of the amendment is on the 12-month period before
joining the union. In practical terms, there is a significant problem
with the amendment, apart from the fact that it seems to be based on a
lack of recognition of the protections that have been built into clause
18.</div><a name="08101676000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
refer to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East
Derbyshire, who said that the amendment would result in unions being
expected to know the dates when individuals were registered as a member
of a party when even the parties themselves may not know
that.</div><a name="08101676000061"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000377"></a><b class="B">Mary
Creagh</b> (Wakefield) (Lab): We had a debate on Tuesday about
the difficulties that enforcement officers have in acquiring records
and copies of documents from employers. Does the Minister agree that
the amendment would place an onerous imposition on trade unions if they
were expected to go into the headquarters of the BNP and ask for its
membership records, and does he think that the records would be up to
date or freely given to trade
unionists?</div><a name="08101676000062"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000378"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That illustrates the practical problems
associated with accepting the amendment. As my noble friend Lord Bach
said, it would result in trade unions and a member in such a position
playing cat and mouse, and a process that could produce a platform for
vexatious actions. As I have said all along, this is delicate territory
and we have to proceed with care and caution. That is why safeguards
have been built into the clause that take account of the issue raised
by the hon. Members for Northampton, South and for Huntingdon about a
youthful flirtation that was left behind many years
before.</div><a name="08101676000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also like to say a few words about amendment No. 18, which seeks
to provide a definition of &#147;political party&#148;. We do not
believe that it is necessary. The statutory provisions limiting the
ability of a trade union to exclude or expel persons for their party
membership were first introduced in 1993. No definition of political
party was thought to be needed at that time, and there has been no
evidence since then that not including a definition in the legislation
introduced by that Government has caused a
problem.</div><a name="08101676000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
should also point out that although including registration with the
Electoral Commission in a definition of a political party would cover
most parties, it would not cover every political party in the country.
Emerging parties or parties that do not stand for election in their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>own name do not need to register. That is precisely the territory that
we are talking about with extremist
organisations.</div><a name="08101676000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a difficulty with the foreign aspect. It is true that it was
discussed in the other place, but how can we assume that every other
country has equivalent registration systems? I doubt that that is the
case. Again, the amendment would create practical hurdles that unions
would find well nigh impossible to
overcome.</div><a name="08101676000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000379"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> Following up on my point about Thompsons
Solicitors, would the Minister agree that, in practice, a trade union
would be able to have a rule to exclude members of parties with a
racialist ideology, or something general, rather than specifying a
particular
name?</div><a name="08101676000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000380"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend is right to draw me back to his
point. I draw his attention to subsection
(2):</div><a name="08101676000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Conduct
which consists in an individual&#146;s being or having been a member
of a political
party&#148;.</div><a name="08101676000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
does not say that the union must specify in the rule book the exact
name of the political party. That also came up in the other place,
where on behalf of the Government Lord Bach
said:</div><a name="08101676000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Membership
need not be of that political party but of any political party whose
values contravene the union&#146;s rules or
objectives.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 2
June 2008; Vol. 702, c.
28.]</div><a name="08101676000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000381"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> My reading of subsection (2) is that that is
where the problem lies, because, to refer to it more fully, it
says:</div><a name="08101676000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Conduct
which consists in an individual&#146;s being or having been a member
of a political party is not conduct falling within subsection (4A) if
membership of that political
party&#148;.</div><a name="08101676000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reference to &#147;that political party&#148; seeks to provide a
particular rather than a more general
definition.</div><a name="08101676000333"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="08101676000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000382"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My reading of the provision is that that
reference relates to the political party mentioned above. I hesitate to
differ with hon. Members who have good legal knowledge, but our view is
that it does not require the specification of named political parties
in the union rule book. I think that that is at the heart of my hon.
Friend&#146;s
concern.</div><a name="08101676000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000383"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Therein lies the concern. The Minister said that
someone should not be banned because of a youthful flirtation. We have
all had youthful flirtations in one way or another, but they are not
matters for debate today. To quote Paul on the way to Damascus, a
person can change his belief on an action instantly. It seems to me
that therein lies the problem, because someone who was a member of the
British National party, the Communist party, the Nazis or God knows
what else that we might find abhorrent may decide that they no longer
believe in that. That is why I argue that the issue should be an
individual&#146;s view, not their
association.</div><a name="08101676000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not understand why the matter cannot be cleared up by saying that if
an individual&#146;s views clash with the constitution of a trade
union, that individual cannot be a member. I cannot see that the issue
is association. Will the Minister explain why many members of the
Labour party who support me in Northampton were adamant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column85" />Column number: 85</div>that they would support Tony Blair five years ago? People change their
minds. The issue is not time. Time is an
instant.</div><a name="08101676000074"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000384"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. Interventions are becoming rather long,
and sometimes are off the
subject.</div><a name="08101676000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000385"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman asks why the provision is
about membership of a political party. That was the nature of the case
that was taken to the European Court. As the hon. Member for Huntingdon
said, since 1993, capacity has been in place for a union to expel or
exclude someone on the basis of conduct. The change in clause 18 arises
from that case, and refers to membership of a political party. The
Government&#146;s task, and our task as a Parliament, is to try to
find a clause that matches the requirement imposed on us by the
European convention judgment, but also does that in a way that
preserves natural justice for the individual. That is what we have
tried to do through clause
18.</div><a name="08101676000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
I may return in seriousness to the point about youthful flirtation, the
safeguards that we have built in for representations to be made,
considered and so on will provide ample opportunity for someone to say,
&#147;That was a long time ago in my youth.&#148; I cannot
understand why a trade union would want to expel or exclude someone in
such
circumstances.</div><a name="08101676000077"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000386"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> The ASLEF <i class="I">v.</i> Lee judgment is unusual, and
the circumstances hardly ever arise. We are trying to legislate for an
eventuality that does not happen often, and we must recognise that the
circumstances would be
extreme.</div><a name="08101676000078"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000387"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I agree with my hon. Friend. As I said this
morning, unions are recruiting members and trying to attract people,
not rooting through their lists trying to get rid of
people.</div><a name="08101676000079"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000388"></a><b class="B">Barry
Gardiner</b> (Brent, North) (Lab): The hon. Member for
Northampton, South said that this matter should be about an
individual&#146;s views rather than membership of a party. Perhaps he
should walk down the corridor and look at that wonderful painting of
Queen Elizabeth I, where she is saying that she has no desire to make a
window into men&#146;s souls. The individual view is private, whereas
membership of a party is a public representation of certain views and
an expression of them. That is an important distinction. The hon.
Gentleman would not want a Big Brother state that inquired into what
each of us privately thought, any more than I would. Going down that
route would be very
dangerous.</div><a name="08101676000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000389"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend makes the point well and more
eloquently than I could. I am drawing to a conclusion. I talked about
the difficulties of finding where foreign political parties were
registered and so on.</div>
<a name="08101676000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000390"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Baron</b> (Billericay) (Con): The hon. Member for Brent,
North made an excellent point that, in turn, argues against the
legislation as a whole. The legislation 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>seeks to do exactly what he referred to&#151;make a window into
men&#146;s souls, and judge somebody on their beliefs rather than
their conduct.</div>
<a name="08101676000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000391"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I thought that this quarrel among Conservative
Front Benchers could be sorted out. It happens with every
amendment.</div><a name="08101676000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Huntingdon, whom I believe is also the shadow
Solicitor-General, told us that his party&#146;s position is to
legislate in line with ECHR judgments. Twice, the hon. Member for
Billericay has indicated that he does not wish to do so, and objected
in principle to the legislation being introduced at
all.</div><a name="08101676000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">Either
the Conservative party believes in legislating in line with ECHR
judgments or it does not. If it does, as the hon. Member for
Huntingdon, the Front-Bench spokesperson, said, the issue is about how
we can meet that judgment. If it does not, that is a significant
departure, which has been mentioned twice by the hon. Member for
Billericay and which will be noted. The Conservative party must make up
its mind.</div>
<a name="08101676000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000392"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I take issue with one of the assertions made by
the hon. Member for Billericay. The decision to join a political party
is a conscious decision to do just that. It may or may not express
views. I would not wish to see legislation based on expressing views,
but this matter is about the conscious act of joining a political party
and the freedom of association.</div>
<a name="08101676000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000393"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> As I said in response to the hon. Member for
Northampton, South, the judgment was about membership of a political
party.</div>
<a name="08101676000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
draw the Committee&#146;s attention to the difference between
exclusion and expulsion. Expulsion would be when someone was already a
member of a trade union, and exclusion when someone was not a member
but sought to join. In that sense, amendment No. 18 might be
problematic as it seems to deal only with the exclusion of those
seeking union membership. If a political party were established after
an individual joined a trade union, I am not sure whether that would be
covered.</div>
<a name="08101676000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">In summary, I
stress again that this is delicate territory, but the amendments go
well beyond what is required to comply with the judgment. They could
make it impossible for trade unions to use the powers in clause 18,
even when in line with the safeguards set out in the clause, which
cater for instances such as those quoted during the debate. On that
basis, I hope that the Opposition will not press the
amendment.</div><a name="08101676000089"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000394"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The judgment was certainly about membership of a
political party. Amendment No. 18 defines what constitutes a political
party. Would anyone who heard this debate have a clear idea as to what
constitutes or is likely to constitute a political party? I do not
think so. I submit that there will be court cases based on what
constitutes a political
party.</div><a name="08101676000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Broxtowe gave a thoughtful speech, using the example of
Combat 18. We have to ask whether that is a political party or just a
movement. That is highly debateable. Does hanging out with the same
group of people in a particular place without a membership card make
one a member of a political party? Does a group all wearing a T-shirt
saying &#147;Combat 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>18&#148; constitute a political party? On what basis is a member of
Combat 18 a member of a political party? Another example that comes to
mind is the Militant Tendency, which it called itself a newspaper
rather than a political party. That was a highly debateable point. We
could debate it again
today.</div><a name="08101676000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that we are creating legislation that will lead not to less
review and fewer court cases, but to more. We have seen that
organisations such as the BNP are quite prepared to go to court and
test this kind of thing. Do not think that this will be the end of it.
Our suggestion is that we must tie the matter
down.</div><a name="08101676000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000395"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The point about the potential for litigation is
important and valid. My point is that the kind of extra conditions
contained in the amendments would be likely to give more grounds for
litigation to the people that the hon. Gentleman is worried
about.</div><a name="08101676000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000396"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I disagree. If someone is a member of a
registered political party, that is a lot more certain than anything
else that we have discussed. I appreciate that the amendments might not
be perfect. If the Minister were to come up with other suggestions, we
would be prepared to discuss
them.</div><a name="08101676000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Broxtowe said, a party could change its name, but
that is unlikely. The more popular political parties are unlikely to
want to change their names regularly. He also said that one of the
advantages could be that BNP members would end up going into their own
unions. I do not wholly agree with that as a valid course of action. It
smacks of the Italian fascist corporatist unions. Although this is not
directly relevant to the debate, I do not think that that would be an
effective way to negate BNP or fascist action in this
country.</div><a name="08101676000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the arbitrary 12-month period, if the hon. Member for North-East
Derbyshire thinks that it should be two or three years, we are prepared
to discuss that. In principle, the idea that someone can be excluded
from a union or anything else because of something that they were
involved in 20, 30 or 40 years ago is conceptually wrong and
unfair.</div><a name="08101676000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000397"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> The hon. Gentleman is trying to legislate for
something that I do not think will ever happen. The idea that a trade
union might be purely vindictive and get rid of somebody because 40
years ago they were a member of such-and-such an organisation just will
not
happen.</div><a name="08101676000097"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000398"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I assure the hon. Lady that in Nazi Germany a
person&#146;s membership of the Communist party 20 or 30 years
previously may well have been taken into account in deciding how they
were dealt with. Such treatment is therefore conceptually possible. As
to whether it has happened in this country, I do not have any proof. Is
it conceptually possible? Is it a fear that as legislators we should be
looking at? I think it is.</div>
<a name="08101676000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000399"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> The point is that we do not live in Nazi Germany.
If we are legislating on the basis that we are living in Nazi Germany,
we should start all over again.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column88" />Column number: 88</div><a name="08101676000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000400"></a>Mr.

country, and I hope that all of us do to some
extent.</div><a name="08101676000334"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000401"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Is it not the case that Nazi Germany did not
have proposed new subsection (4H), which will impose reasonableness?
With respect to the hon. Gentleman, any of those bizarre examples, such
as someone who was a member 20 or 30 years ago, would be unreasonable
unless their conduct had been different in the
meantime.</div>
<a name="08101676000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000402"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I think that I have made my
point.</div><a name="08101676000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000403"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree from his history
lessons&#151;I lived through it&#151;that vindictiveness occurred
in the union movement consistently in the 1970s? Before saying that it
did not, one should talk to many of my friends who fought that battle
in Nottinghamshire and other parts of the country. It may happen again,
and we need to be aware of that when we are writing law. We are not
writing law for a week or a month; we assume that we are writing law
for a long time indeed, and we must take that into
account.</div>
<a name="08101676000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000404"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I totally agree with my hon.
Friend.</div>
<a name="08101676000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000405"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the price of
liberty is eternal vigilance and that our role is to ensure that the
laws operate properly and protect people against vindictive actions?
Although I would disagree with him on this occasion in valuing the
right of voluntary association where a person does not suffer any
disadvantage as an important issue to be taken account of, it is our
responsibility as hon. Members to protect the freedoms of the people of
this
country.</div><a name="08101676000105"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000406"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I agree that eternal vigilance is certainly one
of our duties as legislators. The ban is based on being a member of a
political party&#151;we are agreed on that.</div>
<a name="08101676000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another thing
came to mind as the Minister was making his remarks. I argued, as
others have been arguing, that a person&#146;s views may change over
time, but there is another aspect: over 20 or 30 years, the
political party&#146;s views may change as well. The Conservative
party of 30 or 40 years ago is not the Conservative party of today, so
it is not only people&#146;s views but parties&#146; views that
change. What might have been a racist party might not be after 30 or 40
years, and vice versa.</div>
<a name="08101676000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The more we
look at the legislation, the more we see holes in it and ways in which
it will be challenged. What we have seen in the other place and what we
will, I hope, see today is an Opposition who say, &#147;Yes, we
appreciate that the legislation is necessary, but we are not quite
happy with where we are at the moment,&#148; or &#147;What we have
is not going to work,&#148; and we have been producing different ways
forward. It would be helpful if the Government gave some thought to how
such points could be firmed up, so that we could return to it at a
later stage.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column89" />Column number: 89</div><a name="08101676000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000407"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> The hon. Gentleman has gone some way to persuading
me that there is a difficulty in the political party definition. I am
not sure whether he is raising it as a practical objection or as part
of a wish to constrain the activity of trade unions. My conclusion is
that we should perhaps replace the term with &#147;political
association or movement&#148;&#151;in other words, draw the
definition more widely. His approach of limiting it to parties defined
in the Bill would work.</div>
<a name="08101676000109"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000408"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I have said openly, as has my hon. Friend the
Member for Billericay&#151;the Minister tried to create some sort of
difference between us on this&#151;that conceptually, we do not like
the legislation. We do not like the clause; we are concerned about its
overall impact on civil liberties. However, we respect the ECHR and
realise that it is our starting point. We are not trying to overturn
the ECHR decision and certainly not the ECHR, which was the extra world
that we got into. We are where we are, and we have made our point. I
will go away, look through the <i class="I">Hansard </i>report of today&#146;s
debate and think again about how we can review the amendments before
the Bill is considered on Report, because we will certainly want to
raise that issue again. In the meantime, we are willing to discuss it
with the Minister and hope that there will be movement on it before
Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000409"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> I must confess a prejudice. My prejudice is
against the BNP&#151;there are some other political parties that I do
not like either, but I forgive them. The BNP are an obnoxious bunch,
and many hon. Members agree. Fascists, like chameleons, change their
appearances. My first concern is how unions can clearly define the
sorts of organisations that are contrary to their purpose, although my
hon. Friend the Minister has dealt with this point to some extent. I am
grateful to him for defining the point about the term &#147;political
party&#148; being wide enough so as not to be too prescriptive in
excluding or including groups that are contrary to the purpose of trade
unions.</div>
<a name="08101676000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
understand why trade unions should not be able, in the main, to do as
they want&#151;political parties do. If one cannot join political
parties in some parts of the country&#151;that is not so much the
case these days but certainly was in the past&#151;that creates
detriment. As political parties, we can decide who we want in our
membership, and if someone has already joined a party whose views are
inconsistent with ours, we do not have to take them on. Even the Fabian
Society states that one must not be ineligible for membership of the
Labour party, which means that one cannot be a Tory, because one cannot
be a member of the Labour party if one is a Tory party member. Those
sorts of thing seem to be obvious.</div>
<a name="08101676000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">It seems
perfectly proper that voluntary organisations should be able to exclude
people who are not their fellow travellers. My worry is that that might
still be too restrictive. We now know that the ECHR has decided that
the right to association by the unions will, in all but one situation,
lead to that having prominence over the human rights of the individual.
The exception to that is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column90" />Column number: 90</div>laid out in proposed new subsection (4G), to which the Minister referred
this morning, in cases
where</div><a name="08101676000327"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
individual would lose his livelihood or suffer other exceptional
hardship&#148;.</div><a name="08101676000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
loss of livelihood could never occur now because there are no longer
such things as closed shops, so I am not sure what the exceptional
hardship could be. I cannot think of an example in which exceptional
hardship could be imposed on anyone simply because they could not join
the club. This morning we heard all sorts of examples of inconvenience,
such as not being able to go on holiday in the west country and losing
the right to free legal advice, but exceptional hardship seems to be
such a test that it is almost inconceivable that simply losing
one&#146;s union membership could be so described, and we discussed
that earlier.</div>
<a name="08101676000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
the other issues set out in the new clauses that the House of Lords
suggests are imposed make me worry about the possibility of significant
litigation on some issues. An example is the business of the reasonable
practicality of knowledge. What is the reasonable practicality of
knowing whether the union had brought a policy that the new member did
not know about? The test in proposed new subsection (4D) creates a test
of reasonable practicality in the knowing of the objectives&#151;it
looks like a minefield. A BNP member might well find a fellow traveller
who is happy to come along and say that he did not know about the
objectives of the union. What will happen? Is the trade union to bring
a bus-load of shop stewards and say that everybody should know about it
if they turn up to their branch meetings? I just do not know why it is
all necessary.</div>
<a name="08101676000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have not
tabled an amendment this afternoon. The Minister has worked really hard
to strike the right balance in the Bill, and whatever he does, there
will be people who will disagree with him&#151;he has a tough job and
I congratulate him on his efforts. As far as I can see, however, the
bottom line is that the ECHR has made clear its point that under very
rare circumstances only&#151;exceptional hardship, for
example&#151;a trade union might be unable to expel someone. Unless
he knows of other such circumstances and if all the other provisions
are simply window dressing designed to comply with what the House of
Lords said, will he reconsider whether the provisions are necessary?
Would it not be just as simple to return to the drafting in the
original Bill? Might that not serve his purposes well and do what he
has been trying to do throughout the Bill, which is to simplify and
clarify employment legislation, so that the employee&#151;the union
member, in this case&#151;knows precisely what is intended? Perhaps
the BNP will not even bother to join unions in which they are not
welcome.</div><a name="08101676000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000410"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Most of my points have been dealt with during the
discussion on the amendment. The debate is primarily about freedom of
association, voluntary association and people&#146;s right to decide
not to associate with certain other people. I would share hon. Members
concerns if we tried to legislate on that within statutory
organisations.</div><a name="08101676000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000411"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I apologise for not having said what a delight it
is to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Caton&#151;it is,
of course. I declare an interest in that, before I was elected to
Parliament, I worked as the trade 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column91" />Column number: 91</div>union liaison officer at the Labour party and, after that, with trade
unions organising their political fund ballots, so I understand unions
and how they work. They are very broad churches, beyond even what has
been said here today. I remember working quite closely with people in
unions and workplaces who were members of other political parties.
Before I did that job, I was a trade union
organiser.</div><a name="08101676000120"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08101676000412"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Stephen Crabb</b> (Preseli Pembrokeshire) (Con): On the hon.
Lady&#146;s point about trade unions being broad churches, is that
not borne out by the fact that the majority of trade union members
voted Conservative in 1983, 1987 and, I think, at the last
election?</div><a name="08101676000121"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000413"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I cannot comment on that, because I do not know the
facts. Trade union members are members of lots of different political
parties, and everybody who calls themselves a democrat should support
that. Although I would say that a working person&#146;s rights are
much better represented by the Labour party than by any other party, I
would still die in a ditch for their right to join any other political
party, if that is what they wanted to do. We are overlooking that
important fact. Trade unions are very broad churches. The circumstances
that we are legislating for are very
rare.</div><a name="08101676000122"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000414"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Having been a trade unionist, I understand the
hon. Lady&#146;s point. I was a member the Union of Shop,
Distributive and Allied Workers and worked for the co-operative
movement in the bank, as I have said before. However, although the
unions are very reasonable at the moment, they have not been in the
past&#151;for example, when a specific group took hold of a region or
branch and caused havoc. Havoc was caused to members of the Labour
party, let alone to members of other parties, whether Conservative or
Liberal. Does she recognise that we must write law with that
possibility in mind? That is what the debate is
about.</div><a name="08101676000335"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000415"></a>Natascha
Engel:</b> I do not entirely disagree, but the hon. Gentleman
must also recognise that that is just politics. It might be a bit
annoying and sometimes really painful, but havoc is politics&#151;and
legitimate politics, too, even if annoying. We must also recognise the
difference between serious extremism, which the hon. Gentleman was so
passionately angry about, and xenophobia and racism, both of which the
BNP, as a political party, represent, which we all hate fundamentally
and which are, importantly, fundamentally anti-democratic. The
mainstream political parties, as well as trade unions, are democratic
organisations. Again, that is another point that we must
recognise.</div><a name="08101676000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have also recognised in our debates, in terms of freedom of association
and freedom of speech, that there are big political parties and trade
unions. Those points have been raised time and again during our
sittings. Freedom of association and freedom of speech are fundamental
to democracy, and we all support those things. It is important to
remember that this is about members in membership
organisations&#151;trade unions and mainstream political
parties&#151;having the right and the ability collectively to
determine the rules 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column92" />Column number: 92</div>of those organisations, as well as collectively to change them.
Extremism absolutely undermines those democratic principles.</div>
<a name="08101676000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a trade
union or a political party decides collectively that it finds extremist
views unacceptable&#151;not just in principle, but as part of the
ethos of the organisation&#151;it should be within the rights of
those organisations to expel people with those views. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Hastings and Rye said, if no hardship is suffered as a
result&#151;there is no longer a closed shop&#151;that should be
within the rights of those
organisations.</div><a name="08101676000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Northampton, South mentioned earlier, if an
individual&#146;s beliefs run so contrary to the
organisation&#151;in this case, a trade union&#151;that they
undermine everything that it represents, he or she should go. I support
their going. The proposal is trying to enshrine in law the ability for
a trade union or other organisation to get rid of a person if the
organisation has collectively decided and judged that they are contrary
to everything that it represents. Another fundamental point is that the
ECHR&#146;s decision on this matter was all about transparency and
the ability to do that within trade union rules. That is all that I
want to say about that. The clause supports all the things that we have
been talking about today. Most members of the Committee agree that
these are fundamental democratic
principles.</div><a name="08101676000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000416"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye
is right on one point&#151;whichever way people move on this issue,
somebody is ready to tell them that they have gone too far or not far
enough. That goes with the territory. To govern is to choose. Our
responsibility is to try to get this
right.</div><a name="08101676000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
thrust of the amendments is that there should be more conditions. The
question is whether we have gone too far in respect of this power, and
that is the judgment that we have had to make all the way through. I
said in my first comments this morning that the Government changed our
view as the debate went on in the other place. We canvassed two
options&#151;a broader option, to which the hon. Gentleman is
encouraging us to return, and an option broadly in line with the
clause as it is now. On balance, we have taken the view that although
both those options would meet the legal requirement to legislate in
line with the ECHR judgment, we should give unions the power that the
judgment recommends. However, there was also a strong case for due
process and safeguards in the exercise of the power, and that is what
the clause tries to do. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee
will have their views on whether it does so
perfectly.</div><a name="08101676000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000417"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> I appreciate that the Government are not in an easy
position and that finding the right compromise is difficult, but will
the Minister, for the sake of clarity, give us his definition of a
political
party?</div><a name="08101676000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000418"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> For me, a political party is the kind of
organisation that I joined. It is no more necessary to define that now
than it was when the hon. Gentleman&#146;s party introduced the 1993
provisions and felt no need to enshrine such a definition in
law.</div><a name="08101676000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000419"></a>Mr.
Baron:</b> For the purposes of the Bill, some regard clearly
has to be given to the term, &#147;political party&#148;. Will the
Minister give us his definition of that
term?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column93" />Column number: 93</div><a name="08101676000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000420"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman feels that
it is more necessary to define that term today than it was when the
Government whom he supported introduced their legislation, which made a
distinction between party and conduct that had not been in previous
legislation.</div><a name="08101676000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
should not lose sight of the safeguards, which we have discussed one by
one and which are set out in proposed new subsections (4G) and (4H).
They state that a decision to exclude or expel should be taken in
accordance with the union&#146;s rules and that it should not be done
unfairly. We have been over the point about exceptional hardship.
&#147;Fairness&#148; is defined as notice of the proposal to
exclude or expel being given to the person with reasons and there being
a fair opportunity to make representations, which should then be
considered fairly. Most of us would recognise that as being due process
that allows somebody a legitimate voice in a decision of this kind.
This is delicate territory. We have to legislate with care and caution,
and we should do so in line with the Court&#146;s judgment. The
Government have always taken the view that it was right to bring our
legislation into line with that judgment. As the debate has progressed
in the other place and in Committee, we have concluded that it is right
to do so in this legislation, with the safeguards that I mentioned
enshrined
there.</div><a name="08101676000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000423"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> We move on to a different subject, which is
proposed in two very similar new clauses&#151;new clause 3 and
Government new clause 8. Earlier on in our deliberations, we
talked&#151;at least, I talked&#151;about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column94" />Column number: 94</div>the Government&#146;s vulnerable worker enforcement forum, which has
met over the past year and considered a number of issues in relation to
the vulnerability of people at work and their capacity to report
abuses, and the enforcement agency&#146;s capacity to act on those
reports. That is important in terms of the rights of vulnerable
workers, in terms of legitimate businesses, and in terms of the
taxpayer, who legitimately wishes to see the most effective use of
their funds in the enforcement of the law.</div>
<a name="08101676000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
forum&#146;s report, which was published in August, sets out a
programme to improve basic awareness of employment rights, to
facilitate and encourage the reporting of abuses and to take steps to
join up the workplace enforcement bodies and enhance their profile. One
key issue that the forum identified was the need for closer working
between the enforcement bodies. An important element of that is the
ability of the bodies to share information about non-compliance. That
is addressed in the new clause in my name and in that tabled by the
Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="08101676000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the forum recognised, there are currently barriers to effective
information sharing between some of the enforcement bodies, including
between those that enforce the national minimum wage and those that
enforce employment agency legislation. The Employment Agency Standards
Inspectorate can contact Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs,
which enforces the minimum wage, about potential non-compliance with
the minimum wage only before it has undertaken an inspection when a
complainant has clearly stated that there is a minimum wage issue or
where that is clear from the complaint. Once an inspection has started,
the current legal position is that it would be an offence to disclose
information obtained during the inspection. In those circumstances, the
agency standards inspectors can only advise the complainants to contact
the minimum wage
helpline.</div><a name="08101676000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">Information
about compliance with the minimum wage does not always come to light
until the inspection is carried out, by which time it would be too late
to pass from one agency to another. Clearly, there would be value in
the inspectorate being able to contact HMRC after an inspection has
been carried out, rather than having two sets of inspectors working in
silos, where once they had started their work, they were not able to
communicate with one another. The converse is also true: the
restriction on minimum wage officers being able to share information
about breaches of the law with regard to employment agencies or details
of non-compliant employers represents a similar barrier in the other
direction.</div>
<a name="08101676000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The minimum
wage enforcement team at HMRC visited 122 employment agencies last year
during the course of its national minimum wage enforcement. Of those,
30 were found to be non-compliant. Those 30 agencies may be
non-compliant in other ways too, so this is valuable and important
information sharing. There is really only one difference between the
two clauses dealing with this issue. The new clause in the name of the
Liberal Democrats deals with the particular bodies I mentioned in my
remarks, that is HMRC and ASI. The new clause in the name of the
Government deals with the Acts, which in terms of future-proofing,
should give us a little more flexibility to ensure that, were we to go
down that road, even if the bodies enforcing the provisions under these
Acts change in the future, the information-sharing permission which we
seek to gain through this new clause could
continue.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column95" />Column number: 95</div><a name="08101676000336"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="08101676000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Much
of this information between enforcement bodies is not a matter of
principle. It is more to do with when the founding legislation for a
particular body was passed by Parliament. For example, the Gangmasters
Licensing Authority which was established a couple of years ago does
not have this gateway problem of information-sharing. No one has
suggested that the fact it does not have such a gateway is a problem.
We are seeking to bring other bodies into line with that. Nor do I
pretend&#151;and it is important to stress this&#151;that with the
passage of this new clause we will have entirely dealt with the
difficulty of information-sharing between different enforcement bodies
in the employment field. What we would be doing is taking the earliest
possible legislative opportunity after the publication of the
vulnerable worker enforcement forum report to address the issue in the
context of agency standards and minimum wage. Although I am grateful to
the Liberal Democrats for tabling the amendment that addresses the same
issue, I believe that operating on the basis of the legislation rather
than particular bodies may be a better way to do it and I hope that
hon. Members
agree.</div><a name="08101676000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 21 provides for a commencement by order of new clause 8 and is
therefore consequential to it. Amendment No. 20 deals with the passage
of time. In the dim, distant and hopeful past there was a possibility
that this legislation may have completed its parliamentary passage by
now and, as hon. Members will be aware, the Government take the view
that when bringing in new legislation which has an effect on employers
or businesses, that it is best to do that on one of two common
commencement dates so that employers know when changes will come into
force. Hon. Members will see that clause 21 as it stands at line 16
refers to 1 October 2008 as a possible commencement date. That date has
clearly passed. By my watch, that is 15 days ago and this amendment
simply takes account of that to ensure a commencement date that is in
the
future.</div><a name="08101676000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000424"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I will not press new clause 3. It is not worth
arguing about the difference between it and new clause 8 which was
tabled
afterwards.</div><a name="08101676000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000425"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Regarding Government amendment No. 21, well
spotted to the Minister or perhaps others in his team. As for
Government amendment No. 20, yes, I fully appreciate that employers
like to know when things are coming up.</div>
<a name="08101676000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">My main
concern about new clause 8 relates to safeguards. Will the Minister
explain what safeguards he is proposing concerning the information that
will be kept? Will he please outline how such information will be
stored, how and when it will be transferred and when it will be
disposed of? The concern for small businesses is that once in the
system they will face arbitrary investigation as their details are
passed from one agency to another, perhaps on an ongoing basis or for
ever. Given the problems of lost data suffered by various Departments,
will the Minister assure me and small businesses that information will
be transferred only when absolutely necessary? I am interested to know
how the information transfers will take place. Will it be through a
centralised searchable database or by specific transfers on request? My
concern is that there may be additional administrative and financial
costs, when a simple phone call between investigators might be
adequate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column96" />Column number: 96</div><a name="08101676000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final
concern is with the phrase &#147;any purpose relating to that
Act&#148;, which is used extensively throughout new clause 8. It
strikes me as the sort of broad umbrella term that could hide a host of
things. What safeguards are there to ensure that this requirement will
be complied with? Should we not have more definite parameters than
&#147;any purpose relating to the Act&#148; within the
Bill  to ensure that the courts are not flooded with cases to
interpret that
phrase?</div><a name="08101676000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000426"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right to ask how the
clause will work and what we have in mind. As I said in my opening
remarks, when a minimum wage officer or agency standards inspector is
called to inspect an organisation because of a report, if they feel
that there is also a high risk of non-compliance in the other field of
law, they may tell the other enforcement body about it instead of two
sets of inspectors going in. Officers will be able to pass on
information about a business that is found to be non-compliant. I also
said such provisions operate without difficulty for the Gangmasters
Licensing Authority. As hon. Members may be aware, that body operates
in the field of agriculture and food production. The agency standards
inspectorate works in the rest of the
economy.</div><a name="08101676000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to reassure the hon. Gentleman on the issue of data loss. We
are not talking about the mass transfer of personal data, but the
inspection of employment premises with a view to ensuring that they
adhere to the law. We are fully aware of the concerns that he raised
and we take them
seriously.</div><a name="08101676000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 8 will not affect the legal restrictions that prevent agency
standards inspectors and minimum wage officers from disclosing
information to other bodies. The phrase &#147;any purpose relating to
that Act&#148; should not be too wide. It limits the use of the
information to the enforcement of the two pieces of legislation that
are specified. Both pieces of legislation contain criminal sanctions
for disclosure that is not for the purposes of the
legislation.</div><a name="08101676000155"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000427"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> There is a concern, particularly from small
businesses, about&#151;I was about to say policing by consent, but
perhaps inspecting by consent is a better phrase. First, it takes a lot
more time proportionally for a small business to deal with these
matters than it takes in a larger business. Secondly, if there is a
fear that inspection by one authority might lead to lots of other
inspections, there is a tendency to become defensive. That defensive
mechanism is not helpful to any of
us.</div><a name="08101676000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the need to ensure that those who are wilfully trying to get
round provisions such as the minimum wage should be treated in the way
that we would all wish to see. They should be paying the minimum wage;
there is no doubt about that, but I want the Minister to assure me that
it will be applied sensitively. I can see that, particularly over the
next two or three years, if we made a purge&#151;I know that that is
not in the Minister&#146;s mind&#151;or if any officers made a
purge, it could be disruptive and make it more difficult for small
businesses to operate in the way that we all want them
to.</div>
<a name="08101676000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000428"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I agree with most of what the hon. Gentleman has
said, but there is another side that we have to consider. He referred
to some of the earlier 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column97" />Column number: 97</div>deliberations on the Bill and to what happens when &#147;the inspector
calls&#148;&#151;I think that that was the phrase he used. The
amendment would mean that rather than having a series of inspectors
calling about different legislation, they would be able to talk to one
another in a way that they are legally prohibited from doing at the
moment. I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about small businesses
not wanting repeat visits, but I think that the provision could result
in fewer repeat visits rather than more. I appreciate the difficulties
of the small business&#151;I represent the Department of business
and, of course, we want small businesses to prosper. We fully
appreciate their
value.</div><a name="08101676000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
we must also place ourselves in the shoes of the vulnerable worker, who
does not know, and legitimately cannot be expected to know, what to do
if they face problems at work&#151;for example, if an agency supplied
them to an employer and charged them illegally for finding them work,
and they were possibly not paid the minimum wage or the holiday and
other pay to which they were entitled. Surely we should try to improve
the current situation, in which a person can find themselves having to
phone different Government helplines to try to report the problems. As
far as they are concerned, they just want to report their problem to
the Government. They do not know that the agency standards inspectorate
is part of BERR and that HMRC is part of the Treasury, or about
friendly and proper agreement about the enforcement of the minimum
wage.</div>
<a name="08101676000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through a lot
of the work on vulnerable workers, we are trying to transfer more of
the burden of navigating the system from the vulnerable worker to the
Government. That is certainly in the interests of the vulnerable
worker, but I stress that it is also in the interests of good and
legitimate business. The hon. Gentleman asked us to work with
sensitivity. I absolutely believe in working with sensitivity, but
there must be a tough edge to law enforcement on these areas, because
we are dealing with vulnerable workers and an overall theme of the Bill
is that enforcement has to get
tougher.</div><a name="08101676000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
took issue with the hon. Member for Solihull, who is not with us today,
when she raised the idea that, with the resources of the minimum wage
inspectorate, the chances of inspection were once every 300 years. We
do not want an inspection regime that simply sends people round the
country for no reason into legitimate businesses that are obeying the
law, paying and treating their workers properly and so on. We want it
to be risk-based and targeted, in the interests of business and of the
taxpayer. We will operate with sensitivity, but we are also determined
to enforce the law. The new clause will help us to do that more
effectively.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000432"></a>John
Hemming:</b> There has been some concern about this issue. New
clause 7 would have similar effect to new clause 1, which is meant to
probe the issue. Depending on the Government&#146;s response,
however, we might be inclined to divide on new clause 7, if the hon.
Member for Huntingdon wants to do
so.</div><a name="08101676000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
issue is important because it is complicated to have a mix of service
charges and extra bits on credit cards with some things being paid
through the payroll and others not. Some subtlety is required to handle
the matter. Perhaps there should be a standard service charge rather
than it simply being put in the price, so that there is clarity. I am
interested to hear what the Government have to say on
that.</div><a name="08101676000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000433"></a>Mr.
Crabb:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,
Mr. Caton. Obviously, I rise to speak to the new clause
tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon, but I support the
sentiment in the new clause tabled by the Liberal Democrats.</div>
<a name="08101676000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the start
of the Committee&#146;s proceedings on Tuesday, the Minister referred
to an article that he had read in the <i class="I">Sunday Mirror </i>purporting
to convey some foresight into what might be a future Conservative
Government&#146;s approach to the minimum wage. On behalf of the
Conservatives, I should say that we are positive about the minimum
wage. When discussing an amendment earlier this afternoon, my hon.
Friend said that changes can occur in political parties. One change in
our party is that we recognise that the minimum wage has been a good
thing, and we want it to be properly enforced and to be
effective.</div><a name="08101676000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are also positive about the service industry. We recognise that we have
a vibrant, successful service sector that is an increasingly important
component of the economy, and we want that success to continue. Our new
clause would support a successful and vibrant service-based economy,
from the perspective of both employees and employers. From an
employer&#146;s perspective, our new clause would make a significant
difference to many people working in caf(c)s, restaurants or
hairdressers. Let us take, for example, the case of a student working
in a city centre restaurant, doing three shifts a week, six hours each
shift, totalling 18 hours a week. That person might be paid the minimum
wage rate of &#163;5.73 an hour and can expect to take home
&#163;103.14. If they anticipate that they will receive &#163;20 in
tips per night, which is not unusual in a city centre restaurant, an
extra &#163;60 will bring their wage up to &#163;163.14. By having
a properly enforced minimum wage, &#163;163 is far better than if
they were receiving a wage below that
level.</div><a name="08101676000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us compare that scenario to the one uncovered by <i class="I">The Independent on
Sunday</i> and reported on in May this year. It was about a leading
Italian restaurant chain that employed its 300 members of staff at
&#163;3.75 an hour. There was a substantial difference in what those
employees were taking home. The company said in its defence that it
took care to maintain that the money that its employees received at the
end of each week or month was equivalent to the minimum wage level, and
that it bumped it up to ensure that its staff received at least the
minimum wage. That defence was weak.</div>
<a name="08101676000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">Many
restaurant owners argue that that it creates an incentive for good
performance on the part of their staff if they know that they need to
work hard and put 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column100" />Column number: 100</div>in a good performance just to bring their wage up to the minimum wage
level. I do not buy that. A far more powerful incentive for employees
in caf(c)s, restaurants, hairdressers&#151;or whatever the
service-based scenario&#151;is to be guaranteed a decent legal
minimum wage at the end of each week, knowing that whatever tips,
bonuses or gratuities they receive are in recognition of extra-good
performance.</div><a name="08101676000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sure that I am not the only hon. Member who has experienced
particularly bad service or an unhelpful, stroppy waiter or waitress,
nor would I be the first to observe that we have a problem of patchy
quality in our service sector. Guaranteeing a decent minimum wage for
people in the service sector will help to raise their esteem and lead
to overall gain for the industry and the British
economy.</div><a name="08101676000181"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000434"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I support new clause 7, and I largely support what
my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire has said, but I
want it to go a lot further. It hinges on the word
&#147;gratuity&#148;&#151;a tip. A gratuity is given to someone
who has done something above what we would normally expect them to do
for us. The whole issue of tipping is completely out of control in this
country. I have never understood why a taxi driver who is rendering us
a service when we contract him to take us from A to B expects a 10, 11
or 12 per cent. tip on top. Even when I was a little younger than I am
now, taxi drivers used to emerge from the comfort and warmth of their
front seats to open the door and help elderly people with suitcases.
Alas, that is no longer the case, yet they still expect a tip on top of
what we pay them. That is completely
unacceptable.</div><a name="08101676000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
represent a constituency that has many people working in the service
industry. The industry is casual and seasonable, and it pays a low
wage. To them, the minimum wage is important. I would come down harder
than my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire on the Italian
restaurateur, or on any other restaurateur who acted in that way. There
is evidence throughout the country of people regarding gratuities or
tipping as a supplement with which to bring poor wages up to the
minimum wage. Such a practice should be illegal, and it should be
enshrined in law that it can never happen.</div>
<a name="08101676000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000435"></a>Mr.
Crabb:</b> For the sake of clarity, I too regard it as
absolutely unacceptable for a chain of restaurants to use arguments
about incentives as a smokescreen for paying an illegal wage to its
workers.</div><a name="08101676000184"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000436"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Indeed. If I suggested that my hon. Friend did not
feel as strongly about the matter as I do, I completely withdraw that
remark.</div><a name="08101676000185"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000437"></a>Mary
Creagh:</b> I am sure that all members of the Committee feel
strongly about it. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we need to put an
end to the practice whereby restaurants automatically add the service
charge to a bill but leave the total blank so that people unwittingly
add an extra amount? That is bad for consumers as well as for
staff.</div><a name="08101676000186"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000438"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> The hon. Lady is stealing my script. I completely
agree with her. An hon. Member&#151;I cannot remember who&#151;was
going to introduce a private Member&#146;s 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column101" />Column number: 101</div>Bill on the whole question of tipping, but alas he lost his seat or is
otherwise no longer with us. I am quite tempted to do the same,
although I do not want to lose my own seat. Nor do I wish to irritate
the entire taxi-driving community of London, although I fear that I
have already done so. I shall have to resort to my Vespa motorcycle,
which I ride most days anyway like a good green
Conservative.</div><a name="08101676000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady rightly raised another issue about gratuities and tipping in
general. As well as the appalling practice whereby service is added on
and then the bill is left open, when one asks whether service is
included it can seem almost like a threat to be told, &#147;Yes, 12.5
per cent.&#148; or whatever, as if that is not enough. Where does
that money go? Increasingly often, I ask waitresses and waiters, many
of whom come from eastern Europe and many of whom are struggling
students, what happens to their tips. When I hear that they are all
pooled and handed out at the end of the week, I do not much like the
sound of that
either.</div><a name="08101676000188"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000439"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. We are getting into the issue of tipping
generally. It would be useful if the hon. Gentleman could bring the

wage.</div><a name="08101676000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000440"></a>Mr.

<a name="08101676000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000441"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that bringing in
such a change would make a distinction between the service charge,
which is really a way of hiding part of the price of the food, and a
gratuity, which is a bonus for extra
work?</div><a name="08101676000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000442"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> Absolutely right. A gratuity is a gratuity. As I
said, it should reward service that is way and above that which one
would normally expect to
receive.</div><a name="08101676000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000443"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I am getting a little concerned about the
anti-business attitude in all this, and I want to defend the people who
act properly with their staff. Many of those who levy a service charge,
whether or not my hon. Friend agrees with that, act properly towards
their staff and ensure that they receive it. There is a difference
between a service charge, which embraces the whole of the operation,
and a gratuity to a given waiter or waitress. We have to be careful
that we are not seen as being seen as
anti-business.</div><a name="08101676000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000444"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I do not agree with my hon. Friend. I have never
understood why one needs to pay any kind of charge to sit at a table in
a restaurant when one is going to pay for one&#146;s food. A gratuity
is for service, and it should go to the person who is serving. That is
why I increasingly pay in cash at the end of my meal to ensure that it
goes to the waiter serving me and is not used by the proprietor to get
that person up to the level of the minimum
wage.</div><a name="08101676000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000445"></a>Mr.
Crabb:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that if people go into
restaurants feeling compelled to tip merely to ensure that whoever
serves them, whether they perform well or badly, receives a legal wage
at the end of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>week, that dilutes the potency of a well run system of gratuities? At
the end of each night or each week, an employer should have an idea of
which staff are receiving large gratuities or tips and which are not.
That sends a good economic signal to him about how well his staff and
his business overall are doing, and it is therefore
pro-business.</div>
<a name="08101676000195"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000446"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I agree. I do not believe that any well run
business&#151;I have many in my constituency and there are many up
and down the country&#151;should have to resort to any underhand way
of paying their staff through the gratuities left by their customers.
That is not anti-business&#151;it is pro-employee and pro-well run
businesses.</div><a name="08101676000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000447"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I therefore assume that the hon. Gentleman would
agree that suggesting to businesses that they make it clear what the
price list on the menu means is not anti-business but good for business
because it provides
clarity.</div><a name="08101676000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000448"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I agree. We are very dependent on tourists in the
south-west&#151;we have 15 million of them. No doubt many more would
come if the trade unions did not ban them from trade union homes in the
south-west, but we have to overcome that. Of course we want tourists,
not all of whom are English or speak English as their first language.
They might come to London, or wherever, and not understand about
service charges and whether they have to tip. It is a complete mess. In
no sense is this proposal anti-business&#151;it is pro-business and
good for well run businesses. Gratuities should not be used as a
supplement in order to pay the minimum
wage.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000449"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The new clauses cover an issue that we all care
about and which has come into increasing prominence over the last
couple of years. The minimum wage, which we have discussed during
consideration of the Bill, has evolved over time. For example, the
situation for 16 and 17-year-olds was changed a few years ago. We have
discussed changes with regard to voluntary workers and expenses, and
the law has changed with regard to work experience and so
on.</div><a name="08101676000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is one such change, and it is something that I have wanted do since I
became employment relations Minister. In July, I was pleased to
announce that the Government would change the law to ensure that tips
could no longer count to make up the minimum wage. That is profoundly
within the instincts of the British people, and I was glad to make that
announcement.</div><a name="08101676000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
we leave a tip in a restaurant, however it is divided among the
staff&#151;I might come on to that&#151;we expect that it will be
additional to the minimum wage and will go to the staff who served us,
on top of their pay. It should not be used to make up the minimum
wage.</div><a name="08101676000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire said that some businesses operate
a system in which they guarantee the minimum wage, although some of it
will be made up from tips. At the moment, that is not illegal if the
tips or gratuities are processed through the payroll. Things partly
depend on that. The change would ensure that all tips were additional
to pay. We have announced that, and we believe it is the right thing to
do.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div><a name="08101676000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the law,
all workers are entitled to the minimum wage. The measure will deal
with the situation raised by the hon. Gentleman so that the practice of
using tips to make up the minimum wage will no longer be possible. That
is why we announced the change several months ago.</div>
<a name="08101676000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
question about what happens to tips. It is more difficult to legislate
on that, but we would all like to achieve transparency. In the end, the
money is ours as customers&#151;as the hon. Gentleman said, we can
choose to leave or not leave a tip, or to leave a smaller one should we
wish. We must work with the hospitality industry to promote
transparency over what happens to tips. That is equally as important as
changing the law to ensure that tips are additional to the minimum
wage.</div>
<a name="08101676000204"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000450"></a>Mr.
Swire:</b> I risk your wrath, Mr. Caton, but I
agree with what the Minister says. I am sure that he and all members of
the Committee can give examples of when, after an indifferent meal,
they did not seek to reward that indifference, although they wanted to
reward the waiter who provided first-class
service.</div>
<a name="08101676000205"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000451"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is a fair point. For the purposes of the
Government and the law, the critical point is that in future tips
should be in addition to the minimum wage. As customers, we expect that
to happen with our tips. I have not carried out a scientific poll, but
I suspect that most customers would not like to think that their tips
were making up the minimum wage.</div>
<a name="08101676000206"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000452"></a>John
Hemming:</b> How is this going to be implemented in
law?</div><a name="08101676000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000453"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The hon. Gentleman is anticipating me. I have
explained how the regulations work at the moment: a service charge,
tip, gratuity or cover charge that is paid to the worker through the
payroll may, legally, count towards payment or part-payment of the
minimum wage. We are seeking to address that
issue.</div><a name="08101676000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the end of July, we announced our intentions, and I am pleased to tell
the Committee that my Department is preparing a consultation document,
which we shall publish in a matter of weeks. We shall consult the
hospitality industry on precise implementation. We have heard various
comments today about service charges, gratuities, tips and so
on&#151;it is true that there are all those different practices. When
making such a change, it is right to consult the
industry.</div><a name="08101676000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
also pay tribute to the people who campaigned for the change. The
campaign has increased substantially over the past couple of years. We
have heard a lot of talk about trade unions in our deliberations. I do
not want to go over all that again, but a number of unions campaigned
on the issue and, in doing so, were campaigning for something very much
in line with public instincts. Our intention is to consult on exactly
how to do this, but let me leave no doubt about the Government&#146;s
intentions to do it, which will be made clear in a document in the next
few
weeks.</div><a name="08101676000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for the amendments, we do not need to make the change through primary
legislation. We can do it through the minimum wage regulations, which
are debated in the House every year. We have a route forward, having
consulted with the industry. There is substantial unity 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column104" />Column number: 104</div>in Committee&#151;across all three parties&#151;that the issue is
one that we want to address. As I said, the Government have announced a
firm intention to do so. There is no need to do anything through the
Bill or primary legislation. Fairness on tips unites us. On that basis,
I hope we can move
forward.</div><a name="08101676000211"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000454"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Obviously the issue can be dealt with through
secondary legislation. Therefore, there is an argument for new clause 1
to be withdrawn, but new clause 7 would create a duty on the Government
to act as they intend, which, perhaps, would give legislative cover.
That would not be subject to judicial review, which secondary
legislation can be. On new clause 1, however, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08101676000212"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

we get a more substantive response from the Government, the new clause
is a key issue that will require a Division of the
Committee.</div><a name="08101676000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
essence, the new clause looks at what would happen if someone did not
pay the employment tribunal award. As it stands, there would then be a
civil enforcement process. We will come to the fact that equality of
arms is the key issue. A lot of the people who are trying to get money
that has not been paid to them are in a challenging position, having to
go to a civil court and go through that process. The new clause would
put a duty on the Government to produce secondary legislation. We are
not trying to specify in minute detail how that should be done&#151;I
would not be surprised if this proposal had been drafted by Citizens
Advice, but I am not 100 per cent. certain, not having been involved at
that
stage.</div><a name="08101676000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
should recognise that there is a real problem here. The Government need
to act. This is the right vehicle to create regulations enabling the
enforcement process to be handled, so I would like to press new clause
2 to a vote, unless the Government pull some legislative rabbit out of
the hat.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column105" />Column number: 105</div><a name="08101676000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000456"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I put my name to the new clause on a probing
basis, because important questions raised in the other place have not
yet been answered. The Government say that they recognise that there is
a need to address the recovery of awards, but they do not believe that
direct enforcement is the way to deal with such claims. Will the
Minister tell us what form enforcement should take
instead?</div><a name="08101676000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause deals with a problem that is often faced by those at the
poorer end of the employment spectrum. It was originally tabled in the
other place by Baroness Turner at the request of Citizens Advice, with
the aim of dealing with the problem of non-payment of employment
tribunal awards by rogue
employers.</div><a name="08101676000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current system is long and complex, and sometimes prohibitively
expensive for those who have not been paid their award. There are, on
average, some 15,000 employment tribunal awards made in favour of
claimants each year, but Citizens Advice estimates that more than one
in 10 does not receive their award. Citizens advice bureaux dealt with
more than 1,000 cases last year alone, and Citizens Advice research
also highlights the fact that nearly half those unpaid awards were for
less than &#163;2,000 and almost a quarter were for less than
&#163;1,000.</div><a name="08101676000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
those vulnerable workers affected, navigating the county court or High
Court enforcement process can be a daunting challenge that involves a
lot of time, stress and cost relative to the value of the award.
Citizens Advice notes that many of those affected simply do not take
their claims forward, that the impact on them can be devastating and
that the total loss involved may be as much as &#163;7 million per
year. Rogue employers&#146; knowledge of the complexity of
enforcement provisions means that they could see it as a commercial
decision to avoid paying out, because, on balance, they might save more
than they would be forced to pay out in the longer
term.</div><a name="08101676000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have said that they commissioned their own inquiry on this
area, on the back of Citizens Advice. Will the Minister tell us what
format the inquiry has taken and what results it has produced to date,
bearing it in mind that the inquiry has been running at least from
May?</div><a name="08101676000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is a wrong here that needs to be recognised. I am interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s reaction to the question whether the new clause
is the right way to go about
that.</div><a name="08101676000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000457"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> I would like to know what the problem is. At
present, this is a straightforward issue of the judgment&#151;the
award&#151;being registered in the county court and then enforced.
There are problems with county court enforcements: often the employer
does not have the money; it is a matter of the resources not being
there. I cannot see how a new system&#151;a new bureaucracy of
enforcement&#151;would
help.</div><a name="08101676000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to discover how this new organisation would operate under the new
clause. How would it differ from the current, relatively simple process
of attaching an affidavit to the award and registering it in the county
court? That is all that happens at the moment. Then there is the
enforcement problem to consider. Is it being suggested that the rules
under the new clause should be enforced in respect of criminal
proceedings, such as an award in a magistrates court? What is the logic
behind 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column106" />Column number: 106</div>the new clause that would make its new methods of enforcement different
from those now available in the county
court?</div><a name="08101676000226"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000458"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that
important and valid issue. It has been raised a number of times with me
by Citizens Advice, which has campaigned long and hard on it, and is
campaigning for proper enforcement of tribunal awards. This is about
not an extension of the law, but its
enforcement.</div><a name="08101676000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
July, I met representatives of Citizens Advice with the Under-Secretary
of State for Justice, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East
(Bridget Prentice), to discuss the matter. I put on record my thanks to
my hon. Friend for taking the matter so seriously, particularly in
recent months as we have been discussing it with Citizens
Advice.</div><a name="08101676000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Huntingdon said, the new clause follows on from a
similar one tabled in the other place during earlier stages of
consideration of the Bill. It would allow the Secretary of State to
provide by regulation for an organisation or organisations to enforce
employment tribunal decisions that remained unpaid on the due date,
which is normally 42 days after judgment on behalf of the
claimant.</div><a name="08101676000339"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="08101676000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
Lord Bach said in the other place, the Government recognise the need to
do more. He laid out some steps that are being taken by the Ministry of
Justice, which has responsibility for the issue. I will recap those
briefly. First, there are measures in the Tribunals, Courts and
Enforcement Act 2007 that, when implemented in the secondary
legislation to which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley referred,
will allow unpaid awards and legally binding agreements brokered by
ACAS to be automatically registered as country court orders so that the
full range of enforcement options can be
pursued.</div><a name="08101676000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Importantly,
unpaid awards will be included on the register of judgments, orders and
fines, which is often consulted by banks and credit companies when
considering applications for credit. The Ministry of Justice is working
to introduce those measures by April next year, which is the same date
as the implementation date for the changes to the dispute resolution
system which we have been
discussing.</div><a name="08101676000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the Ministry of Justice is undertaking research to explore the extent
of non-payment. I appreciate that there has been research by Citizens
Advice, which has been referred to, but the Government are carrying out
research on the issue. The hon. Member for Huntingdon asked about the
dates for that research. It started on 8 September and will
report by 26 November. Citizens Advice has helpfully published its own
research, which will contribute to that work. Taken together, the two
studies will provide detailed evidence of the extent to which
employment tribunal awards remain unpaid. That will give the Ministry
of Justice a firm basis for considering what further steps are
appropriate, bearing in mind the changes in the 2007
Act.</div><a name="08101676000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have met Citizens Advice to discuss the issue and I understand the
difficulty for vulnerable workers. It is important that the Committee
is aware that there is an exemption from court fees for claimants in
receipt of income support and the other key means-tested benefits, and
for those whose annual income is below a certain 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column107" />Column number: 107</div>threshold. That includes fees for enforcement directly through the
county courts, but not for enforcement by High Court enforcement
officers.</div><a name="08101676000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am pleased to say that the Ministry of Justice is committed to
continuing to work with Citizens Advice to review and approve where
possible the process for the enforcement of awards. One option that
will be discussed is the Citizens Advice proposal for High Court
enforcement officers in this area. Ministry of Justice officials are
already in touch with Citizens Advice on the
matter.</div><a name="08101676000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
summary, I believe that this is a valid issue to raise. We all want
people who win their case at tribunal to get the award to which they
are entitled. I take this matter seriously. I assure the Committee that
the Ministry of Justice also takes it seriously. We will maintain a
dialogue with Citizens Advice on it. I do not think we can say at this
stage whether the method proposed in the new clause is the right one.
However, I accept the validity of the issue and guarantee that we will
maintain a dialogue with Citizens
Advice.</div><a name="08101676000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000459"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I understand from the Minister&#146;s response
that there is automatic registration of judgments for ACAS agreements
but not for tribunal agreements. One would presume that the objective
is to ensure the automatic registration of judgments from the tribunal
in the county court. That could be done by the employment tribunal
service
itself.</div><a name="08101676000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000460"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I think I am right in saying that that does
include the automatic registration of tribunal judgments. When I
mentioned ACAS-brokered agreements, I did not mean that only those were
registered and not employment tribunal
judgments.</div><a name="08101676000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000461"></a>John

<div class="Column"><a name="Column108" />Column number: 108</div><a name="08101676000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is
another probing provision, which looks at having a body where the

that.</div><a name="08101676000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000463"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The hon. Gentleman said that this was a probing
provision. I have two concerns about it. First, the emphasis once again
seems to be on a new body to deal with problems of enforcement, and I
fear that that might create undue costs for not enough benefit. The
Bill already contains provisions to strengthen the investigative powers
of the employment agency standards inspectorate in enforcing the
Employment Agencies Act 1973 and related regulations, including powers
to allow EAS inspectors to demand and secure copies of financial
information from an agency or suspect directly, or from their bank or
building society. I suggest that we give some time at least for those
provisions to bed in and take effect, and that we then review the
effectiveness of what we have done in this Bill, rather than too
quickly forming a new body with sweeping powers of
investigation.</div><a name="08101676000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second concern is that a balance must be maintained between the freedom
of business to go unhindered by arbitrary state intervention and that
of the individual to fully enjoy the rights afforded to him by law. I
am concerned that such a balance is not achieved by the new clause, and
that we would simply be creating another body and yet more red
tape.</div><a name="08101676000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000464"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The idea of a fair employment commission was
suggested in a report published by the TUC earlier this year. It had
established a body called the commission on vulnerable employment,
which looked into this whole area, and that idea was one of its
recommendations. The issue is what we mean by such a body, and whether
we mean the combination of all the agencies covered by new clause 4.
The issue of the closer co-ordination of the enforcement agencies has
been raised with the Government. I am certainly committed to such
co-ordination; it is in the interests of vulnerable workers, reputable
business and the taxpayer. The question is whether we need to bring all
the agencies together in one body. I am not sure that that would be the
most effective way to
proceed.</div><a name="08101676000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
the Government have agreed to do is to set up a board&#151;the fair
employment enforcement board&#151;which will bring together all the
agencies to ensure that they can co-ordinate their work and that we get
the best value for money from the taxpayer, and also to deal with some
of the silo issues that we have discussed. Representatives of the TUC,
the CBI and the Federation of Small Businesses will also be on the
board, because it is important that we hear the views of both employees
and business as we discuss enforcement. My experience is that when it
comes to proper enforcement, the CBI and the TUC often
agree&#151;they both have a great interest in strong and effective
enforcement.</div>
<a name="08101676000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
board&#146;s work will focus on helping vulnerable workers and their
employers by improving enforcement, raising awareness of employment
rights, and so on. The board will meet for the first time next month,
and its key focus will be to oversee delivery of the key measures in
the vulnerable workers forum report, which was published a few months
ago. Those measures include the development of plans to pilot a single
enforcement 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 109</div>helpline and a review of the strategies for taking forward a sustained
campaign to raise awareness of basic rights and to encourage reporting
of abuses. I am all for closer co-ordination but I am not sure that it
is necessary to have a single enforcement body as the clause implies.
Putting that together could absorb a great deal of institutional energy
rather than doing the job for which the enforcement bodies were set up.
That will be what the new board tries to take forward rather than the
picture painted in the new clause. This is again about transferring
more of the burden for navigating the system from the vulnerable
workers themselves to the Government.</div>
<a name="08101676000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate
where the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley is coming from, but
closer co-ordination, better working together and better value for
money are probably a better route than full merger or the creation of a
single commission. We have gone some way towards achieving that and I
hope that it will be
effective.</div><a name="08101676000248"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000466"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="08101676000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now go
back to the first part of this Bill, dealing with employment tribunals.
At the start we discussed the procedure of employment tribunals and
penalties for non-compliance. I said at the time that it was difficult
to have that debate without discussing vexatious claims, not least
because we did not have the facts and statistics to make a decision in
relation to the procedural aspects, but also because vexatious claims
are of most concern to employers. Now we can have that debate in an
area where there are more statistics on vexatious
claims.</div><a name="08101676000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause has two proposed subsections, the first stating
that</div>
<a name="08101676000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
losing party in any proceedings before an employment tribunal should
bear the costs of the winning party.&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 110</div><a name="08101676000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 1999, on average
111,754 claims have been accepted every year by employment tribunals,
of which only 15 per cent. are successful; 66 per cent. are
withdrawn or settled; and 19 per cent.&#151;some 21,233&#151;are
dismissed or unsuccessful. Given that the estimated average cost to
employers of defending a tribunal case is about &#163;9,000 and
almost 10 days of lost time, it is unsurprising that the CBI reports
that a quarter of cases are settled by employers, despite receiving
advice that they are likely to win. This pattern is especially true for
small and medium-sized companies that are less likely to have internal
resources or legal advisers to fight claims on their
behalf.</div><a name="08101676000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is another recurring pattern with small businesses, in that tribunal
applications are disproportionately high in small employers,
particularly those employing between 50 and 249 employees&#151;215
applicants came from a group of employees that employ only 4 per cent.
of the work force. Taken together, those businesses that employ fewer
than 250 people are respondents in 62 per cent. of cases but employ
only 37 per cent. of the labour
force.</div><a name="08101676000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">Business
organisations report that there is a culture of settling cases to get
rid of them, which is encouraged by the fact that costs are rarely
awarded against litigants, and complainants may have relatively few
costs of their own. Employers believe that cases are pursued using
no-win, no-fee lawyers in the expectation that businesses will settle a
claim at a level below what they believe it would cost to defend it at
hearing.</div><a name="08101676000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Take,
for instance, the case of the Law Society in 2001, when it ran up costs
of more than &#163;1 million defending itself against claims of race
and sex discrimination made by its former vice-president, who had
previously been forced to resign after allegations that she herself had
bullied and harassed staff. Despite finding that the claimant had
indeed created an atmosphere of &#147;fear and dread&#148;, and
that she had also lied under oath, a tribunal found in her favour after
a six-week
trial.</div><a name="08101676000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Employment Tribunal Service reported in 2003-04 that 976 awards of
costs had been made&#151;34 per cent. to claimants and 66 per cent.
to respondents&#151;out of 30,107 claims that went to a hearing, the
average order being &#163;1,859. By 2006-07, that figure had shifted
with 509 cost orders being made: 32 per cent. to claimants and 68 per
cent. to respondents. The average award was &#163;2,078, but the
maximum was &#163;65,000. That means that costs were awarded to
employers in fewer than 0.3 per cent. of all cases, with the majority
getting less than &#163;1,000. To compound this, the number of cases
accepted by employment tribunals has gone up since 2004-05 from 86,000
to 132,000 in 2006-07, an increase of 53 per
cent.</div>
<a name="08101676000340"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="08101676000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations
2001 introduced changes to the employment tribunals rules, including an
increase in the maximum amount of unassessed costs that tribunals could
award from &#163;500 to &#163;10,000, and the power to make an
order for costs in cases where a claim had been misconceived. Rules 39
and 40 set out when an award of costs must and may be made
respectively. Employment tribunals must make an award only where a
hearing is postponed because a business fails to adduce reasonable
evidence as to the availability of the job, or a comparable one, from
which the claimant was dismissed or, alternatively, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>if the claimant informs the respondent business at least seven days
before the hearing that they seek re-engagement. This is a provision
that will hardly set the mind of small businesses at ease when they
consider the cost of defending themselves.</div>
<a name="08101676000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule 40
allows employment tribunals to make cost awards where claimants have
brought proceedings and have</div>
<a name="08101676000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;acted
vexatiously, abusively, disruptively, or otherwise unreasonably, or
that the bringing or conducting of proceedings has been
misconceived.&#148;</div>
<a name="08101676000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">If that is the case,
the employment tribunal must then consider whether it should exercise
its discretion to make a costs order. Employment tribunals have been
held to have acted erroneously in three cases, because after finding
that the case fell in to one of the headings in rule 40(2) they did not
then separately consider whether they should exercise their discretion
to make a costs award.</div>
<a name="08101676000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
discretion to make such awards in favour of businesses is hampered by
this dual procedural hurdle. Can the Minister tell the Committee how
often cost orders are made under this provision? The scope of these
powers when combined with statistics that I outlined earlier makes me
deeply suspicious that employment tribunals are ruling against awarding
costs to companies in a disproportionately high number of cases. While
I accept that a few small businesses may employ sharp practice and
deserve to be brought to book, it is the widespread belief of business
in the UK that the tribunals have a predisposition towards claimants
and that in any event the system is such that companies are being
forced to settle because of the costs of the system.</div>
<a name="08101676000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill
seems to be saying that dealing with the procedural issues will solve
the problem, which is not at all the case. To that end, my amendment
seeks to redress the balance and ensure that businesses are not
penalised disproportionately by employment tribunals into paying the
costs of claimants. The second part of new clause 5 suggests that up to
25 per cent. of any claim can be awarded to the defendant as a penalty
on the claimant in the event that the claimant&#146;s action is
deemed vexatious.</div>
<a name="08101676000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rise in
employment claims since 2000 has been almost unstoppable on the back a
compensation culture that is spiralling out of control, according to
the CBI deputy director-general. He said:</div>
<a name="08101676000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I
visited a company where they had a security camera showing an employee
leaving his shift, getting on his bike and falling off outside the
factory gates. What he did then was to get up, get on his bike, come
back into the company&#146;s gates and fall off
again.&#148;</div><a name="08101676000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
2004 the CBI employers association said that 69 per cent. of firms
thought more employees were bringing weak and vexatious claims. The CBI
now reports that 44 per cent. of respondents to its CBI/Pertemps
employment trends survey 2008 felt that weak and vexatious claims have
increased over the past year. It goes on to point out that employers
believe that far too many weak claims proceed through to tribunal as
some tribunal offices are reluctant to use the powers available to
them. It is felt that this is an issue of resources, as the existing
powers could be used more effectively and consistently with better
filtering of claims during the stage at which they are issued to
tribunal.</div><a name="08101676000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
recent weeks, I have spoken to various organisations that have raised
concerns about the record of employment tribunals, especially in
relation to vexatious litigants 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 112</div>and the cost of proceedings being disproportionately heavy on small
businesses. We must appreciate that we are not talking about large
outfits with big human resources departments. Often, those operating
small businesses with one or two employees are no more sophisticated
than the employees who are bringing the
claims.</div><a name="08101676000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s &#147;Survey of Employment
Tribunal Applications&#148; in 2003 estimated the cost of employment
tribunal proceedings to business as &#163;4,362 per business. That
does not include the main cost: that of time. On average, about 9.8
days were spent on a claim, 7.7 days of which were the time of
directors or senior managers. Further figures for 2005-06 estimated
that the average cost to the Exchequer of each claim was &#163;606.
Given those figures, the cost for the 19 per cent. of dismissed or
unsuccessful cases is about &#163;93 million for employers
and &#163;12 million for the Exchequer. Can the Minister give us the
preliminary figures for this
year?</div><a name="08101676000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">While
I accept that not all dismissed cases are vexatious, a considerable
proportion are. An example is the employee who was caught dealing
cannabis at work and admitted that he had been doing so for some time.
He was dismissed, but claimed unfair dismissal and his notice money.
The case went to a hearing but he did not turn up. Nevertheless, the
company&#146;s representatives were made to go through the evidence
to get the case rejected. Another example is the case of an accountant
who claimed under disability discrimination law for a disability of
acute anxiety about her work performance, which prevented her from
working to deadlines or submitting herself to appraisal. She argued
that her employer had not sufficiently adjusted her working conditions
to take account of that. At lunch time during the tribunal hearing she
disappeared. The case was abandoned, leaving the employer with
substantial, irrecoverable legal
costs.</div><a name="08101676000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">Rule
18(8) of the employment tribunal rules, which are set out in schedule 1
to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure)
Regulations 2004, enables an employment tribunal to strike out a claim.
There are provisions for deposits to be paid and for restriction of
proceedings orders to be made against vexatious claimants. It seems
strange that the Government have been looking to amend employment
tribunal powers when the current rules are so clearly underused. Should
they not instead insist that tribunals use those powers more
effectively? Many businesses, along with my party, believe that this
issue must be dealt with. How does the Minister intend to get tribunals
to work more fairly against vexatious claimants and prevent more from
trying it on in the
future?</div><a name="08101676000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause is designed to ensure that vexatious claimants are penalised
for wasting the time of the employment tribunal and, more importantly,
the employer. I have already noted that the cost to business is in
excess of &#163;93 million each year and to the Exchequer,
&#163;12 million. Is it not about time that those who
cause that out-of-pocket expense start helping towards its
repayment?</div><a name="08101676000272"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000467"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> From experience, I take issue with the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s claim that the majority of claimants who fail are
vexatious. That is not the case. The majority who fail misunderstand
the situation. Some are vexatious, but as he rightly points out, the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>rules already exist. For many reasons, I strongly oppose cost orders
being made against every losing litigant, which is what he is calling
for.</div><a name="08101676000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
us be clear: tribunals are not courts of law. They may be becoming so
and that is unfortunate. The purpose of the tribunal system was that a
layman could go along and do his stuff. He could explain what happened
and the tribunal chair or others would assist. If anything is to be
done, and if I were advising the Minister, I would suggest throwing
away the tribunal rules and starting again.</div>
<a name="08101676000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">The process
has become far too complex and that is why it has become so costly. The
figures given by the hon. Gentleman for the average cost of proceedings
are probably about right because of the complexities. Every time that
the rules are changed, they become more complex, more difficult and
simply not understandable to the average litigant. For that reason,
claims are often brought not because of vexatious behaviour, but
because people do not understand the situation properly. That would be
my plea. To penalise someone who believes that they have a reasonable
claim, of whatever nature, seems to be wrong in principle. It would
deter people who had genuine
grievances.</div><a name="08101676000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am sympathetic to the small employer, and I realise that requirements
create a great burden. In the main part, most or many of them are
insured, but when that is not the case, it can be a problem. However,
the litigant or applicant, who may have lost a job through unfair
dismissal, will not have any resources, unless they can persuade the
citizens advice bureau to take on the case for them. Incidentally,
yesterday I wrongly took the lead from an Opposition Member in saying
that citizens advice bureaux do not assist employers. Citizens Advice
has written to me today to say that it is very happy to help small
employers, as well as employees, in seeking legal advice.</div>
<a name="08101676000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very much
hope that the Minister will reject the proposal in all cases, although
I agree that, where there is genuine vexatious conduct by either party,
it should be properly
penalised.</div><a name="08101676000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000468"></a>John
Hemming:</b> I echo the substance of what the hon. Gentleman
just said. When a lay person, who is on a low income and has not been
paid their wages, comes to a process, we do not want him to be
frightened by potential costs incurred on the other side. That does not
mean that costs should never be awarded, but perhaps we should, in
looking at this, take a lesson from the small claims court. It could be
argued that, if someone has initiated a claim at a lesser level, he
should feel invulnerable from costs, but at greater levels the issue
becomes much more complex.</div>
<a name="08101676000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the
things that substantially changed the nature of employment tribunals
was when the maximum was increased from &#163;12,000. I do not think
that anyone is suggesting that we go back to that, but it did mean that
that was the maximum cost that anyone incurred. The question that has
to be asked is whether we should look at this from the point of view of
costs and the magnitude of the initial claim. If the magnitude of the
initial claim is not that great, it allows people to make a commercial
decision to concede the claim, rather than 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 114</div>to fight it, which is not necessarily ideal. Obviously, the
Government&#146;s proposals to try and resolve things before they go
to tribunal is definitely a good one, but we would oppose introducing a
general &#147;costs awarded every time&#148;
approach.</div><a name="08101676000279"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000469"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> I welcome the Government&#146;s proposals to
deal with most of these matters at an earlier stage. That is absolutely
right and
proper.</div><a name="08101676000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have, in part, created a blackmail culture. I shall explain what I mean
by that from personal experience. I have had the sad opportunity of
handling two industrial tribunals, both of which we won. In both of
them, the company that I had started was told that it was not at fault
and the recipients used lawyers provided by the citizens advice bureau,
although I am not saying that that should stop. In fact, we talked to
the citizens advice bureau. It was not very helpful. It felt, frankly,
that, as a business with 30 or 40 people, we were quite capable of
standing on our own. However, businesses that I classify as small,
developing ones, do not have human resources departments, and that is
where the problems fall hardest in many respects. I agree that, for
very small businesses, the citizens advice bureau is very helpful, but,
with those bigger businesses, there is a sort of cultural view that
they ought to be able to look after
themselves.</div><a name="08101676000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
were advised by many other business people to pay &#163;2,000 and not
to bother with the tribunal, even though I was adamant that we were
right and had acted correctly. I felt that that particular blackmail
culture was unacceptable. Frankly, it is bad for our commercial and
industrial processes. I disregarded the advice, and we went ahead and
fought. I am glad that I did, because we won on both occasions.
However, we added up the costs of the preparation and of appearing at
the tribunal for two days with three witnesses who had to be there on
each occasion. The first one cost us &#163;9,000, the second one
&#163;14,000. That was a heavy blow to a business in which cash flow
was vital; we were not cash-rich, my house was backing the process and
we were struggling to grow, which we successfully
did.</div><a name="08101676000341"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div>
<a name="08101676000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to
take note of two elements when considering the provision. The first is
the blackmail culture. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that
everybody who goes to an industrial tribunal is a potential
blackmailer. That is not the point. Many people have genuine cases and
we should recognise that. I am not arguing that all the employers are
good and all employees are bad; that is far from the truth. However, we
need to recognise the blackmail culture among certain groups of people,
and take it into account.</div>
<a name="08101676000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
element to consider is that costs were not awarded to us. On both
occasions, the whole exercise was a sizable demand on our cash flow,
and the news that we had spent all that money was not well received by
the bank. I got the impression that it may have thought that we should
have paid &#163;2,000 and not bothered with the tribunal.</div>
<a name="08101676000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that
the Minister does not want to want to generate that culture, but I ask
him to take that atmosphere into account. I will support the new
clause. I do not know whether the wording is correct. I do not know
whether there are other ways of doing it. However, I do 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>know that there is a problem, and we need to deal with it more
effectively than we are at the moment, hence my
support.</div>
<a name="08101676000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000470"></a>Dr.
Palmer:</b> If there is a problem with tribunals being too
generous to applicants, that should be addressed by looking at the way
in which they reach their conclusions rather than by a financial
penalty. The idea that 19 per cent. of applicants could be faced with a
bill of, on average, &#163;9,000 when they have just been dismissed
is, frankly, terrifying. It is unprecedented in civil law for one to
face the prospect of being automatically landed with a huge legal bill
if one loses, without the court having any discretion over that.
Whether we intend it to or not, that will have an extremely
intimidatory effect. I urge hon. Members to reconsider the new
clause.</div>
<a name="08101676000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000471"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> What strikes me about the new clause is that it
seeks to reform the current situation rather than the situation that
the Bill will create. The thrust of the part of the Bill that deals
with dispute resolution is based on a recognition that it has become
overly legalistic and over-costly. The figure of &#163;9,000 per case
is accurate, as far as I am aware. I agree with my hon. Friend the
Member for Hastings and Rye when he says that there may have been a
trend for it to become more legalistic. That was not the original
intention of the tribunal system, but in some ways that has been the
case. However, it is certainly not universal; there are still plenty of
circumstances where people are unrepresented and argue their own
cases.</div><a name="08101676000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clauses that we discussed earlier in our proceedings about earlier
dispute resolution, about removing the three-step procedures introduced
a few years ago and about increasing the role of ACAS, with Government
funding of up to &#163;37 million over the next few years and the
lifting of the time limits on its interventions, will all have an
impact. The Government&#146;s impact assessment says that this Bill
and those measures could save business up to &#163;170 million or
more.</div>
<a name="08101676000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000472"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> Will the Minister set out how those measures
will have an impact on dealing with vexatious
claims?</div><a name="08101676000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000473"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> There will be a greater opportunity to resolve
claims earlier. My problem with the new clause is that it strikes at an
access-to-justice point. It has been a long-standing belief of this
Government and previous Governments that individuals should have the
ability to enforce their rights through a system that provides access
to justice for all, regardless of status or background. The tribunal
system provides this access to justice, in part through the principle
that&#151;other than in limited circumstances, which I will come
to&#151;parties are responsible for their own costs. In this way,
those without the resources to afford costly legal representation can
still try to take action to enforce their rights.</div>
<a name="08101676000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been
commented on by my hon. Friends the Members for Broxtowe and for
Hastings and Rye, were we to abide by the new clause and award costs
automatically against the losing party, that would not only set
employment tribunals apart from other tribunals where such general
powers do not exist; more importantly, it could seriously deter
individuals from bringing claims to tribunal when 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column116" />Column number: 116</div>they may have a good case, for fear of being left with a very large bill
if they are unsuccessful. We must also consider how such a proposal
would have a disproportionate effect on people. The introduction of
costs against the unsuccessful party automatically is more likely to
deter claimants from pursuing action, rather than
respondents.</div>
<a name="08101676000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept the
point made about small businesses not always having the greatest
resources. That is why the other measures in the Bill will be of
significant help to small businesses and address this situation.
However, if there was an automatic award of costs against a losing
party, employers could use that possibility as a tool to dissuade
employees from bringing a claim in the first place. There is an
important access-to-justice argument here.</div>
<a name="08101676000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Huntingdon asked me about vexatious claims. There are
measures in place to deal with those. There are already pre-tribunal
hearings where claims can be struck out, which happens in about 2 per
cent. of cases. One could argue that the 2 per cent. figure means that
there are fewer vexatious claims than we think, because the tribunals
are looking at them and striking that percentage out. Alternatively,
one could take the view that they should be striking out more, but
there is a process in place for striking out such
claims.</div>
<a name="08101676000293"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000474"></a>Mr.
Binley:</b> Does the Minister recognise that a lot of these
claims do not even get to first base because it is felt that it is
easier and cheaper to pay a small amount of money out, rather than face
the problems of a tribunal and the whole ACAS process? Does the
Minister agree that that is an injustice, as
well?</div>
<a name="08101676000294"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000475"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I am not sure about the point that the hon.
Gentleman makes. The point that I am trying to make is that there is a
process in place to strike down vexatious claims before they get
further on in the procedure. There is also a process whereby a deposit
of &#163;500 can be charged if the case is judged to be weak at first
glance, and costs awarded. In 2006-07, 343 cost awards were made, so it
does happen in some cases.</div>
<a name="08101676000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000476"></a>Michael
Jabez Foster:</b> Is the problem not that for some small
businesses, the fear of an order for costs against them would create an
incentive to settle unnecessarily, because they would be fearful of
substantial costs as well as the
award?</div><a name="08101676000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000477"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is a valid point. As I said, I agree with
the hon. Member for Northampton, South when he reminds us&#151;as he
has done several times&#151;that the resources available to small
businesses in terms of time, human resources and money are limited.
That is why the overall dispute resolution reforms in the Bill are
important and advantageous to business.</div>
<a name="08101676000297"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000478"></a>John
Hemming:</b> Will the Minister look at the issue of a small
claims track? The costs need not be so great, because people know that
if they lose, they will not lose that much and they can do it for
themselves.</div><a name="08101676000298"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000479"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> I think that the reference was to caps on
awards, and that is a more complicated picture. Costs of up to
&#163;10,000 can be awarded if the judge or tribunal believe that the
claimant or representative has 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>acted vexatiously. The new clause on vexatious claims mentions a 25 per
cent. variation, but putting a value on a vexatious claim is
difficult&#151;by its nature it is worthless, so how can we value it?
Not every claim will have a cost value. I imagine that the 25 per cent.
figure relates to the fact that earlier, we talked about varying the
awards up or down by 25 per cent. However, that is for when we have an
award. At this early stage we do not have an award, so concluding what
25 per cent. might be would be difficult in practice. There is no
requirement for claimants to give a statement of loss on their claim
form. If one is given, it is often judged not to be realistic. For
example, some discrimination claims have no value placed upon them; it
is simply alleged that the claimant has been discriminated
against.</div>
<a name="08101676000299"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000480"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The figure is 25 per cent. of any claim, rather
than 25 per cent. of any
award.</div><a name="08101676000300"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000481"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> That is my point. I did mention that that there
was no requirement for claimants to put a value on their claims. It is
difficult to say what there should be 25 per cent. of, and that makes
the measure difficult to implement in practice, were we to choose to do
so.</div>
<a name="08101676000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
that there are probably vexatious claims in the system, and it is
important to have a process to deal with them. We have a pre-tribunal
hearing process in place and if we can improve that, we should. It
would be an error&#151;quite an important one&#151;for us to agree
to a wholesale change in the way that the tribunal system has operated
for years under the governance of both parties, when the principle has
been for people to bear their own costs. It is possible to award costs
in some cases, but making that automatic would have implications for
access to justice. That would be wrong and would not take into account
the other changes that we make to dispute resolution. I therefore ask
my colleagues to oppose the new clause.</div>
<a name="08101676000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000482"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> As my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton,
South said, the number of cases grows more significant. The number of
vexatious cases is rising&#151;of course, not all claims are
vexatious and I am sorry if I gave that impression during my earlier
remarks. As the Minister rightly said, there are powers to make cost
orders and to have deposits paid, but in reality the tribunals do not
use those powers to the extent that they should. The Minister says that
his reforms will clear up the problem. If they work, they may simplify
the system and hopefully that will reduce the level of cost. However, I
do not see how they will stop the vexatious claimant. This is a huge
area of concern for business, and from what the Minister says, I do not
feel that he has reflected on the frustrations felt by businesses about
what exists out there. I appreciate that the drafting of the new clause
may not be perfect, and I will withdraw it on the basis that I may
return to it at a later stage. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw
the
motion.</div><a name="08101676000303"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

Djanogly.]</i></div><a name="08101676000304"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Brought

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000483"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="08101676000306"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall be brief, as I have already used a lot of the evidence in support
of the new clause when speaking to the earlier new clauses. I want to
add some certainty to employment proceedings that I have been led to
believe does not currently exist. The employment tribunal service
covers 21 different jurisdictions, ranging from unfair dismissal, of
which there were 44,491 cases last year, to cases of discrimination on
the grounds of sexual orientation. In many of those different areas,
the various time limits for bringing claims vary, and what I propose
under the new clause is that the time limit is standardised when such
claims are dealt with by employment tribunals. I suggest that it should
be three months&#151;the time limit that is attached to unfair
dismissal.</div><a name="08101676000307"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would have two benefits. On the one hand, companies could
accurately predict at what point likely proceedings would be brought
against them; while on the other hand, the employment tribunal process
would be unburdened of those cases that have become a dim memory for
those giving evidence, thereby ensuring that evidence is clear, concise
and factually relevant. The provision would also tie in well with the
tribunal procedural parts of the Bill, as people will have less excuse
to not know where they stand at any point in the
process.</div><a name="08101676000308"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000484"></a>John
Hemming:</b> There would be a bit of difficulty with the new
clause. If it would bring in resolution processes after the incident
but prevent someone from going to an employment tribunal, I oppose
it.</div><a name="08101676000309"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000485"></a>Mr.
McFadden:</b> The new clause would make the time limit for
bringing an employment tribunal three months from the date of the
alleged incident. The matter was dealt with in the Government&#146;s
consultation paper, which was published in March 2007, alongside the
report of Michael Gibbons on dispute resolution. Under the current
system, the mandatory time limits for bringing claims are either three
months or six months, depending on the jurisdiction of the claim. The
six-month limit applies principally in statutory redundancy payments
and equal pay claims. Almost all time limits for claims can be extended
at the discretion of the tribunal under certain circumstances. The
position is complicated by the extensions to time limits that are
allowed to give parties time to follow statutory procedures, but we are
legislating to remove the statutory procedures, so the extensions will
fall away with the removal of those under the
Bill.</div><a name="08101676000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government consulted on whether time limits should be harmonised. Many
people consider that harmonisation is a good idea; but as members of
the Committee can imagine, when we asked whether the time limit should
be three months or six months, there were divergent views. Some people
argued strongly for three months, while others argued strongly for six
months. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>Proponents of a three-month limit tended to argue that it was a long
enough period to consider bringing a case and that justice would be
better served when claims were made promptly, while proponents of a
six- month limit argued that a three-month time limit would force
potential claimants to submit claims before internal procedures had
been exhausted. We have talked about the value of settling disputes
before going down the tribunal route. Those who are perhaps preoccupied
with dealing with the consequences of an incident or who are seeking a
new job if the issue involved being sacked during pregnancy and whose
baby was born subsequently might not have enough time to bring a claim
within that
period.</div><a name="08101676000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
current system has different time limits, which are reasonably well
known in the system. They have been in place for some time, and the
likelihood of needing to take more time to decide to make a claim in
certain jurisdictions is recognised. We have consulted overall, and we
have considered the matter. Agreeing that uniformity would be good is
the easy part. Agreeing quite what form that uniformity should take is
more difficult. We concluded that we would leave the system as it was
with regard to the different jurisdictions and time limits. On that
basis, we cannot agree to the new
clause.</div><a name="08101676000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000486"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:</b> The Minister has agreed that uniformity would be
good. The problem is therefore what should be the uniform length of
time. I will go away and think about what he has said and may come back
to this issue at a later date. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="08101676000313"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Motion

Djanogly:</b> May I thank you, Mr. Caton, and
Mr. Bercow for your chairmanship of the Committee? The

the business, having given due thought

McFadden:</b> I echo the thanks to you, Mr. Caton,
and Mr. Bercow for guiding our proceedings so effectively. I
thank the hon. Member for Huntingdon for the spirit in which he has
conducted the debates and moved his amendments. Equally, the hon.
Member for Solihull, who is not with us today, has been part of this
regular DBERR team across the parties, if we can call it that. The same
goes for the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. I also thank all my
hon. Friends for their contributions, particularly my hon. Friend the
Member for Watford for her able assistance and my hon. Friend the
Member for Plymouth, Devonport. The Bill was extensively discussed in
the other place. As ever, those discussions added value to the
parliamentary process that has eased our proceedings. With that, I
thank members of the Committee once again for their help in these
proceedings.</div><a name="08101676000317"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08101676000489"></a>John

proceedings, as well as yourself, Mr. Caton, and
Mr. Bercow. I thank the Minister, the hon. Member for
Huntingdon and my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull, who is not
present. The Bill started in the other House, where clearly a lot of
the issues were resolved, thus enabling us to finish with seven minutes
to spare in the first week. That is good
going.</div><a name="08101676000318"></a>
