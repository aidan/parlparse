							<b class="B">Alistair
Burt</b> (North-East Bedfordshire) (Con): Good morning,
Mr. Chope. It is nice to see you in your place. We shall
welcome your
deliberations.</div>
					<a name="07022248000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
to raise a couple of issues and cover a few points about the parishes
that we did not have time to discuss at our previous sitting. Parishes
are the real backbone of community involvement in the rural districts
that make up so much of our country. Those of us who have spent most of
our lives in urban areas and are relatively new to parishes certainly
appreciate their
work.</div>
					<a name="07022248000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">In previous
sittings, I have touched on the growing bureaucracy that surrounds
parish councils and on my appreciation of their concern about how their
role is perceived and defined. I hope that the Under-Secretary will be
allowed to interpret the clause reasonably generously so as to cover
the community governance provisions of the next two or three clauses. I
should like to know her intentions behind the power that will be given
to principal councils to organise the community governance
review.</div>
					<a name="07022248000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">What do the
Government expect to be reviewed? Will parish councils that are not
working effectively be under threat? There are two concerns about the
community governance proposals in the Bill, and the first has to do
with the provision to allow petitions from people who think that their
area might need a parish council. Asking principal councils to consider
whether the parishes in their area are working effectively could
threaten those councils that think they are working straightforwardly
and effectively but are doing so more quietly than the Government
expect.</div>
					<a name="07022248000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me expand
on those two points. If new parishes are to be created, are the
Government satisfied that the capacity is there to take on the role of
parish councils in some new areas? In urban areas, the tradition and
structure of involvement in local communities may not exist in the same
way that it does in rural communities, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column310" />Column number: 311</div>where parish structure has been part of the landscape for a long time.
For example, it is not strictly accurate to say that an estate with
3,000 people living on it is equivalent to a small village of 2,500 or
3,000 people.</div>
					<a name="07022248000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">People
can live on an estate with a relaxed sense of community; in fact, their
sense of community may apply to a council or geographical area that is
larger than their immediate surroundings. A hamlet of fewer than 100
people can have a strong individual identity quite different from what
might be found in a group of 100 people living in an urban area. If
urban parishes are to be created as a result of the proposals and
petitions, is the Under-Secretary confident that there is enough
capacity, that training and resources will be available, and that
mistakes will not be
made?</div>
					<a name="07022248000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second worry
is whether parishes are being overloaded and given too many things to
do&#151;a question that we touched on the other day, when we debated
their being given the chance to promote the power of well-being. At the
weekend, I attended a meeting attended by representatives from two
thirds of my parish councils. We covered several matters, but two or
three things in particular irked the people who were at the
meeting.</div>
					<a name="07022248000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						For
example, people felt that their voices about what matters to them were
not being listened to. We discussed planning and, although there is a
statutory right of consultation, in too many cases people have become
very wary of the whole concept of consultation. To them, the
consultation often seems like an exercise being carried out by a
principal council or authority: opinions are collected, but there is no
real intention to act on the information gathered. When the expectation
of local involvement is raised but not fulfilled, the danger is that
people are not encouraged to stay involved or to continue making a
contribution. The people to whom I spoke were concerned that there was
more bureaucracy and more things that they had to
do.</div>
					<a name="07022248000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The implications
of the Standards Board that was introduced some years ago are probably
well known to the Under-Secretary. My own sense is that all the fuss
that was raised among the parishes that I have contact with seems to
have settled down, and that the board is no longer such an
issue.</div>
					<a name="07022248000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was real
concern, however, that if new powers were taken on to promote
well-being, the councils would find it difficult to bring in new people
to handle the extra duties. They already find it hard to get people
involved. Councils are concerned that, if they do not opt to promote a
power of well-being, they will be seen by the powers that govern them
as not willing to be involved in their communities. That might expose
them to charges that they are not doing their job, with the result that
a community governance review organised by their principal council
could appear threatening.</div>
					<a name="07022248000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">In other words, I want to know
whether the Government desire parish councils to do certain things,
fulfil certain standards and perform a certain amount of work. If a
council does not do all that, will the Government feel that it is not
doing its job and that it is time for it to
go?</div>
					<a name="07022248000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">If so, I think
that that would be a failure to understand the purpose of parish
councils, what they do in their local communities and how they go about
it. The concern is that the continual audit, and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column311" />Column number: 312</div>inspection and review some years ago that revealed a certain number of
silent parish councils, disturbed the sense that councils were masters
of their own destiny and could look after things in their own way,
provided that they fulfilled basic statutory requirements and were
doing the job that their local parish constituents wanted them to do.
Fulfilling those requirements, rather than responding to more rules and
regulations from above, should be the most important thing that they
do.</div>
					<a name="07022248000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are the
concerns I wanted to put on the record. I pay tribute to those who work
in our parish council, and to its clerks. Clerks often cover a number
of different parish councils: their ability to keep the councillors and
chairs up to speed with changes in legislation and responsibilities is
formidable, and we pay tribute to them and to all the parish
councillors who work so hard.</div>
					<a name="07022248000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to know what is
behind the Government&#146;s thinking on the community governance
reviews. Is there anything that parish councils should be aware of? If
petitions are raised for new parish councils to be created in urban
areas, what guarantee will be given that support and resources will be
available to assist
them?</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022248000166"></a>
							<b class="B">Patrick
Hall</b> (Bedford) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is reviewing a
possible gradation of parish councils in the context of the debate.
Within that spectrum, would he care to speculate or comment on the role
of urban community councils, which do not have the power to raise a
local rate, for example, but none the less exist? There are two such
councils in Bedford. They are part of the range of local community
representation that exists in the
UK.</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000167"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> Parish councils are wary about raising more money.
That issue came up the other day when we were discussing the power to
promote well-being. Councils will not be given any new resources to do
that, but will have to raise the money themselves. Raising money
locally is never an easy job. Again, councils were concerned that they
would be given new powers but no new resources, and that then people
would say, &#147;Why are you not doing anything?&#148; No one wants
to contribute and no one wants to cough up extra
taxes.</div>
					<a name="07022248000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
whether urban community councils want the power to raise money. I can
understand why they would be hesitant. Any group, such as a residents
association or neighbourhood association, that provides a collective
view and an opportunity for people to engage beyond the confines of
their own houses and take part in community life is good
news.</div>
					<a name="07022248000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is very important that urban community councils are established, and
that they thrive. We must always ensure that there is something
reasonable and meaningful for people to do. Again, I urge that
community councils and other bodies that are statutory consultees
should be able to see that that consultation really matters, that what
they have to say about something is noticed, and that things change as
a result. It is clear, however, that they are important and that they
have a role.</div>
					<a name="07022248000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, it has happened that community groups have been set up and
have then handled money poorly, with the result that problems have
arisen. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column312" />Column number: 313</div>Therefore, we need to be sure that there is leadership capacity, and
that resources are available for training to improve it and to ensure
that people are able to handle money safely. In that way, people will
be able to handle their responsibilities
effectively.</div>
					<a name="07022248000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are
the issues that I wish to tease out with the Under-Secretary, and I
hope that she will be good enough to respond and give us a sense of the
meaning of clause 58 and the associated
clauses.</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07022248000168"></a>
							<b class="B">Mr.
Robert Syms</b> (Poole) (Con): I have just a couple of
questions. Will the Under-Secretary confirm that where urban parishes
are set up they will have a precepting power? If that is the case, will
the current arrangements&#151;with no capping on parish
councils&#151;continue?</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000169"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Angela E. Smith):
						</b> I am grateful to the hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire for his comments on parish councils.
We touched on some of the issues the other evening, and his comments go
to the crux of community governance matters. I think that I shall be
able to reassure
him.</div>
					<a name="07022248000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause deals
with the means by which a principal council can initiate a community
governance review. Either local electors in an area can petition for
the principal council to conduct a review, or the council can decide to
undertake a review at any time on its own initiative. That will enable
local authorities to take decisions on the community governance
arrangements in their area, following a review that they will be able
to initiate.</div>
					<a name="07022248000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
community governance review can apply to the whole of a local authority
area, or to part of that area. Currently, local authorities conduct
parish reviews, but the Secretary of State or the Electoral Commission
take the decisions on implementation. Under the existing arrangements,
petitions can be raised for the creation of parishes, but local
authorities have to pass those petitions on to the Secretary of State.
A crucial aspect of the Bill is that it devolves these decision-making
powers to local authorities, so that the Secretary of State will no
longer make the decision. Essentially, reviews will operate as they do
already, but the final decision will be taken by local authorities
rather than the Secretary of State. That is quite right, and it is
truly devolutionary.</div>
					<a name="07022248000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">For the purposes of the
provisions on community governance reviews, the local authorities that
will be designated as principal councils will be district
councils&#151;both metropolitan and non-metropolitan, unitary county
councils and, as a further step, London borough councils. The White
Paper said that the Government were committed to giving communities in
London the same rights to have a parish council as the rest of the
country.</div>
					<a name="07022248000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
has been raised in our debate as to whether it will be more difficult
to have parish councils in urban areas. There are already such parish
councils, and there is no evidence that they are not as welcome or
effective as others. The Government do not believe it right that London
alone should be denied the opportunity to have parish councils, if
areas of London so wish. The choice will remain with the area. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column313" />Column number: 314</div>
					</div>
					<a name="07022248000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Is
it more difficult to have parish councils in urban areas? The way to
identify the community will be by way of the parish, the community or
the neighbourhood, although the position might be different from that
in rural areas. The general rule will be to decide matters on the basis
of the smallest area that reflects community identity and community
interests, but the area should also be viable as an administrative
unit. If both those criteria are followed, the position will be the
same as that for rural areas, though there might be a different shape
from rural areas. For instance, the parish council area could be based
on the boundaries of a housing estate rather than on those of the town
in which the estate lies. It will be up to local people to make a case
to the principal council that the area is an appropriate and viable one
for a parish council. It will be a local
decision.</div>

					<a name="07022248000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me ask a question. Smaller
rural councils sometimes have problems finding councillors, and
councillors are sometimes co-opted because they are unable to stand for
election. Does the Under-Secretary not think that there could be a
problem? If, for example, an estate in London were to have a parish
council as she described, it could be taken over by just a few people,
resulting in a general lack of interest. How can we get people
involved? Her idea is good in principle, but in practice, how can it
involve people and get them to stand for such
councils?</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000175"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> The issue that the hon. Gentleman raises cuts
across every parish council in the country. It is not peculiar to
London. For his information, the largest parish council in the country
is Weston-super-Mare, and I regret that it is not Lichfield. I am sure
that he will do his best to find one in Lichfield, but
Weston-super-Mare has the largest parish
council.</div>
					<a name="07022248000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Involving
people in parish councils is an issue that cuts across many areas. What
we are discussing in the measures before us&#151;for example, the
power of well-being if councils achieve certain criteria&#151;will
encourage people to be more involved and play a role in their
community. However, we must be aware that parish councils are an
important part of community life. They are very important in rural
areas and some urban areas, and London should be no different. I do not
see the particular problem that the hon. Gentleman 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column314" />Column number: 315</div>raises, but there are checks and balances in how the local authority
will decide whether to give permission to go ahead with a parish
council. Of course, we have had to take such issues into account. It is
necessary to consider whether there is a community requirement and
support for a parish
council.</div>

								Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): On the legislation
and guidance for local councils in dealing with petitions for
councillors, does the Under-Secretary remember that that point was
raised on Second Reading? I think that the Secretary of State, or
perhaps it was another colleague, responded to questions on particular
concerns&#151;not unique to London but raised by London
councils&#151;about ensuring that councils can resist petitions in
circumstances where there is a risk of damage to community cohesion
through hijacking. When are we likely to see the guidance and the
tightening-up of the
provisions?</div>

							<a name="07022248000177"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> We will get the guidance to the hon. Gentleman
as soon as possible, but I assure him that it will contain a commitment
to community cohesion. That issue was raised in the evidence sessions.
We are going a little wider than the clause, Mr. Chope, but
I hope that you will indulge me, because this debate covers a group of
clauses that hang together on a number of
issues.</div>
					<a name="07022248000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
have made a strong commitment on the importance of community cohesion
and must be covered in the guidance. That will not apply just to the
sort of extremist groups mentioned in evidence; it could also apply to
a group that wants to remove itself from the community as a whole. That
would be community segregation, and we want to see community
cohesion.</div>
					<a name="07022248000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
instantly inspired to give the hon. Gentleman a better time scale. We
should have a draft of the guidance by around April, but I can give him
a commitment that community cohesion will be covered in it. He raised
an important
point.</div>
					<a name="07022248000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other important
points had to do with how small parishes would cope with the work they
have, and what we will do to direct what work parishes should do. That
is difficult for the Government to direct, because parishes vary
enormously in size, from Weston-super-Mare to a parish council of just
a few people or to Lichfield&#151;we are having a Bedford moment with
Lichfield today. I do not think that it is appropriate for the
Government to direct exactly what a parish council should do; that is a
matter for the parish council. In terms of resources, the parish
council, with the support of its community, will raise a precept for
the duties that it thinks it should undertake. That is appropriate
within the
community.</div>
					<a name="07022248000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for North-East Bedfordshire also raised the issue of
bureaucracy. He was correct to raise it, and I take it on board. He
will note that the White Paper and the Bill contain no new duties to
increase bureaucracy. In fact, we have resisted involving parish
councils in the local area agreements, although they will obviously
have regard to parish council plans. Parish councils are not named in
LAAs precisely because we do not want to be overly bureaucratic or
to
						<div class="Column"><a name="Column315" />Column number: 316</div>put overly onerous duties on them. That would be inappropriate. However,
they will play an increasingly important role in the life of the
community.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I am somewhat reassured by
what the Under-Secretary says, but could she clarify something? It is
clear that the measure is intended to devolve power to principal
councils, and, as a localiser and not the centraliser she has accused
me of being, I welcome that. However, I am concerned that some councils
might seek to use those powers to impose a standard obligation upon
areas where there are small parishes. Such small areas might just have
parish meetings and not parish councils. The obligation might be that
the area under the control of the council has a set-up of parish
councils, and parish meetings are abolished for the administrative
convenience of the district council. Will that be permitted under the
arrangements?</div>
					<a name="07022248000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
also concerned that the community governance review will give to
principal councils the authority to impose obligations other than those
prescribed in these clauses for the sizing of parish councils and the
grouping of areas. For example, will a principal council be allowed to
impose an obligation for parish meetings to have a parish clerk in
order to make contact more convenient for the principal
council?</div>

							<a name="07022248000179"></a>Angela
E. Smith:
						</b> I give an absolute reassurance to the hon.
Gentleman that that is not the case. It will not be for the principal
council to place an obligation on the parish council.</div>
					<a name="07022248000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point made about a
review, there are very limited circumstances in which one would be
initiated by the principal council. For example, it may be that
residential properties have been built over existing parish boundaries
and that a street or area straddles a parish boundary, so that people
in the same residential street are represented in different parishes.
In such circumstances, it would be appropriate for the principal
council to initiate a review, but generally it would be for local
members themselves to petition.</div>
					<a name="07022248000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Poole made
a point about precepting. It will be open to parish councils to precept
in their area as it is now. There are no plans to cap local precepts.
That matter will be revisited if a problem is perceived, and if
representations are made to the Government about, say, excessive rate
precepting by parish councils. We may look at the matter again, but
there are currently no plans to do
so.</div>
					<a name="07022248000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of the
Standards Board was raised, and of whether being subject to it would be
over-onerous to parish councils. When the issue was first raised four
years ago, there was an outcry. It was said that subjecting parish
councils to the Standards Board was over-onerous, that it was like
using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, and that it would deter people
from becoming involved in parish councils. However, it has not had that
impact; it has ensured that members of the public are aware of the
propriety of local parish councillors. The fact that it has not been a
problem for parish councils is testimony to the work of parish
councillors themselves.</div>

from parish councils. I was making the point that suggestions were made
four years ago that making parish councils subject to the Standards
Board would impact on them, and that they would have greater difficulty
finding candidates. There is no evidence that the Standards Board has
put anybody off putting themselves forward as a candidate for a parish
council.</div>

number of parish councils may not themselves have complained to the
Standards Board, the volume of its work arising from frivolous or
vexatious complaints made by parish councillors has exploded? Does she
also recognise that a large number of parish councillors who were
councillors prior to the introduction of the Standards Board have
resigned, and that that is the reason why there are not a large number
of people putting themselves forward for election in several areas,
including some areas in my
constituency?</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I find the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comments
quite surprising. My understanding is that there has not been a flood
of complaints from parish councils to the Standards Board. There may
have been some complaints as is appropriate when there are issues to
address. However, there has been no flood of complaints. There is a
difficulty in finding enough candidates in some areas to stand for
election to parish councils, but there is no evidence that that is a
direct result of the involvement of the Standards Board. I find it
difficult to believe that parish councillors have resigned because they
were subject to the Standards Board. Councillors that I know&#151;I
am sure that other hon. Members are aware of similar
examples&#151;appreciate the role of the Standards Board. Its
presence is not a deterrent to councillors; it is for their protection.
The board judges issues of propriety, so I do not accept the hon.

to the clauses dealing with the Standards Board, and I do not want to
extend the point too far. However, will the Under-Secretary look
carefully at the reports prepared by the Standards Board over the years
about the proportion of complaints that it has received from parish
councils, against the proportion from principal councils? Will she
acknowledge that more complaints have gone to the Standards Board in
relation to one parish council covering one third of one of the 21

which is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column317" />Column number: 318</div>why there are so many interventions&#151;is that there is no evidence
that the board has had an impact on the number of people putting
themselves forward to be parish councillors. I should like to emphasise
that. My point, in case I have confused the Committee somewhat or have
not put things clearly enough, is that there is no evidence that the
board as it applies to parish councils, as it was said when it was

						</b> It is welcome that powers to make decisions about
new parishes, and decisions on their creation, have been devolved from
the Secretary of State to principal authorities. Parish councils
welcome that measure, and it has also been welcomed by the parish
councils&#146; associations. However, there is one nagging doubt in
the back of my
mind.</div>
					<a name="07022248000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						To
a certain extent, the fact that such matters used to be handled outside
the local authority by the Secretary of State provided some form of
third-party scrutiny and review, so local battles were not fought and
decided locally. I am concerned about whether there is any appeal
process. If a personality dispute were preoccupying a local area where
a local parish had been awkward or difficult and consistently at odds
with a principal council, perhaps because it represented two different
parts of a local authority area, whether urban or rural, the local
council may decide, under the terms of clause 63, that that was an
ideal opportunity to conduct a community governance review. The result
of that review may be&#151;surprise, surprise&#151;that the
difficult parish council would be scheduled for termination. What power
of appeal is possible?</div>
					<a name="07022248000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Such matters
used, of course, to go to the Secretary of State, thereby avoiding
internecine strife, which is part of British public life. We have all
had experience of that. The nods and smiles from Committee members tell
me that I am mining a rich seam. We are all aware of this sort of

						</b> I thank the hon. Gentlemen for their comments.
The clause allows local authorities to review existing parishes, and
they could recommend the abolition or alteration of existing parishes
following that review. There is some political debate on this.
Currently Portsmouth is trying to abolish Southsea town council, which
is controlled by the Conservatives, and Portsmouth town council, which
is controlled by the Liberal Democrats.

					<a name="07022248000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Bill is about trust and devolution&#151;it is about local authorities
making decisions. If the Secretary of State does not have the powers to
call in decisions or there is no appeal to the Secretary of State, it
is a matter for local authorities to decide. I am a bit surprised by
the hon. Gentlemen&#146;s reluctance to accept the devolutionary
thrust of the Bill. Local authorities will have to consult. The
Government will set out a framework that will ensure that local people
are consulted, that any representations are taken into account and that
the outcome of the review must be open and transparent. There will be
statutory guidance for local authorities carrying out
reviews.</div>
					<a name="07022248000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Local
authorities will have to base their decisions on certain criteria. They
will have to take into account the identities of local communities and
community cohesion across the proposed area&#151;the point raised by
the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst. When considering whether
to create or to abolish a parish council they will also have to take
into account the body&#146;s ability to provide effective and good
local governance. The right of appeal in such matters would be the
legal right to have a judicial
review.</div>

Burt:
						</b> I am not complaining about the devolutionary power
in the Bill. I accept that. As I said at the beginning of my remarks on
the clause, the National Association of Local Councils has welcomed the
measure and so do people in most parishes, because it offers more local
control of their affairs. However, the sticking point is when a problem
arises. All these things look great when everyone agrees with everyone
else, and taking account of the needs of the locality and so on sounds
great&#151;until there are two opposing factions and the rubber hits
the road. It is all very well to have appeal available through judicial
review, but we all know the problems of judicial review. It is
enormously expensive and tremendously uncertain. No parish council will
quickly commit its resources to such a thing.</div>

					<a name="07022248000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a very difficult situation
where a council has taken a political decision to remove a parish
council, there would be no redress for a parish caught up in that sort
of squeeze except through judicial review. That is what the
Under-Secretary has said, but is she really content that that is safe
and sure? Would it not now be better&#151;for disputed cases, not
those in which there is agreement&#151;to have some other power of
appeal that is less expensive and would safeguard the position of a
parish council under
threat?</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman
is making, but the decision would not be made unilaterally. Councils
will go through a due process as laid out in statutory guidance and in
legislation, and the decision will be open and transparent. Decisions
taken by a local council or by Parliament itself do not always meet
with absolute agreement&#151;in the real world, that does not
happen&#151;but there is always the backstop of judicial review. We
should not build in so many checks and balances that principal
authorities cannot take decisions
themselves.</div>

E. Smith:
						</b> The clause provides for a community governance
review to recommend the grouping or de-grouping of parishes. Some
parish communities in England wish to have their own identity and
interests reflected by the creation of a parish, but are too small to
have one of their own. In such cases, a community governance review
could recommend that such parishes be grouped together and represented
by a single parish council. A group of small parishes could therefore
be represented by one parish council, if recommended by the
review.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column320" />Column number: 321</div>
					<a name="07022248000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause provides a
requirement for the review to consider the electoral arrangements of a
grouped parish council or a parish council established after a parish
is de-grouped. It also provides flexibility to allow small communities
to reflect their identity and interests and ensures that, in performing
their role, parish councils are effective and convenient. The clause
therefore ensures that small parishes are not left out of the

						</b> I am not aware of any representations against
the figure. The current position is that each parish must have a parish
meeting at which all local government electors in the parish meet at
least once a year. The Bill will not change that. One hundred and fifty
people could still have a parish and therefore a parish meeting, but
that would not be a parish council with precepting powers. The Bill
does not stop local people becoming organised or having a community
identity. They just will not have a parish council, as such. Does that
answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
question?</div>

asking why. Some groups, for example, residents of a housing estate,
might not be represented as electors, but they are part of the
population. They might want to be part of a community so that may be a
rationale, even though they are not electors, for them to have a say
and to ensure that their area is represented by a parish

will make such decisions. That has been the established tradition for

Mr. Chope. The purpose of the amendments is to deal with
parishes in London. I appreciate that the Under-Secretary may use them
as an opportunity to attack me for having a centralising rather than a
localising tendency, but that does not bear much analysis.</div>
					<a name="07022248000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Logically and instinctively, as
a localiser and a devolutionist, my temptation would be to say that, if
local authorities want a parish council, we should provide a permissive
power to let them do so. However, that must be tempered to some degree,
as the Government&#146;s White Paper recognises. What is appropriate
in some parts of the country does not necessarily work everywhere else.
History and traditions of local government vary.</div>
					<a name="07022248000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">In general, the situation and
the evidence suggest that parishes are most common, even in the home
counties, in the more rural areas. There are exceptions&#151;Milton
Keynes is an urban area that is fully parished&#151;but that is not
the rule. After our 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column322" />Column number: 323</div>evidence sitting, I took up the challenge and went to Bromley public
library to see if there were parishes in the London borough of Bromley
prior to the local government reorganisation. I found that there had
not been for many years. The only part where parishes existed was
Biggin Hill, and that was purely anomalous because of it having been
transferred to Kent many years
ago.</div>

						There
is no real tradition in London of parish government. We have to think,
therefore, where the demand is coming from. London had parishes before
the creation of the old metropolitan borough councils at the end of the
19th century, but they were absorbed into the London boroughs, so there
is no history in London&#151;unlike in much of the rest of the
country&#151;of two-tier government at neighbourhood service level.
There is a tradition of city-wide government&#151;the London county
council or the Greater London council&#151;but not at the level of
delivery of neighbourhood services. If we are to go down the route of
the Government radically changing London&#146;s governance structure,
that ought to be in response to a clear and pressing demand and proven
need.</div>
					<a name="07022248000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">What strikes me
about the debate so far and the literature that has been produced is
that there is no evidence about where that pressing demand or need
comes from. London Councils, the representative body of the London
boroughs, has at no time sought to have the power to create parish
councils in London. None of the London boroughs has petitioned or
sought to set up parish councils. The Commission on London Governance,
of which I was the deputy chairman, looked at that in considerable
detail and took evidence from interested bodies over a period of some
months. We had people come down from Milton Keynes and elsewhere during
our in-depth
review.</div>

Burt:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>Does my hon. Friend recall the other day when
we spoke about a similar mysterious black hole, a Bermuda triangle,
where the demand for directly elected executives had arisen? We
struggled to find where that came from, and the present provision
appears to be coming from the same source. It is an idea, but nothing
with a really solid substantial base.</div>
					
					<a name="07022248000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000206"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>That is correct. When we look at the results
of councils&#146; performance to date, it is interesting that the
idea of the city manager, which the Government accept was wrong, ended
up putting Stoke at the bottom of the pile. There is always the danger
that an idea that is lobbed up without much evidence to support it will
not work in practice. I think that is exactly the same point. When the
Commission on London Governance conducted its investigation, we wanted
to see where the evidence was. We wanted to see that there was a real
demand and that there would be some real added value in the London
context.</div>
					<a name="07022248000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
because I am a devolutionist that I specifically want to emphasise the
London context. A system of permitting parishes may be appropriate in
other urban areas such as Milton Keynes or even Leigh-on-Sea, with
which the Minister and I are not unacquainted, but that does not mean
that it is appropriate or will give added value in London. That is the
key test. The whole 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column323" />Column number: 324</div>point of London having a devolved government structure was to accept
that because of its diversity, complexity and size, it does not and
need not fit in all respects the same local government template as the
rest of the country. I do not understand why the Government are
proposing something for which there is no significant
demand.</div>
					<a name="07022248000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The commission
looked at the matter and we took evidence from a lot of people,
including from authorities outside London that do have parishes. At the
end of the day, a number of members of the commission thought that
there might be merit in the idea and did not want to rule it
out&#151;I say that in fairness&#151;but the majority of the
commission, including, unanimously, the members both of my party and
the Government&#146;s, were of the view that there was no value in
having the power to create parish councils in London.</div>
					<a name="07022248000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the Ministers will
reflect on the views of people such as Hugh Maylan who chaired the
commission. Hugh Maylan was a very successful Labour leader in Croydon.
Croydon gets very high marks for its community engagement from both
Conservative and Labour administrations. People such as Hugh Maylan,
Robin Wales and others gave evidence to us showing that there was not
the demand for that form of community engagement. There are other ways
in which community involvement works in London that we think are more
effective.</div>

Burrowes:
						</b>
						<b class="B"> </b>I concur with many of my hon.
Friend&#146;s remarks and his view that we need to see a demand for
parish councils in London. Representing a London constituency, as we
both do, would my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that that evidence
has not necessarily tested the demand from those who feel detached from
their local council, particularly those who live on the edge of a
borough or in areas of great diversity, which sometimes have their own
characteristics that are not necessarily reflected by existing
governance arrangements, or by the area forums, which do not provide
real power and control in their
community?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000208"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> I have a lot of sympathy with my hon.
Friend&#146;s point, because when I was a local councillor, I
represented a ward on the edge of the London borough of Havering, which
itself is on the edge of London. If people went past me, they got into
Essex; it was as simple as that. I had the advantage, as the
Under-Secretary knows, of being that remarkable thing: an Essex boy who
migrated to Kent. None the less, even in my constituency, the same
issue applies. When the commission considered the London context, we
concluded that there are better ways to proceed. The point that my hon.
Friend raises is serious, but the creation of parishes is not likely to
be the most effective way to deal with the
matter.</div>

							<b class="B">Tom
Levitt</b> (High Peak) (Lab): The hon. Gentleman is quite
right to say that there is a wide variety of models for community
engagement that could be used in particular circumstances. Surely the
parish is one of those models, but the reason why the Bill singles out
parishes is that establishing a parish entails a legislative process,
whereas other forms of community 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column324" />Column number: 325</div>engagement do not. That is the only reason why the Bill proposes the
option of parishes. All of us agreed a few days ago that different
options should be presented to councils in different contexts. Surely
the Bill is right to include the option of
parishes.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07022248000210"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s point is superficially
very attractive, but the reality is that the Government themselves have
conceded that not all options should be put into the Bill. If the logic
of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s position were followed, we should have
included an option to allow local authorities to have modified
committee systems if they wish. However, the Government have chosen for
reasons of policy to exclude that option from the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07022248000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The same principle could
legitimately apply to the present proposal. Unless there is a clear
reason for introducing parishes in London, why should we run the risk
of the extra costs of reorganisation and the likelihood of a parish
precept on top of the Mayor&#146;s precept&#151;a not insignificant
matter in London&#151;as well as the borough councils&#146; costs?
If there were a real demand, or if the Government had been consistently
permissive in the framing of their own Bill, I would have much more
sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div>

							<b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): On the question
whether there is a demand, I do not think that we have probed enough. I
can understand why local authorities in London might not be hopping up
and down saying, &#147;Let&#146;s have lots of parishes all over
the place,&#148; but I agree with the hon. Member for Enfield,
Southgate that there are communities out there that will see value in
the concept, whether in Hampstead village or somewhere on the outskirts
of Havering, which is an area that I know well. I was born there, and
my father was the leader of the council many years ago. I am sure that
some communities would be very keen to consider the option. It might
not tie in with what the local council wants, but I genuinely believe
that the Government should give people the
option.</div>

Lady&#146;s suggestion that the views of the local authorities, which
have a democratic mandate, should be dismissed. The whole point of the
work that we did with the Commission on London Governance was to ensure
that that organisation, unlike the Herbert commission or even the
Marshall report, consisted not of the great and the good but of
practitioners in local government in the capital who have to face
election and take the flak from their own constituents and

point&#151;it is a question of consistency&#151;is that, given that
we have accepted that London has a separate structure from the rest of

create a permissive power in London, we should have regard to
London&#146;s structure and traditions and to whether there
