                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
I laid out the argument for why clause 17 was required, I pointed out
that it is vital to have transparency. My hon. Friend the Member for
Bradford East supports that, and he made the good point that
accountability is provided by an ability to see everything in
public.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth making it clear that clause 17 is consistent with the
Government’s approach, because the starting point has to be that
councils, which are democratically accountable to their own
electorates, should be free to decide how they promote and maintain
high standards of conduct among all their members. Under clause 16,
they can decide whether to have a code or a standards committee. All
such decisions are to be made locally, but if criminal law is involved,
it is right that Parliament takes a decision that applies to councils
everywhere. Clause 17 engages the criminal law, because wilfully not
registering a financial or other interest is a very serious matter. It
is right that that should be a criminal offence. That is why the Bill
requires councils to keep a register, which is a proper decision for
Parliament and is not for local
discretion.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000025">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I fully
understand the Minister’s argument about failures to declare a
financial interest, but will he tell the Committee whether a failure to
declare membership of a local voluntary sports club or organisation
that has no proposals that would affect council decisions in the
immediate short term would give rise to the possibility of committing a
criminal offence? I cannot see how it would, but perhaps the Minister
has more information than I
do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000026">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> No, I cannot see how it would, either. Apart from
anything else, subsequent clauses make it clear that whether or not a
prosecution arises will depend on the circumstances of the case.
However, it is extremely difficult to imagine that that would happen in
the circumstances outlined by the right hon.

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was asked about the cost of abolishing the Standards Board. The cost in
2010-11 is £700,000, which is being met from its operational
budget of £6 million—I have not yet commented on that
enormous cost. That will be the cost of the redundancies of staff
leaving the organisation as it scales back its activities. At the start
of 2010, the organisation had 81 members of staff, and that number has
now been reduced to 49. For the next financial year, which is intended
to be the last year of the board’s operation, the impact
assessment details that the cost  of abolishing the board is
forecast to be a total of £14.7 million, which
consists of redundancy costs of nearly £1 million and pension
liability crystallisation costs of £12 million.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000029">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was also
asked about the impact of transferring complaints to the local
government ombudsman  service. We think that the impact will be
slight. The assumption that the impact will be large is based on a view
that conduct will deteriorate, that more cases of maladministration
will arise and that councillors will be able to get away with more poor
conduct more easily, thus creating injustice that must be referred to
the ombudsman, but we do not accept that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000030">&#160;</a>

the word “naive” this morning, and what the Minister has
just said is naive. He proposes to abolish an organisation that had 80
employees, and then had 50, and to transfer a considerable chunk of its
work to the local government ombudsman, because that will be the only
form of redress apart from criminal proceedings. I fail to see how the
impact on the local government ombudsman can be slight, as he suggests.
People will have to complain to the local government ombudsman because
they will not be able to complain to the Standards Board. I encourage
the Minister to reconsider, because I do not accept that the impact
will be slight in any way, shape or

                           </strong> We do not intend that the Standards
Board’s existing full work load will be transferred to the local
government ombudsman. It will, initially, be for the local authority to
resolve cases as it sees fit. The nature of the matter raised will
determine whether a case goes beyond the local authority. For example,
it might or might not be a matter for criminal prosecution, it which
might or might not come under harassment legislation, it might or might
not be a matter for the district auditor or the auditing arrangements,
and it might or might not be a matter for the local government
ombudsman. The local government ombudsman will be engaged if a matter
of maladministration arises. We do not anticipate a significant rise in
the number of new maladministration cases that are referred to the
ombudsman as a result of the abolition of the Standards

me make it clear that the Opposition fully support greater transparency
in the pay of senior officials in the public sector. The measures to
increase pay accountability in local government are to be welcomed.
Taxpayers have a right to know how their money is being spent, and
there is clear evidence of excess in too many local authorities.
However, of those people who earn more than £150,000, in excess
of 90% work in the private sector. Much of what has happened in the
public sector has been driven by tearaway pay at the top in the private
sector. None the less, that does not justify the decisions that too
many councils have made about the pay of their senior
officers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000056">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Government are keen on propagating myths about pay in the public
sector, so let us nail those myths before we get to the substantive
issues. First, the Government would have us believe that all public
sector workers are well paid, but the truth is that a quarter of those
living in in-work poverty are employed by the public sector. Secondly,
the Government would have us believe that all public sector workers
have gold-plated pensions, but the truth is that the average pension is
£4,200 a year. Thirdly, the Government would have us believe
that local councils can spare front-line services simply by cutting
executive pay, trimming waste and sharing back-office functions, but
the truth is that they cannot. Birmingham city council faces a cut of
£170 million to its budget in the next financial year
alone, and we are already seeing front-line services—from youth
services to social care—cut to the
bone.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000057">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
believe that the amendments would bring about greater transparency and
therefore help the Government in their stated objective
of curbing excessive top pay. How will a highly
paid chief executive officer be able to defend excessively high pay if
the public can also see what the lowest paid members of staff earn in
contrast? How will a council be able to defend an outsourced contract
as good value if the pay transparency statement shows that those
working on the contract are excessively paid? I agree with the
Secretary of State that:<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
public should be able to see where their money goes and what it
delivers.”<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000389">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>However,
why should not that include those being paid excessive amounts through
procurement contracts, or those being underpaid with taxpayers’
money?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
low pay policy statement that the amendments would introduce would,
rightly, allow local authority employees to see what percentage of them
were paid the minimum wage by the authority—the minimum national
rate—and what percentage were paid 10% and 20% above that level.
That will empower employees to determine whether their
authority’s pay policy has a fair distribution. Pay transparency
incorporating both low and high pay would bring a welcome focus on
internal relativities of pay. That would enable local people to assess,
as the Government have argued they should, acceptable levels of senior
pay in local authorities. It would also, crucially, enable them to
assess whether their local authority was paying its lowest-wage workers
at an accepted threshold. The London living wage has sought to address
that point. I have stood on platforms with Boris Johnson, the Mayor of
London, and the Deputy Prime Minister from which we have collectively
advocated the value and virtue of the London living wage.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am sure
that Ministers agree that taxpayers would not want to be the
beneficiaries of services provided by workers who they considered to be
underpaid, just as much as they rightly want to see value for money at
the top. Transparency should cut both ways: fairness at the top and
fairness at the bottom. Fairness at the top and bottom must both be
included whenever taxpayers’ money is involved.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000063">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It cannot
have escaped the attention of Ministers that their implementation of a
senior pay policy in local government creates a double standard because
the same logic is not applied to contractors providing goods and
services to town halls in excess of £250,000. We all know that
Ministers like to pretend that there is no link between the public and
the private sector, but the truth is that significant sums of public
money go to private contractors that then provide goods and services
for taxpayers. The local government procurement market represents a
total of £34.2 billion. Are taxpayers not entitled to
transparency? Should they not know where the money is
going?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000064">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I have two questions about
new clause 1, to which the hon. Gentleman has started to refer. First,
surely the transparency that residents want to ensure that their money
is well spent relates to the value for money of the contract, rather
than the pay of the people working under it. If the contract is good
value, it is good value. My second question, which leads on from that,
is that if the Opposition are saying that they want to impose public
authority regulations around transparency on private companies, 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>why did they not do so through the Companies Act 2006 when they were in
government? Have they assessed the possible impact of new clause
1, given that the 2006 Act puts different

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman’s first question
demonstrates a rather poor view of what local residents expect. Let me
give a commercial example. I have worked with major companies in the
private sector such as the supermarkets and the ethical trading
initiative. There is an increasing recognition that those who buy from
high street stores and supermarkets want to know how employees in the
supply chain—domestically or internationally—are treated.
Such a welcome trend in public opinion should be
supported.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000066">&#160;</a>

deal of historical detail, I was involved in work in 1997-98 with the
CBI, the Business Services Association and various contractors that led
to welcome changes to the regime of compulsory competitive tendering.
The CCT, which was a centralist measure, was abolished, and there was
an insistence that local authorities should take work-force matters
into account. Subsequently, following a proposal from two major private
sector organisations, I chaired the TUPE forum through which public,
private and voluntary sectors worked together with the trade unions and
other stakeholders to update the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection
of Employment) Regulations 1981. Let me give one other example.
Together with the private, voluntary and public sectors, I was
personally and deeply involved in discussions around the two-tier code.
Some welcome progress was made with, I am pleased to say, a large
amount of consensus on the part of not only employees and their
representatives, but
employers.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000070">&#160;</a>

absolutely central tenet is that the Government are insisting that
local authorities “must” have transparency. They must
have transparency on top pay. No doubt when the Minister responds he
can tell us why it is top pay—and not low pay—in the
public sector alone, and why it is not top pay and low pay where
contractors are employed on contracts worth more than £250,000.
There is a fundamental inconsistency in the Government’s
approach. I agree with the Churchillian rhetoric; the problem is that
it stops well short of where it
should.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000088">&#160;</a>

to demand transparency on top pay in the public sector. We argue that
they have been utterly inconsistent in not taking that further, as the
amendment seeks to do. Perhaps Ministers still need convincing of the
wisdom of their case. Why is there a need to focus on low pay and,
indeed, contractors? In the present economic climate, as VAT increases,
inflation rises and transport costs rise, things will become more
expensive, particularly for those at the lower end of the scale.

compared and wage levels set. That was a totally transparent exercise
in which the authority’s employees in every area were
interviewed and comparables were set. The problem was that no
comparables were available for those at the very top of the

low-paid people are already feeling the squeeze. A recent New Policy
Institute report shows that there has been a rise in in-work poverty.
More than 13 million Britons—22% of the population—now
live on less than 60% of the median income, despite at least one adult
in affected households bringing a wage home. Of them, 5.8 million are
in deep poverty, surviving on less than 40% of the median income, which
is less than £192 a week for a couple with two children under
14. These people are working, yet too many of them still face poverty.
The idea that work alone is the way out of poverty is fanciful. We also
need to focus on work and low pay. We all agree that excessive pay at
the top of local government should be properly scrutinised, but how can
that be sensibly and fairly done other than in relation to low pay at
the
bottom?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000100">&#160;</a>

a year. Moreover, according to the LGA’s figures, more than
400,000 council workers earn less than the living wage, and of those,
more than 250,000 earn less than £6.50 an hour. The hon. Member

contributed to the depression in pay levels. The Government have
themselves estimated that 1 million public service workers now work for
the third sector and private providers. Those staff are
concentrated—not exclusively, but predominantly—in
low-wage sectors such as cleaning, portering, catering, low-skilled
manual work and care work. Do we not want the cleaners, care workers

the bottom. They feared that if there was no code in place to protect

                           </strong> My right hon. Friend—a former
Minister—is absolutely right. I vividly remember some of the
contributions made, including those by an admirable man who was the
chairman of the CBI local government panel. He argued strongly that
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981
and 2006 did not go far enough, because they protected employees at the
time of transfer, and he said that it was necessary to ensure that
companies did not win bids by, for example, undercutting on pensions
for new starters. He also said that if companies such as his did not
have that protection, they would inevitably lose out to the rogues.
That is why those measures were put in place, and it is deeply
regrettable that the Government are proceeding down the path of
unfairness to future public servants on the one hand and unfair
competition on the other. The code has been scrapped for central
Government, but not yet for local government. I suspect that that is
because it will take a change in the best value regime, and we hope
that the Government will not proceed down that
path.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000105">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">To
conclude, a decent wage is of value not only to employees, but to the
users of services. I remember standing on a platform with the chief
executive of British Aerospace, and we both said the same thing, which
was that how workers are treated is crucial to the quality of the
services that they provide or the product that they produce, and that
the difference between the average and the world-class lies in the
extent to which the endless potential and creativity of employees is
untapped. His point, with which I agree, is that pay is an indicator,
although not the only one, of how staff are valued, and it has a
profound effect on the loyalty and trust that they feel towards their
organisation. It is therefore only right that we set out clear
principles of fair pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000106">&#160;</a>

Councils and their contractors—all employers, in

living wage. The group of amendments would shine a light on low pay and
where taxpayers’ money goes. We need fairness at the top and the
bottom, and in the public and private sectors. Those must be the
objectives behind the drive for accountability and

council, we will introduce a low-pay policy,” or—looking
at amendments 57 and 58—“We will promote democracy and
introduce a right to petition.” We could put that in our
leaflets, as opposed to being the party that will not do such things.
There would be a difference; there would be a

I am faced with two political parties, one that offers me transparency
in the form of a low-pay policy and one that does not, I will make a
choice. That is how it should be. In effect, if someone agrees with
what the council is being asked to do, the “musts” remove
the possibility  of there being bad councils. However, it is
the right of electors to elect bad councils if that is what they
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000110">&#160;</a>

disclosure, I have consistently held the position—to reiterate
an earlier point—that the “must” should not be
about whether there is transparency, but about whether the existence of
transparency is disclosed and whether a particular authority intends to
introduce it. I find it difficult to think through the benefits to
local electors of private sector transparency. If there were two
contracts, and one could be offered either to a co-operative, or to a
company with a millionaire boss and 20 employees on the minimum wage,
what would we do with that knowledge? Will it make us accept a contract
from a co-operative that is more costly to the local electors? It might
seem fine for us to know more about the pay scales within a private
sector company, but what will we do with that information? Will we
accept, to the detriment of local electors, a contract that is more

to say a few words about the backdrop to the clause 21. Time and time
again, Ministers have talked about the fat cats at town halls. They
argue that if their salaries are reduced, the problem of the deficit
will magically be tackled. From my local authority experience,

			Column number: 312<a class="bkMark" name="Column312">&#160;</a>
                           </div>I can say that that is not the case. I spent six years representing a
ward in Lewisham and I was Lewisham’s deputy major for four
years. The authority employs some 4,000 staff and
has a wage bill of about £270 million. The wage bill
of the chief executive and the executive director’s team comes
to about £1 million. I recognise that that is a lot of money,
but those people do some of the most important jobs in this country,
which is a point that has so far been lacking from the
debate.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000114">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Let
us consider the responsibilities of an executive director for community
services. That individual is responsible for making sure that our
leisure centres are safe and for ensuring that the social care packages
provided to elderly and vulnerable citizens are made up of the right
sort of support. An annual statement setting out that
individual’s job title and pay does nothing to elucidate the
nature of their job, their responsibilities and their accountability to
the local

                           </strong> I would turn that question on its head and ask
whether the Prime Minister earns enough. There are thousands of
lawyers, accountants and management consultants in London who earn more
than the Prime Minister within five or six years of graduation. The
Prime Minister does a very difficult job, as do people in local
authorities. I respect the work that they do and they should receive
proper remuneration. Before coming this afternoon’s sitting, I
read about a case a number of years ago involving a council employee in
Barrow-in-Furness. He went to court on corporate manslaughter charges
in connection with an outbreak of legionnaires disease at a leisure
centre. A person in such a job has a huge responsibility, which I
believe should be reflected in their pay.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000117">&#160;</a>

danger in this debate that we forget about the really important job
that senior people in local authorities do. Although this analogy does
not work perfectly, I cannot help but think that this is somewhat like
asking how to reduce the wage bill at Manchester United. The Government
would say, “Get rid of Alex Ferguson,” but we all know
that the real cost is in the team—the people out there doing
stuff. I know that our street sweepers and care workers are not paid
what Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs are paid, but I would love them to be,
to be honest, because they are the real heroes of this country, and we
should do all that we can to encourage people to work in local
authorities. Another of my concerns about the whole nature of this
debate is that by insisting on senior salary policies, we might
generate the idea that we are interested only in how much people earn,
as opposed to the value that they offer
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000118">&#160;</a>

I may ask the Committee to indulge me further—I ask hon. Members
to consider the implications of such a conversation about local
authority pay for the recruitment and retention of the brightest and
best. After working in a local authority for a long time, I know that
the number of people under the age of 30 working in local authorities
can, in some parts of a council, be counted on two hands. According to
work force data, only 6% of people who work in local authorities are
aged 24 and under.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000121">&#160;</a>

round goes around the top universities, I think that we want people to
be saying, “I aspire to be the chief executive of a local
authority because I can make a huge difference to people’s
lives.” People go into public service for many different
reasons; it is not only about the pay. Certainly, as a London MP, I can
look at comparable jobs with equal responsibility in the private
sector. I suggest caution and restraint in this discussion and that we
think about what these jobs really involve.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000122">&#160;</a>

raising the debate to a better level, in a sense, by building on the
case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington.
People working in local government are carrying out significant jobs
and they deserve our praise and support, and to be valued.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">This debate
is very much about values, and I live in hope—I am a hopeful and
optimistic person—that the Government will take on board the
amendments, which propose a sensible way forward and show the sort of
leadership for which the country is asking. This is an opportunity for
leadership, as well as an opportunity to recognise the great work that
people do in local government and the great challenge for our age of
closing the inequality gap. Everybody knows—there is agreement
across the House—that closing that gap will save us money in the
longer term, as is shown by lots of evidence and research. When we
publish details of top pay, we should also publish details of the
lowest pay because that would shine a light on the issue of equality
and inequality and ensure that it is part of what is being driven
forward for the leadership of our country.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000124">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not feel
that the Government will object to the improvements set out in the
amendments. The proposal improves on the statements that the Government
have set out in the Bill. Transparency about the top pay and the lowest
pay in an organisation will show the right sort of leadership for those
who are contracted to carry out significant public sector work. The
country is asking for such leadership, so it is the sort of leadership
that we should show, because it will demonstrate our values.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000125">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I value the
honest debate that we have had so far, and I am optimistic that the
Government will see an opportunity for leadership by taking this
proposal for fairness forward. It would help us to show the public that
we are serious about closing the inequality gap and about people
earning a living wage. As the evidence tells us, the proposals will
benefit not only those people, but everybody
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000126">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Before I
became a Member, I spent 11 years as a trade union official
representing many tens of thousands of members in the public
sector—local government and the health service—as well as
in private companies. I saw the direct effect that a lack of
transparency had on the level of service. I can give an example of
cleaners in the health service. Owing to rising costs, a contractor was
seriously struggling to keep within the bid that they had put in for
the contract, so it kept reducing the pay for hospital cleaners. As a
result, the hospital could not keep its cleaners, because they were
being paid something like 90p an hour and as soon as they could get a
better-paid job, they left. The time spent training those
people—which is six weeks in the NHS for cleaning such important
places as theatres—and the investment in providing the
facilities and equipment for them to do the job was completely lost,
and such work had to continue on a rolling cycle. Subsequent
legislation stopped the
practice<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000128">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is a danger of having a lack of transparency in private companies.
Transparency should go from top to bottom. If companies are good, it
does not matter whether they are in the private or public sector. If
they are providing a service to the public that is funded by public
money, which is in effect what such contractors are doing, the
transparency should be there for all to see. Driving down contract
costs at the expense of people’s wages, and their terms and
conditions, creates the inherent danger of problems with service
provision. That is why having top-to-bottom transparency protects the
public and the services they receive, whether directly from public
bodies such as local authorities or the NHS, or from contractors paid
from the public purse. We need to look carefully across the piece to
ensure that the provisions we are considering are fair, transparent and
equal. If we do so, we will end up with good legislation, but if we do
not, we will just give ourselves problems for the
future.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000129">&#160;</a>

work every day and are give of themselves unbelievably selflessly as
they provide public services throughout the country. If we ask an
ordinary citizen, “What does the council do for you?”
their stock answer will be, “They empty the bins,” but is
so much more than that. Although we are in a time of cuts across a
range of public services, we should never miss an opportunity to

bury our dead. At the top end, they also provide strategy, leadership,

managing big departments in local authorities to make sure that the

require transparency in the pay of senior staff is, by no means, to
diminish the value of those who work there. Those two points are not in
the slightest contradictory. Indeed, the important role played by
senior staff means that it is right there should be transparency in the

say to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East that I appreciate
his concern about the “musts.” Of course, what we are
doing in the clauses is not to prescribe what a council’s policy
or levels of remuneration should be; we are simply prescribing that
there should be a policy. What it is, how it is phrased and what
arguments are made are entirely matters for the relevant council. If,
for example, the council wishes to set out in its policy the reasons
why it thinks appropriate remuneration should be paid and the nature of
the job, that can be incorporated in the policy. To that extent, the
“must” relates to the having of the policy, not the way
in which it is drawn up. I hope that the Committee will support those
elements of the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000136">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth considering the approach suggested by the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Erdington to lower pay. Given that we have accepted the
importance of transparency on senior pay and the fact that the full
council must vote on the policy—this brings us back to the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East—every
elected member has the opportunity 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>to vote and be held to account by their electors for the policy they
adopt. That seems to be consistent with localism and

the question of lower pay, although I am sympathetic to attempts to
shine light and gain transparency on the issue, I ask the hon. Member

amendments as proposed would achieve that objective in the best
possible way. I do not say that we should not continue to explore these
issues, but the important points made by a number of my hon. Friends in
interventions should not be ignored. Much has already been done to
improve transparency. Of course, the changes that my hon. Friend the
Member for Congleton referred to have already had a valuable impact and
it is also worth remembering that the Government have set up a review
under Will Hutton to specifically look at these pay levels. It might be
premature for us to be legislating to opt for a particular means of
dealing with the issue in advance of that commission’s

                           </strong> When the Minister says that he has sympathy for
the motives behind what we are proposing, I know that he means it,
given that he comes from a Macmillanite tradition of
Conservatives in local government. If what he is suggesting is that the
Government are sympathetic to the principle, considering that Will
Hutton is due to report in a matter of weeks, is the Minister prepared
to consider what we have proposed and introduce his own amendments to
ensure transparency for low pay as well as high
pay?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000139">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for what I take
as genuinely a very great compliment. I appreciate that. I cannot say
what we will do in advance of Hutton reporting, but we will certainly
undertake to reflect upon Hutton in the context of the Bill. I hope
that that is a sensible point to make. We want to be constructive about
the
matter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000140">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At
the moment our concern with the code is that any system we adopt to
encourage transparency at all pay levels should be proportionate,
because there is a potential burden on local authorities. It can be
dealt with, but it is important to keep it proportionate. In
particular, in advance of the Hutton commission’s report, it
might be premature at this stage to be legislating specifically on
multiples, which is the purpose of amendment 48. The hon. Gentleman
knows that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer
specifically asked that  the Hutton commission makes
recommendations on how to ensure that no public sector manager can earn
more than 20 times the lowest paid person in the organisation. That is
why we should wait to see what the public say on that point before
committing
ourselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000141">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also worth bearing in mind that clause 23 provides for the issuing
of guidance. We intend to ensure that, whatever happens, that guidance
reflects the fact that councils may extend their policies not just to
senior pay, but to pay levels further down the organisation. I hope
that is a constructive response to the hon. Gentleman’s
amendment, and I would ask him to consider withdrawing it on that
basis. We will revisit the
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000142">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
difficulty with new clause 1 is the extent to which one can impose that
requirement on contractors. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East
made the 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 317<a class="bkMark" name="Column317">&#160;</a>
                           </div>point that there are balancing considerations between the required value
of the contract and the other issues related to it. We require that
spends of more than £500 be published online, which is the
bottom line in which most members of the public will be interested. I
accept that there are other considerations, but I do not think one
could put councils in exactly the same position as, say, a shopper in a
supermarket who wants to be sure of buying fair trade food, or
something of that kind, because the shopper has the opportunity to take
their custom elsewhere, to buy a different product or to shop at a
different store. That is not comparable with the case we are
discussing.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
bodies that contract with local government to provide services are
separate legal entities and their staff are subject to their own pay
arrangements. The local authority is not their employer and they may be
contracting with a range of authorities. They might have contracts that
extend beyond the public sector,
too.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000144">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> But it is perfectly legal, when one puts a
contract out to tender, to ask for rates of pay to be included in the
information provided in that tendering process. It is not difficult to
do, and it is often done by many parts of the public sector already. It
is not a difficult thing to include; it is quite straightforward. It is
not onerous for the companies that are putting in
tenders.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is rather different when Government are doing
it. Commercial considerations and commercial confidentiality sometimes
arise where there is such provision. It is not necessary to go further
than that at this stage. If the local authority wishes to contract on
that basis, it is a matter for them; it should not be a matter of
Government prescribing how a local authority draws up the terms of its
contracts.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000146">&#160;</a>

are differences. There are safeguards under the Companies Act and, for

to prescribe that there will be a policy, but we do not seek to dictate

touched on the fact that certain councils want to outsource everything.

megabucks to be paid, as has been the case in some local authorities.
On the other hand, it is not right to brand
everyone who earns above a certain sum of money, irrespective of how
valuable they are to the local authority and irrespective of the
immense commercial skills that they may have acquired elsewhere in the
public and private sectors. I know that some good, long-serving local

She had been in the shop on a Saturday just before Easter, buying
Easter eggs for the half a dozen people whom she was due to visit the
following week. I asked her why she was doing it, and she said,
“They’re wonderful. I look after them in their homes, and
most of them are never visited by anyone else. No one will give them an

the years what the appropriate figure should be could change. The
clause simply gives the Secretary of State the capacity to set
parameters for the proposals that a council needs to take into account.

applied. That is where the “must” comes in. It would be

                           </strong> The Minister has given as good a defence as he
possibly can in the circumstances. Can I put to him another genuine
concern? There are circumstances where, because unforeseen requirements
emerge, an authority decides that it needs to make a new appointment
and it is impossible to fill that post without offering a pay level for
that type of activity that is out of line with its existing pay policy.
There appears to be no flexibility in the way that the clause is
written for an authority to make exceptions in exceptional
circumstances. I do not argue that it should be free to disregard its
own policy; that is not right at all. But it is always unfortunate if
policies are written so rigidly that there is no scope for variation
when there is good reason for it, even though there could be caveats
about additional safeguards that would need to be deployed in such
circumstances. The measure appears to be extraordinarily
rigid.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000182">&#160;</a>

envisage such circumstances arising in the area of east London that I
represent. The Olympics next year will put certain obligations and
responsibilities on local authorities that may require additional
appointments, and I can envisage the situation that I described
happening in those very exceptional circumstances. I wonder why a
degree of flexibility is not built into the provision. The Minister may
well tell me that the guidance that the Secretary of State will
issue—clearly, whatever he says, the Government do not entirely
trust local authorities—will cover the question of
flexibility.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000183">&#160;</a>

long enough for me to know the answer to this question. May I refer him
to clause 22(4)? It
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000184">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>In
other words, should such a circumstance arise, there is flexibility in
the primary legislation for the authority to amend its policy, perhaps
in relation to a specific post or more generally, so that it can make
sure that an appointment complies with the policy, even if the policy
has a little bulge on one side to accommodate the
situation.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000185">&#160;</a>

want to come back to the flexibility point. The Secretary of

designed to give flexibility at the national level if there were
rapidly changing circumstances that meant that, from year to year,

local authority to adjust according to its local circumstances. With

                           </strong> I want to put on record our
concern about, and our opposition to, this surprising provision. Clause
27 removes the measures introduced in the Local Democracy, Economic
Development and Construction Act 2009, which placed a duty on local
authorities to promote democracy. The removal of that duty is deeply
worrying for several reasons. That duty and the duty on petitions,
which will be discussed in the clause 28 debate, were introduced by a
Labour Government in 2009 to strengthen local democracy. The 2009 Act
did that by giving councils new duties actively to promote democratic
engagement and civic participation. It also gave local people stronger
rights and more opportunities to have their say through increased and
enhanced scrutiny and, for the first time, through legal rights to
receive a response to their petitions. The decision to repeal the duty
to promote democracy raises several concerns about the
Government’s attitude towards democratic engagement. It also,
however, gives rise to several important questions that I hope the
Ministers will be able to
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000191">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
general issue of consultation is important, and we will return to it
time and again. The Committee stage is the first time that the Bill has
received any form of scrutiny. In sharp contrast to that, the decision
to place a duty on local authorities to promote democracy, which was
enshrined in the 2009 Act, came about as a result of considerable
consultation and scrutiny. In 2007, the Councillors Commission was
established by the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, Ruth Kelly, to investigate the barriers preventing able and
representative people from becoming councillors and how best to secure
public interest and recognition for the work of councillors. The first
recommendation of that all-party commission was that local authorities
should be charged with a duty to facilitate local democratic
engagement. It
said:<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000192">&#160;</a>

are unlikely to feel a sense of engagement with something they do not
understand. The starting point for facilitating democratic engagement
locally is through communication. Local authorities need to become
expert at explaining what they do, which services are the

another. Who is accountable to whom and for what? How can people have
influence? How can they get involved, individually or collectively? How
do they get things

I say that Ministers perhaps believe that once the duty to promote

work, and people will therefore not realise that the cuts that they
face to their citizens advice bureaux, libraries, swimming pools,
social care and youth centres, to name but a few examples, are the
result of decisions taken in Whitehall rather than in town halls, as
Ministers would have them believe?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000204">&#160;</a>

did not prescribe how the duty would work in practice. That was for the
local authorities to implement as they saw fit, but the principle of
promoting democracy is surely something on which everyone in this House
would agree. There was a statesmanlike exchange at Prime
Minister’s Question Time between the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition on the need for President Mubarak to hear the
call for democracy in his country. It is utterly inconsistent for the
Government to remove the duty to promote democracy in our country. Do

                           </strong> Parliament needs, on the one hand, to discuss new
ways of empowering the citizen—as we are doing in the context of
the Bill—and, on the other hand, unashamedly to expect councils
to engage with their communities. The duty to promote democracy told
councils that democracy, engagement and listening to the people they
represent matters, and it told them that we expected them to do that.
There is no contradiction
whatever.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000209">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
measures that the Government seek to repeal also place a duty on
principal local authorities to promote understanding among local people
of local bodies that relate to the authority’s area. Those
include health bodies, police bodies and court boards. Given the
Government’s rhetoric on community involvement, the promotion of
an understanding of who does what—it can be a complex
jumble—would seem a thoroughly noble objective.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000210">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Parish
councils are included in the list of bodies under the duty. In my
experience, parish councils at their best—many are absolutely
admirable—make an enormous contribution to their communities. In
later parts of the Bill that deal with planning, which I am sure will
be the subject of lively debate, new responsibilities will be placed on
parish councils. Under the Government’s proposals to introduce a
neighbourhood planning regime, parish councils will be able to prepare
neighbourhood plans and neighbourhood development orders. It seems
intellectually incoherent to place new responsibilities on such
bodies—important responsibilities that will have an effect on
the areas that they cover for generations—only to remove the
duty to promote understanding of such bodies in the same
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000211">&#160;</a>

assessment has been made of current participation in parish councils?
How many uncontested elections to parish councils have taken place in
the past five years? What percentage of elections to parish councils
have been uncontested during the past few years? Has the Department for
Communities and Local Government carried out any research on
participation in parish councils? If, as we all believe, the role of
parish councils matters, what will the Government do to encourage
participation in, and understanding of, parish councils in the absence
of the duty that is to be removed by the Bill?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000212">&#160;</a>

greater community involvement in the planning and development of local
areas. We recognise that parish councils will play an important role,
but we must ensure that such bodies are as open and transparent as

councils in having a greater say in the lives of their

his attention to the proposal, which we will debate in due course, for
neighbourhood forums? Are the Government repealing the duty to promote
democracy because they are embarrassed by the realisation that they
propose to allow the establishment of neighbourhood forums consisting
of only three members, who do not have to be democratically elected by
the forum? Is the real secret behind the repeal that the Government are
embarrassed not to be promoting
democracy?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000214">&#160;</a>

taken by neighbourhood forums. The capacity, however, for three
men—or women—and a dog to decide, in the Dog and Duck, to
become a neighbourhood forum, and to demand special status as a
consequence, is bizarre. We will return to the matter in some detail in
subsequent debates. We do not want a reduction in democratic
participation, so Government and local government need to act to
ensure: that citizens know about the decisions and responsibilities of
their councils and councillors; that they are clear about the different
responsibilities and how they can influence them; that they understand
how the different agencies relate to one another; and that they are
encouraged to get involved. I hope, therefore that Ministers have a
change of heart and continue to support the duty to promote

He also performed a U-turn of breathtaking proportions, considering his

Mr Amess, but to us he is the sage of Bradford. Earlier, the hon.
Member for Birmingham, Erdington accepted the principle that the

but when we reach the very next measure in the Bill that deals with a

sole economy measure that they sought to preserve before the former
Chief Secretary left his note saying that there was no money left. They
saved a bit of money by realising that the provision was daft, but the
amount saved was not daft. The impact assessment in the December 2008
White Paper in which the idea was first canvassed estimated that it
would cost local government £32 million a year to maintain the
duty. The best estimate was that it would require each council to hire
two additional employees merely to discharge this duty from the centre.
Leaving aside any publicity budget that might have arisen, anyone in
local government would recognise that that £32 million could be
better spent on services and other areas at councils’

the Member for Bradford East, is that just because something is a good
thing, one does not need to insist that it happens and compel it from
the centre. People of goodwill, and especially those involved in
democratic politics, can be trusted to discharge the obligation
themselves.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000222">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I am lost in
admiration for the voluntary promotion of democracy by Opposition Front
Benchers. For example, I regularly visit the website of the hon. Member
for Worsley and Eccles South, pages of which are devoted to setting out
how constituents can get in touch with her, have a tour of Parliament,
or get tickets to the Gallery to watch debates. Quite
rightly—and at great length—she encourages her
constituents of all ages to come to see the House in operation.
Although it might have escaped me, I do not believe that there we have
a duty under our employment contracts, in so far as we have them, to
promote democracy in that way, yet of us do it. All of us take
constituency groups around Westminster and we all speak to young people
and voluntary groups in our constituencies. We do it because we know it
is right and we do it with enthusiasm.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000223">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It would not
be right for Front Benchers to suggest that the Independent
Parliamentary Standards Authority should take on the new requirement of
testing whether Members do enough each year to promote democracy. It
would be as inappropriate—<em>[</em>

Perhaps I am tempting hon. Members. What is good enough for us is good
enough for local government. Every elected member of every authority
knows that they have responsibilities, and we should allow them to
discharge those responsibilities in their own way without the central
imposition that even the previous Government thought was a dead
end.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000224">&#160;</a>

Democracy is not promoted for the residents of those areas. We must

lower turnout, apart from when the issues are very

want to ask the Minister a different question. Members on both sides of
the Committee share a desire to encourage more people to stand for
election to their local council. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham

we have a debate on the eligibility of council employees to stand for

the hon. Gentleman knows, we have introduced the Localism Bill. There
may be an opportunity, as that Bill goes through the House, to have a

minefield, but I would particularly encourage this to be considered in
the light of the fact that we will be talking next week about community
empowerment and the possibility that council employees may bid for
services, and a service may start to be run outwith a council. People
who are disqualified could suddenly find that that is not the case. If
that happened at a large scale in some areas, there could be some very
unfair effects. There might be one position for lollipop ladies and
classroom assistants, while much more senior people involved in a
charity or some form of social enterprise could still be disqualified.
Can the Minister give us any encouragement on
that?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000229">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Let me answer the hon. Lady’s first point
first. What can be done about those councillors—those elected
members of democratic institutions at any level—who do not
enough to engage with and involve their community? Frankly, they get
voted out of office—that is an imperative, and we want to see
more of it. There are further things that we can do. One of the reasons
why local election turnout has declined and people have been put off
participating in local government is that when powers are taken away
from local government and local people and given to centralised
or—even worse—unelected bodies, it reduces the motivation
to be a local councillor and the purpose of the
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000230">&#160;</a>

powers and the balance between national and local
government.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is a very good point. It is true that
declining participation presents a challenge, but this country has
experienced a precipitous decline that is greater than that of other
countries. Let us consider significant and meaningful elections. For
example, there was a lot of interest in the previous US presidential
election because a great deal was at stake. People started to
participate in new ways. That did not happen because Congress imposed a
duty on Senators and Congressmen to whip up interest in the
presidential contest, but because there was a hard-fought contest on
which many important matters concerning the whole of America and the
free world
rested.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000232">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Putting
more substantial decisions in the hands of local people and their
elected bodies is the way to revive confidence and interest. We have a
system in which there is a remote and alienating regional tier that
people feel imposes on them. Local government operating through the
comprehensive area assessment, and so essentially acting as a branch
officer of central Government, is not the way to promote democracy. The
previous Government would have been better served by addressing, as we
are, the fundamental causes of a lack of participation, rather than
attempting, but failing, to deal with its symptoms, although they
recognised that in the end by not commencing the relevant provisions of
the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act
2009.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000233">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister’s thesis is that the
decline in the power of local government is one explanation for the
fall in turnout in local government elections. If his thesis were
correct, the obverse would surely be the case. The most precipitant
fall in participation occurred in elections to this House, particularly
in 2001 and 2005. If his thesis were correct and the previous
Government had been taking powers away from local government, we might
have expected an increase, not a decrease, in the turnout for those
elections, but that was not the case. The pattern that my hon. Friend
the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde described is true. It is
international and it relates to Parliament as well as local government.
Although we might intellectually like to think there is some truth in
the Minister’s case, it does not
wash.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000234">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The right hon. Gentleman need only look at the
increase in participation in the previous general election to see what
happens when there is something at stake. I am sad to say that most of
the population did not share the expectation that the 2001 election
would be a knife-edge contest, so some people decided that it was not
worth turning out. There was more at stake in 2010, so many people
turned out to vote. Surely it is not a matter of contention between the
parties that the more people are involved in making decisions, the more
relevant things seem for them, and the more likely they will be to take
up the

I was a councillor in Trafford. We may say to people, “You could
stand in Stafford or Manchester”, but they might not know those
places and be part of them. Teaching assistants and lollipop ladies
would be well known in their communities and their representation of
local people would probably be excellent. My hon. Friend the Member for
Wrexham was asking why they cannot stand for election. Surely working
for a council by helping children across the road or acting at a very

Of course, people will have many opportunities, especially under our
plans in the Bill, to participate in authorities other than the one
that employs them. If there is a parish council or, indeed, a
neighbourhood forum, people can get involved at that level. If they
work for a lower-tier authority, they could be involved in the
upper-tier authority. At the moment, there is no lack of opportunity
for people to participate in their communities in ways other than
through their employment, but it is right that we reflect on the
safeguards necessary to guard against possible conflicts of interest.

                           </div>were given legal rights to receive a response to their petitions. Clause
28 removes the requirement for local authorities to establish schemes
to accept and respond to local petitions. In addition to the removal of
the duty to promote democracy, the removal of the duty to respond to
petitions clearly undermines the Government’s commitment to
localism and empowering
communities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000245">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
all have the same experience; petitions provide an extremely important
way for local communities to express their views collectively about an
issue and to generate local and national debate. Petitioning also helps
to ensure that local authorities are aware of and respond to the
issues, concerns and aspirations that are most important to local
people.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000246">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It

                        <p class="tabbed">The
first recorded petitions to the Houses of Parliament date from the
reign of Richard II and became such an important part of our
parliamentary democracy that, in 1571, a Committee for Motions of
Griefs and Petitions was first appointed. Petitions continued
throughout the centuries. In the 16th and 17th centuries, they
generally dealt with personal or local grievances. Then, with the
increase in the influence of Parliament during the reign of Charles I,
petitioning became one of the main methods of airing grievances by
those classes under-represented in Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000249">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is,
therefore, a long and honourable history of the right to petition and
the power of the House to deal with petitions, and the previous
Government’s legislation sought to extend those rights to
ordinary people locally in relation to their local
authorities.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000250">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">By
the 1830s, both for Parliament and for town halls, the reading of
petitions took up considerable time. MPs often used the system to get
frequent and unscheduled debates on subjects that their constituents
felt strongly about. During the 19th century, 10,000 a Session came to
Parliament.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000251">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">That great
historic tide was confirmed when 6 million people, out of a population
of 20 million, signed the Chartist petitions in the 1840s, which
demanded greater democracy. Another mass petition involved tens of
thousands signing in support of the campaign to abolish the
transatlantic slave trade. In 1901, <em>The Times</em> considered that
“whatever their practical utility”, petitions

the other. We will debate that in some detail, but why rob local people
of their right to say to their council, “This is a matter of

28, the council is under no obligation whatever to respond. Any

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009
introduced new and groundbreaking requirements for local authorities to
respond to the communities that they serve. Petitions are an important
way in which local communities can collectively express their views on
issues that matter to them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000258">&#160;</a>

also improve the connection between residents and local authorities,
especially—in answer to the point that the hon. Member for
Congleton made—when they are acknowledged and responded to
seriously by local authorities. The process of formally petitioning
local authorities strengthens the voice of local communities and allows
them to have a legitimate voice in, and a direct influence on, local
authority decision making. It also helps to ensure that local
authorities are aware of the issues, concerns and aspirations that
matter most to local people and that they can respond to them
accordingly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000259">&#160;</a>

are all in favour of petitions. I have presented them and I am sure
that every Member of the House has, too. None of us has felt
constrained by the arrangements. I dare say that the reason why we
present petitions is that we think it is the right thing to do. We want
to give expression to the opinions of our constituents and, if we
refused to represent them and take them seriously, that would be noted
and we would bear the consequences at the next general election. A
degree of self-interest and community mindedness over the past 1,000

it. We can save more than £4 million, which would be best spent
on local services, by getting rid of yet another daft leftover from the
previous Government. I hope that the Committee agrees with

know from my time as Deputy Leader of the House before the last
election that the House has been testing over the past number of years
how to improve what it does in support of petitions. It has made sure
that, when a Member presents a petition to the House, it is recorded in
<em>Hansard</em>, and it has tried to find ways for Committees to respond
to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000265">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
should reject the repeals, keep the duty on petitions and not
substitute them with something else. A referendum would be costly,
particularly in London boroughs. The impact assessment mentions
hundreds and thousands of pounds in relation to referendums. It will
not happen lightly. Collecting 5% of signatures—if that remains
the amount required—will not be
easy.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000266">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure that members of the Committee will have received petitions
recently. We recently received a petition and took it to our local
council in Salford. It was from all the parents whose children attend a
particular day nursery, and it complained about the nursery’s
poor lighting, which they thought unsatisfactory in the dark of
winter.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000267">&#160;</a>

is no way that a local referendum could meet the requirements of such
small, concentrated groups, which may comprise all the people who live
on a street or two. The previous Government introduced the duty because
there was a need to get those councils that were not responding to
petitions to do so. It is part of our

answer. There is enough cynicism about councils. People always complain
that when they write to them, they do not reply, and that when they ask
them to do something, they do not do it. The petition is cheap,
flexible and effective. It is well understood and has a long history,

paragon of local democratic engagement, promoting petitions in her
constituency. I imagine that her council responded well to the petition
and took it seriously. A council that did not do that should, frankly,
be thrown out. We would all recognise that a council that is failing to
engage with its community should bear the consequences. The hon. Lady
says that the House is thinking about how to improve the means by which
we consider petitions. That has the germ of a principle that we should
establish for local councils. It should be for the bodies themselves to
consider their current practice, to reflect on how they can improve it
and to make those changes. If we do not think we have got it right, it
ill behoves us to give our flawed and partial advice to every local

thousands of pounds for continuing non-compliance. To give a very rough
indication of historic fines, in a Spanish bathing water case, the levy
was €624,000 per year for each 1 per cent of bathing waters in
breach of the relevant Directive. In a French fishing case the levy was
a €20m lump sum fine and €58m every six months until the

heart of the Bill is a very centrist desire to impose the will of

local government for things over which it has no
control.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000289">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It is not
surprising that Councillor Gary Porter and the other people from local
government who gave evidence to us were concerned about this.
Councillor Porter showed a touching confidence in us as politicians in
respect of putting right what he saw as the meddling of officials in
parts of the Bill. I am sure that he saw this clause as one of those
areas that we need to put right. If we are genuine about localism and
about allowing local people to take things forward, this clause needs
to be removed because it gives the Secretary of State an additional
power that he should not have.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000290">&#160;</a>

the Minister to explain the rationale behind it. The only rationale I
can see is to pass the buck and pass on costs to local authorities. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South has explained,
we know what incredible pressure the budgets of local authorities will
be under over the next couple of years.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000291">&#160;</a>

represent a London constituency, I wonder how the clause would work in
a London context. Reference has already been made to air pollution and
not meeting the relevant targets set in EU legislation. We have
Heathrow in London and I wonder how this measure would work for the
Greater London authority or Hounslow. What control does Hounslow or the
GLA have over the air pollutants from the nation’s primary
airport? How would it work around landfill?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000292">&#160;</a>

previous career, I represented a unitary authority. The London borough
of Lewisham has direct responsibility over how we manage our waste. We
were able to build an incinerator and to reduce the amount of waste
that was going to landfill. But for many local authorities, meeting EU
landfill targets is incredibly difficult. How do we allocate where the
fines are allocated when different local authorities have different
types of
responsibility?<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000293">&#160;</a>

disagreed with the decision and would like the project to continue.

                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
object in principle to the concept of delegating fines without also
delegating the funds, resources and powers to take the steps necessary
to avoid the fines.”<em>––[Official Report,

                        </p>
                        <p>I would
have thought that the Government, with all their devolutionary
aspirations, would have had a great deal of
sympathy with that clear principle. It cannot be right to delegate an
obligation to pay a fine without delegating the means to mitigate the
harm to the maximum extent, or if not, then the resources to enable the
authority to pay the fine. That is particularly true when the authority
has had no role whatever in the circumstances leading to the
infringement. Sir Simon went on to highlight circumstances in which the
measure would
apply:<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000298">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“For
example, in London there are three waste sites that contribute to our
exceeding air quality levels. Those waste sites are operated by
boroughs, they are regulated by the Environment Agency and yet it is
the Mayor of London who will face a fine if those sites continue to
exceed air quality levels.”<em>––</em>[<em>Official
Report, Localism Public Bill Committee, </em>25 January 2011; c. 52,

                        </p>
                        <p>Again,
that is a powerful point of principle. If the Government intend to
delegate the obligation to pay that fine to an authority that has had
no part whatever in the circumstances leading to the infringement, that
implies a considerable measure of
injustice.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000299">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
are important points of principle that not only cover the worries and
anxieties of local government, but go to the heart of the Bill. If the
Government are truly as devolutionist as they pretend to be, they have
to reconsider the provision, because it is not devolutionary. It is a
centralising provision, which says, “We are only devolving costs
to local government. We are making local government meet the costs, but
won’t help them with the obligations that go with fines.”
I urge the Government to reconsider. A strong case has been made, not
only by my hon. Friends but by witnesses. I hope that the Minister will
restore some of his devolutionary credibility by removing the
provision, which makes a mockery of the aspiration to
devolve.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000300">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am always anxious to restore my devolutionary
credibility. I share Councillor Porter’s assessment of the
capability of the Committee and the House to ensure that the
legislation does not fall into the trap of unintended consequences, and
the scrutiny process is important in that.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000301">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The principle
is clear: with great power comes great responsibility, as was said in a
recent film. We are giving great power to local
authorities—powers that used to reside with Ministers in
Whitehall. We are giving them to people who will be able to exercise
them with fewer restraints than they had in the past, so there needs to
be some responsibility. In effect, the question is one of subsidiarity.
Where should power lie? What accountability should there be at that
level of power? I concur with the evidence and the right hon.
Gentleman’s quote from Sir Simon Milton, who said that if we
devolve responsibility for paying contributions to the fines, we must
devolve the powers to deal with the problem. That seems an absolutely
correct encapsulation of the issue at hand.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000302">&#160;</a>

statement of policy, which we will draw up in consultation with the
London boroughs and the LGA, we will establish a set of principles that
clearly do not apportion responsibility for issues on which we might be
subject to EU infraction proceedings but for which no local authority
has responsibility, or where responsibility cannot be divided up, such
as in the case of Heathrow’s contribution. However, we are
talking about cases where a particular local authority has an
identifiable responsibility, was warned in advance and had the power to
do something about the matter—to refer to the point made by the
right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich—but deliberately
and wilfully set that responsibility aside. I am sure that we will be
able to design a set of principles and safeguards that will allay any
of the concerns that would be justified if it were intended merely to
pass on all EU fines. That is not the intention; we will do things
proportionately.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000307">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I was looking
again at my notes on the impact assessment. The worry, bearing in mind
the amount of the cuts with which local authorities are still tussling,
is that a fine is a minimum lump sum of €9.6 million, according
to the impact assessment, plus daily fines, and we have only those raw
figures. Can the Minister give us some estimate of present liabilities
and those in the near future? My local council in Salford is tussling
with the need to cut £47 million this year. Authorities are now
having to move their eligibility criteria for social care up to
“critical”. There is no scope for the fines. If an
authority has not done what it should in all areas, what is the
potential impact of a passed-down fine? Could it be €500,000, or
€1 million? How many thousands of euros a day are we talking
about? It is not good enough to expect the Committee to go along with
the measures just because the Minister says “It will be
okay” and regulations and a policy can be
made.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000309">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The UK has not had a fine from the EU so far, so it
is not possible to say what a typical fine is. The whole purpose of the
provisions is to ensure that we never have a fine, because they provide
the right incentives for everyone who might contribute to an

                           </div>infraction to prevent it from happening in the first place. To go back
to the point made by the hon. Member for Stalybridge and
Hyde, given our commitment to setting out the
conditions, and the requirement for advance warning of both the risk of
infraction proceedings and the fact that there is something that a
particular authority can do about it, it clearly follows that there is
no danger that anything could be retrospective in advance of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000310">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
doubt whether there is an issue of principle between us. Let me give an
example of something that could be a difficulty in future. Under the EU
waste framework directive, there is a requirement on all waste planning
authorities to adopt a waste management plan. That is a requirement on
every single authority that is designated a waste authority. That is
clearly something that is directly in the control of a local authority.
What if it did not comply with the need to have a waste management
plan? Clearly it would need to be notified in good time that it needed
to have one, and it would need to be warned in good time that if it did
not, it risked making the UK breach its treaty obligations and
incurring a fine for the UK. If the responsibility was very clear and
the power to avert the infraction was equally clear—obviously I
cannot prejudice how this would be considered, but that seems to be a
fair example—and there had been sufficient warning, it would be
unfair to make council tax payers elsewhere in the country responsible
for one particular authority’s failure to comply. Establishing a
means by which that unfairness could be avoided seems to me to be the
right thing to do.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000311">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
reasonable debate to have—the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles
South is perfectly right to say this—is about the methodology:
the rules for allocating fines and for assessing whether it is
reasonable to attribute a fine to a local authority. That is of the
essence. We will come forward during the passage of the Bill with some
suggestions on how that might be
addressed.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000312">&#160;</a>

direction on this clause. I am delighted at the way in which the
Minister is explaining his intentions, which are broadly reasonable.
Our difficulty is that there is widespread anxiety in local government
about the impact of the provisions. Moreover, in the absence of
pre-legislative scrutiny, we have not had an opportunity to dig down
into the issues and really get them resolved before we have to vote on
the provisions. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles
South said, we are having to take things on trust. I hope that the
Minister will recognise that the problem was created because the Bill
was presented in short order, and with much of the detail that we would
normally expect to see in Committee simply not available to us. I
welcome the moves that the Minister is making, and I applaud his

Committee to that Bill than there were clauses in the first place, so I
think the right hon. Gentleman is being a little harsh. This is not a
complex matter or a point of contention. I agree absolutely with the
request and the injunction given by the deputy Mayor of London, Sir
Simon Milton. They seem reasonable provisions. They are explicitly
anticipated in clause 31, which provides that the warning notice should
set out the Minister’s reasons for believing that an authority
has caused or contributed to any infraction, whether the authority
should be required to make a payment, the criteria for determining the
amount of payment and the proposed procedure and timetable for
representations. That is a pretty clear set of intentions.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000318">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We will take
that a step further to provide necessary and reasonable reassurance.
However, again, the essential point of the measure is that if a
particular local authority is entirely responsible for incurring a fine
for the remaining citizens of the country, it is reasonable that there
should be provision for that to be handed on. I note that the
Labour-led Welsh Assembly Government recognised the same point and have
requested the same power there. I think there is a recognition across
parties in government that this is a reasonable and proportionate
desire, and it clearly needs to be rooted in some operating
procedures.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000319">&#160;</a>

approaching the debate because he seems to be taking things forward in
a positive direction. Am I right to understand that he is essentially
saying is that this principle will taken forward in such a way that
local authorities can be vulnerable to EU fines only if they have
proper control over the circumstances that might lead to that fine? Is
he also saying that information we have not yet seen, because it has
not yet been developed, will be worked up with the LGA and local
authorities so that the measure will come into effect only in
circumstances in which they are comfortable with what is being

would be very easy for any local authority that is liable to say,
“Yes, we have the power, but I’m afraid we didn’t
have the resources to make a difference, given that those resources
come overwhelmingly from central Government.” Many members of
the Committee who have been elected as members of various bodies have
blamed central Government for not giving them enough resources as an
easy way to get around a problem. Will the Minister address that

answer both questions at the same time. As I have stressed on a couple
of occasions, we must bear in mind the context of the difficult
financial situation and large front-loaded cuts faced by cities such as
Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham. They are having to cut jobs and
services. I know that we have not yet reached the provisions on council
tax, but they recognise the fact it is sometimes inappropriate to take
certain action against a local authority. The Minister is still telling
us that this is going to be okay because it is going to be okay. I am
surprised that there could not be a similar measure in the EU fines
provisions to say, “We don’t want to break a
council”—even one that has been irresponsible, although I

authority? This is being done extrajudicially. When individuals are
fined by a court, their ability to pay is taken into account. The
effect of levying a fine of many hundreds of thousands of pounds or
half a million or more would have to be taken into account, so I am
slightly surprised that that has not been

it is stated that there will be “due regard” and that the

that the Minister must do more than just look at the situation or take
it into account. If applying that sort of fine would break a council,
it would not be right to do so. We would not want to see services cut
back to the bone just to ensure that a fine was
paid.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000329">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> There is no danger of that. In fact, the drafting
is pretty strong. The provision goes further than
some of the other measures. It requires the Minister “to have
regard to”—a legalistic phrase, as we know, but a
powerful one in law—the effect of a payment on any
authority’s finances to ensure that any allocated sum will not
impose an excessive burden. It is not about tipping an authority into
bankruptcy, but about imposing an excessive burden. It should be
obvious from the drafting that we have bent over backwards to be
reasonable and to accommodate local government’s perfectly
understandable concerns. The powers could not be used
unfairly.<a class="bkMark" name="11020358000330">&#160;</a>
