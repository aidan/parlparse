Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): The hon. Member for

Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob Marris) was saved by the bell at the end

of this morning&#146;s sitting, having introduced the subject of

sport into the debate. He was trying the patience&#151;I imagine

deliberately&#151;of Opposition Members in a rather uncharacteristic

attempt to suggest that they had been asleep during the Budget debate.

He must have erased from his memory the entire debate in Committee on

the Floor of the House in which the Opposition raised matters of great

significance.</div><a name="06051155000020"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000391"></a>The

amendment No.

2?</div><a name="06051155000021"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000392"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I am grateful to you, Mr. O&#146;Hara, for

bringing me on to the point of my remarks. However, having been unable

to speak earlier, I could not resist responding to the point made by

the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West.</div>

<a name="06051155000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I support what was said by my

hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois) when he moved what

is a pragmatic and sensible amendment. As we heard this morning, it is

entirely supported by the art market. I want to make a practical

observation to the Paymaster General if she is not aware of the way in

which the art market works. It is a seasonal market. There are markets,

typically in the summer months of June and July, that require a great

deal of preparation, not least of which is the publication of extensive

catalogues. Due to the complexity of the VAT regime in the art market,

the catalogues have to refer to specific VAT rates and regimes that

apply to each piece of art that is up for

auction.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column109" />Column number: 110</div><a name="06051155000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000393"></a><b class="B">Helen

Goodman</b> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab): Like the hon. Gentleman,

I have a rural constituency and can understand seasonality in

agriculture. However, can he explain why the art market is particularly

seasonal?</div><a name="06051155000024"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000394"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I do not profess to having any specific expert

knowledge. I receive rather too many e-mails from art auctioneers for

reasons that I cannot really understand, but they make me aware when

sales are coming up. They have sales at times of the year when there

are many visitors to London&#151;London being the centre of the art

market in Europe and a world centre&#151;and they tend to be in June

and July, months when other occasions, such as major sporting events,

draw people to this country. The other popular seasons tend to be in

the pre-Christmas period&#151;in November and December&#151;which

again may be partly related to the fact that people enjoy buying

Christmas presents at that time of year. There are well established

seasons and because of the lead time for drawing up the necessary

publications to make the market work properly, the provision cannot be

introduced overnight without having significant repercussions on the

normal working of the market. For that reason, I support the

amendment.</div><a name="06051155000025"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000395"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Gauke</b> (South-West Hertfordshire) (Con): I merely

have a few questions for the Paymaster General about the clause, all of

which relate to the amendment. What assessment has the Treasury made of

the impact on the art market, as a consequence of the changes in VAT on

auctioneer&#146;s commission? What revenue will it gain as a

consequence of the changes? Has it taken into account any harm that may

be done to the art market in the United

Kingdom?</div><a name="06051155000026"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000396"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Sadiq Khan</b> (Tooting) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman accept

that, rather than the change having an impact on the art market, issues

such as rates of exchange may have more of an impact than seasonal

variations?</div><a name="06051155000027"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000397"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> That may well be the case, but as we are debating

changes in VAT, I thought that I would raise that matter rather than

any other

factors.</div><a name="06051155000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000398"></a><b class="B">Julia

Goldsworthy</b> (Falmouth and Camborne) (LD): Will the hon.

Gentleman accept that the issue is about compliance with a European

Court of Justice ruling? The issue is not the negative impact that

there may be on the market, but the fact that compliance is

necessary.</div><a name="06051155000029"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000399"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> The hon. Lady is absolutely right. Compliance is

necessary, but we should none the less know the costs of that

compliance. That is what I am asking about and, indeed, I may return to

that subject later in our proceedings should I catch you

eye,Mr.

O&#146;Hara.</div><a name="06051155000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given

that the changes are a consequence of a European Court of Justice

judgment, what legal advice have the Government received saying that

they were correct in their application of VAT rules? I ask that,

because several Conservative Members have referred to legal advice in

other contexts. Perhaps Ministers were a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column110" />Column number: 111</div>little dismissive by saying that they had always taken legal advice, but

it seems that it is frequently wrong or at least a different

interpretation is taken by the European Court of Justice. Will the

Paymaster General explore that matter

further?</div><a name="06051155000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000400"></a><b class="B">Sir

George Young</b> (North-West Hampshire) (Con): I welcome the

speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh when he moved the

amendment. I am sure that it will make him even more welcome in

Sotheby&#146;s and Christie&#146;s on his regular visits to those

two great auction

houses.</div><a name="06051155000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to

pursue two points. I have no difficulty with the United Kingdom

responding to the judgment of the European Court of Justice. Of course,

we must do that. Will the Paymaster General say whether the speed at

which we respond to such a judgment and this one, in particular, is

comparable to the speed with which other countries respond when they

are found tohave acted unlawfully? The date of the judgment

was 25 February last year and we are putting the matter right under the

Finance Bill. Can the right hon. Lady assure me that other Governments

respond with similar alacrity when they are found to be acting outwith

the remit of the European Court of

Justice?</div><a name="06051155000033"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000401"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. It is not within the terms of reference

of the debate to ask the Paymaster General to speak for other

Governments.</div><a name="06051155000034"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000402"></a>Sir

George Young:</b> I understand that, but the amendment would

delay the date on which we respond to the judgment. If we delayed,

would that mean that we were more in line with the speed at which other

countries respond to the European Court? Will it bring us ahead? I see

that the right hon. Lady has the answer at her

fingertips.</div><a name="06051155000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we

respond as proposed, will we be on a level playing field with other

auction houses in Europe? In other words, have they also responded to

any judgments against them? Will there be a level playing field in the

auction house market within Europe when the clause is

enacted?</div><a name="06051155000036"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000403"></a>The

Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</b> I think that I can

help the Committee. The matter needs to be put into context. It has not

arisen simply because of an ECJ ruling, although that is part of the

chain of events that led to the amendment. In 1973, when VAT was

introduced in the United Kingdom, the Government at the time went for

the option of not charging VAT on the importation of certain works of

art, antiques and collectors&#146; pieces. However, when accepting

the dossier, the then Government in negotiations on the seventh VAT

directive, which was concerned mainly with the harmonisation of VAT

treatment, agreed that, for a short time, the rate of VAT on works of

art should be 2.5 per cent., rising automatically to 5 per cent. That

is the position that we are in, and it was negotiated by the previous

Conservative Government. Unfortunately, they failed to raise the issue

of VAT treatment of auctioneer&#146;s commission, the very subject

that we are debating, when seeking a derogation. They

missedthat out.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 112</div><a name="06051155000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">When this Government was

elected, we automatically inherited the international agreement

established by the previous Government, including their failure to

apply for a derogation in that specific area. This Government agreed

with the art market that auctioneer&#146;s commission should be

subject to the same rate. Unfortunately, the Commission did

not.</div> <a name="06051155000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">A very long set

of negotiations and disagreements then ensued between the Government

and the Commission. A series of changes were also made in Finance Bills

to try to ease the art market&#146;s position, particularly in

recognition of London&#146;s importance on the international scene.

We were taken to court, and we lost. We have an ECJ ruling against us

now. The reason that we are here in the first place is a failure to

apply for&#151;a failure even to think to apply for&#151;a

derogation. </div><a name="06051155000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

British Art Market Federation does not support the amendment. It

recognises the difficult position that it and the Government are in.

The BAMF has suggested in its discussions and

negotiations&#151;bearing in mind all the points made by the hon.

Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)&#151;that 1 September would be a

sensible starting date for the arrangement. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

Members:</span> &#147;That is what the amendment says.&#148;]

No, the amendment does not say

that.</div><a name="06051155000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">A difficulty

then arises, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, with regard to how

speedily the UK will be required to comply with the requirement that we

have been disputing&#151;we have lost the dispute at each

point&#151;since 1997. Technically, the starting date should be on

Royal Assent, but having negotiated with the industry, we have made it

1 September. That is what the industry has asked

for.</div><a name="06051155000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment is

not acceptable because it opens up a possibility that the Commission

might interpret it unfavourably. It says,</div>

<a name="06051155000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;not before 1st September

2006&#148;,</div><a name="06051155000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">which implies that

it could be later. Because it could happen on Royal Assent, the BAMF

does not support the amendment, and did not ask for it to be tabled.

The BAMF has an agreement with the Government, and that is the most

sensible way to proceed after long and protracted negotiations. I pay

tribute to art market representatives, particularly Anthony Browne,

whom I have met. I am familiar with the brief because it has been on my

desk since

1997.</div><a name="06051155000343"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000405"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> It is not surprising that Mr. Browne is against

the changes. The Government and the art market have fought hard over

the issue. It is a shame that the Conservative Government did not work

as closely with the art market, a market that they now profess to

support on the derogation.</div>

<a name="06051155000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said why it needs to be

done within that period, and I have dealt with the matter of legal

advice&#151;and our advice is the same as the art market&#146;s. I

turn next to what the cost is likely to be to the art 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column112" />Column number: 113</div>market. The only figures that I can provide are those provided by the

British Art Market Federation, but we have absolutely no reason to

dispute them.</div>

<a name="06051155000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Mark Francois</b> (Rayleigh) (Con): As a matter of fact, the

British Art Market Federation was aware that we had tabled the

amendment. I discussed it with the federation in some detail.</div>

<a name="06051155000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is the Paymaster General saying

that the likely implementation date is now the date of Royal Assent, or

will it be 1 September? She mentioned both, and it would help the

Committee if she were to say which of the two is the most

likely.</div>

<a name="06051155000048"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000407"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The Government have negotiated with the trade

for a starting date of 1 September. That is what we intend. I know that

the hon. Gentleman has discussed the amendment with the art market, but

I dispute whether the federation supports it. It knows the delicate

position that we are in; we, too, have had the opportunity to discuss

the matter with them.</div>

<a name="06051155000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I return to the matter of

costs. The increase is not on the works of art but on the

auctioneer&#146;s commission. The federation estimates that the total

implementation costs for UK auctioneers will not exceed

&#163;500,000. That is a reasonably large amount of money, but it is

not substantial when compared with turnover and profits. The

federation&#146;s estimate of the total implementation costs for

smaller businesses in the trade sector is about &#163;50,000. As for

income to the Government, it will be negligible&#151;so small that no

Government would calculate it. Additional support and help to the art

market has been put in place under previous Finance Acts&#151;the

market already has that help&#151;to try to counter some of the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000408"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> In direct relation to the helpful statistics that

the Paymaster General is giving us, has she or the art market

calculated the much more significant impact that the measure may have

on business forgone&#151;the art business lost to the London

market?</div><a name="06051155000051"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000409"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> It is clearly difficult to establish. We rely

on the market for that information. It is a strong and important

market; it is the central market in the European Union, and second only

in the world&#151;perhaps not even second. We are advised that the

impact will be minimal. That was the Commission&#146;s case; it said

that it wanted to ensure a level playing field. The impact was minimal,

and we were asked why we were moving heaven and earth to prevent

something that would have a minimal effect. None the less, the

Government did so.</div>

<a name="06051155000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000410"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> The Paymaster General said that it was the

Commission&#146;s case that it would have a minimal effect. Was that

case accepted by the Government during the hearing before the ECJ, or

did the Government argue that it would not have a minimal

impact?</div><a name="06051155000053"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000411"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The Government and the art market made a wider

case than simply the likely cost. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 114</div>As I said, the Commission&#146;s view was that the impact would be

minimal, but that is also the view of the art market. I am not familiar

with the issue although over the years I have had the benefit of

meeting people such as Anthony Browne. As hon. Gentleman can guess,

currency exchange rates and other factors will have a far greater

impact on the market than will this tiny change by the

Commission.</div><a name="06051155000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government and the art market argued for the need to maintain global

competitiveness&#151;the London market vis-Ã -vis the world

market. The Government have moved on that, and I can send the hon.

Gentleman details of those changes designed to counterbalance the

question of competition, but it would not be appropriate to stray on to

that matter

now.</div><a name="06051155000055"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000412"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> Was it therefore the Government&#146;s case that

the measure would have a major impact on the competitiveness of the

London art market? To what extent does the Paymaster General still

believe that that will be the

case?</div><a name="06051155000056"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000413"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The Government supported the art market by

recognising that it had been an omission not to apply for a derogation

at the appropriate time and that there was therefore an obligation to

assist in whatever way possible. Given the size of the market, the

small change that the measure makes will not have a significant

financial impact. However, we were keen to be seen to defend what is a

premier market based in London&#151;we believe that the citizens of

this country would expect us to do that&#151;and that is precisely

what we did.</div> <a name="06051155000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that

basis, I hope that the hon. Member for Rayleigh will not press his

amendment, but if he does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to oppose

it.</div><a name="06051155000058"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000414"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Before I put the question on the amendment, I

should like to say that again it has been difficult to talk to the

amendment without talking also to the substance of the clause. I intend

therefore to move clause stand part formally without further debate, so

if hon. Members wish to make any further points they should make them

now.</div><a name="06051155000059"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000415"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I should like to comment on the clause. There

appears to be an agreement on both sides of the House about the fact

that this is a regrettable step forced upon the Government by the

European Court. Despite the agreement that we should not be

implementing the measure, the Paymaster General has ingeniously

succeeded in blaming the previous Conservative Government and rubbished

my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment, even though she made it clear that

she agrees with its substance. As has happened previously, we appear to

have lost the battle but won the war.</div>

<a name="06051155000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure in the clause is

seemingly innocuous. We have heard that the impact on the art market is

likely to be minimal, but I fear that it could be more significant. As

I said, I am not an expert, but I have done a little research and as I

understand it some&#163;3 billion to &#163;4

billion-worth of transactions are made in the London art market every

year. Most of that goes 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column114" />Column number: 115</div>through Sotheby&#146;s, Christie&#146;s and Bonhams. It is a very

mobile market. We are talking about works of art imported into this

country to be put through those auction houses. Typically, the

consignments of those works of art come from the United States or

non-European vendors. They have the opportunity to keep the artworks in

the United States and sell them in New York or send them to

Switzerland. I suspect that the drip-drip nature of the obstacles to

vendors selling their works in London is likely to encourage other

markets, such as the one in

Geneva.</div><a name="06051155000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to give

hon. Members some idea of the scale of the consignment from overseas

that would be affected by the measure, I understand that in January, at

the impressionist art sale&#151;which happens twice a year,

seasonally, although I cannot tell what the other month is: it may be

July&#151;88 per cent. of the lots sold at Christie&#146;s and 72

per cent. of the lots sold at Sotheby&#146;s were bought by

Europeans, who will now be caught by this increased rate of VAT. The

vast bulk of the buying side of a market&#151;there are always two

sides to a market: the seller and the buyer&#151;is based in Europe

and will be subject to VAT. A large proportion of the sellers can

choose whether they wish to use this market or one that is not caught

by the increased charge. That is potentially significant. I do not know

whether the Paymaster General had representations from the VAT

specialists at Grant Thornton, but Paddy Behan was quoted as saying

that he believes that

this</div><a name="06051155000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will have a major

impact on the standing of UK auction

houses.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard

some relatively complacent remarks from the Paymaster General. I hope

that she is right and the measure has a minor impact, but I am fearful

that it may not. That is yet another example of the European Commission

seeking to introduce creeping tax harmonisation through this

measure&#151;something that is regretted on both sides of the

House&#151;which we should resist at every level. I appreciate what

the Paymaster General said&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> If the hon.

Member for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) wishes to intervene, I should

be happy to let him. No; he is just making sedentary sniping

remarks.</div><a name="06051155000063"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000416"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> We have had a useful opportunity to air this

subject. I thank the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Rob

Marris) for complimenting me on being so quick off the mark in getting

my amendments tabled. It is always nice to receive a compliment from

him; I shall bank it for the future. I am also grateful to the

Paymaster General for her reply. At times, her tone was a little

unnecessary, but I listened carefully to what she

said.</div><a name="06051155000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have heard

your guidance, Mr. O&#146;Hara, about this debate effectively

becoming a clause stand part debate. I have one further point to make

in that context before returning to the amendment. This may appear to

some to be a relatively minor measure, but it has to be considered in

the context of a number of pressures on the United Kingdom art market

in recent years, not least the droit de suite issue, which I do not

propose to expand on at length this afternoon. Nevertheless, that has

been a major challenge to the art market&#151;or will be in the next

few years. It is also, beyond peradventure, an issue on which the

market has 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 116</div>absolutely not been at one with the Government&#151;in fact, precisely

the opposite. The Government have enraged the art market by the way in

which they dealt with that measure and by going beyond what was

required to make the problem worse. If the Paymaster General is

attempting to intimate that there is a cosy relationship across the

board with the market, that is not quite correct&#151;although I

concede, for the avoidance of doubt, that on this issue the Government

attempted to take a robust

view.</div><a name="06051155000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should like to

quote again from Mr. Anthony Browne&#146;s letter about the wider

issue:</div><a name="06051155000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

consider that the ECJ judgment, unhelpful as it is, is not the fault of

the British Government. It is, none the less, a further example of the

way in which the international competitiveness of the British art

market, by far the largest in the EU and Europe&#146;s only global

art market, is being eroded by EU

legislation.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an

important distinction to make. I reiterate the BAMF&#146;s point that

it is grateful for the dialogue with Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and

Customs and its officials. I hope that we have used this opportunity to

air the matter

responsibly.</div><a name="06051155000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning

to the amendment, I heard the Paymaster General give two commitments in

her remarks. First, I am grateful that she reiterated that this change

will apply only to auctioneer&#146;s commission, not to the hammer

price of the object. She mentioned that, and I listened carefully. We

asked her to reiterate that to avoid doubt. She has done so, and I

thank

her.</div><a name="06051155000344"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15

pm</div> <a name="06051155000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">We come to the

date itself. In some ways, it was a rather curious debate. We tabled an

amendment that said that the measures could not come into effect until

1 September. The Minister said, &#147;I don&#146;t want to accept

that, because we&#146;re going to bring in the change on 1

September.&#148; We are almost in danger of being in what the

Americans call &#147;violent agreement.&#148;</div>

<a name="06051155000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister has assured us

that negotiations appear to have progressed successfully and the

measures will not come in until 1 September. The market will have time

to prepare. The change will not come in mid-season and cause the

disruption that we discussed. Therefore, under the circumstances, it

seems that the matter is being reasonably dealt with all around. On

that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

matter is quite simple, and it raises a question of practicality. The

measures will affect only businesses with a turnover of &#163;60,000

setting the disregarded amount at &#163;1,000? Is that threshold

sufficiently low to avoid costs for business? If it is to be set at

&#163;1,000, should there be a threshold at all, or is there a case

for setting it higher? I would appreciate the Minister&#146;s

comments on the rationale behind the

measure.</div><a name="06051155000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000418"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I shall confine my remarks to the amendment, as

I am keen not to prejudice the broader stand part debate on this rather

important clause.</div><a name="06051155000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

have listened carefully to the argument that the hon. Member for

Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy) made in favour of

her amendment, but I am not convinced by it. The clause will give HMRC

quite a strong power to impose the reverse charge procedure, which

could be a useful weapon in the battle against missing trader

intra-community fraud, but which will represent quite a change in VAT

terms for those companies on which the order might be

imposed.</div><a name="06051155000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The element

of the clause in question effectively provides a safeguard for small

businesses in particular by instituting a de minimis level below which

the power should not apply. If it were deleted, the procedure could be

imposed even on companies reclaiming a very modest amount of VAT.

Indeed, some professional bodies have claimed that the threshold should

be raised.</div><a name="06051155000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

curious that the hon. Lady quoted from the Law Society. I read its

brief; perhaps I read it slightly differently. It

said:</div><a name="06051155000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

appreciate that repeated transactions involving loss of VAT on supplies

just below an increased threshold, e.g. &#163;10,000 a month, would

give rise to material losses of VAT. However, the aggregation

provisions in the new section 55A(1)(d) enabling other supplies to be

taken into account&#151;e.g., if a customer has already received (on

the current legislative proposals) supplies of &#163;200, the new

provisions will apply to other supplies which individually or in

aggregate exceed &#163;800&#151;might suggest that a higher

threshold could be

adopted.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless I

completely misread that, the Law Society is saying that, if anything,

the threshold should be higher, presumably because it would like the

safeguard to be broader than it

is.</div><a name="06051155000081"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000420"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I read the paragraph. It said that at one point

and then it referred to what I have brought to the Committee&#146;s

attention. I do not want to be critical of the Law Society, but perhaps

that is the first time ever that a lawyer has given contradictory

advice. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 118</div>However, I am clear about what it said in the paragraph to which I

referred. I appreciate that there is an argument for simplicity.

Retaining the element in the Bill, in a sense complicates it because it

adds a provision that would otherwise not exist. However, it is a

potential safeguard, particularly for smaller businesses. I shall

return to that theme in some detail in the clause stand part debate. As

the element is a safeguard and will protect smaller businesses in

certain circumstances, it should probably be retained. The hon. Lady

said that the proposal was a probing amendment, so I do not anticipate

a Division. However, if there were one, she could probably guess the

outcome.</div><a name="06051155000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000421"></a><b class="B">Rob

Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I declare an

interest. I am a member of the Law Society of England and Wales,

although I am a non-practising solicitor. The Law Society briefing to

which the hon. Member for Rayleigh referred is not contradictory. It

states:</div> <a name="06051155000305"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

question whether &#163;1,000 is a sufficiently low threshold to avoid

costs for business.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

tend to agree broadly with the hon. Gentleman. The amendment is an

extraordinary amendment, albeit a probing amendment. It seems to be

based on a submission by the Law Society, which said that, if anything,

it should be a higher threshold, whereas the hon. Member for Falmouth

and Camborne, in her albeit probing amendment, wants to get rid of the

threshold. That seems an extraordinary reaction to the brief, which she

prays in aid. She has completely misread

it.</div><a name="06051155000085"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000422"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> As the hon. Gentleman is a member of the Law

Society, and partly to justify his annual fee, I thank him, on its

behalf, for clarifying the matter. He has now made clear, beyond

peradventure, what the Law Society

intended.</div>

<a name="06051155000086"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000423"></a>Rob

used it on multiple occasions in Committee on the Floor of the House.

My annual fee is, I think,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000424"></a>Mr.

bargain if we do not have to go through law school again as a

consequence.</div> <a name="06051155000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish

to add to the eloquent words of the previous two speakers. The Law

Society brief is questioning the sum of &#163;1,000 as being too low.

It is an important safeguard, but there is a strong argument for

raising the sum. The reference to the briefing provided by the

Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales certainly calls

for a probing amendment. However, the reference is seeking

clarification of the rationale for the disregard. I have no doubt that

we will receive such a clarification, but the argument is whether a

&#163;1,000 threshold is sufficient, not whether there is a need for

a &#163;1,000 threshold at all.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000425"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Rayleigh

for explaining the Government&#146;s legislation to the hon. Member

for Falmouth and Camborne. The hon. Lady said in her introduction that

the proposal was a probing amendment. The question of a reverse charge

and its impact on small businesses is a matter that we should be

worried about. Although that is a wider debate, it is important to say

that the reverse charge that the Government are suggesting is specific

in certain areas. It is not a general reverse charge across VAT. It is

important, as we discuss the clauses, to remember

that.</div><a name="06051155000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why set the

threshold at &#163;1,000? All the arguments have been made not to

have it set at any level, which would mean that all businesses would be

caught. That is the Government&#146;s current thinking, but it is

subject to discussion. The disregard of &#163;1,000 reflects the

maximum level of purchases of goods subject to the reverse charge that

an unregistered business is likely to make if it is engaged in

legitimate business activity. I hope that that is clear to every member

of the Committee.</div><a name="06051155000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

are worried that if, at this stage, we set it at a higher level than

&#163;1,000, we could suffer significant revenue losses. I shall not

touch further on the matter, because it should be debated either under

clause stand part or under the next amendment. The current view is that

&#163;1,000 is reasonable. We are considering specific sectors in

which the missing trader fraud is at maximum, not across the whole of

trading in VAT. Within those sectors there will be small, unregistered

businesses, and we are seeking to protect them. A small business with a

turnover of &#163;40,000 would expect to purchase between

&#163;7,000 and &#163;8,000-worth of goods a year in the relevant

categories. We are talking about, for example, computer chips and

mobile phones, of which a small, unregistered company will buy only so

many in any one year. That is our current thinking, that is the

information that we have, and that is why we have set that

level.</div> <a name="06051155000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me put in

a caveat in recognition of the fact that the amendment is a probing

amendment. Businesses accept the principle of the reverse charge, but

the detail is important. If our discussions confirm that &#163;1,000

is too low, we are prepared to consider reviewing it before

implementation; that is why we consider it to be appropriate at the

moment. We have looked carefully at the sector and at the type of

demands of the businesses. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady

will withdraw the amendment.</div>

<a name="06051155000093"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000426"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> We have heard that it is difficult

to strike a balance between safeguarding smaller businesses

and protecting revenues. It has been acknowledged that there is a

question mark over the appropriateness of the &#163;1,000 disregard

level, whether it will catch the right businesses and whether

it will make a sufficient impact on revenue. Ultimately, the reverse

charge is welcome. We will deal with that in the stand part

debate. I beg to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

2. They are grouped together under the subheading &#147;Avoidance and

fraud&#148;. I should explain that, following our debate on clause 2

on Tuesday, I decided not to move our amendment No. 3 which would have

introduced an additional sunset clause with regard to the adjustment of

output tax. On reflection, I thought that it might be easier to take

the whole debate in the round in the context of the clause stand part

clause.</div>

inspection. Afterwards, when we move on to clause 21, I should like to

raise some questions about the extent of the powers to tackle fraud

because some of those provisions are very broad indeed.</div>

<a name="06051155000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">On clause 19, the missing

trader intra-community&#151;MTIC&#151;fraud is a growing problem,

of which the Government have been aware for some time. In 2001, a

paper, published jointly by Customs and Excise&#151;as it was then

known&#151;and the Treasury, entitled &#147;Tackling Indirect Tax

Fraud&#148;, defined MTIC fraud in the following

terms:</div><a name="06051155000306"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;VAT

intra-Community missing trader fraud is a systematic criminal attack on

the VAT system, which has been detected in many EU Member States. In

essence, fraudsters obtain VAT registration to acquire goods VAT free

from other Member States. They then sell on the goods at VAT inclusive

prices and disappear without paying over the VAT paid by their

customers to the tax authorities. The fraud is usually carried out very

quickly, with the fraudsters disappearing by the time the tax

authorities follow up the registration with the irregular assurance

activities.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is a

definition of the

problem.</div><a name="06051155000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 2002

pre-Budget report provided an update on the evolution of VAT MTIC fraud

by breaking it down into two main types: acquisition fraud and carousel

fraud. The report delineated the two types:</div>

<a name="06051155000103"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Acquisition fraud is

where the goods are imported from the EU into the UK by a trader who

then goes missing without completing a VAT return or an EU Intrastat

declaration. The &#145;missing trader&#146; therefore has a VAT

free supply of goods, as they make no payment of the VAT monies due on

the goods. He sells the goods to a buyer in the UK and the goods are

available on the home market for

consumption.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000307"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Carousel

fraud is similar to acquisition fraud in the early stages, but the

goods are not sold for consumption on the home market. Rather, they are

sold through a series of companies in the UK and then re- exported to

another Member State, hence the goods moving in a circular pattern or

&#145;carousel&#146;.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 121</div><a name="06051155000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went

on:</div><a name="06051155000308"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Carousel

fraud is currently regarded as the dominant type in terms of loss of

government revenue...The fraud is not exclusive to the UK. Because

these VAT arrangements apply throughout the European Union the fraud

can be perpetrated between any two or more Member

States.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">By nature,

carousel fraud has tended to focus on low-bulk, high-value goods such

as mobile phones and computer chips, but there are indications that it

is spreading to other forms of merchandise including items as diverse

as razor blades, nappies and&#151;I am reliably informed&#151;patio

heaters.</div> <a name="06051155000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem

has become so widespread that the Office for National Statistics now

adjusts the UK&#146;s trade statistics to take into account the

estimate of MTIC fraud. In February 2006, it published a note that

confirmed that the interpretation of the effect on EU trade had been

made more difficult by the spread of the problem in recent years. As

the ONS pointed out recently, by definition, the extent of such fraud

is difficult to measure

accurately.</div><a name="06051155000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a press

release on 26 January 2006, HMRC estimated that UK VAT losses from MTIC

fraud were between &#163;1.1 billion and &#163;1.9 billion for the

2004-05 financial year. Unfortunately, the situation appears to be

deteriorating. Just last month, the Government announced the first

annual fall in VAT revenues since the UK first started collecting it in

1973, largely because of the significant rise in estimated carousel

fraud.</div><a name="06051155000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

25 April, an article in <i class="I">The Guardian </i>entitled &#147;Fears over

fraud as VAT receipts slump&#148; reported that there is</div>

<a name="06051155000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no doubt that MTIC fraud is huge

and the Treasury is losing a massive

amount.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The article went

on to quote a Government source that claimed that losses are rising

rapidly and

stated:</div><a name="06051155000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

a growing problem that can&#146;t be ignored. It appears that the

fraud keeps mutating to counteract the measures which we are taking

against it&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly,

on 27 April 2006, Robert Lee, writing for the website Taxnews.com,

stated:</div><a name="06051155000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;According

to the Office of National Statistics, carousel fraud has become so

prevalent that it is distorting the UK&#146;s trade figures. In a

report issued last year, the ONS warned that trade figures for April,

May and June 2005 would have to be reassessed after it noticed a

suspicious surge in exports of mobile phones and computer chips to

non-EU countries.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

have a definition of the problem and at least some idea of its

extent.</div> <a name="06051155000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Government&#146;s solution under clause 19 is to introduce the

so-called reverse charge procedure for certain categories of goods that

can be specified by secondary legislation. It is intended to combat the

fraud by passing the duty to account to the Government for the VAT

further down the chain to legitimate businesses. The HMRC press release

of26 January 2006 outlined the process and the decision that

the Government had decided to adopt. It

explained:</div><a name="06051155000312"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Under

the reverse charge procedure, the suppliers of the goods do not account

for the VAT on their sales when selling to other VAT registered

businesses&#151;instead, it is the responsibility of the purchaser of

the goods to account for the VAT, although 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 122</div>they can recover this VAT in the normal way. This means that HM Revenue

&amp; Customs is not put in a position where it may have to make

repayments of VAT where the corresponding tax on the purchase has not

been paid to HMRC.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">A

similar procedure was adopted some years ago to combat missing trader

fraud in the gold bullion market, and apparently with some success. The

intention is to apply the same procedure under the Bill. It is clearly

a significant problem and something must be done about it.</div>

<a name="06051155000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish to ask the Paymaster

General some specific questions about the matter, after which I shall

speak briefly to our amendment. First, how confident are we that we now

have a reasonably accurate quantification of the problem? We have an

estimate for 2004-05 of up to &#163;1.9 billion being lost to the

Exchequer. Do we have a provisional estimate from the pre-Budget report

or elsewhere of the figure for 2005-06, now that that financial year

has come to an end? I appreciate that, by definition, the matter is not

a precise science, but have the Government updated their 2004-05

estimate in any way that be used to inform the

Committee?</div><a name="06051155000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the

other side of the ledger, in terms of projected savings from the

initiative, the Red Book estimates that the new measures will save

&#163;100 million in 2006-07, &#163;500 million in 2007-08 and

&#163;425 million in 2008-09&#151;just more than &#163;1 billion

in a little over three years. Will the Paymaster General say on what

evidence those estimates are based? There must have been some rationale

for the calculation. The Committee would find it helpful to know the

evidence.</div><a name="06051155000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,

why has it taken the Government so long to react to the problem? It was

identified in the HM Treasury and Customs and Excise paper that I cited

earlier and that dates back to 2001. It was reiterated in the

pre-Budget report in 2002. Now that we are in 2006, will the Paymaster

General explain why, given the size of the loss of revenue, it has

taken the Government so long to take definitive action against the

problem?</div><a name="06051155000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000431"></a><b class="B">Stephen

Hesford</b> (Wirral, West) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman not

recall that he said that the fraud was something of a moving target and

that it has been mutating? No doubt the Treasury has been watching it

mutate and has taken that into account when bringing forward such

measures.</div><a name="06051155000118"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000432"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> The hon. Gentleman has half a point. We know

that the fraud has been mutating and that there is a constant battle

between what is now the HMRC and the fraudsters. We know that the fraud

is highly organised, as I shall explain in a moment. However, given the

scale of the losses that we now face, the Government could have taken

firmer action earlier. To put it simply, if the problem has reached a

stage at which it is now affecting our official trade statistics each

month, surely we should have done something about it earlier. That is

not an unreasonable point to

make.</div><a name="06051155000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000433"></a><b class="B">Jeremy

Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I want to point out

to my hon. Friend for his assistance, and perhaps through him to assist

the hon. Member for Wirral, West, that, when I was practising law in

2002, it was clear knowledge among the legal 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 123</div>profession that the problem was large and growing. In fact, in the

geographical area in which I worked, one solicitor practised only in

the field of carousel fraud primarily through the sales of mobile

phones. The problem was clearly known about in

2002.</div><a name="06051155000120"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000434"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> My hon. Friend, with his direct legal

experience, confirms my point. We should be interested to hear from the

Paymaster General why it has taken the Government such a long time to

react to the matter. I am sure that she will want to provide us with an

answer, and I look forward to hearing

it.</div><a name="06051155000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The solution

depends on the Government obtaining a derogation from the sixth VAT

directive in order to apply the reverse charge in situations for which

it was not originally envisaged. Will the Paymaster General update the

Committee on the progress in seeking that derogation? In a written

statement a few days ago, the Chancellor revealed that the VAT issue

had been raised at an ECOFIN meeting on 5 May. Did that discussion

include MTIC fraud and the progress of the necessary derogation? It

seems that there was an ideal opportunity in the margins of the meeting

for the Chancellor to have pressed the case with his fellow Finance

Ministers. Did he do so, and if so, what were the results? When do

Ministers anticipate that they will be in a position to issue the

orders to implement that element of the strategy? On a directly related

point, given the history of negotiations with our EU partners in recent

years, what is the Government&#146;s plan B if for any reason the

derogation is not granted? What will they do then?</div>

<a name="06051155000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is intended to be

only part of the strategy to combat MTIC fraud. It is an important part

of it, but as I am sure the Paymaster General will emphasise, it is

only one part. On 26 January 2006, in reply to a series of questions

from my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr.

Gauke)&#151;who might seek to catch your eye on the

matter,Mr. O&#146;Hara&#151;the Paymaster General

stated:</div><a name="06051155000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In

order to strengthen further our strategy to combat VAT fraud, the

Government have made an application to the European Commission (EC) for

a derogation from the provisions of the EC sixth VAT directive to

enable it to introduce a reverse charge procedure for transactions

between VAT-registered businesses in certain goods. The Government

consider this measure to be a proportionate response to MTIC fraud.

This is only one facet of a comprehensive strategy designed to thwart

MTIC fraud by taking the criminal profit out of the

transaction.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>, 26 January 2006;

Vol. 441,c.

2268WS.]</div><a name="06051155000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will the Paymaster

General say more, at least in general terms, about what some of those

other complementary measures are? Will she give the Committee some idea

of what effect they are having on the problem, if any, other than the

effect that she believes the reverse charge procedure will have if we

agree to clause 19?</div><a name="06051155000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">As

the problem clearly affects other EU member states as well as the UK,

what are other EU countries doing in response to the challenge? The

HMRC&#146;s press release of 26 January 2006

said:</div><a name="06051155000314"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;MTIC

fraud is not a problem experienced solely by the UK&#151;it also

affects many other EU member States. The UK is working closely with the

Commission and other member states to strengthen administrative

cooperation, information exchange arrangements and the sharing of best

practice.&#148;</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column123" />Column number: 124</div><a name="06051155000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">That being the case, are there any

additional lessons that we can import from our European partners in

dealing with the problem? They have obviously considered it too. What

have they learned, and are any lessons applicable to

us?</div><a name="06051155000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The scale of the

fraud is growing. It is clearly a sophisticated operation often carried

out by organised gangs that, particularly in the case of carousel

fraud, operate systematically across borders. MTIC fraud is in many

cases a serious and organised crime. That being so, has the HMRC sought

assistance in addressing the problem from the Serious Organised Crime

Agency? Are there any plans to increase SOCA&#146;s involvement if

the problem continues to worsen? It is a reasonably timely question. I

heard just this morning on the &#147;Today&#148; programme that the

Security Service is about to cede its anti-fraud responsibilities to

SOCA. MI5 has decided to give SOCA the responsibility for fighting

fraud. Is that mirrored to any extent by the

HMRC?</div><a name="06051155000346"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45

pm</div><a name="06051155000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">We tabled our

amendment to introduce an additional safeguard into the Bill. I am

delighted to hear that the Paymaster General thought that that was

reasonable, and that she was minded to look favourably on its

provisions. I thank her for that generous offer, and I assure her that

before the Bill is complete, we shall take her up on

it.</div><a name="06051155000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fraud is

serious and appears to be growing. It is perpetrated increasingly by

international organised gangs. According to the Treasury itself, it is

now leading to a fall in our country&#146;s VAT receipts for the

first time since 1973. We are being asked to approve strong powers to

make orders that will affect the supply chains of things such as mobile

phones and computer chips, and also&#151;theoretically, if we allow

the clause to become part of the Bill&#151;other areas of business if

Ministers deem it appropriate, by order, to designate them. We should

not underestimate the power of what we might be going to do this

afternoon. </div><a name="06051155000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before we

grant the Government that considerable power, can the Minister answer

the following questions? What is the latest available estimate on the

extent of MTIC fraud in the United Kingdom? Why has it taken the

Government so long to do something about it? What is the current status

of the regress for a derogation, and what is plan B if that derogation

is not granted? What else is being done in the meantime, domestically,

to combat MTIC fraud? By way of comparison, what are our EU partners

doing about it and what lessons have we been able to learn from them?

What involvement, if any, will SOCA have in the

process?</div>

<a name="06051155000130"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000435"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> As we have heard, this set of clauses is

designed to introduce powerful measures to deal with a big problem.

Without going over the definitions that we have already discussed in

relation to MTIC fraud, it is worth emphasising the scale of the

problem. Figures from City analysts dated April 2006 suggest that as

much as &#163;10 billion in revenues could have been lost to the

Treasury last year. The extent of the fraud is so great that it

distorts the official figures that are used by the Chancellor to show

how successful 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column124" />Column number: 125</div>the economy is. That &#163;10 billion represents 5 per cent. of

exports, so there is a significant problem that needs to be

tackled.</div> <a name="06051155000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

two areas in which HMRC has significant problems. The first is that VAT

registration requests are not properly scrutinised by somebody with

local knowledge. That makes it easier for people to get VAT

registration in the first place. The second, which makes it difficult

for HMRC to overcome trouble, is that prosecuting such frauds is

difficult. It takes 18 months to two years before an arrest is made and

another year for a case to come to court. When it does come to court,

it is complicated. Juries are often faced with multiple defendants and

have to try to work out who is involved in a scam and who is innocent.

There are significant problems, and the industry has generally given a

warm welcome to the concept of a reverse charge that will help it to

overcome some of them.</div>

<a name="06051155000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">Despite that, representations

have been made to me about potential unintended consequences. The first

concerns innocent traders who are within the payment on account regime,

or whose turnover means that they are close to the threshold for having

to make the payments. The payment on account regime requires businesses

with an annual VAT liability of &#163;2 million or more to make

monthly payments to HMRC in respect of their VAT liabilities, the

calculation being based on their actual liability in the preceding

year. The businesses that will be affected in this case are those

selling relevant goods to the public or purchasing goods such as

microchips&#151;</div><a name="06051155000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000436"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The hon. Lady heard the explanation as to what

MTIC fraud is. There is no real activity. It is the circulation of

exactly the same goods through a long chain of bogus companies that are

used as a vehicle to reclaim VAT. I am struggling with the concept that

there could be an innocent party in that chain. Can she explain how an

innocent can be caught in a fraudulent chain of activity of that

type?</div><a name="06051155000134"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000437"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> I can go into a lengthy explanation if the

Paymaster General wants me to. [<span class="SmallCaps">Hon. Members:</span>

&#147;Yes.&#148;] Okay. In its simplest form, at least one business

in a supply chain has to exist so as to facilitate the MTIC

fraud&#151;that is how it works. It never has any intention of paying

any VAT to the Government. Usually, the fraudulent business will aim to

turn over as much money as possible within about six months and then

disappear with the VAT. Most fraudsters are aware that a second missed

quarterly VAT return submission will ring alarm bells, and that a VAT

officer will be sure to visit shortly

afterwards.</div><a name="06051155000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">For

example, business A is resident in the European Community, and

businesses B, C and D are resident in the

UK.</div>

<a name="06051155000136"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000438"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Can the hon. Lady tell us who supplied the brief

that she is

reading?</div><a name="06051155000137"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000439"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> This example has been given to me by

representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column125" />Column number: 126</div><a name="06051155000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Would the Paymaster General

agree that in every case where MTIC fraud has been prosecuted, every

person has either been found innocent or guilty? There are no cases

where businesses involved in the prosecution have not been found guilty

or innocent. I could carry on with this example if she would like me to

do so. I was trying to refer to innocent traders within the payment on

account regime who look likely to receive a negative impact; they would

be affected because they are either selling relevant goods to the

public, or purchasing relevant goods for incorporation into goods, such

as computers, that are not defined as relevant goods. The impact is

that many innocent businesses are likely to have pay more VAT to HMRC

than they would otherwise have to. Is that an intended consequence of

the clause?</div><a name="06051155000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second

issue relates to concerns about where the responsibility lies: is it

the taxpayer&#146;s or the state&#146;s responsibility to identify

and deal with fraud? I understand that the European Court of Justice

has already commented on that. How do the Government reasonably expect

taxpayers to judge that their customer is registered for VAT, when the

ease of fraudulently registering for VAT has already been explained?

How will the supplier know that the customer will use their goods for

business purposes? If the test fails, the supplier is still liable to

pay HMRC the VAT, even if they neither charged nor received it. If the

Government expect a legal challenge, how do they plan to deal with it?

There are concerns that some provisions will make innocent bystanders

pay for the crimes of others, which will lead to injustices and court

cases, and could potentially lead to defeat for the

Government.</div><a name="06051155000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,

there are concerns that the list of relevant supplies will lead to the

cat and mouse situation that we see in other issues relating to tax

fraud. Will fraudsters always ensure that they use goods that are not

within the provisions of the clause? We already know that the services

industry, for example, looks likely to be another potential growth area

for this type of fraud. There is still plenty of scope for concern

regarding such fraud, although the clause, which is attempting to

tackle it, is welcomed by

all.</div><a name="06051155000141"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000440"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> It is fair to say that there is a desire from all

parties to address this serious issue of MTIC fraud. My hon. Friend the

Member for Rayleigh quoted some Treasury figures on the cost being in

the region of&#163;1.1 billion to &#163;1.9 billion. I

should be interested to know whether the Paymaster General has any

further advance on

that.</div><a name="06051155000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I notice the

spirit of co-operation with regard to the clause and the fact that the

Government would have accepted my hon. Friend&#146;s amendment. I

fear, however, that that does not mean that my hon. Friends on the

Front Bench will be failing to move any further amendments during the

entire course of these proceedings. That may disappoint a lot of hon.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000441"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The moral of this lesson is that perhaps I

should mention it next time, to be extra

helpful.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 127</div><a name="06051155000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000442"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> We are all learning something this

afternoon.</div><a name="06051155000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before

returning to the specific details of the clause, I should like to

consider the general context of the measures taken by the Government

with regard to dealing with

MTIC.</div><a name="06051155000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Paymaster

General was a little bit dismissive about the issue of innocent

bystanders. I should like to give one example of an innocent bystander,

a constituent of mine, who came to my surgery to complain that he

wished to establish a company importing electronic goods&#151;I have

no reason to doubt his honesty and sincerity&#151;but was finding it

difficult to open a bank account, because of the pressures that appear

to be put upon banks to identify MTIC fraud and deal with it. That may

be right, but there appears to be a difficulty for businesses in a

particular area. I should be interested to know whether the clause

would have any impact on

that.</div><a name="06051155000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

asked the Paymaster General to elaborate on the general strategy for

dealing with MTIC. I suspect that one issue that the Paymaster General

will mention is new security procedures for obtaining VAT registration.

I wish to quote from an e-mail that was sent to me, which has been

circulating around several law firms on that point. It

states:</div><a name="06051155000315"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

new security procedures do not start until HMRC is satisfied that it

has all the necessary information to support a registration

application, so that it can allocate an effective date of registration.

It is at that point that the papers are sent to a new team in HMRC who

weeks but currently that is how long they are

taking.</div><a name="06051155000316"></a><div class="hs_brev">This means

that the time it might take to get a VAT registration is really

open-ended. I have an application

<a name="06051155000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">This is an appalling lack of

service in the guise of protecting the taxpayer from fraudulent

businesses but there is very little that we can do about

it&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">The e-mail goes

on:</div><a name="06051155000320"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It has

been suggested to me by HMRC that this is the result of a chronic

absence of resources and that any external pressure to improve things

would be welcomed&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

take the opportunity to exert some external pressure on the Paymaster

General because if we are to try to tackle VAT fraud&#151;we all

welcome such action&#151;it is important that it is not done in a way

that will make the life of innocent businesses much more difficult. The

HMRC attempted to take the further step of refusing to pay out to

companies that were claiming VAT when there was a suspicion or, indeed,

proof of carousel fraud occurring. I refer to the Optigen and the Bond

House cases, in which neither of the claimants had been convicted of

any offences or fraud. From what the Paymaster General said earlier, I

can see what her attitude would be to the companies, but perhaps I

should not spend too much time on that. The companies were not

convicted of fraud, but there was a fraudulent element somewhere within

the carousel. The ECJ determined that it was not reasonable or legal

for the Government to do that. That decision has had an impact on the

Government and I accept some 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 128</div>sympathy for them on that specific point because the strategy was

impacted by the ECJ.</div>

<a name="06051155000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it possible to estimate the

cost to HMRC of the judgment and the fact that the strategy could not

be pursued? I ask that in the context of a report in the <i class="I">Financial

Times</i> on 5 May which stated that the High Court has granted

permission to 150 companies to bring a class action in respect of the

matter. Does the Treasury have a feeling of what the overall cost would

be?</div><a name="06051155000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I presume that

legal advice was obtained by the Treasury and HMRC. I see the Paymaster

General waving a piece of paper, so presumably it would be in

compliance with European law and the VAT directives to refuse to pay

out the VAT claims to the various companies? Clearly, the legal advice

was at variance with the judgment of the ECJ. That appears to be a

theme that comes up fairly frequently.</div>

<a name="06051155000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Falmouth

and Camborne has already dealt with certain matters, but I had wanted

to ask about the &#163;1,000 disregard, and whether there is any

flexibility with regard to

that.</div><a name="06051155000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3

pm</div><a name="06051155000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next point

concerns new section 55A(6), andin particular the fact that

it states that in the circumstances in which the reverse charge

applies, it is for the recipient, on the supplier&#146;s behalf, to

account for and pay tax on the supply, and not for the supplier. The

words &#147;on the supplier&#146;s behalf&#148; suggest some kind

of agency arrangement. I should be grateful for further clarification.

In circumstances in which the recipient fails or is unable to pay the

tax for whatever reason, is there any ongoing liability for the

supplier? Looking at subsection (7), it would appear not, because it

refers to the relevant enforcement provisions that apply for the

purposes of the section to any person required under subsection (6) to

account for and pay any VAT as if that VAT were VAT on supply made by

him. That is referring to the recipient. However, it is not followed by

words that one might expect, such as &#147;and not for the

supplier&#148;. I think that, taken as a whole, the clause means that

in the circumstances that I describe the supplier has no

responsibility. However, I should be grateful for the Paymaster

General&#146;s

comments.</div><a name="06051155000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">My next

comment echoes a point that was made by the hon. Member for Falmouth

and Camborne on subsection (6)(c)&#151;the test that

a</div><a name="06051155000321"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recipient is a taxable

person at that time, and is supplied in connection with the carrying on

by him of any business&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051155000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are potentially difficult things to

check. One would assume that in relation to</div>

<a name="06051155000322"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a taxable person at that

time&#148;,</div> <a name="06051155000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">one could check

whether the person in question had a VAT registration number. However,

given that a lot of the problems are caused by the fraudulent use of

VAT registration numbers, that could be a difficult test. As for the

second element, supply</div>

<a name="06051155000323"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in connection with the carrying

on by him of any business&#148;,</div>

<a name="06051155000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should be grateful to know the

Paymaster General&#146;s view on whether that would cause any

particular difficulty. If it is an impossible proof, we could face

legal difficulties.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 129</div><a name="06051155000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point concerns

subsection (9), which refers to the power that the Government will have

to specify the goods to which the section will apply. There are two

contradictory points that might be made about that. The first is that

carousel fraud could apply to anything, and it could be that the

Treasury will determine which goods will apply and the fraudsters will

simply move on to another type of goods. Then there will have to be a

further amendment and the fraudsters will move on again, so the measure

will continually expand. There is, admittedly, a contrary argument,

which is that the powers are broad and there is potential for abuse.

Were the Government so minded, they could determine that almost any

product could fall within the section and the reverse charge would

apply. I acknowledge that there are contradictory pressures, but I

should be grateful to hear about the Government&#146;s attitude and

whether the Paymaster General recognises that there are concerns in

this area.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000443"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I should start by declaring my interest as a

non-practising barrister, and a more specific interest in that a few

years ago I spent three happy months acting for somebody accused of

precisely this type of fraud. I have some very personal knowledge of

the difficulties involved in prosecuting this type of

offence.</div>

<a name="06051155000160"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000444"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): Who

won?</div><a name="06051155000161"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000445"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> I am glad that my hon. Friend asks me that. It

goes back to a point made by the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne.

I am afraid that she is wrong that in such cases everybody gets

convicted or everybody gets acquitted. In the case that I was involved

with, a few people were convicted, but my client was not. As a point of

information, I should make that clear. However, I should also say that,

primarily because of that experience, I welcome the clause. It is a

positive move on the Government&#146;s part to deal with a difficult

issue. As I said in my earlier intervention on my hon. Friend the

Member for Rayleigh, there is no doubt that the Government could and

should have been aware of the problem for a long time, but better late

than never. I am glad to see that the clause has found its way into the

Bill.</div><a name="06051155000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is

important because by reversing the obligation to pay VAT, we are likely

to deter a large proportion of those frauds. That is important, because

when such frauds come to court, they are extremely difficult to deal

with. They are difficult to deal with, incidentally, not because juries

do not understand them&#151;I do not think that that is it at

all&#151;but because they deal necessarily with a complex paper

trail.</div> <a name="06051155000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The structure

of carousel frauds is complex because their intention is to throw HMRC

off the scent. A number of companies are involved, often in various

countries, and&#151;the Paymaster General is right about

this&#151;although every company in the chain is certainly involved

in the fraud, not every person in every company has the necessary

degree of criminal knowledge to be guilty of the offences concerned.

That creates difficulties for juries, as it would for judges or other

tribunals, in dealing with such cases. They are complex and inevitably

long running. They involve mountains of exhibits and take a long time

and a great 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column129" />Column number: 130</div>deal of money to try. Anything that we can do to lessen the impact on

the Exchequer through the legal aid budget and to improve the revenue

that should be drawn in from such transactions seems worth while. In

general, I welcome the

clause.</div><a name="06051155000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two

reservations, however, to which I draw the Paymaster General&#146;s

attention. I hope that she can assist me with some reassurance. Because

the value of the clause, in my view, is to act as an effective

deterrent on those who might be tempted to perpetrate such fraud, I

should hope that it would have absolute clarity on where obligations

for the payment of VAT lie. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-West

Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) said, there is the potential for confusion

not only in subsection (6), which indicates that the recipient must

account for and pay tax on the supplier&#146;s behalf, but in

subsection (3)(a), which indicates that supplies are to be

treated</div><a name="06051155000324"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as taxable

supplies of the recipient (as well as taxable supplies of the person

making

them)&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

no doubt that the clause&#146;s overall purpose and effect are

exactly what we all wish them to be. However, I ask the Paymaster

General to put some reassurance on the record to make it perfectly

clear where the obligations lie, so that no one tempted to perpetrate

such a fraud could believe that the clause gives them any opportunity

to continue.</div><a name="06051155000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

also like to raise another matter touched on by others. A danger has

arisen because of the prevalence of MTIC fraud that those legitimately

involved in trading the types of product commonly used in such

fraud&#151;whether it be computer chips, mobile phones or other

easily transferable components&#151;can not only find it difficult to

obtain banking facilities but can often find it difficult to obtain a

VAT registration.</div>

<a name="06051155000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC is understandably

sceptical about companies wishing to trade in such products because of

their prevalent use in illegitimate trading. I hope that the Paymaster

General will indicate clearly that the methods used under the clause

will make it easier for legitimate traders in such products to go about

their business and obtain banking facilities and VAT registration, so

that those important economic sectors can be sustained and

improved.</div><a name="06051155000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome

the clause broadly, and I hope that with the Paymaster General&#146;s

reassurance, it can be strengthened yet

further.</div><a name="06051155000169"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06051155000446"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Newmark:</b> My understanding is that tax advisers are also

involved in intra-community fraud. In February it was reported that the

Government were trying to tackle the problem through tighter regulation

of tax advisers. However, John Whiting from Pricewaterhouse Coopers

responded:</div><a name="06051155000325"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we would be a

little wary of suddenly appearing as agents of the Revenue. I can

understand why the government might be looking at it, but is this

trying to control a real problem? If the problem is bad tax advice,

then there is a case for regulation. If the problem is that the

government is losing money because people are finding a way around the

tax system, we need clearer

rules&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that

context it would be useful if the Government explained how such

proposals have progressed.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 131</div><a name="06051155000171"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000447"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> This is an extremely important debate and,

within the confines of what I can say in public, I want to be as

helpful as I can. I congratulate the hon. Member for Rayleigh on his

introduction. The issue that we are discussing is complex and a

challenge, not just for the UK Government, but other member states. I

will try to cover all the points that he made.</div>

<a name="06051155000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall deal with the points

that have just been made by the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr.

Newmark). First, the Government are not asking tax advisers and

solicitors not to provide advice. We are asking them not to provide

advice and support for fraudulent activity. Clearly, that is what we

are talking about. Secondly, I accept his second point about clarity,

but that is true of all legislation and so it is necessary that it be

as clear as

possible.</div><a name="06051155000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree

particularly with the points raised by the hon. Member for Rugby and

Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright). Ideally, the provisions in the clause will

deter fraudulent activities and address the difficulties that he so

eloquently described. He made another important point: in a fraudulent

chain of activity there might be individuals who find themselves

subject to prosecution, but who had no knowledge, or did not have

access to knowledge, of fraudulent activity. That is an important

division&#151;I will answer the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne

in a moment&#151;and comes back to the important distinction about

with what we are trying to deal.</div>

<a name="06051155000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall address the points that

have been made in the following order: the scale of the problem and the

Government&#146;s attempts to tackle it; issues involving other

member states; and the safeguards that we are negotiating. I think that

that will cover all the points that have been made, but if any Member

disagrees, please

intervene.</div><a name="06051155000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">In 2001-02,

HMRC identified the growing problem of MTIC fraud. The Finance Bill

2003 gave to Customs and Excise&#151;now Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue

and Customs&#151;not only powers to deal with the growing MTIC fraud,

but a specific plan for its reduction. By 2004-05, losses from that

fraud had been reduced from &#163;2.5 billion in 2001-02 to the

figures in the pre-Budget report of between &#163;1.1 billion to

&#163;1.9 billion. A particular strategy was being deployed by the

Department, which was successful.</div>

<a name="06051155000348"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15

pm</div><a name="06051155000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were

reducing MTIC fraud by interventions on repayments. As a caveat, I

should say that the tax administration is so fantastically efficient at

repaying VAT promptly that that efficiency becomes part of the track.

That is an interesting dilemma for us all as policy makers, as we

strive to support business and make our tax administration sufficient,

and is to do with the speed with which VAT is returned, particularly on

export where the export company delays and the company that is claiming

the VAT does so immediately. Without going too far down that route,

hon. Members can see the dilemma. The first dilemma is to balance

efficiency without creating a

problem.</div>

<a name="06051155000177"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000448"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> If the problem is the over-efficient and rapid

repayment of VAT, has the Paymaster General considered giving it to the

tax credits team?</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 132</div><a name="06051155000178"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000449"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Oh dear. I thought we were having a grown-up

discussion. I am not going to answer the hon. Gentleman&#146;s

questions if he is going to be so

unpleasant.</div>

<a name="06051155000179"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000450"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> Will the Paymaster General give

way?</div><a name="06051155000180"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000451"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Of course, as long as it is not about tax

credits.</div>

<a name="06051155000181"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000452"></a>Mr.

Hoban:</b> I refer back to the Paymaster General&#146;s

comments about the HMRC&#146;s efficiency at repaying refunds. I

understand that in one European country, the delay in paying refunds

back to traders is such that it precludes MTIC from taking place. I am

sure that that is a route that neither she nor the Government would

want to go down, because I know a great many businesses benefit from

the rapid repayments.</div>

<a name="06051155000182"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000453"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Indeed. The hon. Member for Rayleigh also asked

me about the experience of other member states. That has certainly been

a suggestion. I do not think that I am particularly attracted to that

line of

argument.</div><a name="06051155000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Figures have

emerged, particularly of late, and it is right that I should refer to

them. The hon. Member for Rayleigh asked what they were now. As the

result of a decision in a case, which was touched on by the hon. Member

for South-West Hertfordshire, part of the strategy that was being

deployed for the MTIC challenges to the Department was no longer

available to us. I have to put that delicately. As a result, the

Department and I had to reconsider whether there were additional things

we needed to do and what they were&#151;I will come to them in a

minute&#151;and the reverse charge is part of that.</div>

<a name="06051155000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Fraud, by its nature, is

difficult to measure. Because this is intra-community fraud, it relies

on data from other member states to make estimates. The figures that we

have seen cited recently, such as the ONS statistics, are for attempted

fraud not stealing. I wish to draw a line&#151;the figures that we

have seen of late are truly staggering, and there is nothing to suggest

that they are correct. I have given the figures already, but of course

I acknowledge that the issue is growing and we need to move rather

quickly.</div> <a name="06051155000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard

to what the Department is doing, first there are the arrangements in

the Bill, including stamping and, in later clauses, the reverse charge.

A reverse charge is difficult to put into VAT legislation. We are

considering that and have applied for it on the basis of the challenge

that faces us. Other member states&#151;the hon. Member for Rayleigh

asked me to touch on this&#151;who also suffer considerably from MTIC

fraud take a slightly different approach. We are going for a specific,

limited reverse charge. Germany, for instance, wants a reverse charge

in VAT legislation. However, our view, and I think that of Committee

members, is that that would require much of small and medium-sized

businesses and we are not attracted to

it.</div><a name="06051155000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a great

deal of discussion about the nature of a reverse charge. I have made

the point clearly that the issue was not dealt with at the margins of

the last ECOFIN meeting&#151;I was there&#151;but the Commission

has been written to and I have raised the matter with 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 133</div>other Ministers. We continue to press hard, because we believe that our

solution of a limited reverse charge is the way forward. However, that

requires the Commission to agree on how the charge would operate, and

it has to be balanced within Community law. Naturally, the Commission

is concerned with the same things as hon. Members: the impact on small

business and not having excessive burdens. When the Commission has made

a decision, it has to go to the Council and be passed with

unanimity.</div><a name="06051155000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want this

process to take place as fast as possible. I included the proposed

legislation in this Bill so that the Government would be able to bring

it forward. However, the negotiations with the Commission on the detail

are such that, although I can give the hon. Member for Rugby and

Kenilworth (Jeremy Wright) the assurances he is looking for&#151;we

are striving for clarity, specificity, the target and not a general

approach&#151;the Commission is not attracted to that view. Those

negotiations are still going on. I need to reflect on how I am able to

keep him informed of

developments.</div><a name="06051155000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Following

the Bond case, we have deployed more than 1,000 staff to tackle the

issue. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire said that there was

a staff shortage, but that is not the case. I also hark back to what

the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth said: the nature of this work

is such that we need specialist skills, because it is detailed and

about looking at material. In the meantime, extra staff have been

deployed.</div><a name="06051155000189"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000454"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I am grateful to the Paymaster General. I shall not

mention tax credits again. Does she accept, none the less, that there

is at least a perception that there is a shortage of staff? There is a

genuine concern going around a number of law firms, as I said

earlier,Â about the time it takes to obtain VAT registration.

Someone from the HMRC made the point to the correspondent that that

seemed to be caused by a lack of staff. If that is incorrect, I should

grateful for the Paymaster General&#146;s

comments.</div><a name="06051155000190"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000455"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I was coming to my next point. The question is

about what the staff are doing. That touches on another principle that

we need to consider. One of the requirements on the Department is to

consider registration closely&#151;who is seeking to register and

whether registrations can be refused&#151;I make it clear that I have

asked it to do that. That task requires highly skilled staff and takes

time, and there is the tension that the hon. Gentleman and the hon.

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth rightly

identified.</div><a name="06051155000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is

not the most desirable situation to be in, but, given the

circumstances, we are using extra staff to question the huge amount of

registrations, including new registrations. At the moment, that is one

of the tools being used. However, the fraudsters then mutate their

approach. They may find companies that are dormant or do all sorts of

other things, so we also have to look carefully at where activity

suddenly starts.</div><a name="06051155000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

want to be helpful, but I also want to be careful, because those who

commit such fraud are advised and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 134</div>are very able people. There is therefore a limit to how much I can tell

the Committee about the compliance strategy, although I am doing what I

can.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000456"></a>Jeremy

Wright:</b> Would the Paymaster General accept that one of the

ways in which we can deal effectively with the problems of registration

and identifying those who should not have registration is to ensure

that decisions on registration are taken as locally as possible, so

that a degree of local knowledge can be applied in deciding which firms

are likely to be legitimate and which are

not?</div>

<a name="06051155000194"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000457"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I think that my answer is yes and no. Of course

local knowledge is important and that can assist but, equally,

businesses and those who represent them&#151;the hon. Gentleman might

have done this in his past life&#151;want to be sure that consistent

decisions are taken throughout the country and that there are no

variations in decisions between local offices. The challenge&#151;yet

another to put on the table&#151;is somehow to ensure both that that

local knowledge is there and that central clarity and consistency

provide for the other things that he suggested. That is quite

difficult, because we are talking about discretions. There is a balance

to be

struck.</div><a name="06051155000195"></a>

problems?</div><a name="06051155000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000459"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The staff are already deployed on the work.

They do other work, but I shall come to that when I discuss the

relationship with SOCA. The staff in the Department are highly trained

investigators and compliance officers. They have important and unique

skills in the analysis of financial transactions, and we need to ensure

that that is reflected at every

level.</div><a name="06051155000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other

area&#151;here is the next balance to strike&#151;concerns very

large repayment claims. For instance, a company that appears to be

trading on not very much might suddenly put in a VAT reclaim for

&#163;100 million. Then we are caught on the 30 days, as opposed to

whether there are reasonable grounds to refuse payment or investigate

it. Again, I make no apologies to the Committee, although there is a

difficult balance to strike. I make it clear to the Department that I

want it to proceed at every opportunity, because we are dealing with

taxpayers&#146; money that should not be paid out. However, we are

constrained by reasonableness, doubt and the issues that the hon.

Member for Rugby and Kenilworth raises. These provisions are part of

our attempts to disrupt the fraud and to bring pressure to bear to

prevent the loss to the Exchequer, and the reverse charge needs to be a

crucial part of that.</div>

<a name="06051155000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Rayleigh

asked about SOCA. I can give him a categorical yes&#151;there is

joint working. Those genuinely involved in MTIC fraud are also involved

in many other things that would be of interest to SOCA and others.

Therein lies a much greater danger. It is bad enough that revenue

should be stolen 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column134" />Column number: 135</div>from taxpayers, but the use to which such people put that money is also

a concern. It is therefore right that there should be joined-up working

on taking the issue

forward.</div><a name="06051155000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30

pm</div><a name="06051155000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have spoken

for a long time and am trying to be helpful, but perhaps I should

conclude. More than90 per cent. of all the losses from MTIC

fraud arise from goods that would be targeted specifically under the

reverse charge mechanism. The hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth put

his finger on it again: it tends to be small, high-value goods that can

be circulated easily&#151;but, of course, they are not circulated.

There has been speculation in other member states that this may involve

razor blades&#151;and I heard somebody talk about patio

heaters&#151;but the nature of the stuff is that it is high value and

circulates

quickly.</div><a name="06051155000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reverse

charge needs to be a response to that. Part of the discussion with the

Commission&#151;without phenomenal powers being given, which all hon.

Members think is undesirable in the reverse charge&#151;is about the

mechanisms with which the Government should respond should there be a

mutation or change in the way that this fraud operates. The measure is

intended to target what is happening now, give us some leeway and allow

us to work within all the constraints that hon. Members have

mentioned.</div><a name="06051155000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot

answer the question about bank accounts, because I do not have

responsibility for that matter. We would hope that the business banking

legal community in the UK would not be encouraging, facilitating or

inadvertently helping such fraud in any shape. That banking sector in

particular needs to consider carefully what else the individuals

concerned may be

perpetrating.</div><a name="06051155000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">All

Committee members can see that this matter is not only of concern to

the Government, as one would expect. There is a huge challenge to the

House of Commons in whether we have legislation deterring such activity

and getting a grip on

it.</div><a name="06051155000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">I cannot give

Committee members any further detail on the negotiations, but when the

reverse charge is implemented, it will have been done in conjunction

with wide, detailed discussion with business, which has responded

favourably and is supporting us, but has put a number of principles on

the table. I am happy to acknowledge those and can confirm that the

Government will try to comply with

them.</div><a name="06051155000204"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000460"></a>Mr.

Gauke:</b> I intervene because I assume that the Paymaster

General is about to sit down. I want to raise again the specific

drafting point about subsection (6)&#151;&#147;on the

supplier&#146;s behalf&#148;&#151;and whether, in the event of

the recipient not paying the VAT, the supplier may have some liability.

My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh also raised that point. It might

be helpful if some views were expressed at this

stage.</div><a name="06051155000205"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000461"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> I am sorry&#151;it is unavoidable and I can

see no way around it&#151;but the supplier would be required to take

reasonable steps to satisfy themselves that the customer is

VAT-registered and the purchase is 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 136</div>for business purposes. If the customer is VAT-registered and buys goods

for the purposes of the business, it is the recipient&#146;s

responsibility to account for the VAT. If the customer fails to do so,

there will be no liability on the suppliers. That will be a principle

in respect of the requirements as well, if the Commission responds by

saying that it want to see certain adjustments in the legislation. We

will need to look carefully and see that the reverse charge does what

we want but does not extend into areas that we would not want it to. I

hope that I have answered all the

questions.</div><a name="06051155000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">On

amendment No. 3 and the 2009 date, I should just say, frankly, that if

the derogation is not time-limited anyway, and we have not implemented

the provisions by 2009, well, forget it; in that case, the powers

cannot be used. We are talking about derogations that are themselves

time-limited. I put a reserve power in another clause because I am

concerned to assure the House that the special power that I am asking

for is specifically for the cases that I mentioned and will be

time-limited. The hon. Member for Rayleigh did not need to table that

amendment, but I did not feel that I needed to go to extreme lengths

and say, &#147;Well, I&#146;m not going to do it.&#148; I told

the hon. Gentleman that the amendment that he did not move was

completely unobjectionable, because it would do what we were going to

do anyway.</div><a name="06051155000207"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

this is a probing amendment to seek clarification. It refers to

proposed new sub-paragraph (2A)(b), where there is reference

to</div> <a name="06051155000326"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;power to record any

information...relating to the goods that have been

inspected.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">What does

&#147;information...relating to the goods&#148; mean? What

extra burden of paperwork and administration does it represent for

businesses? Basically, under the amendment, we are trying to state

explicitly that there should be the same information as is required and

shown on a tax invoice; that might be a way to give businesses greater

clarity on what information will be required of

them.</div><a name="06051155000212"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000463"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> The purpose of the clause is to put beyond

doubt HMRC officers&#146; power when inspecting goods for VAT

purposes, to evidence that inspection by applying a date stamp to the

goods or their packaging, and to scan barcode information into a

database. What the amendment would do&#151;first and foremost and

absolutely uniquely&#151;is defeat the main purpose of the clause,

which is that if it is the same goods circulating, and they are stamped

and we have the barcode, that information will be provided. If the

amendment prevents us from doing that, we have no power. The amendment

therefore strikes at the very heart of how 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column136" />Column number: 137</div>we are trying to deal with those issues in the clause. I hope that the

hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne will understand that we are

talking about recording barcodes or information about the goods in a

way that is acceptable to business, so that if the same goods come

round again, we know

it.</div><a name="06051155000213"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000464"></a>Julia

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000465"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> We considered MTIC fraud in some detail under

clause 19&#151;and, in passing, I commend the Paymaster General for

the detail that she gave in her reply. She did her best to respond to

the points raised by my hon. Friends and me, within the confines that

she faces, and I am grateful for that. I should like to press the

Minister on some specific questions on the proposed powers to inspect

goods before we allow clause 20 to stand part of the

Bill.</div><a name="06051155000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have received

representations from a number of bodies about the measures in this

brief but nevertheless important clause. For instance, the Institute of

Indirect Taxation reacted to clause 20 as

follows:</div><a name="06051155000328"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

are concerned about the breadth of the new para 10 (2A). Our

understanding is that HMRC only want to stamp the container or outside

packaging and to scan any bar codes printed on the packaging. We fully

appreciate the need for such powers&#148;.</div>

<a name="06051155000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, the IIT goes on to

say,</div> <a name="06051155000329"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,

the new sub-paragraph goes far wider than that. It will give customs

powers to insist on goods being unpacked completely and then

repackaged, at the taxpayers expense and to physically stamp the mobile

telephone

itself.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, the

Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, in its

briefing note under the heading &#147;The breadth of powers&#148;

states:</div><a name="06051155000330"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

institute appreciates the value of this clause, as it will deter the

multiple use of the same goods in MTIC frauds. Nevertheless, we are

concerned that this clause goes far further than necessary, and

contains insufficient safeguards. The clause effectively gives HMRC the

power to have any goods (whether linked to MTIC fraud or not)

completely unpacked and then

marked.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the

institute&#146;s view. I hear the Paymaster General dissenting, so I

hope that she will clarify the situation. I was going to ask whether

she could reassure us that the powers would be used selectively and

only in appropriate circumstances, and whether she could provide that

reassurance beyond doubt.</div>

<a name="06051155000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">As well as the specific issue

of MTIC fraud, there is the wider question of the deliberate smuggling

of 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 138</div>goods in order to evade payment of VAT and duties such as tobacco duty.

My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) dealt with tobacco

duty in part 1 of the Bill, and I do not propose to cover that again

now. However, this clause deals with powers to inspect goods.</div>

<a name="06051155000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that point, Ministers might

be aware that suggestions are circulating in some quarters to the

effect that the Government are considering some kind of scheme for the

marking of cigarette packets against counterfeiting and

smuggling&#151;perhaps something similar to the strip stamps on

Scotch whisky. I see the ears of my friend from north of the border,

the hon. Member for Dundee, East, pricking up.</div>

<a name="06051155000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">That might range from simple

marks that consumers can inspect to see that goods are

genuine&#151;but which risk being easy to counterfeit&#151;to more

complicated technologies for marking packets of cigarettes, which might

be available to those with scanning equipment that can determine

whether a packet of cigarettes is genuine and which could,

theoretically, be used by HMRC inspectors in order to combat

fraud.</div> <a name="06051155000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

that discussions on the issue recently took place between the tobacco

industry and HMRC. Bearing in mind that there was considerable

discussion and consultation before strip stamps came in, can the

Paymaster General say whether those discussions have progressed any

further, whether there is any depth to them and whether the Government

have any plans&#151;even at an early stage&#151;to mark cigarette

packets in some way as an anti-fraud measure? Not least because of all

the other changes that have taken place in relation to smoking in the

past year or so, it is important to know what the Government have in

mind.</div><a name="06051155000226"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000466"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b> The Paymaster General went into great detail

about the broader issues relating to clause 19, so I shall

try to keep my remarks specific to clause 20. It is important for the

combating of MTIC fraud that HMRC has the ability to enter premises and

to inspect and, most importantly, mark the goods that they are

inspecting. That is an important way to tackle fraud. In practical

terms, that will involve date stamping and scanning bar codes to check

that descriptions are correct.</div>

<a name="06051155000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">As has been said, businesses

have raised the concern that that could result in the goods being

defaced or damaged. However, I understand that the Government have a

dilemma. If they cannot mark the internal goods, there is nothing to

prevent them from doing another round on the carousel. I seek

clarification as to how HMRC will tread that tightrope and apply the

law in a proportionate way. For example, will there be a full right to

appeal at a VAT tribunal if it is considered that the goods and their

value have been impaired as a result of their being marked in such a

way? I shall be interested in further comments from the Paymaster

General.</div>

that the cost might fall anywhere between &#163;1 billion and

&#163;2 billion&#151;perhaps up to&#163;10 billion. It

strikes me that it might well be necessary to seek a document with a

full range of serial numbers for a carton of computer chips or other

high-value items of the sort that we have been discussing to find out

whether such goods are being passed down the chain in the criminal

process. I welcome the measures, but I share some of the concerns about

the proportionate use of the

power.</div><a name="06051155000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand

the point made by the hon. Member for Rayleigh about cigarettes. I know

that very few hon. Members smoke, but I am led to believe that each

cigarette packet has a stamp on the bottom. That might be sufficient

without having to add a strip stamp, and he is absolutely right on that

issue. It caused a great deal of consternation in the Scotch whisky

industry, and I should like some comfort from the Paymaster General

that in seeking to introduce machine-readable strips to avoid fraud,

the Government will place no additional burdens on the Scotch whisky

industry. The existing stamp will be

sufficient.</div><a name="06051155000231"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000468"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> I share some of the concerns raised earlier by the

hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne. The powers go way beyond the

powers discussed in the previous clause, which dealt just with MTIC

fraud. As I understand the clause, the powers will apply to the HMRC in

any investigation that it wishes to undertake in relation to VAT fraud.

Therefore, we need to look at the clause in the context of the supply

of all goods across the country, not just those goods involved in the

fraudulent carousel trade. In some respects, the powers go a step too

far. I have no difficulty whatever with the power in proposed new

sub-paragraph (2A)(b) relating to scanning bar codes. That is a

sensible measure that will allow the Revenue to gain access to goods

and record information about them.</div>

<a name="06051155000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I should declare an

interest by reminding Committee members that I am the chairman of a

bookshop chain that benefits from a zero-VAT regime on the sale of

books. However, we also sell other products, including greeting cards

and some relatively high-value arts and art products, and that is where

my concern arises. If they were marked by the industrious inspectors of

the HMRC, could the marking damage the value of the products by

damaging the products themselves?</div>

<a name="06051155000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">One can imagine the same point

applies to a number of other areas of which I have no direct

experience, such as collectors&#146; stamps. If inspectors were to go

around marking and defacing collectors&#146; stamps in the offices of

Stanley Gibbons, they might destroy them. Actually, that might increase

their value, because they would be specialist collector&#146;s items

if they had an official

stamp.</div><a name="06051155000234"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000469"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> I take the opportunity at last to declare an

interest. I do not smoke and I am not a lawyer, but I am a stamp

<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 140</div><a name="06051155000235"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000470"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000471"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> My hon. Friend might wish to proffer a view on

whether stamp prices would rise or fall if the stamps had been marked

by the HMRC. I would not

know.</div><a name="06051155000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision

raises questions, which I hope the Paymaster General will address,

about how the Revenue will interpret the powers. Should not some

safeguards be introduced to prevent it from marking goods if that would

damage their

value?</div><a name="06051155000238"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000472"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> Can the hon. Gentleman envisage a number of goods

besides stamps whose values could be harmed? For example, if Rolex

watches were marked to prove that they were not counterfeit, surely

that would enhance their

value.</div><a name="06051155000239"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000473"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> Having had the pleasure of travelling through a

night market in Hong Kong relatively recently, I have seen arrays of

watches of all kinds of luxury brands available. The hon. Member for

Loughborough (Mr. Reed) is shaking his wrist to suggest that he might

be wearing one. I suspect that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton,

South-West might be right: in some cases, marking might help. I suspect

also that the vast majority of such watches are for sale outside this

country, so the HMRC would not have jurisdiction. I ask the Paymaster

General to address those

points.</div><a name="06051155000240"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000474"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> As I said in my introductory remarks, the

clause will simply put beyond doubt the right of the HMRC&#146;s

officers to evidence the inspection of goods and to make a record of

any information relating to them. Under schedule 11(10) of the Value

Added Tax Act 1994, they already have such powers. I do not know why

hon. Gentlemen are suddenly so worried. Those powers are operating

perfectly well. Although they are predominantly used to tackle MTIC

fraud, their use is not limited to that area and never has been. I do

not consider it necessary to restrict the scope in an area where it is

already operating because to do so could undermine the HMRC&#146;s

existing rights to record information during routine VAT

inspections.</div><a name="06051155000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us

not run away with the idea that suddenly there are loads of extra

powers; there are not. The HMRC&#146;s officers already have the

powers. The provision is to put the powers beyond doubt in what is a

difficult area with regard to MTIC fraud. The powers go back to 1973,

so they have existed for a long

time.</div><a name="06051155000242"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000475"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> The right hon. Lady has explained that the powers

to stamp packaging already exist. Do they also exist to mark

goods?</div><a name="06051155000243"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000476"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> Yes, I believe so. The next issue is one that

the hon. Gentleman raised, as did others. They painted a picture of an

Armageddon in which huge amounts of goods would suddenly be unpacked,

stamped and thus damaged. That would then be at the trader&#146;s

cost.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column140" />Column number: 141</div><a name="06051155000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">The requirements are no

different from that those that exist for the inspection of goods under

the current powers. The HMRC does not require access to individual

product items to carry out the stamping and scanning. Hence, my point

to the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne about the importance of

needing to be able to scan the barcode and record such information.

There is an HMRC date stamp on the outer packing of goods, such as

boxes containing retail consignments of mobile phones. It is a matter

to which we will need to pay careful attention, but it is dealt with at

the moment.</div> <a name="06051155000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should

not really answer the questions about cigarettes, but they are stamped

<a name="06051155000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I understand from my hon.

Friend the Financial Secretary, there was much debate earlier in

Committee about the memorandum of understanding with the industry. What

is under discussion, which is of mutual benefit to the industry and to

the Government, is the question of counterfeit goods and whether

developments of technologies can assist the industry and us in dealing

is, in fact, a broadly drafted clause. It raises questions about where

exactly to draw the line in seeking to achieve a difficult balance

between, on the one hand, giving the HMRC sufficiently robust powers to

tackle organised fraud, such as MTIC fraud, while, on the other,

seeking to safeguard legitimate businesses from possibly unnecessary

intrusion.</div> <a name="06051155000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said

earlier that, on this clause, I would be raising the issue of

safeguards and I hope that the Paymaster General can respond.

Subsection (6) includes a very broadly drafted power to amend schedule

11 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994. It

states:</div><a name="06051155000332"></a><div class="hs_brev">"The

Commissioners may direct any taxable person named in the direction to

keep such records as they specify in the direction in relation to the

goods as they so specify."</div> <a name="06051155000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

fairness, that power is tempered to some extent by the wording of

subsection (6)(3), which

states:</div><a name="06051155000333"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Commissioners may not make a direction under this paragraph unless they

have reasonable grounds for believing that the records specified in the

direction might assist in identifying taxable supplies in respect of

which the VAT chargeable might not be

paid.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nevertheless, that

remains a very broad power.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 142</div><a name="06051155000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">So can Ministers explain how

they believe that that power will be exercised in practice? What

safeguards will be put in place to ensure that in isolated cases

over-zealous HMRC officials do not attempt to use that power as an

opportunity to go on what is often referred to as a &#147;fishing

expedition&#148;, or to seek to obtain all sorts of additional

information about legitimate business under the auspices of combating

VAT fraud?</div><a name="06051155000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before the

Paymaster General accuses me of crying wolf, I should point out that a

number of professional bodies have also expressed concern about this

issue and specifically about clause 21. The Institute of Indirect

Taxation

said:</div><a name="06051155000334"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We would

also point out that the only obligation on HMRC is to have reasonable

grounds to believe that the records specified in the Direction might

assist in identifying unpaid VAT. There is no requirement on HMRC to

take any account of the burden that the Direction might impose on the

business and no requirement even to weigh up such a burden against the

potential loss of tax that HRMC is seeking to recover. We believe that

they ought to be required to take account of both these factors.

Furthermore because of the potentially

draconian&#148;&#151;</div><a name="06051155000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">its

word, not

mine&#151;</div><a name="06051155000335"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;nature of

these powers outside the context of MTIC fraud, we consider that the

VAT and Duties Tribunal ought, on appeal, itself be entitled to

consider not only the need to protect the Revenue, but also the need to

avoid imposing burdens on a business that are disproportionate to the

tax at risk.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales went further.

It said:</div><a name="06051155000336"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

Government&#146;s strategy should be to work with business and their

representatives, the European Commission and other EU Member States to

prevent MTIC fraud. This is unlikely to be achieved in the UK if we

continue to pass legislation which makes honest businesses responsible

for paying VAT misappropriated by others in the chain of

transactions.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">It went on

to quote a European Commission official&#146;s letter published in

the <i class="I">Tax Journal </i>on 24 April 2004, which explained why the

Commission had intervened against the UK in the Optigen case, which was

referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West

Hertfordshire. The Commission&#146;s official, as quoted by the

ICAEW,

said:</div><a name="06051155000337"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is

naturally necessary to take vigorous measures to combat tax fraud, but

that objective does not justify making innocent bystanders pay for the

crimes of others.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

ICAEW

concluded:</div><a name="06051155000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As

they stand, the provisions in clause 21 are likely to create further

similar injustices, further court cases, and further defeats for the

UK&#148;.</div><a name="06051155000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">To avoid doubt, I

should emphasise that I am not in any way trying to denigrate the

HMRC&#146;s officials. Unfortunately, however, as Ministers will be

aware, there have been problems in the past, particularly in what we

used to know as Customs and Excise, which is now the HMRC. It lost a

number of high-profile court cases, and many others collapsed.

Subsequently, on occasions, there have been investigations into what

went wrong by the Metropolitan police.</div>

<a name="06051155000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not propose to reprise

that now, but my predecessor but one in this job, my hon. Friend the

Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk) got into considerable

correspondence with the Financial Secretary over that issue and is

familiar with it. So I am not seeking to over-egg the pudding, but I am

making 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 143</div>the point to Ministers that we know empirically that things have gone

wrong in the past when Customs and Excise, in some respects, went too

far. That being the case, we would like reassurances from the Paymaster

General on how those powers will be exercised in practice. I hope that

she will understand that I am trying to be responsible and not

sensationalist.</div> <a name="06051155000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

summary, and for the avoidance of doubt, I want to make it clear that

we are committed to helping the Government combat fraud such as MTIC

fraud. We appreciate that there is a genuinely difficult balance to

strike. To some extent, Ministers are being asked to exercise the

judgement of Solomon. However, given recent history, we want to ensure

that the powers granted to the HMRC&#146;s officials in part 2 of

this Bill are proportionate, and that safeguards are in place to ensure

that the powers will be exercised both reasonably and proportionately,

not least in relation to this clause, so as not to disadvantage

legitimate traders or adversely damage their business in the UK

economy. I hope that that is a reasonable point to put to the Paymaster

General, and I look forward to receiving some meaningful reassurances

from

her.</div><a name="06051155000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000478"></a>Julia

Goldsworthy:</b><b class="B"> </b>Again, I stress that there are good

intentions behind the clause, but I seek clarification on some areas.

Does not existing legislation require record-keeping in all businesses?

How does the clause extend HMRC&#146;s powers? How does it meet the

proportionality test of businesses? Does it ask companies to keep

records not only on their own businesses, but, in some cases, on other

businesses? Is it reasonable to ask them to do that? Of course it makes

sense, when businesses are undergoing an appeal process, to have

records to hand, but can the Minister confirm that the burden of proof

will remain with HMRC rather than being shifted to businesses? Will

there be a full right of appeal that will give the courts unfettered

jurisdiction? Those are our key concerns about proportionality and

record-keeping.</div> <a name="06051155000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">With

respect to the penalty and the issue raised in proposed new section

69B(4) of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, what circumstances constitute

changes to the value of the penalty? The paragraph mentions</div>

<a name="06051155000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a change in the value of

money&#148;,</div><a name="06051155000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">but how will the

Treasury assess that? Will it be through simple indexation, or is it

purely at the discretion of the Treasury to change the order of

magnitude to whatever it considers appropriate? Those are the two key

areas of concern that I would like the Minister to

address.</div><a name="06051155000266"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000479"></a>Mr.

Newmark:</b> HMRC&#146;s powers to direct a business to keep

additional specified records are, as we have heard, extended by the

clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh implied, the powers

in the measure can be exercised only when HMRC has reasonable grounds

to believe that the additional records might assist in identifying

supplies on which VAT might go unpaid. The measure is intended to deter

MTIC fraud.</div> <a name="06051155000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC

began a wide consultation on its powers, deterrents and safeguards in

March 2005 following its creation in the Commissioners for Revenue and 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 144</div>Customs Act 2005, and the responses to the consultation were published

in July 2005. A further consultation document was published on 30 March

2006, but neither document covers the specific proposals in the Bill.

The Government could usefully explain why these measures have not been

consulted on. A regulatory impact assessment has been published,

however.</div> <a name="06051155000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be

useful if the Government explained why there is a need for legislation

to make these changes, and why it would not be possible for HMRC to

suggest that firms should keep records, as that would help them to

defend themselves against accusations of MTIC fraud. They might also

explain why those powers can be applied more widely than just to goods

that are usually involved in MTIC fraud&#151;primarily computers and

mobile phones&#151;and why it would not be wiser to restrict the

power to those goods for the time being.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000480"></a>Rob

Marris:</b> I hope that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster

General can help with this small point. I understand that subsection

(6) would add paragraph 6A to schedule 11 to the Value Added Tax Act

1994. Paragraph 6(1) of schedule 11 already confers powers on HMRC to

make regulations requiring records to be kept. What additional powers

will paragraph 6A

insert?</div><a name="06051155000270"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000481"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> First, I want to assure the Committee that HMRC

has no plans to use the powers for purposes other than to counter

large-scale fraud, such as MTIC fraud. In that context, any additional

burdens imposed under the measure are, in my view, entirely

proportionate given the serious revenue losses that arise from such

fraud. We had a constructive debate earlier on exactly what the

challenges were.</div> <a name="06051155000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

was also challenged by hon. Members to explain what the Government are

doing now. The record-keeping requirement is part of that. It is a

well-established principle that VAT must be administered in a

proportionate fashion, so I turn first to the question whether the

power is drawn too widely.</div>

<a name="06051155000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have given the undertaking

and made it clear that the power should be used specifically to combat

large-scale fraud, such as MTIC fraud. It is totally impracticable to

try to limit the scope of the measure by attempting to have a legal

definition of MTIC fraud. Given everything that has been said about how

it mutates and what the challenges are, I was a little taken aback that

Members could flip so quickly from a discussion recognising the

complexity of the challenge to providing a legal definition that says,

&#147;This is MTIC fraud; everything else you do is okay as long as

you manage to legally get outside the definition.&#148; In order for

the clause to be effective, it needs to be applied in this

way.</div> <a name="06051155000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">HMRC will have

to demonstrate reasonable grounds to believe that additional records

might assist in identifying supplies on which VAT might not have been

paid. The whole purpose of the measure is to assist HMRC in detecting

and challenging fraud, and that would be seriously undermined if HMRC

had to prove knowing involvement in a specific fraud before using the

direction, particularly given the point made by the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column144" />Column number: 145</div>hon. Member for Dundee, East. By the time HMRC had sufficient evidence

to prove a fraud, the business concerns would be long gone. That is the

nature of such fraud.</div>

<a name="06051155000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to deal with what

constitutes reasonable grounds for deciding the direction, in practical

terms. The Department will exercise its discretion carefully. It has to

do so, as the area is complex and litigious. As the hon. Member for

Rugby and Kenilworth pointed out, we can end up consuming huge amounts

of resources for no gain and we have still lost the revenue.

</div><a name="06051155000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">The main criterion is

likely to be the previous involvement of the business or persons

associated with the business in transaction chains that have led to a

VAT loss through MTIC fraud. Anyone who receives a direction and does

not believe that HMRC has acted reasonably in issuing it will have the

right of appeal to the VAT and duties tribunal.</div>

<a name="06051155000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">The direction would require the

business to keep records that identify the goods it bought or sold,

such as mobile phone serial or batch numbers, or the lock numbers for

computer chips. The direction notice will set out clearly the records

to be maintained. In order to apply the measure, HMRC must have

reasonable grounds. I have explained what those reasonable grounds are

and, given the magnitude of the problem that we want to deal with, that

is entirely proportionate.</div>

<a name="06051155000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">The final point was with regard

to the penalty. The whole point of these clauses and the penalties that

support them is not to use the penalties but to hope that they have a

deterrent effect and that businesses keep better records in the first

place to ensure that if they are in a sensitive area they can always

demonstrate the facts of the case and that they complied with the

legislation.</div> <a name="06051155000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

scale of the fraud could be up to &#163;1.9 billion of stolen VAT. It

is theft, not business. It is like robbing a bank; it is just a

different bank that they are robbing currently. They are doing it

against the Exchequer. In the light of this, the level of penalty must

be appropriate to act as a deterrent. I do not know whether

&#163;6,000 is high enough. However, within the range of penalties

that the Department operates across the piece, that is the appropriate

level and that is how we will back it

up.</div><a name="06051155000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">If businesses keep

the correct records they always know to whom they have sold and from

whom they are purchasing. If they have kept the batch numbers and they

can demonstrate that, it helps to pave the way exactly to the point

made by the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth. Where somebody within

a chain took all possible steps and could not have reasonably known, or

have had access to the knowledge, and can demonstrate the facts with

the records, it will take them outside consideration for MTIC fraud.

That seems very

important.</div><a name="06051155000280"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000482"></a>Stewart

Hosie:</b> The Paymaster General suggested that businesses

should keep correct records of goods, numbers, customers and so on.

That is reasonable. But in a previous debate it was suggested that

tobacco manufacturers should not supply to people who they 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column145" />Column number: 146</div>believe will smuggle; they should not supply to businesses, possibly

illegal ones, which may then resupply to smuggling operations. Would it

be reasonable under proposed new section 6A(1) for the commissioners to

direct a company to keep records, not only of its immediate customers,

but perhaps of the customers&#146; customers? That is the implication

of the tobacco smuggling issue. If that became impossible, because a

business simply could not identify it, and the commissioners thought

that it was reasonable in order to try to stop major fraud, would the

penalty then

apply?</div><a name="06051155000281"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000483"></a>Dawn

Primarolo:</b> We are talking about an entirely different case

here. As I made clear to the hon. Gentleman, the requirement for the

direction to keep more records is because of involvement in, or

suspected involvement in, a previous chain. This has operated perfectly

well. The legislation depends and has depended in other areas on this

definition of reasonableness and then the test at the tribunal. It is

entirely appropriate in this area. The question that we still have to

deal with as Members of this House, and I have to deal with as the

Minister responsible for this area, is whether the combination of these

clauses, the reverse charge and the increased activity, will have the

required deterrent effect on MTIC fraud, or whether further steps will

need to be taken. That is a matter that we can resolve only when we see

the exact details of the reverse charge and the derogation we may be

granted by the

Commission.</div><a name="06051155000282"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000484"></a>Mr.

Francois:</b> Very briefly&#151;[<span class="SmallCaps">Hon.

Members:</span> &#147;Hear, hear.&#148;] It is always nice to

be cheered on in any context. The clause is perhaps more minor than

some of the others that we have debated today. As the explanatory notes

explain:</div> <a name="06051155000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

clause allows HM Treasury to amend schedule 10A to the Value Added Tax

(VAT) Act 1994 by affirmative resolution order to specify circumstances

in which the supply of credit vouchers is not to be disregarded for VAT

purposes.&#148;</div> <a name="06051155000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">In essence it

is an anti-avoidance measure which appears to be aimed principally at

attempts to redefine items such as phonecards as credit vouchers in

order to minimise the VAT liability. The note goes on to stress that

this is a limited power in that</div>

<a name="06051155000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This power is intended

to help combat VAT avoidance schemes which seek to exploit the fact

that credit vouchers are not normally subject to VAT, and to discourage

avoiders from implementing new schemes. This clause is also intended to

leave businesses unaffected where they are not avoiding VAT: it does

not change the basic credit voucher rules, but allows the Government to

take targeted action against specific kinds of VAT avoidance, if the

need arises.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that

sense, the clause seems reasonable. This afternoon, we have been

pressing the Government for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column146" />Column number: 147</div>reassurance on several areas, but on this occasion it is provided

directly in the explanatory notes.</div>

<a name="06051155000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Law Society has raised one

minor technical matter; it has one small quibble. It has

stated:</div><a name="06051155000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We

recommend that clause 22 makes it clear that HM Treasury cannot specify

circumstances in which sub-paragraph (2) does not apply where

transactions of the type in question have been the subject of a taxable

supply in another Member

State.&#148;</div><a name="06051155000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Provided the

Paymaster General can give a brief, snappy answer to that point, we

have no objection to allowing the clause to stand part of the

Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06051155000485"></a>Dawn
