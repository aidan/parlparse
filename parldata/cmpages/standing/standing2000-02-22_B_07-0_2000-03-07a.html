<H4><center>Publication of information to users</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian Cotter </B>(Weston-super-Mare): I beg to move amendment No. 75, in page 23, line 30, leave out `may' and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`shall'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This amendment is similar to previous amendments. We want the Government to be more positive and substitute ``shall'' for ``may'' in clause 42. The clause deals with the publication of information for users and the importance of that justifies the firming up that we seek. Indeed, on several occasions, we have sought to clarify and firm up the Bill.
<P>
Such information is important to postal users, as it covers functions and services. The Minister should not find it difficult to accept the amendment as it is the council's role to inform people. We are merely asking for that role to become a positive obligation; the council should provide information as required by the users' group
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson):</B> The argument is the same as before. The amendment is prescriptive and nothing is to be gained from it. The council has a duty to provide users of postal services with specified information and it is only sensible for it to decide the best way of carrying out that duty for itself. We have empowered it do so in two ways, but do not want to rule out other ways. More generally, we do not want to impose an arbitrary requirement on the council.
<P>
One of the council's vital duties is giving information to users. However, there would be no advantage in specifying the means by which it should provide such information As with the argument about the Postal Services Commission, replacing ``may'' with ``shall'' is too prescriptive. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment for the reasons I have given before.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I express minor disappointment at the Minister's response. Indeed, I wish to say no more.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Do I take it that the hon. Gentleman wishes to withdraw his amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> Yes, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page </B>(South-West Hertfordshire): I am unable to attend the Committee on Thursday as I will be in Sri Lanka. I believe that the Committee will make a lot of progress while I am away. I hope that that encourages everyone.
<P>
Clause 42 deals with the publication of information for users. It requires the consumer council to make available such information on relevant postal services and its own activities as ``it considers expedient'', which is almost like giving it a blank cheque. That duty is qualified by subsection (3), which states that publication should not
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the person to whom it relates.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is rather like saying ``only slightly dead'', so I hope that the Minister will explain what it means. Does it mean that it could damage a company, but not seriously? It is a question of the degree of discretion that the council will have in publicising information to users about its activities or about the relevant postal services.
<P>
The terms ``expedient'' and ``appropriate'' are very legalistic. They are all right for lawyers, but how will they work in the real world, in which a postal service has to be operated and run? What criteria will the council use in deciding whether it is expedient to give users information? Will it check with the users affected before it releases information—showing them what it proposes to send out and asking if they have any objection to it? If it does not do that, companies could be seriously affected. There should be some form of consultation first. There is also nothing in the clause about what redress is available if a company is commercially affected—``seriously and prejudicially''—by the release of information. What redress against the council would a company have in such a case? Will the Minister reassure us that the council will discuss the release of information with the companies involved before it is released into the public domain?
<P>
As the Minister knows, we could have peppered the amendment paper with amendments to tease out such information but I thought it right to raise the issues on the clause stand part debate so that the Minister could respond to them all together, as it were. Some companies have legitimate concerns that information will be released that could seriously affect their business.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> We debated earlier the issue of whether disclosures
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the person to whom it relates.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We should be clear what we are talking about. We are talking about the council making available information to users of relevant postal services. Our earlier debate was on people who were not relevant postal users. The clause relates only to relevant postal users, defined in clause 40 as users of universal service obligation providers and licence holders. No blank cheques are involved. The use of ``expedient''—the clause states that the council will make available to users
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>such information as it considers expedient to give—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
simply gives a non-governmental public body the discretion to decide the issues for itself It is important that we do that. The opposite of giving a blank cheque would be for us to lay down every dot and comma of what that important body, which protects consumer services, should do. The council can be trusted to judge what it considers relevant. The provision does not deal with the information itself, but with the publication of information to users, most of which would be well received by the people to whom it is sent. There is no provision in the clause for information to be discussed with users before publication, but clause 50 deals with forward work programmes. Both the council and the commission will have to set out their forward work programme for the coming year. If users felt that that involved sending out information that would go straight into the wastepaper bin, they could make that clear.
<P>
I am enormously pleased that Opposition Members did not table a series of amendments to the clause. We have got the balance right. I am not talking about the standards of performance of licence holders. That is dealt with under clause 34. This clause deals with other information that the relevant postal services will be happy to receive. There will be no danger in the Committee accepting that clause 42 stand part of the Bill and I hope that at least some of what I have said has eased the fears of Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I thank the Minister for what he said but, with respect, he is reiterating the status quo. The council will have a requirement to circulate information to postal users. I have no objection to that, but what happens if it becomes aware of a new postal initiative taken by a company operating in the marketplace and, by chance, released information to the users that company A was about to introduce a new service in X months time? The users would receive information about the new facility with great interest.
<P>
Let us suppose that other companies were to become aware of what a competitor was up to and said, ``Gosh, what a good idea. We should be doing that.'' The plans that were made carefully by the company would have been negated by such information being released by the council. I am referring to confidential information about a company being made known to the general user and which will be of considerable benefit to other competitors in the marketplace. The council may have thought that it was expedient to release such information, but such action would damage the company. Will there be any redress against the council for damaging, perhaps inadvertently, the interests of competitors?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I re-emphasise that I am talking about relevant postal services that relate only to universal service obligation providers or licence holders. They do not relate to the vast array of 4,000 postal operators who will be operating outside the reserved area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the Minister at such an early stage in his no doubt long and comprehensive answer, but I am talking about the future. When other companies are licensed in the marketplace—not only the Post Office but, hopefully, a raft of people providing services—my point will be relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> It may, but with the licence goes the licence obligations. I am talking about people who are allowed into the reserved monopoly area. The hon. Gentleman is referring to subsection (3), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>So far as practicable the Council shall secure that no information relating to the affairs of a person is disclosed under this section . . . if the Council considers that its disclosure would or might seriously or prejudicially affect the interests of the person to whom it relates.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That will be the position, unless the person gives specific permission for that information to be used.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is seeing shadows. Information that relates to commercially sensitive matters is dealt with elsewhere. We are talking about the consumers' representative gathering information and ensuring that people have the benefit of that information, whether it is a survey that has been carried out on accessibility or something that we know and love about the Road Traffic Act 1991, whereby relevant postal users—licence holders—have a problem with parking arrangements. The hon. Gentleman has not expressed any justifiable fears that cannot be dealt with through the good offices of public servants elected to the council, who will not be placed in a straitjacket in terms of the amount of information that they may glean and distribute. We are discussing people receiving information, not giving it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> I thank the Minister for what he has said so far. Subsection (3) states that the council will ensure that information will not be released
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>if the Council considers that its disclosure would or might seriously and prejudicially affect the interests of the person to whom it relates.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We are discussing a one-way street: the council will make the decision, not the person to whom the information might be of value and interest. As a simple lad, I wonder whether the council will bother to ask people to whom such confidential information refers whether they have an objection to its being released. It is a matter of fair play, and it should not be too difficult for conscientious public servants to ask such people whether they mind such information being released.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That was a slightly long intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman should glance at clause 47, which is much fuller and provides the power to require information. The logic of his argument is that a safeguard should be provided on how information that the council has received is distributed. Clause 47 relates to how the council receives such information. It is a much longer clause, and contains lots more checks and balances on how such information may be gleaned. That is the best point for the hon. Gentleman to express his anxieties. Once the information has been freely given under clause 47, which we have yet to debate, using such information is the easy part, given that proper checks and balances have been provided, including the famous subsection (3). As more stringent checks apply under clause 47, the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) will be able to sleep easily in his bed tonight having agreed that the clause should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 42 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 43</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exercise of functions: general</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 23, line 42, leave out from `services' to `and' in line 43.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 81, in page 23, line 44, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) In exercising its functions the Council shall in particular have regard to the interests of users—
<P>
(a) who are disabled or chronically sick;
<P>
(b) of pensionable age;
<P>
(c) with low incomes;
<P>
(d) in rural areas; and
<P>
(e) in different areas.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> As the afternoon proceeds, I rise with increased hope and expectation for a more positive response from the Minister, and I do so justifiably, as I shall explain.
<P>
The amendments relate to lists of consumers, which are important and appear elsewhere in the Bill. We have already discussed the importance of postal services to people who are disabled or chronically sick, which the Minister accepted earlier. People on pensions are relevant to sub-post offices in particular and postal services in general. The amendment also specifies people on low incomes and people who reside in rural and different areas.
<P>
A clear thrust of the Bill and its associated documentation has been that the social aspects of the postal service are extremely important, and it is not unreasonable to want to draw that out, as has been done in clause 5(2). We welcome the fact that the commission will have regard to consumers who are likely to be more disadvantaged. This is an important social issue and it is right that we highlight those concerned.
<P>
I believe, and hope, that the Utilities Bill is still going through its proceedings in the House. I am not tuned in to what is happening in another Room and things might change but, on the basis that it is proceeding, albeit a little fractiously here and there, what I am proposing is in line with what the Government are proposing for that Bill. The Minister may not agree with that, but I believe it to be the case. There is not a great difference between the Utilities Bill as it is now and the Postal Services Bill in that the requirements for electricity and whatever else is left should equally apply to the users and consumers of postal services.
<P>
The amendment deserves serious consideration from the Minister because great emphasis has been laid on the social aspect of the postal services. It is something that the Government might have considered putting into the Bill and I want to give the Minister the opportunity to say that he would be ready to entertain it in view of the great importance of the social aspect of the postal services.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Duncan </B>(Rutland and Melton): This is a sensible amendment if only because it renders the clause consistent with earlier parts of the Bill. One of the patterns that has emerged in our deliberations over the past few days is repetition. We are repeating ourselves because certain aspects of the duties of the commission are the same as those of the council. In other words, they are parallel organisations performing a slightly different function with identical responsibilities. Whether we call it mirror imaging or perfect dovetailing, the fact is that the responsibilities of the council match and shadow the responsibilities of the commission. This amendment simply puts similar responsibilities for the council on to the same template as the responsibilities of the commission. If the council is required to provide information and offer advice in order to assist the commission with its duties, it makes sense that the nature of that advice should match and reflect the duties of the council. If the commission has responsibility in certain areas, the nature of the advice that emanates from the council should serve that duty as perfectly as possible. That is what the amendment requires. If the commission has to do this in A, B and C, the council has to provide the sort of information that it needs in areas A, B and C. The amendment is asking that the duties of the council match the responsibilities of the commission and would ensure that it properly provides information and advice to help the commission do its work. It is sensible. There are similar repetitions in the schedules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare has travelled in hope and expectation and I think he has arrived. [Hon. Members: ``But.''] But, I have a couple of points. First, we do not think that comparison should be made between clause 43 and clause 5. A better comparison with the commission is with subsections (3) and (4) where all users of the USO are provided for, just as we expect the Consumer Council for Postal Services to represent all users of postal services.
<P>
I have great sympathy with the arguments. I ask the hon. Gentleman not to press the amendment and perhaps to let us return with tidied-up wording because the amendment does not include the following important words from clause 5:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
When we argued about the homeless, it was pointed out that the commission could consider other groups by virtue of those words.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Does what the Minister said—that he will perhaps return with an amendment of his own for consideration—mean that the subsequent Government amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67 will be withdrawn so that he can consider the clause as a whole? If not, how does he propose that the clause will read? How might it subsequently be amended? I know that he cannot say that in exact detail. Does his proposal to return have any bearing on those amendments?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman jumps the gun a little, and almost persuades me to change my mind. Those amendments are about a different issue altogether, as I shall explain. If the commission has a duty to consider those categories of users, the consumer representative should similarly consider the problems. The amendment slants towards considering those groups to the exclusion of all others, as it does not contain the important words from clause 5 that I quoted.
<P>
Having accepted the arguments, we shall come back on Report with a suitably worded amendment. I hope that hon. Members will find no inconsistency between that and the arguments that I shall make on the following Government amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I thank the Minister. My expression of hope a moment ago was justified, and things seem to be looking up. I hope that that carries on for the rest of the sitting. I thank the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) for his able support in emphasising the links between the commission and council. I accept what the Minister said about the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but that is not to be taken as implying that regard may not be had to the interests of other descriptions of users.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is unfortunate that those words dropped off the bottom of the page, or were not in the amendment in the first place as we intended. I appreciate the Minister saying that he will come back on Report to take those concerns on board, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 24, line 4, after `provision', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(in the United Kingdom and elsewhere)'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 66 and 67.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The amendments will enable the council to exercise its functions more effectively than as drafted in the Bill. Amendment No. 65 makes it clear that the council must, to facilitate the exercise of its functions—so far as it considers practicable—collect and keep under review information about the provision of postal services in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. That could, for example, include information about best practice on how other postal operators deal with complaints both here and overseas. As the UK is a member of the European Union and is bound by the same postal services directive as other European operators, it is important that the council should be aware of practice overseas. Obviously it cannot represent consumers overseas, but adding the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the United Kingdom and elsewhere<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
will make its duties much more meaningful by ensuring that it keeps itself informed.
<P>
Amendment No. 66 gives the council a duty to collect and keep under review information about not only ``relevant postal services'', but any postal services as is practicable in facilitating the exercise of its functions. For example, it may compare the performance of parcel operators in unlicensed areas with that of universal service providers, with a view to possible improvement. The council has a role to say, for example, that some private couriers have better arrangements for people to collect parcels if they were not at home when the courier attempted to deliver them. It is right that best practice from the unregulated area influences the council to improve the practices of the relevant postal services users within the regulated area.
<P>
Amendment No. 67 gives the council a duty to collect and keep under review information about the interests and users of all postal services in the United Kingdom, rather than restricting the duty to relevant postal issues. The amendments would make the council better able to perform its functions and are therefore in the interests of consumers.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I should like to delve deeper into the amendment. There is nothing severely objectionable about it; it is a tidying-up provision. However, it gives rise to the fear of duplication between the council and the commission. They will be looking at the same sector, albeit from slightly different angles. The commission will be the regulator, while the council will be a consumer watchdog. The council is primarily a domestic consumer watchdog, but in looking at the interests of those whose services it is studying, it will want to draw some international comparisons in case our services are lagging behind those of, say, Germany and our communications sector is missing a trick. The council must look beyond the immediate market over which it is the consumer watchdog.
<P>
Gathering information from other markets and making a comparative study of what goes on in the United Kingdom and what goes on in Germany or France is an expensive and complicated exercise. The commission has that same responsibility elsewhere in the Bill, albeit from a slightly different angle. It will be looking at matters much more from a commercial and regulatory angle, with a view to permitting or not permitting mergers and deals between companies and letting a foreign company set up a business within, say, the reserved area.
<P>
Primarily, the commission will be gathering information in a sophisticated commercial way. We may find that the council is duplicating the same task at considerable expense. Given that it is a consumer body rather than a commercial concern, it will not be carrying out such research with the same sort of accountant's sharp pen as the commission, because it will be acting from the consumer's point of view. What does the Minister think will be the relationship between the council and the commission? How will they share such information? At present, most of the emphasis is on the council gathering information and offering advice to the commission.
<P>
In return, there could be considerable value, if properly structured, in the commission giving the benefit of its expertise and information-gathering process to the council. Does the Minister consider that there is sufficient provision in the Bill for that two-way exchange of information? At present, it seems to be a one-way exchange, given that the commission will be better equipped than the council to consider international comparisons. When the Minister considers the amendments and what they will get to grips with, it would be valuable if he outlined how he envisages the relationship of the two bodies in terms of the sharing of information, particularly international information.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but Opposition Members tried to persuade me to include the provision that the council should be required to keep themselves informed of developments in the European Community. The amendment states
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in the United Kingdom and elsewhere<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
because there are strong arguments for looking outside the European Union, as has been said in previous sittings. The United States generates 40 per cent. of the world's mail and has an enormous influence on postal services.
<P>
Our amendments are consistent with the arguments that were made in relation to the European Community. There is proper concern about where one draws the line between the activities of the commission and of the council. It is the first time that the Post Office will have a regulator, a consumer body and the Government as owner; that creates many complications and I understand the concerns expressed. In terms of the duplication that may occur, clause 49 provides that the commission and the council have to draw up a memorandum of understanding. We will debate that later, but we think that the two bodies should be left alone to do so. I can envisage many occasions and circumstances where we will not want duplication of effort. We will not expect the commission to undertake research into an area that has already been investigated by the council. The commission and the council will need to sort out problems in regard to the memorandum of understanding and their forward work programmes. There will be cases where the commission, with its specific responsibilities to encourage competition and protect the USO, will want to acquaint itself with developments in the European Union and elsewhere, while the council has separate, distinctive views and may want to undertake its own research—but the amendments merely widen the duty to collect and keep information under review; the clause goes no wider than that.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised an important point, which we intend to sort out in the memorandum of understanding. As the hon. Gentleman said, the consumer representative cannot look just at the United Kingdom. There is best practice in the rest of the world. Several postal administrations—New Zealand, for example—have innovative practices, some of which, such as charging for rural services, we do not want to copy and others of which consumer representatives may want to introduce. The amendments simply tidy up the situation, given that clause 49 deals with the memorandum of understanding. We would expect—the Bill would almost force them to do so—the council and the commission to work together amicably so that they do not duplicate efforts. Any tension should be genuine tension where consumers have different interests from those of the commission and the postal operators.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I did not intend to contribute to the debate on this amendment, but I was driven to do so because the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare forgot to take advantage of the opportunity to add the homeless as a category to amendment No. 81. That would be a winner and should be included.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman may wish to know that we are debating amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67. We have dispensed with amendment No. 81.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am aware of that, Mr. Maxton, but throughout the Bill, clauses and amendments flow into each other. It is hard to decide where to draw a line in that seamless flow.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. We have certainly drawn a line under amendment. No. 81.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Thank you, Mr. Maxton. Government amendment No. 65 requires the consumer council to collect and review information on the provision of postal services in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. The only point that I seriously wanted to make to the Minister was one that has been emphasised by the Countryside Alliance. When we bring in representations, we must take into account the EU definition of rurality—that it should not exceed 200 persons per sq km. Will that fall into the categories of ``relevant postal issues'' or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>views of users about relevant postal issues?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will there be any intention to get in line with the EU definition? In an oblique way, the subject can be related back to the series of definitions made by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, but I shall take it no further than that. To what extent will the Minister consider the EU definition?
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> What a good point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> An interesting point, perhaps. The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire has explained one of the reasons why the consumer representative needs to consider more than the United Kingdom, which is a good argument for the amendment.
<P>
I do not believe that the postal services directive contains a strict definition of rural areas to be applied to each location. In the UK, the definition of a rural area was classified until recently in the head postmaster's manual, a boring and voluminous Victorian document, as being something with a horse trough and only one cinema. That was wiped out of Post Office rules and replaced by a simple definition dependent on a certain volume of mail being received in an area. That is relevant in that urban areas receive two deliveries a day but rural areas receive only one. The subject was important during my time in the Communication Workers Union. Lots of areas previously classified as rural were given housing developments which meant that they were to all intents and purposes, urban which justified a second delivery. The Post Office, which is likely to be the first licence holder, made a pragmatic definition that met the objectives of rural pressure groups and left a situation in which 90 per cent. of addresses received two deliveries a day, and only 10 per cent. were classified as rural.
<P>
I shall research the point, because I have talked for a while and no note has arrived about the definition. [Laughter.] It has probably been sent second class. We have not defined the word ``rural'' in those terms. We may return to it when we consider the social and environmental guidelines, although I shall need to consult the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions before making a statement.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): Will my hon. Friend the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I shall be absolutely delighted.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Does my hon. Friend the Minister accept that we must be careful not to have blacks and whites about urban and rural in our communities? The nature of society is such that a simple black and white decision may not be appropriate in the future. If we use some numerical definition based on density of population or mail being delivered, there is a great danger that we might make a mistake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is right. The best service we can give to rural communities is not to stir up problems when there is none. So far as I am aware, there are arguments about whether the definition used by the only universal service provider at the moment—the Post Office—applies to some areas, but there is no argument about the definition itself. I am confident that the European postal services directive does not require us to define rural areas, but I shall confirm that for the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire next Tuesday.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> I can, perhaps, overemphasise the point, and I should not be too hopeful and confident. I shall start at a fairly low level, hoping that the Minister will seriously consider the amendments. They relate to clause 31, the importance of which we have already discussed. The Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No one should be in any doubt that the clause is an important addition to the various measures that we intend to take to protect the Post Office network.—[Official Report, Standing Committee B, 2 March 2000; c. 85.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will agree that considerable anxiety has been expressed about sub-post offices. Many of my colleagues have, like me, visited sub-post offices and have been acquainted with those anxieties. In our previous debate, the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew), among others, mentioned the importance of the clause, and the Minister accepted that it is extremely important.
<P>
The amendments are designed to strengthen the Bill by replacing the word ``may'' with the word ``shall''. When I proposed a similar amendment earlier, the Minister did not seem to feel the force of the argument. Not dismayed by that, I have bounced back, and I feel that in this case the Minister may feel that the word ``may'' is lacking, especially given the importance of clause 31 to our constituents.
<P>
Subsection (1)(b) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any matter relating to the number and location of public post offices.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Under amendment No. 76, the council ``shall'' investigate, and under amendment No. 77 the council ``shall'' send a report. We are trying to introduce investigation by saying ``shall'' rather than may, the importance of which is self-evident. It is equally vital that there should be a report afterwards to the commission, the Secretary of State and the Director General of Fair Trading—the people whom we have agreed are concerned with such issues. It is not unreasonable to seek a positive obligation rather than a ``may''. I rest on those few words and look forward to the Minister smiling in our direction and accepting that the amendment has some justification.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I hope that the Committee will provide a sobering lesson for the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. The Liberal Democrats cosy up to the Labour party in Cabinet sub-committees and constitutional committees, but what do they get out of it? Not a crumb. Yet, they go on tabling amendments. I hope that the Committee will be a lesson to them. The Minister will not give the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare so much as a crumb. He cannot even go back to his party and say ``We've changed the word from `may' to `shall'''. It is pathetic. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see the light and realise what sort of people the Liberal Democrats have been cosying up to all this time. If the Committee does nothing else for the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare, I hope that it will show that being reasonable does not work.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bob Laxton </B>(Derby, North): Is the hon. Gentleman advocating that the Liberal Democrats should move from cosying up to the Labour party—that is not how I would have described it—to cosying up to the Conservative party?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I am concerned about the cosying up that goes on between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party and I hope that today's proceedings will be a revelation to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I approach the amendment from a slightly different angle. My opinion on this series of amendments is slightly Liberal-Democratic in that I agree with half of what they seek to do. If the first amendment were accepted, so that the Bill would read
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Council shall investigate'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
there would be a risk that the council would thereafter be in a permanent state of compulsory investigation. However, if it is doing its job, the council will want to investigate such matters, particularly the number and location of public post offices. Given that the council would be champing at the bit to conduct such investigations, the word ``may'' is sufficient.
<P>
It would be absurd, however, if, after conducting a very important investigation into, say, the number and location of public post offices—a crucial issue that is very much at the centre of debate at present—the council considered only the possibility of sending a report. I believe that ``may'' should remain in subsection (1), but ``shall'' would be better in subsection (3), but I do not know how the Minister will unravel that. If a council completes an important investigation, it jolly well should submit its report to the commission, the Secretary of State and so on. I half agree, therefore, with the amendments and hope that the Minister might strengthen the council's obligation to pass on the conclusions of any investigation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Perhaps I can help the Minister by summarising our position as ``no, yes, yes'', which I hope that he will accept. From that position, I cannot see how the council could investigate the number and location of public post offices without investigating some of the financial aspects. The Countryside Alliance is exceedingly concerned about the viability of post offices. Given the distinction between ``may investigate'' and ``shall investigate'', will the profitability and capital side of businesses also be investigated?
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> An element of control freakery is slipping into the arguments of the Liberal Democrats. They are becoming dictatorial with their ``shall'' rather than ``may'' amendments. I subscribe to the theory that we can make this century a centre-left century, given that the previous century was a conservative century, but that will not arise from the amendments. There is no basis in the arguments for changing ``may'' to ``shall'' in amendment No. 76, nor is there under amendments Nos. 77 and 78. People can reach out and touch the postal service. The entire country is a user, so if the council must investigate issues, no matter how frivolous or vexatious, we would probably need a consumer council made up of about 7,000 people rather than the 16 to whom referred earlier. That would be illogical.
<P>
The hon. Member for Rutland and Melton jumped in and supported amendment No. 77, which would amend clause 46(3) to read that the council shall
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>send a report on any matter investigated under this section.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The council may decide to investigate a certain matter and find very early on that there is nothing of interest in it. However, it would be required to cut down half a rain forest to send to various people a report saying that its investigation came up with nothing. Once again, that would be illogical. As for the final change of the word ``may'' to ``shall'' in this group of amendments, amendment No. 78 would amend the Bill to read that the council shall also
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>send a report on any such matter to any person who appears to the Council to have an interest in the matter<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and that is completely unnecessary.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked whether the council could investigate finances. Yes, it can. Under clause 46(1)(b), it can investigate any matter relating to the number and location of public post offices, which may include the financial situation and the unit payments that the Post Office pays to sub-postmasters. That is an important step forward, but hon. Member for Rutland and Melton was right when he said that the consumer council would be champing at the bit to get its teeth into the clause. It is one of the most important consumer issues, if not the most important, that will be reported to it. The word ``shall'' is not necessary. The council would have to use its time, energy and finances no matter how vexatious, frivolous or trivial the complaint. We do not need such wording.
<P>
My generosity allowed me to accede to the last few amendments. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) was present when we proved the benefit of cosying up to the Liberal Democrats—
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Some of us are having to double up on the Trade and Industry Committee and this Committee, so hard working are we at present.
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> I must point out we appreciated the previous amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare and we are obliged to table an amendment on Report to take them into account. With regard to the amendments under discussion now, however, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that they would make the job of the CCPS harder rather than easier. The fact that it would be forced to consider all complaints would detract from its investigating and reporting on cases that have substance. I hope that the Committee rejects the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cotter:</B> The hon. Member for Banbury missed a few crumbs that came in our direction earlier, and I hope that he was not making an overture from his party in my direction. Rather than digging a hole any deeper, I shall move swiftly on. We have been accused of control freakery and liberal democracy, but we need to firm up the Bill as much as we can, and we have tried to do so in the past. I accept what the Minister says, and we clearly have 50:50 support from those on the Conservative Benches. We shall watch this space in future to ensure that the public are given reports and that proper investigations are carried out, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Of course, the ability of the council to investigate such matters is its essential role and key brief. We shall consider the subject further, as the number and location of public post offices is crucial. Although I know that the Minister said that the Bill suggests that there shall be studies, the viability of post offices as commercial concerns is also crucial. We have a reasonable network that serves the country well, but its continuing commercial viability risks being severely in doubt. The clause implicitly wants to safeguard and protect the network, so perhaps we need to consider injecting a greater obligation to study its long-term commercial viability into the Bill on Report. We shall do a little more homework, because the looming fact is that post offices will not survive if they do not make money. If the Bill is to be an effective safeguard for the future network, we must make the council consider the income, costs and commercial viability carefully.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The commercial viability of the network would be under serious threat if we refused to computerise it, or if we let the gradual erosion continue. Ten per cent. of rural post offices have closed since 1990, and 25 per cent.—I previously said 20 per cent.—have closed over the past 20 years, which has happened without any great public debate or furore. For the first time, we have put a spotlight on an underutilised, underpromoted network. There is an unhealthy over-dependence on one type of customer, but that is changing due to the gradual move to automated credit transfer. No sensible Government would refuse to see the writing on the wall about the drift to ACT.
<P>
I say all that to record in Hansard our view that there is opportunity, not threat, for the Post Office network. We want post offices to not simply survive and cling on by their fingernails, but to survive. Everything that we do over the next six years to give new opportunities to the network will be reinforced by the Bill, through the access criteria and the consumer council's obligation to police and monitor the number and location of public post offices. We welcome any healthy debate on the issue. It is a subject of great concern to communities all over the country. Any kind of political opportunism that devalues and undermines the network by saying that it has no future would be damaging and I do not accuse any member of the Committee of that. Sub-postmasters have £1 billion of their own money invested in the network and it is important to ensure that we do not talk it down.

Clause 46 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 47</center></H4>
<H4><center>Power of the Council to require information</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> We welcome part of the clause. It gives the council power to require information for use in performing its functions, but we are pleased that that power is limited to requiring information from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the Commission,
<P>
(b) the universal service provider,
<P>
(c) any licence holder under Part II,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
which is the wording that we wanted to use for same provision concerning the commission. We welcome the limited parameters within which such information can be demanded. There is the prospect of a stand-off between the council and the commission when the commission refuses to supply information. I note that it is then required to explain why and to publish its reasons. Can the Minister cite the circumstances in which such information might be refused and say whether there is a risk of a stand-off between the commission and the council that might jeopardise the proper workings of either body?
<P>
<B>Mr. Johnson:</B> That is a valid point. The memorandum of understanding will set out the position of the commission vis-a-vis the council, so that their work does not overlap. I cannot think of an example off the top of my head, but given that the commission's work will be related to encouraging competition and that it will be privy to much more commercially sensitive information than the consumer representative by virtue of the fact that it has to police the monopoly and that it must ensure that the universal service obligation is not damaged, the commission may not give the information that is required of the council. The hon. Gentleman is right; the clause is related purely to the universal service obligation provider or the licence holder. It gives teeth to the CCPS, without which it could not perform its duties.

<H4><center>Provision of information by the Council to the Commission</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> I shall be making the same point as before, but I shall be working in reverse. We are setting a rapid pace this afternoon. The council will be obliged to give information to the commission but, again, it may refuse to do so. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire has prompted me on a certain matter. We have expressed concerns about information being demanded of those within the licensed area. Will it be legitimate for the commission or the council to seek information from certain Government agencies, as distinct from private commercial concerns? I may be marginally out of order by raising such a matter under clause 48, but it is an allied subject. Will the Minister say whether there is provision in the Bill for the council or the commission to seek information from Government agencies? We would not object to their seeking information from, say, the Benefits Agency, but we would object to their having the power to seek information from, say, Aardvark Couriers Ltd. of Bromley.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I should like to add to my hon. Friend's request. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us a clue about what information the Secretary of State would consider it right for the council to refuse to supply to the Postal Services Commission. In what circumstances could such a refusal be justified? Could there be situations in which information that the commission would usually be required to produce could be refused? If so, how and why? It would be useful to put on record the remit of the council and commission for their guidance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Alan Johnson:</B> The Secretary of State may decide that information should not be handed over to the commission. An example of that would be where an individual who works in the industry gave information on problems occurring within it to the council; that individual may feel strongly that the information should not be passed to the commission. The Secretary of State would also have that power in regard to information flowing in the opposite direction—where the council required information from the commission. The clause ensures that the rules are transparent for all to see.
<P>
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton, I believe that the council will have the power to require information from Government bodies, but I am not certain and rather than have something appear in Hansard that I would have to retract later, I shall reflect on the matter and drop him a note by Thursday's sitting.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Our discussion on the previous two or three clauses has led up to this one. The clause provides for the memorandum of understanding between the council and the commission, which will set out, in a carefully crafted document, the working practices that will govern their conduct. Of course we do not want the Bill to be too narrowly prescriptive and we recognise that the working relationship between the two bodies can reasonably be left to them to decide in that document. We welcome the fact that it will be presented to Parliament and therefore subject to democratic scrutiny. Assuming that the commission and the council hit it off happily from the start, the clause should ensure that they work sensibly together and fulfil their respective functions efficiently and harmoniously.
