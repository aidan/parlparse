<H2><center>Standing Committee A</center></H2>
<H4><center>Tuesday 23 November 1999</center></H4>
<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>
<H4><center>[Mr. Bill O'Brien in the Chair]</center></H4>
<H3><center><A href="/pa/cm199900/cmbills/001/2000001.htm">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Loughton </B>(East Worthing and Shoreham): On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. We meet again after a short break either side of the Queen's Speech. Less than 24 hours before the Committee's deliberations, substantial rewritings of clauses were posted on the board for hon. Members. We face discussion of a great many Government amendments, which rewrite substantial clauses and, added to that, we have a new Bill, which contains all the amendments that have been made so far. All the clauses, line numbers and page numbers have changed substantially. Is it in order to give Opposition Members, in particular, such little notice? We have come to the Committee to debate the Bill, but we have had little time to prepare for the new clauses. We are faced with substantial changes to clauses that might well come up this morning. Is it in order to expect us to carry out our deliberations when changes are made at such short notice?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me. It is for the usual channels and the Treasury to agree the exchange of papers. The points that have been raised should be taken up with the Whips and the Treasury.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. The Government have provided us with something entitled,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Financial Services and Markets Bill<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government Amendments to Part VIII and schedule 11<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Explanatory Notes for the Standing Committee''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I imagine that that is to assist the Committee. I should be grateful if the Ministers could explain whether that document relates to part VIII and schedule 11 or whether the wording is a mistake.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Again, it is for the Minister to comment on that. If he wants to do so now, he obviously can. However, the real place for such transactions is between those on the two Front Benches; they are not a matter for the Chair. I appeal to hon. Members to raise the issue with the appropriate Department.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household):</B> I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during further proceedings on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at five minutes to Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That change was made to the Standing Orders because certain hon. Members want to get to Prayers at 11.30 am. The Thursday morning sitting has, therefore, been moved forward by five minutes. It will, of course, end five minutes earlier.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<H4><center>Clause 135</center></H4>
<H4><center>Authority's power to require information</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): I beg to move amendment No. 483, in page 63, line 14, after `without', insert `unreasonable'.
<P>
We now move to part X, to which clause 135 and the amendment specifically relate. It is complex territory, which concerns the powers of the Financial Services Authority to require the production of information, conduct investigations and have access to businesses. Those whom the FSA orders to comply face serious penalties for not doing so. Obviously, it is important that the FSA should be able to do its job properly. However, in relation to the traditional Anglo-Saxon areas of justice and liberty, refusal to comply with such orders is a criminal offence.
<P>
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) said, the Government have substantially rewritten much of part X. Buried within that rewriting is, to some degree, a concealed extension of the FSA's powers, which goes beyond it having reasonable grounds to make such investigations. I wish to state upfront the Opposition's general feeling that the extension of those powers is unwarranted. Powers prescribed in the current draft of the Bill are sufficient for a professional job and for justice to be done. Many of the powers are Star Chamber powers. Since the beginning of our debates, we have felt the need to strike a balance in the Bill between the powers of the individual and the regulator.
<P>
Clause 135 gives the FSA a general power to require information and call for documents, which may be reasonably required for it to discharge its functions. Those requirements relate to formally authorised persons, those connected to them, exchanges and clearing houses. The clause should be absolutely clear and just. Amendment No 483 would change ``without delay'' in 135(3) to ``without unreasonable delay''. We are dealing with a criminal offence. ``Without delay'' means what it says. We consider that the qualification ``unreasonable'' is appropriate to achieve a proper degree of justice. Obviously, the amendment is not a major one, but it sets the tone for quite a lot of the amendments relating to part X.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> Mr. O'Brien, I hope that you and Committee members enjoyed the short pause that we have had over the past week.
<P>
There is a little confusion on both sides of the Committee about which part of the Bill we are discussing. We are indeed discussing part X, not part IX or part VIII. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir Nicholas Lyell) asked about notes, the title of which contained an error. It should have referred to part X and schedule 12, not part VIII and schedule 11.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the argument for amendment No. 483 made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). However, I hope to persuade him that it is unnecessary.
<P>
First, let me say a little about the purpose of the clause and this part of the Bill. Hon. Members will appreciate that information is the key to effective regulation. The FSA must have access to detailed, up-to-date and relevant information in order to make good, regulatory decisions.
<P>
Therefore, this part of the Bill is vital to ensuring that the new rationalised regulatory system is effective. In keeping with our general policy of rationalising powers, part X represents a synthesis—put together with some care—of the rather confusing array of investigative powers exercised by the existing regulators. Initially, there was one kind of person doing one kind of activity, another power for another person, and so on. Part X now includes some detailed and technical provisions, but I hope that the Committee will bear in mind as we debate them that we shall end up with something a lot simpler than what is on the statute book at present—an important improvement.
<P>
What is equally important is that the powers in this part are not just simpler, but also more transparent than some of the powers currently relied on by existing regulators. All the FSA's powers, and the associated limits and safeguards, will be contained in the primary statute, rather than operating through contracts.
<P>
So the main point is not that the Bill arms the regulator with a wide range of powers, but that it provides the FSA with a single coherent set of powers, appropriate for a modern regulator dealing with developing markets, bounded by appropriate safeguards, and drawing on the best of what exists at present.
<P>
There are two broad categories of power under this part: powers to gather information or documents as part of the on-going supervisory process and powers to carry out investigations. This clause is concerned with the former. It deals with how the FSA goes about its daily business of supervising authorised firms and overseeing recognised exchanges and clearing houses. It provides the FSA with its basic power to require information or documents to be provided by an authorised person, a recognised investment exchange, a recognised clearing house, a formerly authorised person or a person who is connected to an authorised person.
<P>
The power replaces a range of similar information, gathering powers under existing Acts: the Insurance Companies Act 1982; the Financial Services Act 1986; the Building Societies Act 1986; the Banking Act 1987—section 39, to which I shall refer in a moment—and section 62 of the Friendly Societies Act 1992.
<P>
The information or document that the FSA can require under the clause is restricted to those documents or that information which it may reasonably require in connection with the discharge of its functions. Clearly, it is important that the FSA can access information and documents on a timely basis. Subsection (3) therefore provides that the FSA can require information or documents ``without delay''. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs, (Mr. Flight) suggests that we change that to ``without unreasonable delay''.
<P>
I sympathise with the intention behind the amendment, but I hope that I can reassure him that that is unnecessary. The term ``without delay'' appears in innumerable other places on the statute book. It is implicit that what is being referred to is an unjustified or unreasonable delay. Subsection (3) does not enable the FSA to require a person to meet some unreasonable or impractical requirement, nor do any of the other statutes that include that wording.
<P>
If we were to include the wording proposed by the hon. Gentleman, it could cast doubt on those other parts of the statute book where the word ``unreasonable'' does not appear. That would clearly be highly undesirable.
<P>
I hope that, in the light of that explanation and the fact that I have put on record the Government's intention behind the wording that we have adopted, the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will feel able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> On the basis of the Minister having made it clear that ``without delay'' means here and in other places ``without unreasonable delay'', I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave. withdrawn.<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 484, in page 63, line 19, leave out from `only' to end of line 21 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`if it appears to the Authority that an authorised person has or may have contravened rules or engaged in market abuse or has or may have ceased to satisfy the qualifying conditions set out in Schedule 6 in relation to all of the regulated activities for which permission has been given to that authorised person.'.<P>

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 485, in clause 135, page 63 line 33, after `time', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within the previous six years'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 487, in clause 136, page 64, line 12, after `time', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`within the previous six years'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> These three amendments are all essentially intended to limit the FSA's powers in the territories for which the clause prescribes what is reasonable amendment necessary. As the Committee will be aware, clause 135 applies to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``information and documents reasonably required in connection with the exercise by the Authority of functions conferred on it by or under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``functions conferred on it by or under this Act''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are very wide. The amendment would limit the FSA's power to require information and documents to be provided by an authorised person first, to cases of actual or possible breaches of the rules, secondly, to cases of actual or possible market abuse and, thirdly, to cases where the qualifying conditions have, or may have, ceased to be satisfied in relation to all the regulated activities for which permission has been given to the authorised person.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 485 and 487 would limit to a period of six years the relevant back time in relation to people who have formally been authorised . The FSA cannot reasonably expect a firm to retain documents for more than six years after it has ceased to be authorised. Amendment No. 487 relates to clause 136 but makes the same point. Persons whom the FSA can give a notice under clause 136(1) are set out in subsection (2) and include, for example, group companies, where they may have been incorporated, irrespective of the nature of their business. The amendment would impose a six-year time limit for identifying the person with the various categories. We question why the list in clause 136(2) does not include controllers when they are included in clause 135. The main point of the two amendments is that there is no time qualification of how far back the period may go. There needs to be a practical argument for this in terms of record keeping, as well as a common justice argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have some sympathy with amendments Nos. 485 and 487, although I hope to be able to convince the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends that we have already met the points at issue. However, I have little sympathy with amendment No. 484 because I feel that it would undermine the character of this power and remove a mainstay of effective regulation. Its effect would be to deprive the FSA of its power to supervise, replacing it with one such as that under clause 138 which could be triggered only where it appeared that something was already wrong. The FSA would have no power to require information or documents on the basis of good reason. Instead it would have to wait until it could say that it appeared that some contraventions had or may have been committed, or until the authorised person no longer met the schedule 6 criteria. The problem there is that it would be shutting the door after the horse had bolted. How can we expect the FSA to supervise if it does not have the power to require information, or check on how things are going. I feel sure that Opposition Members would not really prefer a regulator which needs to wait until a problem has arisen. That would be out of line with all the principles and practice of sound modern financial regulation. The Bank of Credit and Commerce International and Barings have reminded us, if a reminder were needed, of the dangers of waiting until things have gone wrong before taking action. The lessons from those cases were widely drawn. We need a regulator that will be vigilant and pro-active in keeping its eyes open for trouble. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw amendment No. 484.
<P>
I have some sympathy with the thinking behind amendments Nos. 485 and 487, which would prevent the FSA from seeking information under the powers conferred by the clause on someone who ceased to be authorised more than six years previously. The Government do not intend that a person who was once authorised should be subject to an endless stream of information for ever more, but nor can we afford to have the regulator wash its hands of an authorised person as soon as they cease to be authorised. What if, a few years later, concerns emerge that there has been large-scale mis-selling along the lines of the pensions scandal? To assess the extent of the problem, the FSA may need to have access to information from all those who were active in the market at the time, not just those who are still authorised.
<P>
For good reason, we have taken forward the existing approach under section 39 (8) of the Banking Act 1987, which applies the power to collect information to former authorised institutions under that Act. We considered whether there should be some cut-off date, but the difficulty is that any date we might choose is bound to be arbitrary. Pensions mis-selling provides evidence that there can be a real need for information about transactions carried out a few years—certainly more than six years—earlier. Instead, the power under the clause is circumscribed by the requirement in subsection (4), which limits it to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``information and documents reasonably required in connection with the exercise by the Authority of functions conferred on it by . . . this Act''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Amendment No. 484 would delete that. If it is left in, that requirement ensures that a former authorised person will not be pursued endlessly with information requests. Only where the FSA has some legitimate need for information in connection with the discharge of its functions may it invoke that power.
<P>
The position under clause 136 is similar. That clause deals with reports by skilled persons, another very useful power modelled on section 39 of the Banking Act. Subsection (2) (d) of clause 136 applies the power to a person who was an authorised person, or a group or partnership of which an authorised person was a member ``at any relevant time''. The requirement under subsection (4) of clause 135, to which I just referred, also applies by virtue of subsection (1) of clause 136.
<P>
Adequate constraints are built into clauses 135 and 136, which will ensure that, while it is necessary for these powers to be capable of being exercised against former authorised persons, they can be exercised only for reasons connected with the discharge of the authority's functions. There is no possibility of former authorised persons being pursued with needless information requests for indefinite periods. In the light of that assurance, I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I have a brief question of clarification. If the former authorised person has not kept the documentation and 10 years have passed, what penalties can be imposed on him—for example, in the pensions scandal to which the Minister referred? I ask that to establish what archiving obligations are being imposed on companies that supply or broker pensions. Will substantial fines be imposed years later if the firms cannot produce documentation that is subsequently required?
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): My question is similar to that of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire. What obligations will be imposed on authorised persons and will it be a condition of their authorisation that they will have to keep records for more than six years? If so, that amounts to a significant and onerous obligation. Documents are voluminous in modern business, despite the so-called paperless office, and storing them is expensive. The FSA requirements go beyond normal audit requirements. It is not common for documents to be kept for more than six years and doing so could be a burden, especially for small firms.
<P>
Will a person or a firm seeking authorisation be warned that the authority may want to go back beyond six years? What penalties could be levied? We come later to the terms of imprisonment or fines that could be levied for breaches of the rules. Is it seriously proposed that a firm that has not kept documents for a sufficient length of time could be fined or the owner imprisoned? The Minister relied heavily on subsection (4), which tries to impose a reasonableness test but that does not fit with my reading of it. The FSA will be restricted to requiring documents that are reasonably required in connection with the exercise of its powers. It must show that it has a reason for requiring the documents, which is different from restricting it to the reasonable exercise of those powers in requesting them from a firm.
<P>
In other words, the FSA may argue, correctly, that it needs the documents to exercise its powers and so it is reasonable to request them. But there is another test and that is whether it is reasonable in the circumstances for it to request documents from a firm under investigation for potentially breaking the rules? There is a distinction there. The FSA could pass the first test. It could be entirely reasonable for it to want to get at the documents to discharge its obligations, but unreasonable for a firm to be required to keep them for that length of time. I can well imagine a situation in which the FSA could properly rely on subsection (4) but the wretched firm would still be required to do something that is unreasonable, namely to retrieve documents that have long been destroyed.
<P>
This is a serious matter. Yet again the Treasury and the FSA are doing something for their own convenience. Of course, the people at the top of the FSA are reasonable men, but practitioners and small firms tell us repeatedly that the people they deal with further down the feeding chain take a rather different attitude. A more junior member of the FSA could get on the wrong side of a firm. There could be a clash of personalities and the FSA could decide to go on a fishing expedition and trawl through the firm. It might have no evidence of wrongdoing but it could require the firm to disgorge all its past documents. When the police try this the courts do not like it. I am not a lawyer and I rely heavily on my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire, but I understand that that is why the police need a warrant. The police have to show that there is a prima facie case. They have to convince a magistrate that there is something wrong and that they need to burst into someone's home to look at various documents. They cannot do a trawl through documents in the hope of finding something.
<P>
Here we are giving the FSA powers to engage in those fishing expeditions. It is not qualified adequately in subsection (4). Moreover, on the specific point about the time limit, it is not prevented from fining a firm that, for perfectly good reasons, has decided that it cannot store documents for more than six years. I would like the Minister to respond to those points. The Treasury and the FSA still do not understand sufficiently the burdens that they are casually flinging on to many small firms that are trying to earn a living in a competitive market. The Bill and all the regulations are a nuisance. They understand the need for it, but it is a nuisance nevertheless.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Nigel Beard </B>(Bexleyheath and Crayford): Would not the amendment confer immunity on wrongdoers if they could get away with it for more than six years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> There is a statute of limitation. I am trying to catch the eye of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire. He might illuminate the Committee about that in due course. Crimes have a limit and the statute law is prevented from going back beyond a certain time. I am not sure of the exact time limit but, in principle, when a time limit has passed it is recognised by the legal system that a person cannot be brought before the courts. That principle already exists in law. A balance must be struck. One wants to go back some time, but there is no time limit in the Bill. The Minister ought to address that.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend about the burden on small firms. For larger firms, however, the sheer volume of documentation is enormous. Might it not be relevant to know how long and where the Government keep such archiving, and how long and where the FSA proposes to keep such documentation?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I agree. Many year ago when I was qualifying, I worked as an auditor and I recall that, on making an innocent inquiry about what had happened to a transaction, the chief clerk or accountant would often say, ``Right, lad, they're in there,'' and show me into a room full of dusty boxes containing documents in various orders.
<P>
Enormous quantities of information are generated by quite modest businesses, so there is an entire industry built around the storage of documents for larger firms. If businesses are required to keep the documents beyond a reasonable time, it is another burden for them to bear. We think that six years might be reasonable.
<P>
The clause is another example of where something quite casually thrown into a Bill can result in a consequential burden that the Treasury should at least endeavour to quantify.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that what is a burden on a business in this context must necessarily carry through to be a cost on the consumer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> That point needs constant repetition. If we increase the burden on firms, they will pass the costs on to the consumer in so far as they can. That will make savings products more expensive. If we want to create a savings habit and culture in this country, it is not clever to increase the cost of saving and savings products in that way. If firms cannot pass on the costs, they are open to foreign competition from firms that do not have them, so we lose out in another way. The matter is serious.
<P>
The Government have helpfully and rightly decided elsewhere the importance of cost compliance assessments and estimating the cost of regulation. I suggest that a study should be made of the potential cost of requiring firms and independent financial advisers to keep documents beyond what we consider to be a reasonable time. That might be an interesting calculation. If it cannot be done now, perhaps it could be returned to in due course.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I want to ask the Minister for some clarification, following on from my right hon. Friends' comments. The clause refers to ``documents'', and I wonder what that means. Does it purely mean the hard copy of documents? From my own experience in fund management, I know that there are already significant requirements, even for keeping booking slips—simply receipts for the purchase or sale of shares—for many years. That takes up enormous space. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) said, archiving is a whole industry. One can buy shares in companies the raison d'etre of which is to make money by archiving documents for financial services companies, which is a vicious circle.
<P>
Does ``documents'' refer to electronically held documents in place of hard copy? That would make it slightly easier in terms of space, but is also expensive. Many firms have transferred to use of Lotus notes or other forms of electronic referral to letters, although, under current legislation they are also required to keep the hard copy. So firms pay twice. They pay to upgrade their systems electronically so that they can easily access the information if they need to return to it or if the regulator requires them, through the various regulations, to do so, but for a full-blown investigation they will also have to go to the warehouse and find the hard-copy documents.
<P>
Will the Minister clarify whether he requires firms to hold hard copy documents for more than six years, above and beyond electronic documents that are facsimiled on to computer systems? At the moment, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, hard copy must still be kept in dusty boxes in warehouses somewhere. That seems excessive, in the electronic age that the Government claim that they want to promote.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> To return to the Minister's comment on amendment No. 484, it does not do what he suggested—that one has to wait for something terrible to happen before information can be requested. The amendment provides only that the FSA should have a reasonable suspicion that there has been a contravention. Subsection (4) is capable of extremely wide interpretation, enabling people to go on fishing expeditions for anything that might emerge under the Bill and to seek information that might relate to it. Before agreeing to withdraw the amendment, we would want the Minister's confirmation that the intention of subsection (4) is to give the FSA the power to act where it suspects that there have been contraventions and not to be used for fishing expeditions.
<P>
On amendments Nos. 485 and 487, my right hon. and hon. Friends made winning arguments. I add only that I would have thought that the Government and the FSA would have learnt the lessons from phase two of the pensions inquiry, which has resulted in many cases of injustice towards smaller independent financial advisers, who simply do not have the records from that far back. People must have clear knowledge of how long to keep records, both in hard copy and electronically; we chose the period of six years, based on the audit requirement. Secondly, there is a statute of limitations point, on which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire might give us some guidance. How far would it be reasonable to go back in regard to matters that could ultimately have a criminal sanction? To leave it hanging in mid-air is unsatisfactory and inoperable for all parties.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I shall be brief because I do not like to intervene twice. There is no limitation period on criminal offences unless the statute provides for one. In most matters, for example motoring offences, statute provides that prosecutions shall take place within a certain period. My understanding is that more serious criminal offences are backed by criminal powers; I asked the Minister to clarify that. There is no statute of limitations on more serious criminal offences. As my right hon. and hon. Friends have said, the proposal is that there be a six-year cut-off period, to tally with the normal audit periods and the statute of limitations in relation to civil proceedings. People who want to sue on a contract or bring other civil proceedings, will be prevented from doing so by the statute of limitations, as amended over the years, once six years has elapsed—unless there has been some sort of concealed fraud or unless the courts grant leave, in which case the time limit will start again.
<P>
In general, businesses are not expected to keep records for more than six years. The question is whether those requirements that can be criminally enforced should be allowed to be enforced for more than six years. That is what our amendments seek to tease out: those are the questions to which we seek answers. It would help the Committee if the Minister were to clarify the limitation period for both civil and criminal matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Right hon. and hon. Members have recognised the clear need to be able to seek information from people who were previously authorised. I hope that I can persuade the Opposition that what we propose is not unduly onerous.
<P>
At the outset of this short debate, the right hon. Member for Wells asked about the sanction. As he said, it is potentially a criminal matter under clause 147, but we plan to change that to contempt of court with amendment No. 558. Once that amendment has been made, there will be no sanction if a firm has acted reasonably; having a reasonable excuse will be a defence. That rather changes the climate of our debate, which I hope is helpful.
<P>
The keeping of documents will be a matter for the FSA, under its general rule-making power. The obligations on authorised persons will be made clear from the outset—from when a firm is authorised. In answer to the right hon. Member for Wells, I do not envisage a requirement being imposed on firms to keep documents for more than six years. If the information is not available, that fact can be taken into account by the courts. The FSA will not be able to require what legitimately does not exist.
<P>
I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs that there is no sanction for fishing expeditions. Subsection (4) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``information and documents reasonably required in connection with the exercise by the Authority of functions conferred on it by or under this Act''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The FSA does not have that wide latitude to embark on fishing expeditions—nor would it wish to do so.

<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Tyrie </B>(Chichester): I apologise for taking the Minister back to what he said a moment ago. I quickly wrote down what he said. He did not expect a requirement to be imposed on firms to keep documents for more than six years. That is welcome news to the Opposition—it is close to what we seek—but do the Government intend to include that provision in the Bill for the sake of greater clarity? If so, will they table an amendment to that effect on Report?

<P>

<B>Mr. Timms:</B> As I have said, such a matter is for the FSA rules. It is not one that we expect to deal with under the Bill. However, I understand that the FSA will be carrying that out.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Does the word ``function'' include general duties, one of which is the reduction of financial crime under clause 2? Can it be argued that any trawl through the documents of any firm is justified with the aim of reducing financial crime? What is the qualification or restriction imposed by subsection 4?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The circumstances in which information can be stored are set out clearly in the Bill. We must not make it difficult for the FSA or even prevent it from keeping a vigilant eye on what is happening and obtaining reports to ensure that serious problems of the sort with which we are all too familiar are not brewing in financial services. We have struck that balance under the Bill. The FSA needs to require information reasonably and the clause is an adequate safeguard, given that we do not want to impede legitimate monitoring exercises and ensure that no problems on are on the horizon.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I apologise for returning to the six-year requirement. The Minister made two statements, one of which I strongly agree with and one of which I do not. He said that the six-year requirement was a good idea, but that it should be left to the FSA rules to determine. We are concerned that the FSA may start with that requirement, but change it subsequently. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the FSA from imposing a longer requirement. Will the Minister deal with that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> There is no need for such a provision. The FSA will not be imposing unnecessary requirements in that or any other element of its rule-making activities. I will come back specifically to the six-year requirement when dealing with the other points that have been made.
<P>
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Mr. Loughton) asked what was meant by the term ``document''. It is defined under clause 352, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`` `documents' includes information recorded in any form and, in relation to information recorded otherwise than in legible form, references to its production include references to producing a copy of the information in legible form''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
So the term does apply to electronic documents provided that they can be converted into legible form, which means that the authority is not requiring hard copy to be held as long as the electronic version can be produced in such a form when it is required. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that I have now dealt with all the points raised by Opposition Members.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Will the Minister clarify his last sentence? Am I not right in thinking that if any hard copies have been produced, the Bill requires copies of them to be kept? If they are in hard copy only, they must be kept only in that form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> The question that I understood the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham to be asking was whether there was a requirement to keep hard copy versions of documents in electronic form. I said no. As long as it is possible to produce them in hard copy form when requested, there is no need to go into the dusty warehouses full of documents to which the right hon. Member for Wells referred.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> We do not want to have endless warehouses cluttered with masses of documents, as the Government have somewhere on the way to Croydon—is it Colindale? If the material is in electronic form, it can be kept in that form, but if it is in hard form only, it must be kept in hard form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Clearly, there are many circumstances in which documents need to be kept. We are not imposing an onerous requirement. The FSA rules will be more explicit about that requirement in due course. If I understood the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs rightly, he said that IFAs had lost out because they did not keep documents. It is not simply a matter of the convenience of the FSA that documents need to be kept; it is in the interests of the organisations as well.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I think that we are in agreement, but I want to confirm something. Let us say that a contract is produced by a financial services firm and that it is a hard copy document which goes to the client. If it is replicated electronically either because it has been electronically produced and the record is kept on the computer system, or because it is scanned into electronic notes, there is no duty on the firm to keep the hard copy. It can be thrown away on the same day, and only the electronic image will suffice. Is that the case?
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> Yes, it is. I can endorse that point fully. If something is held only in hard copy, it needs to be kept as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are still not entirely clear as to the Government's stance. We would be happy not to press amendments Nos. 485 and 487 if the Government are saying that although the FSA will have the power, six years is reasonable and that is what they will say in discussions with the FSA. The Minister seems to be saying that on the one hand, but steps back from saying it on the other. If he will make the position absolutely clear, we can do the same.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the word ``functions'' in subsection (4) permits a fishing expedition. The Minister has given us comfort that it will not used as a power for fishing expeditions, but he has not given us comfort that the intention of the power is to do with the FSA having reasonable suspicions about contraventions on which it needs to gather information. Subject to his confirmation that that is the intent, we shall not press amendment No. 484.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am not sure that I can give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he seeks. Clearly, the FSA is well aware of the use of the six-year limit in circumstances where that applies currently. It is a matter for the FSA to decide how its rules are drawn up, and I do not want to raise the hon. Gentleman's hopes at this stage about how the power will be used.
<P>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, we want the FSA to keep an eye on what is happening in the market generally to ensure that everything is proceeding satisfactorily. I would not want to give the hon. Gentleman the impression that it will do nothing unless it believes that a contravention has taken place. It must also fulfil a monitoring role. I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman most of the assurances for which he asked, even if I cannot go as far as he invited me to go.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I fear that the Financial Secretary has contradicted some of what we thought we heard. We therefore feel that the amendment should be pressed to a Division.

<P>
As I mentioned in previous debates on amendments to the clause, the power to require information and documents applies to connected persons. That power is necessary to ensure that the FSA can investigate the affairs of people who are closely connected to authorised persons.
<P>
Subsection (11) and schedule 12 bring within the ambit of the information-gathering power various people who are connected to the authorised person in ways that mean that their affairs may have a bearing on those of the authorised person. That covers shareholder controllers, members of the same corporate group, officers, managers, employees and other members of the same mutual association or partnership. The existing legislation contains similar provisions, such as section 104(9) of the Financial Services Act 1986, and subsections (6) and (7) of section 39 of the Banking Act 1987.
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to correct the drafting of subsection (11)(c), which applies where an authorised person is a member of a partnership. At present under the subsection, the FSA will be allowed to obtain information from the partnership. However, the FSA will need to obtain information not from the partnership as such but from the other members of it. The amendment will correct that small point.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> Clause 136 will lay down the reports for which the FSA can call and will give it the power to require authorised persons or formally authorised persons—at their expense, we presume—to commission and procure such written reports. We assume that those who will write such reports are likely to be professionals, such as accountants. The FSA can also require such reports from those who carry on a connected business—for example, in the same group. Subsection (4) will impose the obligation to co-operate on any expert associated with the group.
<P>
Although amendment No. 406 has not been selected for debate, I should say that there is a need to clarify who should do what. It should be clear that the person asked to report should not be the person asked to write the report.
<P>
Amendment No. 488 deals with what it is reasonable to require of people, such as lawyers, accountants, and actuaries, who have provided services to the person named in the notice. Amendment No. 489 would consequentially add a new subsection (7) to afford reasonable protection to those who have provided the service.
<P>
Subsection (5) states that it will be the duty of any person who provides services to a person to whom a notice has been given under clause 136 to give the person appointed to provide the report referred to in clause 136 all such assistance as he may reasonably require. A wide range of people could provide services under clause 136(2). I have mentioned three providers, but bankers could also be involved. The requirement on such people to provide all such assistance as the person who prepares the report may reasonably require is too wide. The amendment would limit that requirement to the provision of relevant information and documents.
<P>
Amendment No. 489 would make it clear that those persons would not breach their duties to their clients by complying with the obligation imposed under subsection (5).
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> The FSA may often require detailed information about a firm, which can be provided only by a skilled person, such as an accountant, actuary or computer expert. The clause carries forward the very useful powers under section 139 of the Banking Act 1987. It enables the FSA to require an authorised person to provide it with a report written by a person with the relevant skills whom it has appointed or approved.
<P>
On the basis of the power in the Banking Act, the bank and then the FSA developed the system of reporting accountants and section 39 reports, which has become a cornerstone of banking supervision over the years. The report can be on any matter about which the FSA can request information under clause 135. As with information that is requested under that clause, a report that is required under clause 136 must be reasonably required in connection with the discharge of the FSA's functions.
<P>
Subsection (5) imposes a duty on any person providing, for example, accountancy services, to a person whom the FSA requires under the clause to have a report prepared. That duty is to give the person who does the report such assistance as he may reasonably require.
<P>
Amendment No. 488 would narrow the assistance that may be required to the provision of information and documents. I see no reason for narrowing the duty in that way, although I appreciate that Opposition Members might want to discover what other assistance might be required under the provision. I regret that it is not possible to be comprehensive. Different circumstances can mean that different forms of practical assistance are required. For example, the person doing the report might need assistance in using the authorised person's computer systems. The important point is that the duty is limited to such assistance as the person doing the report may reasonably require.
<P>
Amendment No. 489 is closely connected to that point. I sympathise fully with Opposition Members' wish to ensure that a person who is required to give assistance under subsection (5) cannot be sued for a breach of fiduciary duty or other obligation as a result. That is clearly right. Arguably, an explicit provision is unnecessary because the statutory duty imposed by subsection (5) should automatically override any contractual or fiduciary obligation of confidence. However, we have sought to make the position explicit in relation to information that an auditor or actuary gives the FSA under clause 299. I am happy to give Opposition Members an undertaking to consider amendment No. 489 further. However, if the amendments are pressed to a vote, I will ask my hon. Friends to oppose them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are grateful for the Minister's comments and for her undertaking on amendment No. 489. Amendment No. 488, however, involves an important issue. Section 39 investigations are extremely costly. When one deals with outside professionals and goes beyond the documentation to which we have referred, there is the issue of who will pay, and the firm can incur a substantial expense. The Minister said that she was unwilling to give any undertaking to limit the extent to which outside parties can be embroiled in such matters. That would be perfectly reasonable where criminal investigations were under way. However, it would be unreasonable where investigations were little more than fishing expeditions, and I have had experience of a section 39 investigation that was purely a fishing expedition.
<P>
The issue is not big enough to put to a vote, and the arrangements already exist in practice. However, the Government should note that the provision represents yet another burden and that the Bill is widening section 39 investigation powers, which presently apply to banking groups, to the whole financial services industry. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> I should like to raise a couple of points. The Minister rightly said that the clause is based on section 39 of the Banking Act 1987, but he is now seeking to extend it across the entire financial services industry. It is a vast extension of an existing power, which may or may not have worked successfully and, as my hon. Friends have said, may have resulted in numerous ubiquitous fishing expeditions.
<P>
Given the supervisory weight placed on the reports and the sensitivity of the issues—we should also remember, as my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned, that the reports are commissioned, paid for and remain the property of the banks under section 39—it is important that section 136 reports remain fully privileged and protected from disclosure outside the FSA or the relevant firm, unless consent has been given by both parties.
<P>
Most of us acknowledge the need for privileged information to pass between supervisors, but we are concerned that privilege remains fully protected. It is the responsibility of the FSA to decide what information is switched with overseas supervisors. Will the Minister give a clear undertaking that section 136 reports will be at least as watertight in respect of privilege and confidentiality as section 39 reports have been under the Banking Act—or preferably better? We are not talking about a small extension of practice under the Banking Act, but a massive extension to a vast raft of additional firms. I am surprised that protection of privilege did not feature in the Minister's responses to the amendments.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I follow my hon. Friend in seeking further clarification and pointing to potential dangers. As we saw with pension mis-selling, a great head of steam can develop—sometimes fully justified, sometimes only partly and sometimes not at all—in connection with matters that could give rise to commercial dispute leading to civil litigation. Influential people in the city may bring pressure on the FSA to investigate scams, scandal, unfairness or hardship to consumers: and reports may be called for. They may also be prompted by people with a commercial interest in finding out information about their competitors, against whom they may be contemplating litigation. Such people may hope to profit in future litigation by gaining access to the reports or the documentation on which they are based. Prima facie, unless they are expressly privileged, they are likely to be called on in civil litigation. That problem will emerge in several clauses in part X, which we shall debate in the next day or two. We must achieve a sensible balance between requirements enabling the FSA to do its job and legal rights and privileges for authorised persons—who are players in the market—and their advisers.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I shall make similar points on subsequent clauses. If one is too demanding about what is not effectively protected by privilege in the legal sense—privilege from production in subsequent court proceedings—a great deal of time and energy may be involved. Unless one is careful, that will lead to greatly reduced production of documents and a culture of secrecy and verbal communication that is not conducive to the good conduct of business.
<P>
Governments of all complexions have had to tackle that argument, and it is perfectly obviously that the present Government have been considering it carefully in relation to freedom of information legislation. As those in American government discovered, making everything available—desirable as that is, on the face of it—tends to force discussions underground, so that they go unrecorded and prevent documentation from being produced.
<P>
Our advisers—who come from experienced City firms of solicitors—have warned us about that in detail. They have sent carefully reasoned documents to the Treasury, pointing up the dangers in that area. We are about to consider voting for Clause 136 to become law. However, that clause highlights the significant dangers that I have just mentioned. Will the Minister give a brief preliminary statement about how the Government will get the balance right in that area?

<P>

<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised a couple of matters, with which I shall deal before addressing those raised by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire.
<P>
The expansion of section 39 of the Banking Act 1987 was mentioned. Power in clause 136 is based on section 39, but there are similar powers in other Acts; for example, section 108 of the Financial Services Act 1986, which provides power to require a second audit, and section 42 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982, which enables the Financial Services Authority to require long-term insurance companies to produce an actuarial report. Therefore, clause 136 replaces several existing provisions, not just section 39 of the Banking Act. As I said earlier, such power must be exercised reasonably and proportionately.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members mentioned privilege and protection for privileged information. Privileged information cannot be required under any power in this part of the Bill. As noted, we shall address privilege later, especially in relation to Opposition amendments to clause 145. Confidentiality is dealt with in part XXI of the Bill. I assure hon. Members that that will fully meet the requirements of the directives and existing legislation.
<P>
Clause 145(4) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``No person may be required under this Part to produce or disclose a privileged communication.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That term is defined in clause 360.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I may be anticipating the Minister, but does she appreciate that there is an important distinction between a privileged communication—for example, an authorised person taking advice from lawyers would be privileged, at least if he was taking advice in the context of contentious business—and a separate privilege which will not without statutory provision apply to a confidential report supplied by an authorised person or his bankers or advisers pursuant to the clause. Does the hon. Lady understand that distinction?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Perhaps we are getting into detailed technical territory. It may be better if I drop the right hon. and learned Gentleman a note because I am not clear about what he said. As this is on the record, perhaps he would like to say something more.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Of course I could not see the frown on the face of the spiritual adviser because we cannot see these things. It is important to realise that there is a distinction between privilege, which arises in courts in respect of legal advice, for example, and privilege which does not arise in relation to the reports that can be called for under the clause. This is causing a great deal of worry. I am grateful to the Minister for offering to drop me a line. May I have it within, say, five days? The hon. Lady has offered to drop me several lines and I have not received one.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I hope that sooner or later we might even debate how many spiritual advisers one might get onto the head of a pin following that rather nice point made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. It was good of him to notice frowns on the faces of those whom he cannot even see. I thank him for that. On the point that he raises, one or two matters on which he asked questions are currently in the hands of the Lord Chancellor's Department, where they are being dealt with in detail. They are not yet emerging. I cannot give any assurances about anything that goes there but we shall do our best to give the right hon. and learned Gentleman a speedy reply.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 136 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 137</center></H4>
<H4><center>Appointment of persons to carry out general investigations</center></H4>

<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 490, in page 64, line 32, after `so', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`in connection with the exercise by the Authority of a function conferred on it by or under this Act or contemplated proceedings for an offence under this Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause deals with the appointment of investigators. Our amendment would lay down certain conditions and restrictions. At present, the FSA or the Secretary of State may appoint investigators into the affairs of authorised persons if it appears that there is good reason for doing so. My first question to the Minister is, why is the Secretary of State involved? It seems odd that the Government wish to become involved separately from the authority. More profoundly, subsection (1) seems not to restrict either the FSA or the Secretary of State in any meaningful way. It will be difficult for anyone to challenge the fact that it appears to the Secretary of State that there is good reason to do that. It requires a challenger to get into the mind of the Secretary of State, who will always be able to claim that it does appear to him and his advisers that there is good reason for his involvement. There is no objective test here. The amendment tightens up the provision and requires the exercise of the power to appoint an inspection to be carried out in pursuance of a function conferred on the authority under the Bill or in connection with contemplated proceedings for an offence under the Bill.
<P>
Frankly, if I were being even stricter, I would suggest leaving out the reference to a ``function conferred on it'' because, as we observed earlier, the clause is pretty widely drawn. We took the wording from clause 135(4) as there could be no objections to using a phrase that is already used in the Bill in another context. It is a little more precise as it refers to a specific rather than a generality of functions although I am still concerned that ``functions'' is so widely drawn that it could refer to the very objectives of the Bill which include maintaining market confidence, promoting public awareness, reducing financial crime and protecting consumers.
<P>
As we have often said, the powers and duties of the FSA are so wide that referring to them hardly restricts them at all. Nevertheless, our amendment is an improvement on the simple reference to a good reason for it in the view of the Secretary of State or the authority. In particular, our second suggestion that it should be only when proceedings for an offence are contemplated, is a good restriction. I should like to hear the Minister's reasons for not accepting that.
<P>
The clause is pretty onerous on a firm or an individual, particularly, as subsection (5) allows the inspector to look into parts of the business that go outside regulated activities. Again that is an extremely wide extension. It means that either the authorised person or his associate or partner could be investigated for conducting business outside the regulated activities. Pretty well everything is drawn in here. This is another clause where wide powers are granted on a purely discretionary basis to the authority or the Secretary of State. Our amendment may not be perfect, but it goes some way towards defining and restricting those powers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> May I follow my right hon. Friend's comments by asking the Government what they intend by the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``good reason for doing so''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
There could be all manner of good reasons. Do they intend that it should be in the light of suspicion that an offence has been committed under the Bill or under the powers that the Bill confers on the FSA, or will it be much wider than that? If they intend that it is where the FSA considers that offences may be committed, they should say so. If it is much wider than that then we object to it.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> Obviously, this is a discussion about the investigation powers. As with the powers that we have already discussed, effective investigation powers are critical to maintaining the UK's reputation for well-regulated markets and a sound financial services industry. That must be strongly emphasised. However, we must balance the need for effectiveness with the need for fairness and transparency.
<P>
There are three separate investigation powers. First, there is a general power to investigate the business of an authorised person or an appointed representative on the grounds that the FSA or the Secretary of State believes there are good reasons for doing so. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs mentioned that. That supplements the powers under the previous two clauses by enabling the FSA to conduct particular investigations into the affairs of those whom it regulates, along the lines of the power it has over banks under section 41 of the Banking Act 1987.
<P>
Secondly, there is a power under the following clause to investigate any person whom the FSA or Secretary of State suspects may have contravened a particular requirement or committed a particular offence. Thirdly, there is a power under clause 139 for the FSA to investigate matters on behalf of overseas regulators.
<P>
The extent of the investigators' powers differs according to how specific are the grounds for the investigation. As I think that I have already explained, the more specific the grounds, the more constrained are the matters into which the investigators can inquire. Because of that, it is reasonable to impose less stringent constraints on the range of persons who may be required to answer questions.
<P>
The general power under this clause rightly comes between the information-gathering powers and the more specific contravention-investigating powers. Like the powers under clauses 135 and 136, that is an essentially supervisory, information-gathering power. It can be used to initiate investigations into the business of persons who are either currently, or have at some time been, authorised persons or appointed representatives. It can also be used to look into an authorised person's ownership or control. If a person is no longer authorised or an appointed representative, the investigation can only be into their business at the time when they were authorised persons or appointed representatives.
<P>
The ability to look into the business affairs of an authorised person or appointed representative is deliberately not restricted to that part of the business which consists of regulated activities. It is essential that the whole business that they undertake may be investigated, as it clearly could have a bearing on the way in which the regulated activities are carried out, or the financial strength or fitness and properness of the authorised person.
<P>
I now turn to amendment No. 490. I am not completely clear about the aim behind that amendment, but I entirely agree that the powers must be exercised by the FSA for reasons connected with its functions under the Bill. However, that is achieved by the text as it stands and is implicit in the ``good reason'' test. How else could that be interpreted by the courts? On that basis, the amendment is simply unnecessary.
<P>
However, not only the FSA is involved here. Those powers, like the existing power under section 105 of the Financial Services Act 1986, can be exercised by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, for example. That power was transferred to the FSA in 1987, but it was also retained by the Secretary of State, who can exercise it concurrently with the FSA. The section 105 powers were not transferred to the Treasury in 1992, so we intend merely to reproduce the current position in the clause.
<P>
Those powers are not generally exercised by the Secretary of State, but it is important that they exist as reserve powers. That reflects not only the Secretary of State's wider responsibilities for company law, but the fact that the Department of Trade and Industry has relevant expertise in the conduct of detailed investigations.
<P>
Having the powers held jointly is useful because what may initially appear to be an investigation under the Companies Acts may turn out to concern financial services issues dealt with under the Bill, including market abuse or insider dealing. Equally, an inquiry might involve a financial services company among other non-financial services companies.
<P>
In either case, it is helpful to be able to continue investigations once started, even if their precise character may change over time. The fact that the Secretary of State holds these powers jointly also means that if there were a potential conflict of interest in the FSA conducting an investigation, the DTI could take it on instead. It is right that the reserved powers rest with the Secretary of State rather than the Treasury, as that is where the investigatory expertise lies.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I simply want some clarification. Does ``the Secretary of State'' mean only the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry or any Secretary of State?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I can clarify that it means any Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It might be helpful if, in reply to the debate, the Minister answered our questions. It might also be a courtesy if, instead of reading out her prepared brief, she listened if she was unclear about the purpose of our amendment. My hon. Friends and I took some trouble to explain why we tabled the amendment, and we want a genuine debate. I realise that she has probably had her handwritten response to our points only recently, but we shall not make much progress unless she actually tries to answer our questions.
<P>
We are grateful that the Minister explained why the Secretary of State is involved, and we understand that. However, she did not comment on the points we raised about whether the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it appears to . . . the Secretary of State . . . that there is good reason''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
was any restriction. To us, it seems completely subjective. I repeat that our amendment is intended to restrict matters to those
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in connection with the exercise by the Authority of a function conferred on it . . . under this Act''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
—so we return to its powers and responsibilities under the Bill—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``or contemplated proceedings for an offence under this Act.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That again gives a point to the investigators and defines more closely the wide discretionary powers on the authority, which the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State . . . that there is good reason''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
does not. Will she concede that it really gives complete carte blanche to the authority or the Secretary of State to appoint investigators in practically any eventuality?
<P>
The Minister referred to the courts interpreting the legislation. All Acts of Parliament and Ministers' actions are of course subject to law, but does she really expect firms to go to the law and get judicial review for such decisions? That would be extraordinarily clumsy and expensive. The Committee's duty is to do its job on behalf of the people that we represent, which hardly involves expecting them to go through that hoop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I thank my right hon. Friend. An analogous example was a section 39 investigation that resulted from someone who had been sacked for not doing his job properly and then wrote a libellous letter to the FSA or, as it was then, the Securities and Investments Board. The SIB decided to take that seriously, did not make adequate background inquiries and put the business to all the expense and trouble of a section 39 investigation. To my mind, that is a classic example of powers being too wide on such matters.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> As my right hon. Friend said, the key words that stimulated our amendment open clause 137(1) and read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State (``the investigating authority'') that there is good reason for doing so''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What room does that leave for a supervisory function by the courts under judicial review? Does it leave any room for a supervisory function other than in circumstances of bad faith? To what extent can the courts question whether there appeared to the authority or the Secretary of State to be a good reason for starting an investigation or for appointing someone to conduct an investigation?
<P>
There is a strong suspicion—in fact, that understates the case—there is a belief in legal circles and, in so far as the Bill is understood, a fear in the City that the Bill is being drafted to be judicial review proof. It is designed to limit as far as possible the supervisory functions of the courts and to give as far as possible unfettered powers to the authority and, in this case, to the Secretary of State—which, as the Economic Secretary has just confirmed, means any Secretary of State. The Economic Secretary will have recognised when she obtained that confirmation what I meant by the spiritual guidance to which she frequently looks and which we cannot see.
<P>
This is a serious point. Why could the clause not be redrafted to state, for example:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Authority or the Secretary of State may, if there are reasonable grounds to do so, appoint an investigator''?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What distinction does the Economic Secretary make between that suggestion and the words in the clause? How does she justify that in the context of the words of the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I should like clarification from the Economic Secretary on a related point that I may have merely misunderstood. The Bill states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and describes them as ``the investigating authority'', as though they were a unified authority. In deciding whether to conduct an investigation, is a duty placed on the authority to discuss with the Secretary of State or on the Secretary of State to discuss with the authority before proceeding to establish whether there is good reason for an investigation? If so, might the current wording result in circumstances in which the authority feels that there is good reason for an investigation but the Secretary of State does not, but nevertheless an investigation proceeds? Should the Bill not read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority and the Secretary of State'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
rather than
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the Authority or the Secretary of State''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when a Secretary of State is involved?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> In fact, I had not quite finished, but I thought that the right hon. Member for Wells wanted to intervene. He signalled that he wanted to rise, so I allowed him to make some comments. He alleges that I did not listen to what he said, but I allege that he did not listen to what I said, so that evens it up slightly. I have already pointed out—as he mentioned later, and admitted that I had said as much—that the FSA must exercise its powers in a way that is connected to its functions under the Bill, and the good reason test will be set in that context.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> If that is so, the Economic Secretary can accept our amendment. All we want to do is to make that clear in the Bill. It is no good her asserting such things when they are not specified in the Bill. Where does the clause spell out what she has just said?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows full well, what I say in Committee as a Minister greatly affects how the Bill will be interpreted. Many things are said in Committee that are not included in the Bill—
<P>
<B>Mr. Loughton:</B> Says who?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The hon. Gentleman asks, from a seated position, who says so. So says tradition and practice. Much of the interpretation of many Bills relates to what is said in Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Is the hon. Lady seriously asserting that Pepper v. Hart has the same force in law as primary legislation? That is an amazing extension of constitutional law, and we shall want to return to it. Will the hon. Lady confirm that she genuinely means what she just said?
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am not saying what the right hon. Gentleman has just said. I am merely pointing out that by tradition what Ministers say in Committee has explanatory force in terms of what is included in the Bill. Hon. Gentlemen are well aware that when I give assurances about the Bill, they have a weight which they would not have were they not taking place as part of the proceedings of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Is the Minister aware that what she says in Committee has no effect by tradition whatsoever? Indeed, by tradition, the courts could not even look at it. In so far as it has effect, it does so as a result of the ruling of the House of Lords in Pepper v. Hart.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows full well the tradition to which I am referring.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> What tradition? Does she mean that a ruling of the House of Lords is a tradition?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I am going to move on, as we are not making any progress on the issues raised in this morning's debate.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells asked about investigation into unregulated activity. In order thoroughly to investigate the affairs of an authorised firm, the FSA must have a regulatory power of investigation to cover the whole business. The power enables the FSA to investigate whether qualifying conditions are met, resources are adequate to meet financial commitments and all is fit and proper.
<P>
I had better say more about the circumstances under which the Secretary of State has powers under the Bill. I thought that I had explained it, but Opposition Members seem uncertain. First, Companies Act investigations could turn out to involve financial services issues, including market abuse or insider dealing, dealt with in the Bill. Equally, an inquiry could involve a financial services company among other non-financial services companies, and the Secretary of State could have powers to conclude any investigation that he had started. That might be more appropriate than handing over certain aspects of the investigation to the FSA. In some circumstances, it makes better sense for the Secretary of State to continue dealing with the matter. The Secretary of State might have particular expertise in certain cases and would be better placed to deal with them where there is a potential conflict of interest. Those are the unusual circumstances in which the Secretary of State might exercise powers. As I said earlier, we are trying to continue an existing arrangement, not to change fundamentally the existing position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I want to answer the points put to me, particularly by the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire. Otherwise, we will have points on points on points and hon. Gentlemen will complain that I am not answering them.
<P>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the supervisory function of the court. The test on judicial review will be the usual test of whether a reasonable regulator could have formed a view that circumstances suggested that certain events had happened. The court could not substitute its own view of the fact for the view of the body, which has the expertise and experience to make the judgment.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Does that mean that the Secretary of State must have reasonable grounds for appointing an investigation?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I believe so.
<P>
The FSA is subject to judicial review in the exercise of all its functions under the Bill. It is also subject to the jurisdiction of the tribunal where it exercises enforcement powers, for example, and to the courts, under the Human Rights Act 1998 and in actions of alleged bad faith. So there are several different judicial claims over the FSA.
<P>
On the points made by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie), the Secretary of State and the FSA are not treated as one; ``investigating authority'' refers to whichever is exercising the powers, which is why the clause states ``the Authority or the Secretary of State''. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the FSA and the DTI are in discussion to establish clear understanding about how they will exercise the powers that they hold concurrently.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. She answered all the points that I raised, except one: when the Secretary of State is acting as the investigating authority in cases in which the FSA has been involved, will he or she have a duty to consult it to establish whether there is good reason for going ahead with the investigation?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall come back to that in a moment, after dealing with the point made by the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire. There is no point in trying to find substitute words for those that we have already carefully chosen. We have used a formulation found elsewhere in legislation, without giving rise to any problems. Paraphrasing could rise to a form of words that creates problems.
<P>
I shall write to the hon. Member for Chichester on his last point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I find the Minister's response deeply depressing and worrying. We are dealing with a serious point. We want to know whether the Secretary of State or the authority can be challenged judicially. My right hon. Friend put it much more eloquently than I could; because of the way the clause is written, the discretion of the authority or the Secretary of State seems limitless and purely subjective. Because the authority and the Secretary of State have only to show that it appeared to them at the time that they had a good reason, they are in practice immune from effective judicial challenge. The Minister confirmed that by saying that a court could not substitute its judgment for that of the authority. However, in response to a direct challenge by my right hon. and learned Friend on whether the authority or the Secretary of State must have reasonable grounds for appointing an inspector, the hon. Lady said that she thought so. She had said earlier that that her comment had the force of primary law [Interruption<P>
]—I apologise, she said that she believed, as distinct from thinking, that it did. According to the Minister's newly developed theory of where we look to our laws, her comment has the force of law. From now on we look for our liberties by what Ministers say in Committee, as obiter dicta, rather than what is written in primary legislation. That is a terrifying doctrine; Henry VIII would have been very envious of the Minister.
<P>
The Minister owes us an explanation. We seek some objectivity in the exercise of those powers so that someone somewhere can challenge the Minister or the authority if they appoint inspectors unreasonably. It is unsatisfactory that a court apparently cannot substitute its judgment for that of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> Surely the Minister's response was correct. A judicial review could determine whether there was a good reason for doing something. Such a review is not excluded The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire spoke about reasonable grounds, but what is the difference between reasonable grounds and a good reason? That is surely a quibble.
<P>
As regards the openness of the investigation, clause 137(1)(a) refers to an investigation into
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the nature, conduct or state of the business of an authorised person or of an appointed representative''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The provision can be limited to the business of an authorised person or widened to include not just his regulated activities, but his unregulated activities. That point is recognised in several different parts of the Bill. We cannot consider an authorised person's regulated business on its own, because it impinges on his unregulated activities The measure is not as wide ranging as the right hon. Member for Wells makes out. The provision could just as well be part of the judicial review—
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. This is an intervention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It was an interesting intervention. There is probably a new doctrine to the effect that Back Benchers' comments also have the force of law in some circuitous way. The hon. Gentleman was helping the Minister to develop her theory and her belief that the authority must have reasonable grounds. Perhaps she is trying to bolster that view and assert that the authority really must have reasonable grounds, which can be objectively assessed.
<P>
However, the hon. Gentleman then strayed on to the more general and interesting issue of what the investigators could do once they were appointed. I did indeed raise the issue of whether it was right for them to carry out investigations into unregulated activities.
<P>
However, we are not debating what they should investigate, but whether it is right for them to be appointed in the first place, the circumstances in which they should be appointed and the checks and restraints on any decision. We have still not quite achieved a definition of the law, and apparently none will be written into the Bill. We therefore require a more definite statement of the law than the Minister's statement about what she believed to be the case.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's comments thus far, but clarity is important. I asked whether the authority or the Secretary of State would need to have reasonable grounds to appoint an inspector, and the Minister said that she believed so. The hon. Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr. Beard) said that he thought that that was right, and the general feeling will be that it is. However, notes were passed, and the Minister read something from one of them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> My intervention was intended to make it clear that I see no distinction between reasonable grounds and a good reason. The latter is already the basis on which the investigators will be appointed.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> As I understand the hon. Gentleman, he thinks that there should be a good reason for appointing investigators and that they should not be appointed without one.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> That is what the Bill says.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> If that was what the Bill meant, we would be satisfied. However, there are some weasel words in the clause. They are:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State . . . that there is good reason''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The wording is not ``if there is good reason''. The Minister was handed a piece of paper and read out words to the effect that ``it is unhelpful to paraphrase.'' That happened because those who guide and advise her are worried that she will sell the pass on this matter.
<P>
We are trying to decide whether the courts should have effective supervision over the draconian power before us—and it is draconian, whether or not it exists at the moment. If an investigator is appointed, word will get around, the business to be investigated will be in danger of falling into disrepute and its market position will be affected. Consequently, it will require there to be great responsibility before an investigator is appointed.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Looking at is objectively—it is the duty of the House of Commons to scrutinise legislation—we must consider carefully whether it is good enough to give powers to the Secretary of State and the Financial Services Authority to appoint an inspector simply if it seems to them that there is good reason for so doing or whether they should have objective good reasons for such action that can be examined in a court.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> One of the crucial powers that lies with the FSA is the mere exercise of the threat to investigate, which, in many cases, will be enough to secure—rightly or wrongly—a change of behaviour by the party that might be investigated? Therefore, some limit on the exercise of the threat of a judicial review is an essential part of the safeguard that is required by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> My hon. Friend makes am important point; it can reinforce our confidence in the powers of the Financial Services Authority. The Minister should know from our entire attitude towards the Bill that it is not our objective to strip from the FSA any necessary powers. We want to be sure that its powers are not so overweening that they fail to be subject to judicial control. When the Financial Secretary takes legal advice on the matter, as I hope she will, she will discover that the rigmarole at the beginning of the clause that states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State . . . that there is good reason for doing so''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
leaves the discretion for such action to the authority and leaves the courts extremely unwilling to intervene. That is not good enough; it is why we are objecting to the provision and are trying with a small amendment to bolster the position.
<P>
<B>Mr. Beard:</B> If the Secretary of State or the authority has reasons that would stand up to judicial review, there will be no need for an investigation. Surely such a procedure is in place to find evidence where there is a suspicion. By the nature of events, a suspicion will have such a foundation that would stand up to a judicial review. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to say that it appears that such a suspicion is not based strictly on evidence that would stand up in law. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman were to require that the evidence must stand up in a court of law, many such investigations would never start. It is the nature of such matters that evidence will not come to light unless there is an investigation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is motivated by good sense, but he is not endowed with detailed knowledge of the complex law of judicial review. He is right in that it would be going too far if, before an investigation was started, one had to prove that something was wrong. However, he is saying that an investigation should not be started without there being reasonable grounds for so doing. We also are saying that, but that is not what the Bill says. It states that if it simply appears to the Secretary of State or the Financial Services Authority that there are good grounds for such action, off they go and the courts cannot touch them. That is my understanding of the clause, but it was not the Minister's understanding of it. In fact, I do not know what she understands in any real sense of the word ``understanding''. The Minister is a sensible person, with common sense, and she believed that the investigations were not to be started without reasonable grounds. She was then handed a note saying that it was unwise to paraphrase what is in the Bill. What is written in the Bill is designed to limit, as tightly as possible, the supervisory powers of the court. That is not good enough.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> It is worth pointing out that the Opposition's amendment does not change the words, which have been much quoted, at the start of the clause. The amendment inserts something in addition to the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If it appears to the Authority or the Secretary of State . . . that there is good reason for doing so''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
[Interruption.] I must make some progress. Opposition Members have intervened on each other substantially throughout our discussion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson:</B> We know what is going on.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> As the Whip says from a sedentary position, we know what is going on.
<P>
I shall run through some of the points that I have made already in response to some of the comments that have been made. The FSA is subject to judicial review and other forms of jurisdiction, which I mentioned before. The judicial review is available, but the test that the court must apply is whether the authority or the Secretary of State acted reasonably in forming the view that the circumstances suggested are included in the list of events that may have taken place. The test is subjective, not objective. It must appear to the authority or the Secretary of State that there is good reason.
<P>
As I have said before, judicial review will consider whether a reasonable regulator could have reached that view. That must be the test, which follows the wording of section 105 of the Financial Services Act 1986. It is no different. Opposition Members have had a good run at the issue. We believe that there is plenty in the Bill and that it is fine. In essence, it carries forward existing arrangements. The idea that a reasonable regulator has to reach the same view as an authority in doing something under the clause is a good and sound basis for anyone, and ultimately the courts, to test whether the FSA or the Secretary of State are doing their jobs properly.
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Am I, therefore, to understand that a reasonable regulator will have reasonable grounds for starting an investigation? If not, he will be capable of being overturned on judicial review?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Yes. On the question of how specific the investigation that is undertaken might be, the more specific it is, the more general the powers to investigate, and the less specific, the converse. It is important to recognise that there are different circumstances, which I have already outlined in my general comments earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tyrie:</B> The Minister agreed with my right hon. and learned Friend, so is she prepared to come back with a suggestion to include it in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall go away and think about that, but my immediate reaction is to say probably not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> We are still in a certain amount of confusion. The Minister has moved a little way towards my right hon. and learned Friend's position, which is that there must be some objectivity in the test. The authority or the Secretary of State must have reasonable grounds for appointing investigators, which can be challenged judicially. It is not simply a subjective matter of what is in the mind of the regulator or the Secretary of State.
<P>
In view of the Minister's remark that we must rely on our debate for an interpretation of the law rather than seek clarity in the Bill—a doctrine which disturbs me deeply—I am rather unsure how to proceed. We shall hold the Minister to her offer to re-examine the matter. On that basis, we shall not press the amendment to a vote.
<P>
We have not prolonged our debate unnecessarily. In fact, it has been quite good, if rather difficult for the Minister. However, we have struggled towards an understanding of the underlying issues, which the Minister has said she will scrutinise. She has qualified that with a caution that she is not optimistic about making a substantive change, but she will at least review the matter. We shall rely on that, as it relates to important limits of discretion that have cropped up elsewhere in the Bill and to our efforts to tie down that discretion for the benefit of the regulated community.
<P>
On those conditions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 527, in page 65, line 12, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`the business of an authorised person including a part which'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`a business even if it'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss Government amendment No. 528.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> Amendment No. 527 alters clause 137(5), clarifying that the term ``business'' covers the regulated and unregulated activities of the person concerned, whether he or she is an authorised person or an appointed representative. That is entirely in line with existing powers under section 41 of the Banking Act 1987 and section 105 of the Financial Services Act 1986.
<P>
Naturally, a power that may need to be exercised to inform the regulator about the extent to which the qualifying conditions continue to be satisfied, must cover all of someone's business, as I said earlier. As the clause stands, the reference to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the business of an authorised person''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
may be interpreted to meaning that, in relation to an appointed representative, ``business'' does not cover unregulated business. We have already discussed that matter at some length. The amendment clarifies that we did not intend to draw such a distinction between how the power works m relation to authorised persons and appointed representatives.
<P>
Amendment No. 528 simply corrects a drafting error. It replaces a reference to ``carrying out'' regulated activities with a reference to ``carrying on'' regulated activities.
<P>
I trust that Committee members of all parties will support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We concur with the Government's view that it is sensible to extend the cover of any part of the business, even if it is not regulated. We do not hold a particular view on whether ``carrying on'' or ``carrying out'' business is better semantics. However, amendment No. 528 is clearly simply a drafting amendment, and is acceptable to us.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>

<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> The clause gives the FSA and the Secretary of State the power to appoint competent persons to carry out investigations in more specific circumstances than under clause 137. It gives the Financial Services Authority and the Secretary of State the ability to look into possible contraventions by authorised and unauthorised persons.
<P>
This power is therefore appropriate where circumstances suggest that an authorised person has contravened a particular rule. Equally this power is exercisable where there are grounds for thinking that an unauthorised person may have breached the general prohibition on carrying on regulated activity without authorisation, or committed the holding out offence under clause 22, or breached the financial promotion prohibition under clause 19.
<P>
The power also captures behaviours and breaches which could be committed by either authorised or unauthorised persons, such as market abuse, misleading the FSA, making misleading statements or engaging in misleading practices, breaches of the money laundering regulations and insider dealing.
<P>
Finally this clause covers investigations in support of the approved persons regime under Part V. So an investigation under this clause can look into whether an individual is no longer fit and proper to be approved, or has failed to comply with a statement of principle under clause 61. The clause is currently drafted on the basis that the trigger for these investigation powers is where the authority or the Secretary of State has
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``reasonable grounds for suspecting that''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
one of the things listed in subsections (1) or (2) may have happened.<P>
 However, we have concluded that this wording imposes an unnecessarily high test for launching an investigation. It is very similar to the level of suspicion that a policeman must have to carry out an arrest, and which would often be met only after some initial investigation. This is too high a test if we want to have a regulatory system that responds quickly and effectively to possible wrongdoing. We make no apologies for wanting to be sure that investigations can take place as and when the circumstances suggest that they are needed. Nothing is gained by having a regulator that cannot respond quickly. Nothing is gained by encouraging wrongdoers to seek to prevent the launch of inquiries through procedural challenges in the courts.
<P>
So we are persuaded that we should align the trigger for these investigation powers with those currently applying under section 177 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and section 432 of the Companies Act 1985. Under these provisions, the relevant investigating authority can launch an investigation where it appears that there are circumstances suggesting that a contravention may have taken place. Amendments Nos. 529, 535 and 538 have that effect. Amendment No. 538 also improves the drafting of subsection (4), which governs the breaches which may be investigated on behalf of the Secretary of State.
<P>
As I have already said, the powers of investigators appointed under this clause are wider than those appointed under clause 137 in terms of who may be required to attend and answer questions. That reflects the fact that investigations under this clause are into some specific possible breach, rather than more generally into the business of an authorised person. So it is reasonable that, so long as the investigator is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient for the particular purposes of the investigation, he should be able to require information from any person, not just those who are ``connected'' in the ways set out in clause 135 and schedule 12.
<P>
The situation is slightly different for investigations into possible insider dealing, market abuse or misleading statements and practices—the contraventions listed in subsection (2) rather than (1). Here no distinction is drawn on whether someone is connected to someone else. The investigator may require any person to attend and answer questions so long as he considers the person may be able to supply relevant information.
<P>
The point behind the difference in treatment is that it is in the nature of market investigations that the circumstances giving rise to the need for an investigation may not indicate that any particular person is the suspect.
<P>
It would be ridiculous if an investigation could be launched to look into suspicious market movements, but no-one could be required to supply information because there was no particular person under investigation, and no other persons who could be said to be connected to such a person.
<P>
However, we have considered further the split between the contraventions in subsection (1){**mel**}—where there is assumed to be a particular person under investigation—and subsection (2), where there is not.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 530, 531, 536 and 537 transfer a number of other contraventions from subsection (1) to subsection (2). These are: breach of the general prohibition under clause 17, breach of the financial promotion prohibition under clause 19 and the holding out offence under clause 22. These contraventions may also be detected and would warrant further investigation before a suspect could be identified. In addition, all of them are by their nature contraventions that would be committed by unauthorised persons. The authority therefore lacks other information-gathering powers on which to rely to narrow its inquiries prior to the launch of an investigation under the clause. Amendment No. 530 also inserts an additional contravention into the list in subsection (1)—a breach under clause 18 by an authorised person of the limits of his permission under part IV. It ensures that a permission breach can be treated on all fours with rules breaches. The amendments also remove an element of duplication in the current drafting as a result both of reference to the breaches of prohibitions, and to relevant criminal offences. We opted to focus on the breach of the prohibition as this enables the FSA to commence an investigation without having to form a preliminary view about whether the person concerned could make out any of the due diligence defences under clauses 21(3), 22(2) and 23(2).
<P>
Amendment No. 532 is a drafting change which brings the test in clause 138(1)(g) into line with the other tests under the paragraphs of subsection (1). Amendment No. 533 aligns the description of the conduct which may be investigated with the scope of the authority's powers to make prohibition orders under clause 53. Amendment No. 534 clarifies the scope of the authority's powers to investigate relevant matters before exercising its powers under part V of the Bill. This is necessary because the arrangements for prohibitions under part V relate only to individuals, whereas the arrangement for approved persons under that part may also apply to bodies corporate.
<P>
Not all possibilities are currently provided for under clause 138(1). For example, the authority would be able to investigate an individual's fitness to perform a function for which he has approval under clause 56 but would not be able to with a company which had similar approval. The amendments are designed to improve the way that the important investigation powers in the clause will work. They also remove some unintended duplication, and align the drafting generally.
<P>
The Opposition's amendments do not add anything to the Bill. It is clear that the role of an investigator appointed under the clause is to examine the circumstances that gave rise to his appointment. That is the clear construction that should be placed on the clause. I am happy to clarify this for Opposition Members, but I will not accept their amendments, which would be necessary even if they were compatible with the new wording in our amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> We are not happy that the Government have effectively rewritten this extremely complicated clause in a way that the notes on clauses did not make entirely clear. It would be helpful to have the clause printed in clear amended form so that it can be easily understood.
<P>
The clause gives a further category of powers to investigate specific circumstances and to appoint competent people to conduct investigations. We are cautious about the considerably wider powers that the amendments confer on investigators, which seem to have been sneaked in at the last hour and buried among other amendments relating to the re-ordering of the sequence of clause 138. Amendments Nos. 491 and 492, which the Minister wrongly dismissed as implicitly being there already, would make it clear that the territory of investigation will be limited to the matter which gave rise to the suspicion. The clause as drafted does not do that, and anything could be investigated on the whim of the FSA when it appointed the investigator. The Government amendments in part redraft the contraventions that may be investigated under clauses 16, 342, 95, 345, and if there is suspicion of insider dealing or related offences under the Criminal Justice Act 1993, or contraventions of rules made under the Bill.
<P>
The stated reason for some of the Government amendments is that the existing wording would impose an unnecessarily difficult test before an investigation could be undertaken, and we are inherently suspicious of that. As I have said, part of the effect of the amendments will be to give the FSA powers that were not previously in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 529 will allow wider powers of what are reasonable grounds for suspicion. We view that as a star chamber measure and as unacceptable. We question whether the re-ordering of various provisions under amendments Nos. 530, 531, 536 and 537 is entirely right. Do the Government intend to omit clause 17 under amendment No. 530? Surely the intention is to add clause 18. Under amendment No. 531, clauses 21(1), 22(1), 23(1) and 53(4) will be omitted, although they will be dealt with in subsequent amendments. Amendment No. 532 deals with a drafting matter. Amendment No. 533 implies that the Government intend that there should be reasonable grounds for suspicion—our key requirement. Amendment No. 534 is intended to cover bodies corporate as well as individuals in relation to breaches under clause 56.
<P>
On amendment No. 535, we believe that it is wrong to remove the requirement for the FSA to have reasonable grounds for suspicion when appointing an investigator. Amendment No. 535 reflects the Government's statement that they think that it will be too difficult to launch an investigation. That illustrates the star chamber approach. Subsections (2)(a) and (2)(b) relate to serious offences and it would be unacceptable to investigate if there are less than reasonable grounds for doing so.
<P>
In effect, the Government are reversing the intent of our amendments, which would require the FSA to behave reasonably. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester will treat us to a learned discourse on the Wednesbury principle of natural justice.
<P>
Amendment No. 536 will reinsert clause 22(1), which will be deleted under amendment No. 531. Amendments Nos. 537 and 538 will introduce clauses 19, 208 and 341 as well as general market abuse. What is wrong with the statement ``appears that the circumstances suggest''?
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. These were starred amendments yesterday. It would be extremely helpful to the discussion of this important clause if the Government would provide typed-up copies of the clause containing the amendments before we resume at 4.30 pm.
