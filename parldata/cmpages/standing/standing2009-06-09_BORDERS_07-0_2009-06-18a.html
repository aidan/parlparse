<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000235"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship
this morning, Miss Begg. The first of these three new clauses is the
Ilois or the Chagos islands amendment. I cannot remember whether it was
on Second Reading or in Committee that the Minister or perhaps the
Secretary of State suggested that some Members were jumping on a
bandwagon in relation to the Chagos islands.
<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> It was not him. Perhaps it was the
Secretary of State on Second Reading. I should like to reassure the
Committee that this is certainly not a bandwagon that Liberal Democrats
are jumping on now. It may have been a bandwagon that we jumped on many
years ago. I recall speaking in a debate with the hon. Member for
Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn) about this six or seven years ago. So
it is not a recent arrival. It is not something that has just hit our
radar.</div>
<a name="09061852000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly now
is not the time to debate the injustices that have been done to the
Chagos islanders. That is a matter that has been debated many times in
the House and there have been many reports on it, but it is not the
subject of today&#146;s debate on new clause 1. The subject of new
clause 1 is simply to consider the rights of the Chagos islanders, or
the Ilois, and their descendents to full British citizenship. That is
what the new clause seeks to achieve.</div>
<a name="09061852000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
quote some things that have been said about the injustices that I have
just referred to. Members of the Committee will have read the judgment
of Lord Hoffmann, who described &#147;the whole sad story&#148; of
the Chagos islanders, saying
that</div><a name="09061852000176"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
removal and resettlement of the Chagossians was accomplished with a
callous disregard of their
interests&#148;.</div><a name="09061852000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through
new clause 1, we can perhaps go some way towards redressing those
injustices and that &#147;callous disregard&#148; of the
Chagossians&#146; interests.</div>
<a name="09061852000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
Ministers have recognised that an injustice was committed, it is fair
to say that their statements of concern have not been of particular use
to the Chagos islanders. New clause 1 would be of great use. As I have
said, it is about considering the rights of the Chagos
islanders&#146; descendents to full British citizenship.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column210" />Column number: 210</div><a name="09061852000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Members of the
Committee may be aware that, under section 6 of the British Overseas
Territories Act 2002, a person who was born after 26 April 1969 and
before 1 January 1983 to a woman who was a citizen of the United
Kingdom&#146;s colonies by virtue of her birth in the British Indian
Ocean Territory and who is neither a British citizen nor a British
overseas territory citizen immediately before commencement of section 6
became a British citizen by descent. To summarise that in a way that is
perhaps more digestible, what it means is simply that those people are
not able to transmit citizenship automatically to their children. That
is the key point that we are discussing today. The new clause would
ensure that, by omission of section 6(2) of the 2002 Act, those people
would become full citizens and thus would be able to pass on their
citizenship to their own children.</div>
<a name="09061852000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
other Members of the Committee will agree that that is something that
we have a responsibility to do, because of the circumstances in which
the Chagos islanders were dispossessed of their own homes, and in many
cases forced to go to Mauritius. I also hope that the Minister will use
this opportunity to take a positive step in this regard. We know that
in 2002 there were intentions to address this issue, but those
intentions were not fulfilled.</div>
<a name="09061852000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 1
sets the scene and, as I say, hopefully it will give the Minister an
opportunity to address the Committee and explain what action the
Government are going to take on this issue.</div>
<a name="09061852000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 6
is entitled &#147;Stateless children of British nationals&#148;.
Again, I must say that I am afraid that these citizenship and
immigration issues are quite complex and discussing them requires that
a fair chunk of information is read into the record, to ensure that
there is a reasonable understanding of what our proposal is about. The
purpose of new clause 6 is to ensure that stateless children born after
1 January 1983 to &#147;British nationals&#148;, which includes
British citizens, British overseas territories citizens, British
overseas citizens, British nationals (overseas) and British subjects,
wherever they are in the world, are entitled to be registered as
British citizens, and that the children of British overseas territory
citizens can be registered as both British citizens and British
overseas territory citizens.</div>
<a name="09061852000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">By way of
giving a couple of examples, I will explain exactly what that means. A
relatively small number of people would be affected by new clause 6. My
understanding is that this is not an issue that affects tens of
thousands of people. It affects small numbers of people&#151;tens of
people. Therefore, if the Government were concerned that new clause 6
might open the doors to significant numbers of new British citizens, I
must say that I do not believe that that is the case. Perhaps the
Minister will stand up and contradict me on that point; we will wait
and see.</div>
<a name="09061852000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">A British
citizen born outside the UK under British overseas territories will be
a British citizen by descent. As I stated earlier, that means that they
cannot automatically transmit their citizenship to their children. In
addition, a British overseas territories citizen born outside the
overseas territories will be a British overseas territories citizen by
descent; again, he or she will not be able to transmit citizenship to
his or her children. For the children of British citizens and British
overseas territories citizens, it is not always possible to satisfy
existing provisions for registration to obtain those citizenships 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column211" />Column number: 211</div>for want of compliance with residence requirements in the UK or a
British overseas territory. Moreover, in certain circumstances, where
the state of residence prohibits the acquisition of
nationality&#151;often on racially discriminatory grounds&#151;this
leaves the children of such persons stateless. That is what this is
about: stateless children&#151;children who, in effect, have no
rights.</div><a name="09061852000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition, British overseas citizens and British subjects are not able
to transmit that citizenship or status, as the case may be, by descent
to their children. This also has the effect of rendering such children
stateless, where the state of residence prohibits the acquisition of
its nationality. Thus the statelessness of children may arise in
circumstances where the state in which they live does not provide for
the acquisition of its nationality and there is no mechanism for the
children to acquire the British nationality of their
parents.</div><a name="09061852000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
over the world there are small pockets of stateless children who have a
link through their parents&#146; nationality or citizenship to the
UK. The UK has accepted that their parents are entitled to a form of
British nationality and therefore to some protection and assistance
from the UK. Most families with parents who are such British nationals
identify with the UK and are treated as identifying with the UK by the
state in which they
live.</div><a name="09061852000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Immigration Law Practitioners&#146; Association&#151;I know the
Minister enjoys their briefings and talks to them on a regular
basis&#151;has examples of children of British citizens of Asian
descent resident in Zambia and the surrounding former British colonies
in eastern and southern Africa, who have been rendered stateless by
strict domestic citizenship laws and restrictive policies preventing
them from registering as British citizens or as British overseas
citizens. While there are no official statistics on how many children
in Zambia are affected, it is conservatively estimated that about 20
children, not 20,000 or 200,000, of Asian descent resident in Zambia
are affected by statelessness. In June 2004 Lord Patel of Blackburn
surmised that about 40 to 50 British families of Asian descent whose
children were born after the country's independence were
affected.</div><a name="09061852000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall go into the detail of one particular case to illustrate further
the point I am making. The case is that of a British citizen of Indian
origin resident in Zambia&#151;hereinafter called &#147;A&#148;
to simplify matters. He is a professional member of the community. He
was a citizen of the UK and colonies by descent without a right of
abode. On commencement of the British Nationality Act 1981, A became a
British overseas citizen. His father, who moved to Zambia from India in
1953 as a result of the British Government's incentives, was registered
as a citizen of the UK and colonies in 1955. He was automatically
reclassified as a British overseas citizen on commencement of the 1981
Act. A&#146;s mother, also of Indian origin, joined her husband in
what was then Northern Rhodesia in 1957. She was registered as a
citizen of the UK and colonies on the basis of her marriage in 1967. On
1 January 1983 she was automatically reclassified as a British
citizen.</div><a name="09061852000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
married, first in a religious ceremony in Zambia and then in a civil
ceremony in the UK in 1985. His wife, born in India, registered as a
British overseas citizen in 1990 when the couple were living in the UK.
A 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column212" />Column number: 212</div>acquired indefinite leave to remain in the UK without a right to
re-admission. The couple&#146;s first two daughters were born in the
UK in 1985 and 1991 and were thus British citizens by birth. In 1992
the family had to return to Zambia due to A&#146;s increasing ill
health. A&#146;s younger two daughters were born in Zambia in 1993
and 1996; both have been stateless since birth&#151;this is the
important point. Despite numerous attempts made by A to register his
younger daughters as Zambian citizens, he has been persistently
informed that they are not eligible for Zambian citizenship nor do they
have a realistic prospect of acquiring it in the future under the
country&#146;s citizenship laws. Zambian authorities have also been
reluctant to issue travel documents to the
children.</div><a name="09061852000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09061852000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
two exceptional occasions, they agreed to issue temporary travel
documents allowing the children to leave and return to Zambia, on the
understanding that no further applications would be entertained in the
same way, other than to issue one-way-only travel documents.</div>
<a name="09061852000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Meanwhile, A
has made several unsuccessful applications to register his daughters
under section 3(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981. He has made
representations through MPs since 1999. In all his efforts A has been
unequivocally rebuffed, with neither Zambia nor the UK taking
responsibility for the children. As a result, the two daughters remain
stateless. They are unable to visit extended family members in India
and the UK. Should they ever contract a serious illness or suffer an
accident the effects of which cannot be treated locally, it would be
necessary for them to be airlifted to South Africa, where treatment
could be administered&#151;that has become common practice in such
cases. However, as stateless children, they would not be able to
travel.</div><a name="09061852000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
one occasion, the Home Office suggested that A and his family move to
the UK so as to resolve the two daughters&#146; statelessness. They
would have to travel on a one-way travel document as they are not
entitled to passports from any country in the world. They have no
guarantee that the move would achieve the desired result, as the
discretion to register them as British under section 3(1) has never
been exercised in their favour. It would also involve leaving the home
and country in which they have grown up, to lead a precarious and
complicated existence as stateless children in the UK.</div>
<a name="09061852000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will probably be pleased to hear that that will be the only example I
give, but it well illustrates the issue. It is a small-scale issue but
one which is of huge importance to a small number of children who are
stranded in different parts of the world.</div>
<a name="09061852000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purpose
of new clause 7 is to make provision for those born to fathers not
married to their mothers to register as British citizens. As I am sure
the Minister knows, before 1 July 2006 British fathers could not pass
on their British nationality to children born outside marriage. The new
clause affects children born to fathers who were British citizens; it
affects those born in the UK after 1983 to such fathers and to a mother
who is not British nor settled in the UK. Before 1983, a child born in
the UK was a British citizen. It also affects children born in a
qualifying territory and children born outside the UK where the mother
was not a British citizen otherwise than by descent.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column213" />Column number: 213</div><a name="09061852000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">As Members may
know, section 9 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
changed the law, amending the British Nationality Act 1981 so that
children born to British fathers not married to their non-British,
non-settled mothers were born British if their fathers could prove
paternity. However, it only did so for those born after 1 July 2006,
the day on which the provisions were finally given full effect. It did
nothing to correct the present-day effects on children and young adults
of the historic injustice and discrimination against men.</div>
<a name="09061852000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would allow those not considered British citizens&#151;only
because they were born to British fathers not married to their
mothers&#151;to register as such. The new clause assists those born
in the UK after 1983. For those born outside the UK to fathers who are
British citizens otherwise than by descent, it would assist those still
living.</div>
<a name="09061852000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope the
Minister will agree that the new clauses are sensible
proposals&#151;relatively minor amendments to the law. The issues are
about justice, whether for Chagos islanders or for families where the
father did not happen to be married to the mother. I hope the Minister
will give me some assurance that the Government will not only
acknowledge but will be willing to take action on those
issues.</div><a name="09061852000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061852000236"></a><b class="B">Damian
Green</b> (Ashford) (Con): This is an interesting set of
questions for the Minister. The Library note for the Bill is
instructive. It makes a very important point about the labyrinthine
complexities of nationality legislation. We have had so many Bills over
the years that there are now many anomalous situations, many of them,
as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington just pointed out,
affecting very small groups of people, but which can nevertheless give
rise to genuine human
misery.</div><a name="09061852000078"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000237"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> The hon. Gentleman may be interested to know that
another of those quirky immigration issues that I learned of is the
debate that is going on about how much visiting Olympians should have
to pay for their visas when they come to the UK for
2012.</div><a name="09061852000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000238"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, although I am
not entirely sure how relevant it is to these new
clauses.</div><a name="09061852000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000239"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It is
complicated.</div><a name="09061852000081"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000240"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister helpfully tells me from a sedentary
position that it is complicated, which, while true, is not necessarily
hugely illuminating. I think we all know that there are difficult areas
here and they do create genuine human misery. The point is well made
about the Bill, which is that although it is indeed, as I have pointed
out several times, one in a long line of nationality Bills that we have
discussed, it is my understanding that the immigration simplification
Bill that, for some reason, we are getting in the next Session, will
not address these issues, so this is the last bus for a long time upon
which they can be discussed. If the Minister is unable to respond with
any positive plan of action, these various small-scale anomalies will
exist for many years to come.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column214" />Column number: 214</div><a name="09061852000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall move
on to each of the new clauses in turn. It is instructive to remember
that the problem of the Chagos islanders arises from one of the last
gasps of what might be described as traditional British imperialism,
which, I suspect, even at the time looked a bit&#151;some would say
robust, some might say brutal. Groups of people were just removed from
their homeland against their will by, it is worth saying, a Labour
Government under Harold Wilson in 1969, at the behest of the American
Administration. Looking back on it historically, it is fair to say that
that was pretty much the last time that that kind of action would have
taken
place.</div><a name="09061852000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000241"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Upper
Heyford?</div><a name="09061852000084"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000242"></a>Damian
Green:</b> If the Minister wishes to intervene, he is more
than welcome to relive his youth on picket lines, or whatever it was,
protesting against a Cruise missile system which his Government have
not only continued but, in the case of Trident, recently renewed. I am
not sure the Minister will necessarily want to go down that
route.</div><a name="09061852000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I was saying, this may be the last chance for the Government to address
the issue of the Chagos islanders, if they choose to do so, and we will
be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in response. He will
be aware that this is a long-running campaign&#151;there is an
all-party group in the House of Lords on this&#151;and the
nationality law consequences of what happened to those islanders in
1969 is complex and very serious. Being born in the UK, or a British
overseas territory, to a parent who is British or settled there means
that you are born a British citizen. However, groups such as the Chagos
islanders in exile, for example, in Mauritius, who are not born in the
British Indian Ocean Territory, do not have that kind of status,
because they are in enforced exile. I can understand why people regard
that as
unfair.</div><a name="09061852000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister will also be aware that there have been several runs around
this course in Parliament, not least in the British Overseas
Territories Act 2002. Section 6 says that all those born between 26
April 1969 and  1 January
1983</div><a name="09061852000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;to
a woman who at the time was a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies by virtue of her birth in the British Indian Ocean
Territory&#148;</div><a name="09061852000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">became
British citizens by descent. However, that means they are not able to
pass on their British citizenship to their children born overseas, if
they were not already British citizens. They became British overseas
territories citizens, again by
descent.</div><a name="09061852000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
amendment was designed to make provision for those born in exile from
the islands, many of whom are in Mauritius. It only assists those born
on or after  26 April 1969&#151;the date on which the removal
from the islands was authorised. That is one group who are eliminated
and it only assists those who are born to the women involved, not the
men. Exile did not end in 2002 when the provision was made; it
continues today, and because those who benefit cannot pass
on their British citizenship to their children born overseas, it does
not deal with the generations who are born in exile. Unless
action is taken, the disadvantage those children suffer in respect of
their nationality will last for ever.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column215" />Column number: 215</div><a name="09061852000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is why
this is a continuing campaign and cause of concern. I suspect the
Minister will share that concern and it will be interesting to hear
what he says. I can only assume he is worried about setting a precedent
for other groups of people. I appreciate the complexities of British
overseas citizenship. It is not one of the easiest areas of nationality
law. However, given that we have the Bill in front of us and it is
possible to address the issue now, it would be a useful and important
thing to consider. Rather like the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington, I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say. We
have all read the debates in the other place, but there seem to be a
number of nice judgments to be made here. I approach this with an open
mind because I can see not only the points being made by the
campaigners, but the complexities involved.</div>
<a name="09061852000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">In new clause
6 we are again dealing with the slightly arcane world of British
citizens born outside the UK, British overseas territories and British
citizenship by descent. Someone who is born outside this
country&#151;or in British overseas territories&#151;and is
therefore a British citizen by descent, will not be able to
automatically transmit citizenship to their children. A British
overseas territories citizen born outside the overseas territories will
only be a British overseas territories citizen by descent, and
therefore will not automatically be able to transmit citizenship. It is
not always possible for the children of British citizens to satisfy
existing provisions for registration and obtain citizenship, because of
a lack of compliance with the residence requirements in the UK or in
the British overseas territories. As we have heard, it happens that
children in those circumstances may be left stateless. In the modern
world, those people are peculiarly powerless and unable to access many
of the genuine universal human rights that we seek to spread around the
world.</div>
<a name="09061852000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
issues of principle at stake here, as well as the practical effects
that the hon. Gentleman laid out in his introductory remarks. In terms
of new clause 6 it would be helpful if the Minister could let us know
what the rough estimate is of how many people we are talking about. Is
it dozens, hundreds, or thousands? We need to take a practical approach
and see how many people might be gaining extra privileges from this. If
the absolute total population that might gain new benefits because of
it is only a small number, that would probably have a powerful impact
on the argument and what we wish the Government to
do.</div>
<a name="09061852000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000243"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I hear what the hon. Gentleman says in terms of the
numbers who might be affected. Looking at the Minister and his
officials, I am not sure whether they will in fact be able to give us a
figure at all. There is surely an issue about the rights of a child
which should not be affected by the numbers involved. There is a basic
right. These children are stateless children who do not have rights.
That must be
addressed.</div><a name="09061852000185"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000244"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I sense that the hon. Gentleman is intervening on
me as a way of sending a message to the Minister. I hope that the
Minister has heard that. To be fair, I do not expect an exact figure,
but the order of the numbers involved is quite important.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column216" />Column number: 216</div><a name="09061852000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7
is obviously related. It makes provision for those born before 1 July
2006 to British fathers who are not married to the mothers to register
by entitlement as British citizens. In another place Lord Brett
described it as</div>
<a name="09061852000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a useful part
of the comprehensive discussion that we will have on these
issues&#148; &#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4 March
2009; Vol. 708, c.
742.]</div><a name="09061852000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">In a
letter to Lord Avebury he acknowledged that the proposal in part
replicates the current exercise of discretion in relation to those born
to a father who is not married to the mother. The Government said in
the other place that the amendment was unnecessary because ministerial
discretion can be used. We have had debates about when it is
appropriate to use ministerial discretion and when it is better to have
decisions written into legislation so that we can have greater
certainty and greater consistency over time. That is an important
principle.</div><a name="09061852000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lord
Brett stated that there was no need for redress because</div>
<a name="09061852000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;it was felt
that this could create difficulties for those affected in relation to
any other citizenship they held.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
House of Lords,</i> 1 April 2009; Vol. 709, c.
1092.]</div><a name="09061852000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I
understand it, the new clause provides for people to apply to register;
it does not compel them to do so. I am not sure that that objection
holds water. Steps have been taken to mitigate the current effect of
historical discrimination against women who are unable to pass on their
British citizenship to children born overseas, regardless of whether
they are still children or are now adults. The new clause will remove
the similar discrimination that still takes place against men in that
situation.</div>
<a name="09061852000175"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">This is
a collection of extremely difficult issues, which touch on the
boundaries of nationality and how it can be transmitted. It will be
interesting to hear what the Minister says, particularly on new clause
1. This is a long-running campaign, which I suspect he knows will not
simply go away if he does not respond to it
satisfactorily.</div>
<a name="09061852000098"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000245"></a>The
Minister for Borders and Immigration (Mr. Phil
Woolas):</b> I congratulate the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington on tabling these new clauses. I commend him on his approach,
particularly in laying out the facts and the background in a very
helpful manner. It means that I do not have to repeat it, which is
normally the function of a Minister in this
regard.</div><a name="09061852000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall respond to the new clauses in the order in which they were
presented. The hon. Member for Ashford pointed out that these are
nationality issues; he was right to say that the proposed
simplification Bill is an immigration Bill, not a nationality Bill.
There is a large number of very complex, unintended, knock-on effects
as a result of British nationality overseas issues, not least in the
case of Chagos islanders. There are two issues. The Chagossians
inhabited the islands of Diego Garcia, Peros Banhos and the Salomon
islands, and had also settled in other parts of the Chagos archipelago,
such as the Egmont islands and the Eagle islands. Those islands are
formally referred to as the British Indian Ocean Territory and now form
part of the British overseas territories listed under schedule 6 of the
1981 Act, as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
said.</div><a name="09061852000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
resettlement, if that is the right word&#151;the hon. Member for
Ashford described the process as robust at best and brutal at worst,
but &#147;resettlement&#148; is the word used in my
briefing&#151;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column217" />Column number: 217</div><a name="09061852000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000246"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the Minister agree that
&#147;eviction&#148; might be a more appropriate
word?</div><a name="09061852000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000247"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I will be careful what I say, because the first
issue, as the hon. Gentleman has recognised and, indeed, has campaigned
on, is resettlement and what rights, if any, the people have to return.
So let me be cautious in that
regard.</div><a name="09061852000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
official Government position is that the resettlement of the islanders
was enforced so as to enable the use of the islands for American
military purposes. The resettlement took place in the late 1960s and
early 1970s, and the people were relocated to Mauritius and the
Seychelles, although some subsequently moved to other territories,
including Canada and the United States of America. The return of the
Chagossians to the islands has been deemed, until now, as inappropriate
for defence, security and practical reasons. Diego Garcia has one of
the longest runways, if not the longest, in the world for American
forces.</div><a name="09061852000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
come to the issue that the hon. Gentleman has raised. Those who were
resettled&#151;if I can use that word neutrally&#151;and who were
born in the islands were citizens of the United Kingdom and the
colonies by birth, by virtue of section 4 of the British Nationality
Act 1948. If we are having difficulties with these complexities, I
should imagine that the 1948 Act was even more complicated. On
commencement of the British Nationality Act 1981, those people became
British overseas territories citizens otherwise than by descent,
meaning that they can pass their status on by descent to children born
to them outside the United Kingdom and qualifying territories. If
Committee members are interested, that is mentioned in section 23 of
the 1981
Act.</div><a name="09061852000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsequently,
under section 3 of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, all
British overseas territories citizens otherwise than by descent
acquired British citizenship. That means that the rights to British
citizenship under nationality law of resettled Chagossians were not
affected by the resettlement. However, those children born to parents
who were resettled in 1969 acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom
and colonies by descent only under section 5 of the 1948 Act, if born
to a United Kingdom and colonies father, because they were born in
Mauritius or other territories outside the United Kingdom and the
colonies. However, it is strongly argued by Chagossian campaigners that
such a child would, more likely than not, have been born in the British
Indian Ocean Territory if their parent had not been forcefully
resettled. If that had been so, the child would have acquired
citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies by birth and they
would now, since commencement of the 1981 Act, and by virtue of
application of section 3 of the 2002 Act, have acquired
British citizenship otherwise than by descent in the same way as their
parent had. However, because those children born outside the islands to
resettled parents acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom and
colonies by descent only, they have subsequently acquired British
citizenship by descent by virtue of section 3(3) of the 2002 Act. That
means that they can not transmit&#151;pass on&#151;their British
citizenship status to children born to them outside of the UK and
qualifying territories, under the application of the 1981
Act.</div>
<a name="09061852000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
may be interested to know the number of people that we are discussing
here. In that period&#151;the late 1960s and early
1970s&#151;arrangements were made  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column218" />Column number: 218</div>for the islanders to be relocated, as I have said, mainly to Mauritius
and Seychelles, although others subsequently moved elsewhere. The
substantial majority of those people&#151;some 1,200 of
them&#151;were relocated to Mauritius. Of course, that does not cover
the issue of those people who were on Mauritius for medical reasons,
educational reasons, including being at school and college, and other
reasons, who were prevented from returning to the Chagos islands when
ships stopped going back to the islands from
Mauritius.</div><a name="09061852000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is very difficult indeed to estimate the current number of Chagossians.
However, 1,415 British citizen passports were issued to Chagossians in
Port Louis in Mauritius and 203 were issued in Victoria in Mauritius
between commencement of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 and 8
November 2007. I thought that the Committee would be interested in
those figures and I wanted to read them out because a lot of work has
gone into finding them.</div>
<a name="09061852000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">There may be
a total of about 5,000 Chagossians worldwide who are currently eligible
to receive British citizen passports, including the second generation
Chagossians born outside of the British Indian Ocean Territory who
acquired British citizenship by descent under the 2002 Act. So we are
discussing not only adults resettled from the islands from 1969 onwards
but some of their children. The Chagossian community in the UK is
already about 1,000 in number, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
estimates that there are around 3,000 to 4,000 Chagossians in Mauritius
and the
Seychelles.</div><a name="09061852000109"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000248"></a>Damian
Green:</b> The Minister is right that those are extremely
interesting figures. He said that the Chagossian community in Britain
is about 1,000. Is that number fairly stable or has it been growing in
recent
years?</div><a name="09061852000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000249"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My understanding is that that number is fairly
stable; I have no evidence that the movement is exponential or that the
curve is getting steeper. However, I want to emphasise that that number
is an estimate. It is better than a guess, but it is an estimate none
the less. There are no accurate figures on the number of Chagossians in
the UK.</div>
<a name="09061852000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee
will want to know the Government&#146;s position on this issue. The
proposal in new clause 1 is to extend British citizenship to a further
generation of Chagossians; that is, to the children of the children
who, it is argued, would have been born in qualifying territories if
the resettlement had not taken place.</div>
<a name="09061852000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000250"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> Does the Minister also acknowledge that, to some
extent, the 1969 cut-off date is not entirely fair? As he said himself,
the fact is that ships stopped going to the Chagos islands and a lot of
people had to move out before that. So that 1969 cut-off date is not an
actual fixed
point.</div><a name="09061852000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000251"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. Indeed, I
said that the resettlement started in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
The particular date in 1969&#151;I think that it was a date in August
1969&#151;does not take on board the practical point about the ships
that he made. The difficulty that the Government have is that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column219" />Column number: 219</div>we are talking about children of children and what could have happened
to those people retrospectively, if the Committee follows my
logic.</div><a name="09061852000186"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45
am</div><a name="09061852000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the debate on this subject in the other place, Lord Brett expressed
sympathy on behalf of the Government for the circumstances that had
brought about the situation. The vast majority of Chagossians who from
1969 onwards resettled from the British Indian Ocean
Territory&#151;principally Diego Garcia, but the other islands as
well&#151;are now in Mauritius, which of course is not covered. The
new clause seeks to address what the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington sees as an imbalance in the rights of former residents of
the Chagos islands, and would enable children who were born outside the
islands, potentially due to the resettlement of their parents, to
acquire British citizenship in the same way as they would have done but
for that resettlement.</div>
<a name="09061852000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intended
beneficiaries of the provision, if I understand the new clause
correctly, would be second generation Chagossians born outside the
British Indian Ocean Territory and the UK qualifying
territories&#151;not those who were resettled, but their children.
The new clause seeks to ensure that those children are able to pass on
the right to citizenship to future generations born to them outside the
UK qualifying territories.</div>
<a name="09061852000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">In discussing
the new clause, I have been made aware of discussions being held
between the Foreign Office and the Chagossians and their
representatives on the broad range of issues relating to resettlement.
The hon. Gentleman referred to the all-party group on the Chagos
islands, which I understand last met on 30 May and is giving support to
those representations on resettlement. The principal issue they have
raised with us is their right, or suggested right, to resettle on the
islands, rather than&#151;not instead of&#151;the issue of
resettlement. Of course, Miss Begg, you would not allow me to address
that issue here because it is not covered by the Bill. Suffice it to
say, we are sympathetic to the position of second, and subsequent,
generation Chagossians who were born in Mauritius or the Seychelles. I
appreciate that is not the issue raised in the new clause, but I
thought it would help the Committee to know that that was our
focus.</div><a name="09061852000117"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09061852000252"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Crispin Blunt</b> (Reigate) (Con): There is some merit in the
Minister setting the debate in a wider context. Has he had any advice
about the consequences of accepting or not accepting the new clause for
the various sovereignty claims to the islands? Mauritius has made a
claim on the British Indian Ocean Territory and may have understandings
about what will happen when the United States finishes using Diego
Garcia. I cannot remember the position, although I knew it once. There
could be implications for the rights of people who are citizens of the
British Indian Ocean Territory by descent but who are now in Mauritius
and the other
islands.</div><a name="09061852000118"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000253"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The straightforward answer is no, although I
absolutely see the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. There  is a
relationship between the issue addressed by the  new clause and
the issue I have just raised, and I will take that up with my colleague
in the Foreign and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column220" />Column number: 220</div>Commonwealth Office. I cannot remember who that Minister is after the
reshuffle but I think it is still my noble Friend Lord Malloch-Brown,
or at least it was at 9 o&#146;clock&#151;please do not put that in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> I am advised that
it is my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda.</div>
<a name="09061852000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Moving
swiftly on to the bit we are interested in, citizenship, otherwise than
by descent, that can be transmitted to the next generation, born
outside the UK, can only be acquired by persons who are born in the UK
or a qualifying territory, who are naturalised in the UK, or who are
born outside the UK or a qualifying territory to a British citizen in
particular circumstances, for example a British citizen in the Crown
service.</div>
<a name="09061852000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
Chagossians who are British citizens through living in Mauritius or
other parts of the Indian ocean could, if they so choose, elect to live
in the United Kingdom. We understand, as I have already said, that some
have done so. That means that any child born to them in the UK or a
qualifying territory would acquire British citizenship automatically at
birth by virtue of being born to a British
citizen.</div><a name="09061852000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
a child has not been born in the UK but has been born in Mauritius or
another part of the Indian Ocean it is probable that they will have
acquired the citizenship of the state in which they were born. Any
decision to allow British citizens by descent with a connection with
the British Indian Ocean Territory to pass on their citizenship could
lead to representations from other British citizens. British citizens
by descent who are ordinarily resident in the UK and who have children
born to them outside the UK cannot transmit their citizenship under
section 2 of the 1981 Act, unless&#151;there is a caveat&#151;they
are working in specified employment under Crown or designated
service.</div><a name="09061852000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy on transmission of British citizenship by persons who hold that
status by descent only is, therefore, strictly applied. The policy is
designed to ensure that children born outside the UK to a British
citizen by descent acquire British citizenship only when there is an
ongoing close connection with the UK&#151;the principle will also
apply in my arguments on new clause 6&#151;and, therefore, in cases
where that connection is broken, on a temporary basis only. It is thus
inappropriate to amend the class of British citizenship acquired by
that group. So to amend would lead to similar representations from
others who have British citizenship by descent only. There is no
adequate case for such an
extension.</div><a name="09061852000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000254"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I hear what the Minister says. This seems to be the
central point where numbers come in. He has just said that the proposal
would set a precedent for other groups of people. What rough quantum of
numbers are we talking
about?</div><a name="09061852000124"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000255"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I thought I had been through
that.</div><a name="09061852000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000256"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I think that the hon. Member for Ashford is asking
what are the other categories of people whose claims the Minister says
would be reinforced if the Chagos islanders were granted
permission.</div><a name="09061852000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000257"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am not sure about the numbers, but it would be
people who, as I have said, were born outside the UK to a British
citizen by descent only, who acquired 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column221" />Column number: 221</div>British citizenship when there was no close connection with the UK. That
is our difficulty. In layperson&#146;s terms, the new clause is
attempting to right a historical wrong by assuming citizenship rights
being passed on to the next generation. My difficulty with that, as I
have explained, is twofold. First, any such change that would
retrospectively, as it were, assign rights could be ascribed in other
places to other people. Secondly, in any event, it makes an assumption
that the child would have been born in the Chagos islands. That is the
difficulty in practical
circumstances.</div><a name="09061852000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
policy is consistent and empathetic to Chagossians when there has been
an application by the first generation and when we have been able to
use the powers that we have to grant citizenship, but those children,
who may be grown up now, of course, who have acquired citizenship of
another country&#151;predominantly Mauritius&#151;have no such
close connection with the United Kingdom. Therefore, retrospectively,
to turn that back would imply difficulty, although that is not quite
the right use of the word &#147;retrospectively&#148;. We do not
see how the Government can separate the nationality rights of
Chagossians from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&#146;s general
policy regarding the Chagos islands. That relates to the point made by
the hon. Member for
Reigate.</div><a name="09061852000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the Government have not sought to justify the actions taken in the
1960s and 1970s, we have maintained the line that our
obligations&#151;legal and otherwise&#151;have been settled by
previous compensation awards, and by the grant of British citizenship
under the 2002 Act. If hon. Members are concerned that we have shut the
door on Chagossians, the provisions in that Act should be borne in
mind, although, to be fair, I think that the hon. Member for Carshalton
and Wallington has acknowledged that point, if not today, during
previous
debates.</div><a name="09061852000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
British Indian Ocean Territory is currently British sovereign
territory&#151;none of it is US territory. Recently, Foreign Office
Ministers have repeated publicly, and have given the commitment to the
Mauritians, that when the UK no longer requires the BIOT for defence
purposes, we will cede the territory to Mauritius. Of course, we have
given no indication of the time scale for that, but it is important
because it will transfer rights to Mauritians, which we think is the
best way to address the wrong that the hon. Gentleman wants
addressed.</div>
<a name="09061852000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The UK-US
agreement was signed in 1966 and resettlement continued until 1973,
when of course there was a Conservative Government. I take the point
made by the hon. Member for Ashford about Harold Wilson, but I think
Edward Heath continued the policy.</div>
<a name="09061852000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have tried
at some length to show how our strategy will address the problem raised
by the new clause but without the associated difficulties. As the hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington said, new clause 6, on stateless
minors, would extend current provisions that enable a person born
stateless outside the United Kingdom or qualifying territories to a
British national, to acquire the same type of British nationality as
their parent. That relates to provisions in schedule 2(4) to the
British Nationality Act
1981.</div><a name="09061852000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would have two principal effects: first, to remove the
requirement for a stateless person to have lived in the United Kingdom
for a period of three years; and, secondly, to change the nationality
status acquired from that of the parent to either full British 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column222" />Column number: 222</div>citizenship or British overseas territory citizenship. It is a
well-understood principle that British citizenship should be limited to
those with a close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom or
an overseas territory. As such it can normally be transmitted to only
one generation born overseas&#151;that is similar to the point about
the Chagossians. The principle is reinforced by the proposals in the
Bill on earned citizenship. Nevertheless, the Government are committed
to reducing cases of statelessness, and we will continue to make
exceptions&#151;the key point about ministerial discretion is that it
is much tougher than the impression we may have given&#151;to reduce
statelessness in order to meet our obligations under the important 1961
convention on the reduction of statelessness.</div>
<a name="09061852000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
unreasonable to insist on a period of residence before registering a
stateless person. I shall address the example given by the hon. Member
for Carshalton and Wallington. The entitlement to British citizenship
should not be available to someone with no ties to the United Kingdom
or with only a distant connection, such as a grandparent or a
parent&#146;s connection through a former colony. Those who acquire
British citizenship, and therefore the right to abode in the UK, should
have a real association with this country, such as through a period of
residence. Despite our commitment to reducing statelessness, we can
only go so far to compensate for the fact that other nations do not
share that commitment, and so do not provide for the acquisition of
citizenship by children born in their territory.</div>
<a name="09061852000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, I
fear that some countries would abuse such a change were we to make it.
I can think of several countries that would do so&#151;as I am sure
the Committee can. It should give the hon. Gentleman some reassurance
in his campaign to hear that the requirements under schedule 2 of the
British Nationality Act 1981 are in accordance with article 4 of the
United Nations convention on the reduction of statelessness, because
the fear is that a country that was not signed up to the convention
could discriminate against groups&#151;perhaps minorities&#151;by
denying them citizenship of their country in the belief that it would
be taken advantage of if signatory countries made those
changes.</div>
<a name="09061852000187"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10
am</div><a name="09061852000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we accept the proposed new clause, it would allow children born
overseas to British overseas citizens and British subjects to become
British citizens if they would otherwise be stateless. To illustrate my
point, I shall give an example of how that could work. When Uganda
became independent in 1963, despite having been born in Uganda, a large
number of citizens of the UK and the colonies did not acquire Ugandan
citizenship because neither parent was born there. Such people became
British overseas citizens and may now have children&#151;a second
generation born in Uganda&#151;who cannot acquire citizenship because
under current Uganda law, a child born there would not be a citizen if
neither a parent or a grandparent is or was a member of an indigenous
community that existed, incredibly, in 1926 or was a citizen at the
time of the child&#146;s birth. I am not sure from where that date
came, but that is the law
there.</div><a name="09061852000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would mean that a child born to such a British overseas
citizen parent would be able to register as a British citizen and would
therefore have a right to abode here without the child or parent having
a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column223" />Column number: 223</div>close connection to the UK. The United Kingdom makes adequate provision
for children born stateless who have a connection with the UK or an
overseas territory to acquire citizenship. In doing so, we believe that
we meet our international obligations as set out in the 1961
convention.</div>
<a name="09061852000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
further reassure the Committee on the point about discretion. As has
been said, we do not give a guarantee that if people move to the UK
they will acquire citizenship. However, if they live here for three
years before applying on behalf of their children, the law provides a
registration entitlement under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the 1981
Act. That means that there is no need for discretion to be exercised
under section 3(1), which relates to an open discretion to register a
child. However, schedule 2, paragraph 4 provides for stateless children
born outside the UK whose parents are British citizens, British
overseas territory citizens, British overseas citizens or British
subjects. If they moved to the UK for three years, under that paragraph
they would be able to apply for the child&#146;s registration.
Subject to the normal good character-type caveats, schedule
2, paragraph 4 provides not for ministerial discretion but for that
entitlement. In a way, schedule 3 is an open
discretion.</div><a name="09061852000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am more than happy to look at the specific example that the hon.
Gentleman used, but my understanding&#151;I caveat my answer with
that&#151;is that the advice we gave was that they could come here.
His concern that there was no guarantee&#151;that it was a pig in a
poke for them&#151;is covered by schedule 2, paragraph 4. Again, I am
trying to suggest that we have a strategy to meet the point without the
consequential dangers.</div>
<a name="09061852000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must move
on; I am being urged to do so from both sides of the Committee. The
final amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Carshalton and
Wallington relates to a difficult area of policy: the rights or
supposed rights of illegitimate children of British fathers. I have
been asked whether we have any estimate of how many such people there
are. Her Majesty&#146;s Government have no such estimate. We have not
made one.</div>
<a name="09061852000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
known how many illegitimate children of British fathers there are in
the world. It is an area of speculation that I do not wish to get into.
It assumes many things, such as whether the father knows&#151;in my
speaking notes, it says &#147;in my experience&#148;. The point has
been made. It is a serious question, though, and I respect it. The
answer is that we do not have an estimate, and neither do we have
experience that could allow us to make a fair
extrapolation.</div><a name="09061852000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would enable registration by any person born illegitimately
to a British citizen father before 2006. The hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point of principle is important, because the rights of children born
illegitimately should be recognised as a general principle, and we did
so in the 2006 Act. He is very reasonably trying to right a wrong, but
let me again describe our approach.</div>
<a name="09061852000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">We now come
to the Secretary of State&#146;s discretion exercised in relation to
those born illegitimately to a British father. The discretion is
exercised under the broad remit of section 3(1) of the 1981 Act, which
came into force in 1983, to enable the registration of children born
before 1 July 2006 who are the illegitimate children of British
citizens or settled fathers. That has been the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column224" />Column number: 224</div>case since the Family Law Reform Act 1987 removed any distinction
between legitimate and illegitimate children in other areas of
law.</div><a name="09061852000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parliament
changed the law on 1 July 2006 to enable British citizen fathers to
pass on their citizenship to a child born to them out of wedlock. The
change, however, was not made retrospective, because of the
difficulties that would have been created for those affected in
relation to any other citizenships that they held. That is, of course,
still the
case.</div><a name="09061852000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
policy adopted in relation to the exercise of discretion under section
3(1) is that registration can take place if the Home Secretary is
satisfied about the paternity of the child, all those with parental
responsibility have consented, the good character requirement is met
and if, had the child been born to the father legitimately, he or she
would have had an automatic claim to British citizenship or an
entitlement to
registration.</div><a name="09061852000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
exercise of discretion under section 3(1) applies only to those who are
minors on the date of application for British citizenship. There is no
power in law, discretionary or otherwise, to register as a British
citizen a person who was born illegitimately to a British citizen
father before 2006 and who is now an
adult.</div><a name="09061852000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
question of numbers is complicated by the fact that many of those who
were illegitimate at birth may since have been legitimised by the
marriage of their parents. Many children born illegitimately to a
British citizen father between 1983&#151;the onset of the 1981 Act,
from when retrospective discretion is applied&#151;and 2006 will have
become British by virtue of being born to a British citizen mother.
Many people will have been registered under the discretion exercised by
the Secretary of State as long as they were minors on the date of
application. Many others born illegitimately before the change in law
who are now adults may well have naturalised as British citizens under
section 6 of the British Nationality Act 1981. However, it is
impossible to
say.</div><a name="09061852000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the guessing game&#151;I say this not to score points but
to put it on the record&#151;I am advised that the new clause is
technically incomplete in that it does not determine whether someone
registered under it would acquire British citizenship by descent or
otherwise than by descent and so reflect the precise circumstances of
their birth. There is also a minor technical difficulty. The hon.
Member for Carshalton and Wallington recognised that the 2006 Act
addressed the principal issue. We effectively apply that through our
discretion retrospectively to 1983, but to do so further would be a
step into the unknown. It would be a difficult move to
take.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000258"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I just wonder about the numbers. I know that it is
not possible to estimate at all accurately, but have any figures been
collated since the 2006 change that would give a rough indication of
what numbers we are talking
about?</div><a name="09061852000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000259"></a>Mr.

apparent in the third of my four examples: the numbers who could have
used that right used a different route because of other connections.
That is why I do not want to mislead the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="09061852000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
short, the difficulty I have on a practical level is the potential for
complication, abuse and unfounded claims and the complicated measures
that I am sure hon. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column225" />Column number: 225</div>Members can imagine would flow from that. We believe that we have
strategies that address the issues in all three new clauses, although
they do not go as far as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington
would like. He would prefer a clean change in the law to go further
back than we went in the cases of the stateless and illegitimate
children and the Chagossians. I hope that I have explained my reasons.
I have tried to be sympathetic rather than dismissing these arguments.
We recognise that they are important, but we do not believe that they
are practical and in some cases we believe that there are some
technical
difficulties.</div><a name="09061852000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000260"></a>Tom
Brake:</b> I start by thanking the Minister for explaining in
some detail the Government&#146;s position. It may have prevented
Labour Members from going off and doing more important things, but it
was worth getting some of the points that the Minister made on the
record, particularly the fact that discretion is available. The
Minister having reinforced that point, some of the cases may now be
resolved in a way that is favourable to the claimants. I will ensure
that he gets details of the individual case I
described.</div><a name="09061852000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 1, the Minister highlighted the fact that the FCO is in
discussion with the all-party group, principally around the issue of
resettlement rights. It is fair to let those deliberations continue and
the group could clearly take on the issue that I sought to raise about
citizenship if it wanted to. I understand what he was saying about
British citizenship claims from other categories of people with no
close connection to the UK who could see this as a precedent if the new
clause were
accepted.</div><a name="09061852000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
new clause 6, the Minister reinforced the point about discretion.
Without being able to make any categorical statements he seemed to
underline the fact that, although there are no guarantees about people
being allowed to get citizenship after a period of residence, there is
a high probability that the statelessness issue of children in that
case at least might be addressed. Finally, on new clause 7, the
Minister was right not to seek to document or quantify the number of
illegitimate children of British fathers. That would clearly be
extremely difficult to establish. One might be able to extrapolate from
any figures the Minister arrived at how many may have been fathered by
Members present in the Chamber today. We would not want to go down that
route.</div><a name="09061852000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
heard what the Minister said. I heard him underline the point about
discretion, and I heard his reference to the debates that are taking
place between the FCO and the all-party group on the Chagos islands.
Having received some reassurance that the Government are showing
flexibility, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09061852000261"></a>Damian
Green:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="09061852000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
debate has become a regular feature of immigration Bills, in that since
2007 Opposition Members have come to the conclusion that we need a
unified border police force in this country, and have sought to
persuade the Government of that in several immigration Bills in both
Houses. We seek to do so again. There was a good debate on the subject
in the other place. This is an idea whose time has come, and I sense
that it is an idea that the Government are inching towards but, for
reasons that I have never quite understood, will not actually
adopt.</div><a name="09061852000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is unarguable that we ought to protect our borders better than we do.
Britain is a series of islands. We do not face the land border problems
faced by many other countries that are desirable targets for illegal
immigration and cross-border crime, but we ought to be able to defend
our borders better than we do. Our defences are not
adequate.</div><a name="09061852000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would be a significant step forward. We think that it would
be a more effective step forward than the one that the Government have
taken, which we do not oppose&#151;that is, to merge some of the
functions of the UK Border Agency and Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and
Customs at the border&#151;but we think it illogical that the police
should be the one body that is still doing all the work in a fragmented
way.</div><a name="09061852000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Experience
of policing more widely shows us that specialisation of police services
is more effective, particularly in fighting the new types of crime that
have hit society in recent years. We therefore believe that the Bill as
it stands is a severe missed
opportunity.</div><a name="09061852000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister himself admitted that our border controls are too lax. He
stated:</div><a name="09061852000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
have, compared to other rich countries, been liberal in our border
controls.&#148;</div><a name="09061852000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that that is an accurate quote.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column227" />Column number: 227</div><a name="09061852000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Prime
Minister admitted that Britain is suffering from the failure to tackle
organised immigration crime. On 12 May, he
stated:</div><a name="09061852000181"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
well as street gangs we are seeing increasingly sophisticated
international criminal networks which operate in the shadows but are
responsible for the worst kind of crimes: people trafficking, drugs,
and&#151;as we saw with the Gooch gang in Manchester&#151;gun
crime...we need to go
further&#148;.</div><a name="09061852000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
that, I agree with
him.</div><a name="09061852000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
July 2007, the Prime Minister announced that he would introduce a new
border force. It involved a link-up between the UKBA and HMRC&#146;s
customs operations. However, if that is as far as the Government will
go&#151;that seems to be the case; it has certainly been the case
argued by Ministers up to now&#151;it is not far enough or good
enough.</div><a name="09061852000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly,
the police are the body with the greatest expertise in fighting
cross-border crime. I am sure that the Minister, too, finds as he goes
around the country that the level of expertise is inherently patchy.
Constabularies such as Kent, which have borders and big ports to
control, develop expertise, but other police forces inevitably have
less to do with such things and so develop less
expertise.</div><a name="09061852000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">Protecting
our borders, and particularly fighting illegal immigration, cannot be
done only at UK borders. The Minister says continually that he wants to
export the border and do some border protection work overseas, which is
fine, but I urge him to recognise that protecting our borders and
combating illegal immigration, particularly human trafficking and
illegal working, also takes place inside our borders. If one wants to
be more effective in fighting illegal working and the sex trafficking
aspect of human trafficking, one must be more effective all over the
country, not just in our big cities. Some of the worst
immigration-related crimes take place in small towns and villages
throughout the country. A shocking change in human trafficking over the
past few years is that brothels with young women who are often duped
into coming here are not a feature just of our bigger cities and of our
inner cities. They crop up in many places. There have been some in my
constituency, which is a prosperous part of Kent where one would not
expect to find them, and my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes
(Mr. Steen), who has done so much good work in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column228" />Column number: 228</div>raising the consciousness of this place to human trafficking, says that
he finds the problem in Devon, and that it simply did not exist two or
three years ago.</div>
<a name="09061852000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
illustration of the wider point. We must do much better, and the
Government&#146;s action so far is simply not enough. The facts speak
for themselves. The estimate of illegal immigration can never be
precise, but the most recent, which the Government carried out,
suggests that it was anything up to 500,000. The Minister will have
seen the report commissioned by the Mayor of London, which puts the
figure slightly higher at about 600,000. Clearly, it is likely to be in
that sort of ball park, and we all agree that we must cut
it.</div><a name="09061852000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other crime areas, drug offences rose 68 per cent. between 1998-99 and
2007-08, and that is another big cross-border trade. We cannot tackle
crime effectively while our borders are so porous. We have debated
where illegal immigrants come from and the routes that they use to
become illegal immigrants. My best guess is that about 60 per cent.
arrive illegally. We know that apart from the appalling effect on
lives, the economic and social costs of people trafficking are more
than &#163;1 billion a year, and it seems likely that the
regrettable increase in gun crime in this country is being fuelled by
the illegal supply of weapons into the UK, particularly from eastern
Europe.</div><a name="09061852000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
tasks facing a border police force are huge, and hugely important. Each
area, whether trafficking, drugs, guns or illegal immigration, would
justify the creation of such a force. The fact that we are facing such
growth in all four of those areas at the same time seems to be an
extremely strong argument for such a force. If the Government are
unwilling to accept the Opposition&#146;s argument, perhaps they will
listen to others. Sir Chris Fox, when president of the Association of
Chief Police Officers, said on 25 March
2006:</div><a name="09061852000182"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Personally
I think we should have a Border Force. I think we should have a group
of people that are made up of Police Officers, Special Branch,
Immigration Officers, Customs, who have a total responsibility for all
our points of
entry.&#148;</div><a name="09061852000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
may surprise the Minister by praying in aid Sir Ian
Blair&#151;</div><a name="09061852000189"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
