<H4><center>General right of access to information held by public authorities</center></H4>

<P>
Amendment proposed [this day]: No. 22, in page 1, line 24, leave out subsection(6).—[Mr. David Heath.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Clark, and wish you a happy new year.
<P>
I was reminding the Committee that clause 75 makes it an offence for an authority to alter or destroy records with the intention of preventing disclosure. The effect of the amendment would be to remove clause 1(6) from the Bill. That subsection provides that the information communicated to an applicant under clause 1
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is the information . . . held at the time when the request is received, except that account may be taken of any amendment or deletion made between that time and the time when the information is to be communicated''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as long as the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``amendment or deletion . . . would have been made regardless of the receipt of the request.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment is intended to cause authorities to preserve a record requested under freedom of information legislation regardless of any previous intention to destroy it. However, by deleting clause 1(6), the amendment would leave unclear the crucial time for determining the communication of information to the applicant.
<P>
Further difficulties would remain even if that defect could be remedied by retaining the first half of clause 1(6) and deleting the lines on page 2 of the Bill, because the subsection is not simply concerned with the destruction of records, but enables an authority to update and correct information that has been requested. In many cases, information held by authorities will require constant updating and revision in the light of changing circumstances and more up to date analysis of facts. Without the provision, authorities would be obliged to communicate unrevised information to applicants without any additions or deletions that would be required to bring it up to date. The amendment would therefore have the effect of requiring authorities to communicate incorrect and out of date information to the applicant.
<P>
Far from being otiose, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) suggested, the clause is important. If it were deleted, normal record management within large operations would be almost impossible. They could never update; they would have to maintain things as they always were. The amendment does not achieve what the hon. Gentleman seeks. The best way to protect against anyone who might seek for mendacious reasons to prevent information from getting into the public area is clause 75, which provides the sort of protections that the public needs. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I, too, welcome you to the Chair this afternoon, Dr. Clark.
<P>
I listened with great care to the Under-Secretary's reply, as always, but am none the wiser for having done so. There seemed to be a certain lack of logic in what he said. Nothing in the subsection prevents an authority that produces information from adding an additional piece of paper to say, ``By the way, this is now incorrect or has been superseded by later information that we will provide as well.'' Nothing in the Bill restricts a public body from providing information. Therefore, suggesting that the amendment would prevent a public body from correcting, amending or updating information is simply wrong.
<P>
There would be a short time between the application for information and its being sent to the applicant, but it would not upset the workings of even the most sophisticated filing system to keep a matter that had been inquired into on file during that brief period. The Under-Secretary referred to clause 75, but he has not made it clear why there could be a procedure for updating files—it would be quite a proper procedure if the subsection were to remain—that would effectively take another class of information outside the remit of the Bill. The amendment would also prevent any accusation under clause 75 that something had been done intentionally to circumvent the Bill, as there would clearly be a regular updating or deletion programme and the intent would not be to remove a specific piece of information from public scrutiny.
<P>
For that reason, I am not entirely satisfied with what the Minister said, and I hope that he will discuss the matter with others to establish whether the subsection achieves the objectives that he has ascribed to it. I believe that it does not and that its deletion would not have the results that he suggested. We will want to return to the matter later in the Bill but, at this stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 2, line 9, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) In this Act, ``information'' includes unrecorded information.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a pleasure to sit for the first time under your chairmanship, Dr. Clark.
<P>
Amendment No. 36 is intended to raise the question of information that is not written down or recorded. The Bill's right of access is to information ``recorded in any form'', as set out in the interpretation clause, clause 82. That seems fair enough, but what about information that is known to people in a public authority but has not been recorded? That may sound rather an abstruse definition, but when one stops to think about it, certain rather important classes of information may be included in it, such as information that relates to action or inaction by a public body. That includes action with regard to meetings, visits, site visits, decisions and the converse of all those things, such as meetings, visits and decisions that have not been made, which are often as significant as those that are, as with Conan Doyle's dog that did not bark. All such information will not be recorded anywhere, but may be germane to information in which a member of the public or an organisation has a proper and serious interest.
<P>
Once we have identified that, we must ask whether it is practicable to legislate for something as intangible as unrecorded information. Not being a lawyer, I do not know whether it is, but my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, who is a lawyer, will obviously have something interesting to say about that. As I understand it, in law witnesses can be required to testify about what they know rather than what is written down. Therefore, if such information is testable in law, it could presumably be covered by the Bill. I am afraid that references to other freedom of information regimes will be a boringly constant refrain throughout our proceedings, but New Zealand's 1982 Act covers any knowledge, however gained or held.
<P>
In the White Paper ``Your Right to Know'', my right hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) acknowledged in paragraph 2.6 the existence and importance of unrecorded information. Such information is referred to in clauses 20, 25 and 40, but, worryingly, only in negative terms. Will my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary say whether he sees a way of bringing unwritten and unrecorded information within the Bill's ambit. I am sure that he will agree that such information can be extremely important.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) has presented a valid and interesting case, but it is unfortunately an extremely difficult issue. We have considered it and studied how it has been addressed in New Zealand. The amendment would extend the right of access to unrecorded information, but we cannot support it—certainly not in its current form. There are difficulties regarding the enforcement of such a right of access to unrecorded information.
<P>
Under the Bill, the right of access applies to information recorded in any form, and we believe that that is the only practical solution if the Bill is to be effective. A public authority cannot be said to hold information or be required to communicate it accurately if no record of the information exists. How can the commissioner investigate a failure to provide information in respect of which there is no record of its existence? I accept my hon. Friend's point that information may be known to individuals which is not written down. It may have been the subject of discussion, but was not recorded. How will the commissioner determine that, except by calling witnesses before her—assuming that the commissioner is Mrs. Elizabeth France—and questioning them about what they know, when they knew it and why they did not record it? She would no doubt have to record information from all the testimony and then try to determine what the information was. That is difficult, especially as some of that information could be rumour, unsubstantiated or inaccurate comment, or merely hearsay. The Bill is not intended to promote a right of freedom for misinformation; it will provide access to recorded information about which people have a right to know.
<P>
To some extent, there is an assumption, which I accept can be challenged, that the public authorities will record everything. It may be that some public authorities will choose not to do so for all sorts of reasons. We do not want to create a situation where that process is encouraged. We need to ensure that information is available to the public when it has been recorded. Some people insist that extending the right of access to unrecorded information will encourage officials deliberately not to record sensitive information to evade the right of access. The only way in which to stop such abuse is to give adequate protection to sensitive information when the public interest demands it. Officials will then have no fear about recording information and adequate audit trails will be maintained. That is what the Bill will do. Under clause 13, the public interest in disclosing information should be taken into account.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central makes a valid point, but the Bill is not an effective way of dealing with the circumstances that he described. That would put the onus on the commissioner and local authorities to deal with unrecorded information. In order to proceed sensibly and coherently, the best approach is not to include a right of access to unrecorded information, but merely that recorded information will be the area to which we wish new rights to extend.

<P>

<B>Mr. Robert Maclennan </B>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross): I find it difficult to understand why the Government should now regard such a provision as something that it is impossible to accept under the Bill, given that they made it clear in December 1997 in the White Paper ``Your Right to Know'' that the Bill would cover all information, not just recorded information. The Under-Secretary has prayed in aid the impracticality of including unrecorded information, yet the Government gave a clear undertaking on all information. They are now performing a U-turn. I accept that other considerations have been adduced, but the opposite problem from that which he has described is likely to result from a decision not to require information that is not recorded to be disclosed in the same way as recorded information.
<P>
The practice of officials deliberately not choosing to record information because it may become disclosable is not one that the Under-Secretary would wish to be developed. That was implicit, if not explicit, in his remarks. However, given that the Bill makes such a clear distinction between recorded and unrecorded information, it will operate as a great incentive to record only conclusions and not the reasons. If expert advice is given to a Department, the end result will be that it is advised not to follow a particular course or that it is advised to take certain action. To have an informed public debate, we must know about the reasoning.
<P>
Having now heard different views from their own, the Government should carefully reconsider the provision. We are all seeking the same objective; we do not wish to make the machinery of government more difficult to operate, but we must open up the reason why certain decisions have been taken. That will be in jeopardy if we allow the clause to go through unamended.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I have already said that the Government have considered the matter with great care, as we did the way in which the Bill, the White Paper and the development of such a policy have gone forward. We have tried to ensure that we have created a Bill that is workable and we believe that it will provide criteria that will enable the commissioner and the courts to enforce a right to know. It is difficult to see how we can create a right to know all information, which may not be recorded. The right hon. Gentleman is understandably looking to those authorities that may wish to keep something secret, but what about those authorities that might want properly to do their duty? I am sure that he agrees that most of our public officials in governmental, local and other public authorities want properly to undertake their duties. If all information was subject to a right to know, the tendency would be to record everything and authorities might consider that, if any information was not recorded, a proper authority that was seeking to comply with the law might present itself with difficulties at a later stage.
<P>
We have addressed the matter by trying to ensure that we have realistic and workable legislation. I said earlier that we are anxious not to create a situation whereby officials would not record matters. We want them to record matters that are properly reportable and for that to be subject, where applicable, to the right to know. The only way to prevent sensitive information from being disclosed is by having proper clauses in the Bill to deal with it. That is our approach.
<P>
Paragraph 2.15 of the White Paper ``Your Right to Know'' states that:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the access right will apply to recorded information that the public authority concerned already holds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman says that we made a promise in the White Paper that unrecorded information would be brought into scope; I am not sure where.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Paragraph 2.6 of ``Your Right to Know'' states that both recorded material and information should be covered. A distinction is drawn between records and information. Paragraph 2.10 states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the term `records' should cover all forms of recorded information including electronic records''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I am looking carefully at the White Paper, but I am not sure that I understand the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of it. Paragraph 2.6 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``This is the heart of the Act. The Government sees it as taking the general form of a right exercisable by any individual company or other body to records or information of any date held by the public authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In that context, ``information'' may or may not include recorded information. I cannot see any explicitly stated view with regard to unrecorded information. Indeed, paragraph 2.15 clarifies that to some extent by stating that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The access right will apply to recorded information that the public authority concerned already holds.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is my evidence for saying that there has been no U-turn on the matter.
<P>
We can, if we are not careful, get into semantic arguments, but the issue is what law is practical and enforceable by the commissioner and the courts. Should we require public authorities to record everything, in order to cover the eventuality of being asked about something—in which case a plethora of bureaucracy would be created by the freedom of information process—or should we have a workable law that gives people the right to know about information that is recorded and held by a public authority? That is what is workable and what we can practically deliver. It is a legal framework that the courts and the commissioner can understand and apply. To go beyond that into a realm where we just do not know where to draw the line is not workable. Do we draw the line at some conversation or rumour? No line is drawn because unrecorded information may have no substance, validity or importance and such provision might cause all sorts of frivolous and unnecessary requests, such as what someone said to someone else on such-and-such a date. That would be going too far. We have something workable; let us stick with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I was encouraged by the Minister's recognition that that was a serious, if difficult point. That seemed helpful, unlike his explanation of why it was too difficult to legislate for that—not because of its complexities but because it would cover frivolous or mischievous eventualities, such as rumour, hearsay and gossip.
<P>
I was tempted to deny the fact that my hon. Friend recognised that it is a serious matter. It is not about catching out officials on unsubstantiated information. As he admitted in his opening remarks, we are trying to bring within the ambit of the Bill serious, important and proper information in a form that is not recordable—for instance, of a meeting that may or may not have taken place. I am glad that my hon. Friend realises that it is serious, but I am slightly depressed by the fact that his struggle on the point was rather short on stamina.
<P>
My hon. Friend made an interesting suggestion when he said that the commissioner could be allowed to interview people. It will not happen often, but when it does and if it is a sufficiently important matter to be taken to the commissioner, it seems perfectly sensible and reasonable that she should establish whether, if the information is in other respects not exempt under the Bill, she should interview the people concerned. She could interview either in writing or in person, and she would quickly be able to establish if it was rumour, hearsay or frivolous gossip. She would have little patience with that, and I suspect that people would not make that mistake more than once; they would get short shrift from Mrs. France. Indeed, I am sure that she is capable of distinguishing pretty quickly between unrecorded information that is serious and that which is not.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The question is not whether such information is important—it may be—but how we should define it and test it to ensure that it is indeed held by a public authority. How do we test that something is held by a public authority? My hon. Friend says that it can be done by interview, which assumes that the number of cases would be small. There is no justification for that assumption.
<P>
One can imagine all sorts of circumstances in which citizens may want to pursue a course of action or instigate an inquiry; they could ask many questions about who said what to whom and when, who met whom and when. They could take matters to enormous lengths, which would be difficult to follow.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Nobody would want that. Indeed, the Bill sensibly gives proper powers to dismiss vexatious, frivolous or multiple applications. The Bill deals competently with such fears. We are talking about a particular and fairly specialised class of unrecorded information,
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me probe my hon. Friend on the matter. Would he give the Information Commissioner a quasi-judicial role that would oblige her to take evidence on oath? People are not bound by the same rules and requirements if their evidence is not given under oath. However, that would change the commissioner's role substantially. She would be not an arbiter but a judge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend leads me down an interesting path; I do not have a ready answer. Given that he recognises that such a serious class of information is not covered by the Bill—[Interruption.] My hon. Friend shakes his head, indicating that he thinks that it is not serious. I hope that we can agree that it is potentially a serious problem, Could he see whether his Department, with its imagination, flair and legal expertise, can find a way? I do not know whether it should be done judicially, but I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for identifying one potential way—there may be others—to address a difficult and intangible problem.
<P>
The Under-Secretary stressed that the Bill must be workable. Of course it must; it is pointless to pass legislation that is not practicable. However, we are trying to allow access to information that Parliament may decide should not be exempt. He said that bringing such information within the Bill's ambit would make it unworkable. His solution for workability is complete exclusion, which is not a practical solution to a difficult and thorny problem.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Under-Secretary recognised the danger of excluding unrecorded information from the Bill. I am not a great believer in conspiracy theories, but legislation must cover all eventualities. People could decide, in difficult and embarrassing circumstances, that the safest action was not to record information. I hope that the integrity of public officials, politicians and people who serve on public bodies would ensure that that would not happen 99.9 per cent of the time.
<P>
I did not follow the Under-Secretary's argument. He seemed to say that the best way to prevent officials not recording information was to provide strong exemptions so that they were not frightened of recording what would be inaccessible information. Perhaps I did not catch the full thread of his argument, but what he said about officials being tempted not to record information did not make a great deal of sense. Like his definition of workability, it would mean that information would be recorded but to no end. The purpose of the Bill is to open information that should be opened. Here is a class of information that may be abstruse and which arises only infrequently, but which is real and, as the Minister concedes, serious and important. Unless the Bill is amended, it will not cover an important class of information.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> First, let me say that the Bill is drafted to make it as clear as possible how its provisions should be applied. Any official with sensitive information should know whether it is public information or not. The point, which my hon. Friend did not follow, is that the Bill makes it clear to officials that they must be aware that information will usually be in the public arena unless it is covered by an exemption or the rules in clause 13. The way in which the Bill will operate provides the clearest possible guidance to officials who may apply it. Its purpose is not to discourage them from writing down information. That was my simple point.
<P>
The amendment does not allow for a sophisticated distinction between frivolous and important information. A right to unrecorded information would be a right to all such information. If people were being difficult, the amendment would allow them to ask for a lot of information about who said what to whom. We must be reasonable about what we ask the Information Commissioner to do. It would be perfectly workable, practical and legally enforceable to tell Elizabeth France that she can enforce under the Bill the disclosure of recorded information. However, if we were to give her an entirely different, quasi-judicial role in which she may have to take a decision on a debate about what people may have said to each other, perhaps having taken information under oath and cross-examined people, we would be fundamentally changing the role of the Information Commissioner. We should be very careful about doing that. I agree with my hon. Friend that the right to unrecorded information is important, but it is so imbued with legalistic and practical difficulties that a venture in that area would be at the cost of discrediting and impairing the effectiveness of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for taking the matter seriously, and am interested to hear what he says. Given that he accepts that it is a serious class of information, I hope that his officials will continue to struggle to find a way of incorporating it in the Bill and that we can return to it at a later stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The Bill's short title will seem quite inappropriate if an amendment along the lines of that which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central has proposed is not accepted. In truth, we shall be dealing with not a Freedom of Information Bill but a Freedom of Recorded Information Bill, which seems to be much more confining than any of us ever imagined that the Government would make it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, and I have some sympathy with it. I hope that the Under-Secretary and his officials will not simply say—
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I feel that my hon. Friend is about to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. Just before he does so, and asks the Under-Secretary to consider it, I should like to ask him whether he agrees that it would be helpful if someone could contact other countries, including New Zealand, whose legislation covers recorded information, to ask how they deal with the genuine problems to which the Under-Secretary alluded. Learning from other people's experiences may be a way of ensuring that we have more robust legislation on the statute book.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely helpful and constructive suggestion, which I hope that the Under-Secretary and his officials heard. We are all agreed that, leaving aside frivolous, vexatious applications, hearsay and so on, important information may be involved, and we do not want to exclude unnecessarily from the Bill important information, even if it is in a class that is difficult and intangible to identify and adjudicate on.
<P>
I suspect that the imagination of the Under-Secretary's officials and advisers is equal to that task, especially when aided by the experience of New Zealand, which has dealt with the matter. If on Report or at some other point the Under-Secretary were to tell the House that, when his officials contacted the New Zealand officials, they discovered that they regret bitterly including the provision in the Bill and that it is unworkable and leads to enormously vexatious problems, we are reasonable people and would accept that. But my guess is that inquiries to New Zealand would not lead to that. After all, the New Zealand Government have been administering the legislation for 17 years. If they had genuine problems, they would have amended it by now. If the Under-Secretary is serious about taking the matter seriously, I urge him to make further inquiries of his colleagues in New Zealand and to find a way of dealing with what I am glad he recognises as an important and serious point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. 
<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Public authorities</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. Clark. We look forward to your stewardship of our deliberations.
<P>
I do not want to detain the Committee too long on the clause 2 stand part debate or, indeed, on the schedule 1 stand part debate, but one or two matters need to be clarified. May I remind the Under-Secretary that, when we considered the Human Rights Bill not too long ago, there was quite a debate about the definition of a public authority. The conclusion was that it was for the courts to decide what body constituted a public authority. We argued for a long time in Committee and on the Floor of the House for the Government to specify those organisations that were public authorities.
<P>
I wish to say at the outset that we have resisted the temptation to seek to amend the Bill to provide for a similar arrangement and that we welcome the Government's intention to be much more specific. The list of organisations that were to be public authorities that were set out originally in the draft Bill has been extended greatly under schedule 1. The matter is so important that there is a need for considerable certainty about which organisations are to be public authorities. It would be wrong to have constructed the Bill on the same basis as that chosen by the Government for the Human Rights Act 1998. That shows that we were right all along on the human rights legislation, but time will tell and, for the moment, we must let such an argument pass by.
<P>
My first question to the Under-Secretary concerns the extent to which the definition of a public authority under clause 2 is meant to be comprehensive and all-inclusive, especially with regard to its link to schedule 1. We have no great difficulty with parts I to V of schedule 1, which list organisations such as Government Departments, local government bodies, health services, the police, fire services and so on, which will always be public authorities under the Bill. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will acquiesce to statement with a nod.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that. My key question relates to the long list of bodies under part VI of schedule 1. This morning, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome described them as the ``quangocracy''. Many organisations are listed in the schedule, but we are not clear whether the intention is that the list should be comprehensive and whether the Under-Secretary has made any effort to have a comprehensive list drawn up. From where has the list come? Who decided the criteria for the organisations that are listed in the schedule?
<P>
When we debate clause 3, we shall want to know what happens when a body that is not in the list is asked for information. What will happen when a member of the public rightly thinks that an organisation should be a public authority, but discovers that it is not listed under schedule 1?
<P>
I need to declare an interest because I have been an elected member—and am the current treasurer—of a body, the Insurance Brokers' Registration Council, that qualifies, by my interpretation of the conditions set out in clause 3, for inclusion in schedule 1 but which is not listed. It was established under an Act and has members appointed by a Minister—the Economic Secretary, who has just appointed four new public appointees to it. I cannot believe that the absence of that body from the list is purely accidental or due to the fact that the Government have signalled their intention to abolish it. None of the other regulatory bodies in the financial services industry, such as the Financial Services Authority or the Personal Investment Authority, is listed.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
That is not meant as a criticism. I seek clarification because I can envisage, from my experience with the Insurance Brokers' Registration Council, someone making a complaint against an insurance broker regulated by the council—indeed, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) recently held an Adjournment debate on the case of a constituent who made such a complaint. The person may decide that the complaint has not been dealt with properly and proceed, under the legislation, to retrieve information held by the council to use in further action through the courts, as he would be fully entitled to do. That begs the question whether we should be on the list in the first place; if the Minister is satisfied that we should or should not be, perhaps he can tell us how certain a member of the public can be that the council would be put on the list and that he or she would then be able to get information.
<P>
It is very important that the Minister clarifies the extent to which the list is meant to be inclusive. I should perhaps have made the point that the only way of getting on to schedule 1 in future is by meeting the conditions set out in clause 3, to which we shall come in a moment. The two conditions that I outlined in respect of the Insurance Brokers' Registration Council are clear: it is a body that was established by Government and which has Government-appointed members. There are a great many such bodies and I suspect that the list is not comprehensive. The Minister may tell us that more work is being done to ensure that the list will be comprehensive by the time of Royal Assent.
<P>
There is also the question of how bodies yet to be created will be put on the list. However, it seems to us crucial that in creating a statutory right to information, we should be absolutely clear about which organisations will be caught by the legislation so that individual members of the public, or of other organisations that may wish to retrieve information held by the public authorities, know which bodies they can approach to exercise their rights under clause 1 and various other provisions in the Bill.
<P>
I shall leave it there for the moment, as we can return to the matter on schedule 1 or when we debate amendments to schedule 3. I hope that the Under-Secretary can say what is intended, so that the rest of our deliberations can proceed in an informed and orderly fashion.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> May I point out to the Committee that Mr. Greenway has naturally moved on to the debate on schedule 1; that is understandable because clause 2 and schedule 1 are interlinked. With the permission of the Committee, I suggest that we now debate clause 2 and schedule 1 together, but that we vote on them separately at the end of this debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> In the context of your ruling, Dr. Clark, I rise to make a brief inquiry about schedule 1. It is evident that a number of public authorities come within the ambit of the Bill only in so far as they have to observe certain restrictions in seeking to enforce the Act. There are not very many of them; however, we learn from schedule 1 that the Bank of England, although it is a public authority for the purposes of the Bill, is not covered in respect of information held for some of its central functions. Were all those bodies asked whether they were happy about that? Were those decisions taken by Ministers? Those restrictions are not there by accident; how can they apply? I should be interested to discover the process by which the Bill's coverage has been cut.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> You suggested, Dr. Clark, that we should debate clause 2 and schedule 1 together. That was a wholly sensible suggestion. I echo what the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross said about the Bank of England; I intended to raise the subject on schedule 1, because the schedule creates specific exemptions in respect of the Bank of England. One is bound to ask why those exemptions are needed, given the extremely comprehensive exemptions found in other parts of the Bill. I have one other question for the Under-Secretary. On page 50—thankfully, the list is in alphabetical order—I see that the Information Commissioner herself is listed as a public authority. I am persuaded to ask who will adjudicate in respect of the commissioner in the unlikely event that she does not provide information. I presume that it will be the tribunal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The last point is fascinating. I, too, should be interested to discover the answer.
<P>
Clause 2 defines the term ``public authority''; schedule 1 sets out in more detail what we mean by public authorities and the circumstances in which information can be held by a public authority. Public authorities are designated in the Bill in four ways, using generic descriptions, where appropriate, and specifying the principal authorities in national and local government, together with the principal public authorities relating to the armed forces, the national health service, police, other public bodies and officers. Clause 3 refers to adding, by order,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any holder of any office''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
who satisfies certain conditions. Under clause 4, the Secretary of State can, by order, add any person who satisfies certain conditions and who
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``appears to the Secretary of State to exercise functions of a public nature, or . . . is providing under a contract made with a public authority any service whose provision is a function of that authority.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 5 refers to a ``publicly-owned company''.
<P>
The Bill is intended to have wide application across the public sector at national, regional and local level. The use of generic descriptions avoids having to list individually many of the thousands of bodies and offices to be covered. Information held by an authority includes information held elsewhere on its behalf—for example, in a private repository—but it does not extend to information that is held on behalf of another person or authority.
<P>
We have approached the matter by talking to other Government Departments and public authorities and trying in so far as we have been able to draft a comprehensive list. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) reasonably asked whether we can guarantee that the list is comprehensive, but I have to say no. I could never guarantee that the list will be comprehensive at all times. We have sought to include as many organisations as we believe fall reasonably within the Bill's ambit and the need to get the information. Many organisations are set up by various public authorities on an ad hoc basis. They operate for a period and then cease to exist. Under clause 6, which has been the subject of controversy today, we shall be able to add and delete organisations as they come to the Secretary of State's attention.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. He has confirmed what I suspected, but will he also confirm that as long as the Bill is progressing, the Government intend to continue to add to the list?
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I can confirm that it is the Government's intention to continue to be alive to the issue of new public authorities that are created and which may need to be added to the Bill at a later stage, or which, because of changes in legislation, need to be deleted.
<P>
I shall deal with some of the issues that the hon. Member for Ryedale raised. I understand that the Personal Investment Authority will be abolished and that a new body will replace it. The Insurance Brokers' Registration Council has yet to be created.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The IBRC exists, and indications are that it will be abolished. The PIA exists, and it is also indicated that it will be abolished. But the Financial Services Authority, which will replace the PIA, exists already. It is not mentioned in the Bill, which is a surprise.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The Financial Services Authority is not in the Bill because it does not meet the relevant conditions. It is intended to be brought within the scope of the Bill by order, under clause 4. It does not meet the conditions at this point, but it is intended that it will do so in due course and will be brought in under clause 4. Therefore, the FSA has indeed been thought of and we are in the process of ensuring that it comes within the terms of the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale raised a number of issues. First, he asked why the approach on this Bill is not like the one on the Human Rights Act 1998. I do not think that either of us want to go into great detail about that. We are creating the right sort of framework for the Bill. The 1998 Act is different legislation, so we took a different approach. I think that we did the right thing and that our approach is the right one. I shall not labour that point further.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross asked about exclusions as they apply to the Bank of England. The provisions for disclosure by the Bank of England in relation to its monetary functions are contained in the Bank of England Act 1998. It is right that its private banking functions should not be subject to obligations that do not apply to other banks with which it may be in competition. Its public function is the subject of legislation and it must provide information in relation to that. Some market-sensitive information will also be covered by legislation and will be published at the appropriate time. The Bank may also hold market sensitive information as part of its role as a regulatory authority which it may not be appropriate to make freely available. It should be able to maintain its provision of private banking and related services.
<P>
Let me give an example of why we have taken some of these steps. The BBC is rightly included as a public authority, but it is excluded in respect of information that is held for purposes other than those of journalism, art or literature, on which there may be a right to hold and not disclose information. In an interview with a BBC journalist today, we discussed whether I was entitled to request copies of his notes. Although he worked for a public authority, he was entitled, for the purposes of his journalistic activities, to subject his notes to an exclusion, and I, as a citizen, had no right to demand copies of his notes. There are levels of secrecy that journalists will favour, in particular when it is in pursuit of their own interests. I thought that that might be relevant to our debate. No doubt any journalist who reads the record may want to bear that fact in mind.
<P>
The list is not comprehensive, although we have done our best to ensure that it is as full as possible. We have created a generic schedule where appropriate. I accept that sometimes we may have to include other organisations on the list, such as those that we have not identified and newly created organisations. There is also the issue of organisations that cease to exist. I believe that our approach should command the broad support of the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's analysis of the situation, but I am surprised that the Financial Services Authority does not meet the criteria in clause 3. I understood that Parliament created it and the Chancellor appointed its chairman. However, it is clear what debate we need to have on clause 3.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 2, line 21, leave out `may' and insert `shall'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 11, in page 2, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(3A) The Secretary of State shall exercise his power under subsection (1) as soon as practicable after his attention has been drawn to a body or office that appears to him to satisfy the conditions laid down in subsections (2) and (3).'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Following our debate on clause 2 and schedule 1, I would like to summarise where we have got to. The list of public bodies in part VI of schedule 1 is not comprehensive, but the Under-Secretary has reassured us that other bodies will be added to the list as they are identified. I take it from that that he does not seek to guarantee to the Committee that all the bodies that should have been thought of and included will be included. I do not want to criticise that, because the numbers are phenomenal. Nevertheless, the general intention is to try to make the list as comprehensive as possible. If we agree that that is the position, we can move on to clause 3, which provides the mechanism whereby organisations that perhaps should have been included in schedule 1 can be added to it.
<P>
Such a situation could arise in one of two ways. A new public body could be created—Parliament creates them all the time, as the Under-Secretary said. Had we debated the subject 10 years ago, I dare say that many of the bodies in the list would not be there, and some that would have been do not exist any more. Changes will be understandable, and we should provide a mechanism for them to be incorporated.
<P>
A second reason may be that someone may seek information from an organisation that seems to be a public body, and then discover that it is not listed in the schedule. We are clearly not talking about Departments—we have established that they will always be there and are comprehensively covered—but about various organisations that hold information that could be of considerable interest to members of the public, campaign groups and even to the media on occasion. It is not beyond our comprehension to imagine that an organisation from which a person seeks information may not be in the list, despite meeting all the criteria in subsections (2) and (3) of the clause.
<P>
The Bill provides a mechanism for the Secretary of State to exercise some discretion as to whether such a body should be added to the list. Amendment No. 10—the perennial old chestnut amendment of
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``leave out `may' and insert `shall' ''—
<P>
</UL></FONT>raises quite a serious point. It flags up the subject of to what extent the Secretary of State should have any discretion as to whether a body that meets the conditions in clause 3 might be added to the schedule.
<P>
With this legislation, we are creating huge expectations. We are encouraging people to seek information. In our deliberations this morning, we openly agreed the need to change the climate of secrecy and to bring a greater openness in all such matters. It is important at this juncture for the Committee to pause and reflect on to what extent there should be an automatic addition to the list once the Secretary of State's attention has been drawn to a body that meets the clause 3 criteria and appears to exercise a function of a public nature, as is referred to in clause 4. I foresee considerable difficulty if a public authority were exposed by someone seeking information as being one that ought to have been included on the list, but was not. The Secretary of State will have no discretion in such matters because, by exercising it, he would be in danger of implying, ``Ah yes, but that person should not have such information''. Such an impression would be given if discretion were exercised not to put the organisation on the list.
<P>
Similarly—this leads me to amendment No. 11—if the Secretary of State's attention is drawn to the fact that the body from which an individual is seeking information exists and should have been included under schedule 1, to what extent should the Secretary of State be under an obligation to put the body on the list as soon as possible? Until it is on the list, the right to access the information will not exist. I can see by the Under-Secretary's reaction to what I am saying that he knows my argument and I shall not labour the point any further, except to say that the clause raises two other minor matters that are worthy of exploration.
<P>
Subsection (4) makes it clear that anyone who ceases to satisfy either of the conditions under subsections (2) or (3) is automatically deleted from the schedule. It must follow therefore that any organisation that meets those conditions should be on the list and that the discretion of the Secretary of State should not arise. If an organisation listed under schedule 1 ceases to satisfy one of the conditions at some future date, it will automatically be withdrawn from the list. But any organisation that is exposed as satisfying both conditions under the clause, but which is not on the list, does not automatically become part of it. I do not follow the logic of that arrangement.
<P>
Finally, the power of the Secretary of State to amend schedule 1 in the first line of clause 3 relates only to parts VI and VII of the schedule, which relates only to organisations in Northern Ireland, and we have already taken on board this morning that that provision may be deleted. The clause does not provide a power to add organisations to parts I to V of the schedule. That is important because there does not seem to be any link between the first three subsections in the clause and subsections (4) and (5), which relate only to parts VI or VII of the schedule. It might be worth clarifying the first line of clause 3. We await the Under-Secretary's explanation.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> Amendment No. 10 would require the Secretary of State to bring under the freedom of information regime any body or office holder, irrespective of other relevant considerations such as the nature of the body or the office, the information that is held and whether that information is accessible elsewhere. The Secretary of State would have to include in schedule 1 bodies such as the security and intelligence services, even though it is a matter of common agreement that it is necessary to exempt all information held by those agencies from the scope of the Bill to preserve their ability to carry out their duties effectively in the interests of the nation.
<P>
In addition, the amendment takes no account of the lifespan of any organisation. A body might come into being, perform its functions and disband before the Secretary of State had a chance to make an order. Indeed, for some inquiries held over weeks or months, that may often happen. The amendment would nevertheless oblige the Secretary of State to make an order and, no doubt, because a non-existent body would be referred to in legislation, to remove that order almost simultaneously. The process could become more than burdensome and bring ridicule on the legislation.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 11 would compel the Secretary of State to act almost immediately to include in schedule 1 a body or office holder as soon as it is brought to his attention that it meets the relevant criteria. I appreciate the reasoning behind the amendment, which would ensure that there is no undue delay in bringing bodies or office holders within the scope of the Bill. The Government are committed to ensuring that the public have a wide-ranging statutory right to access to information, and we have taken the opportunity in the Bill to extend that right widely—indeed, in many ways, more widely than we suggested in the White Paper. We have no difficulty with the principle that rights should be exercisable in full and expeditiously, but the amendment presents some difficulty. We cannot at this stage know how many bodies or office holders that meet the relevant criteria are likely to be created, but the number may be significant. The amendment would almost inevitably lead to the Secretary of State's having to introduce individual orders for each new public body or office. It does not allow sufficient scope effectively to manage the parliamentary process by, for example, allowing several bodies or offices to be included in the same order.
<P>
It is also important to bear in mind the fact that once a body is brought within the scope of the Bill by order, all information that it holds can be disclosed under the Bill. There is, therefore, no prospect of information relating to the time before an order is made being forever inaccessible. I therefore cannot invite the Committee to support the amendments.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale made several other points. Parts I and V describe bodies using generic terms. There is no need to provide a power to add bodies that fall within the generic description. It is likely that any new bodies created in those categories would be created through primary legislation, and it would be possible if necessary to make the necessary amendment in that primary legislation. The primary legislation creating that body could include it in this legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The Under-Secretary has used the term ``generic description'' before, but, unless I am mistaken, clause 2 does not provide a generic description that means that any body that satisfies the first and second conditions in clause 3 would automatically become a public authority. As I read it, the Secretary of State has a discretionary power to add to the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. To some extent, as I suggested in relation to the security and intelligence services, discretion has been provided. In exercising that discretion, the Secretary of State would be disposed not to include in the list, as some might want, the security and intelligence services.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale also made the point that clause 3(4) should require the Secretary of State to make an order to include bodies that meet that condition. We do not want to require him to do that for the security and intelligence services. He may decide not to include in the list some bodies that meet some of the criteria; I have given an example of one. They will be few in number. I suspect that his decision will be publicly acknowledged. It will not be particularly controversial. Yes, there is discretion; and yes, he may choose to exercise it; but there is nothing sinister in it—although that may depend on one's view of the intelligence service. Clause 3(4) deals with the removal of bodies from the Bill; that is done automatically if they cease to meet the conditions. It is a quite different proposition from automatically including any body that meets the conditions, because the Secretary of State may publicly acknowledge that he does not wish to include some bodies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I take it that that is the end of the Under-Secretary's response. As for the intelligence services, the Bill gives such wide-ranging exemptions that no organisation that has their protection should be too worried about being listed. However, that was not my point.
<P>
I do not seek to be churlish, but the Under-Secretary has given us a reasonable reassurance that the list should be as comprehensive as possible and that future bodies will be included in it as their identity becomes known, or as they are created. I agree with the Under-Secretary that a prescriptive approach should be adopted rather than the approach taken in the Human Rights Act 1998, which is what I said at the start, but we may want to return to the matter. What will happen if an individual seeks information from a public body that is not in the list and the Secretaty of State either drags his feet or is not prepared to make the designation? To what extent does that person still have the opportunity to press the matter?
<P>
The comparison between the Bill and the Human Rights Act 1998 is telling. When we debated the 1998 Act, it was the other way round and we were told that the courts would determine the matter. I am not sure whether that is because it is a statutory right and a prescribed list and unless bodies are in the list there is no right. I am not clear whether there would be access to the court in such circumstances. As with all such matters, we are talking in hypothetical terms. It may be that our flagged concern is unfounded. I wanted simply to register the point.
<P>
To speed progress, it might help if I say that it is precisely the same point that we shall make on the amendment to clause 4, which I shall not discuss further because we have exhausted the point. We simply want to register our concern about taking such an approach and encouraging a right to information. It is bound to happen one day that someone will seek information from an organisation that is not in the list and that, as a result, that person will be unable to exercise what he thought were his rights. That is why we believe that it would be better for the Secretary of State not to have the discretion. However, I hear the Under-Secretary's explanation.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Let me make this clear; it is our intention that the normal and proper course of action would be that whenever the Secretary of State became aware of the creation of a new public authority, other than one that could be brought within the ambit of the Bill by its own legislation, he would normally seek to bring it in, with the reasonably managed parliamentary procedures, as quickly as he reasonably could.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad, Dr. Clark, that I persisted a little further because what you have said is extremely helpful. On the basis of what the Under-Secretary has just said, we can draw stumps on the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No.23, in page 2, line 29, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or by another public authority'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 24, in page 2, line 36, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or by another public authority'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Heath:</B> The amendment will continue the discussion that we have just had. I accept entirely the Under-Secretary's assurances that he intends to make the schedule as comprehensive as possible and that the intention of these legislative proposals is to allow for new bodies that are set up to be added to the list as and when they appear.
<P>
The problem is that, as the clause is currently drafted, there is a limit to the Secretary of State's capacity to do that. The clause gives a clear indication that the Secretary of State may do so if a body is set up by legislative proposal, Royal Prerogative or by Ministers or Government Departments, or if Ministers or their Departments make one or more appointments to a body. Difficulties arise if a body is not set up by Government Departments but by a public authority elsewhere. The drafters of these proposals have to some extent already addressed that problem. Schedule 1 provides for joint authorities under the Local Government Act 1985 and there is provision for joint committees under the Local Government Act 1972 and for a joint board, which falls outside those Acts, whose membership will be drawn up by the constituent public authorities.
<P>
However, possibilities exist for the setting up of new bodies which do not derive their membership entirely from public authorities but nevertheless are creatures of public authorities and fall outside those definitions. The amendment's purpose is to allow those bodies to be admitted to the schedule by the Secretary of State to ensure that comprehensive nature.
<P>
It is interesting that because of the way in which government happens in this country, several bodies in London are covered in the schedule because the metropolis has, in parliamentary terms, always had a slightly different way of doing things from the rest of the country. One can imagine entirely analogous organisations elsewhere in the country which could have equally important roles but which under current legislation would not fall within the scope of the schedule.
<P>
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions encourages local authorities to be innovative in their structures, and to look at new ways of delivering services across the public sector. It is not hard to see that with that innovation could come new structures which would fall outside the current definitions, where, for instance, there would be a blurring of the public and private sector participation which would be actively encouraged. That has happened before. When I was in local government there was a time when we were not encouraged to be particularly innovative; instead we were rather encouraged to do as little as possible in the way of innovative thinking. Structures were developed in that period which I believe do not serve a public function directly for the authority, and therefore would not be caught by the later clause provision but which, quite properly, the public would expect to have access to in terms of freedom of information legislation. However, those structures are not wholly constituted of members of local authorities, so they would not fall within the definitions of the joint authorities or joint committees already provided for in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment No. 23 is a probing amendment tabled to discover how the Minister would address the issue of bodies that fall outside the legislation which are wholly or partly constituted by public authorities under the Bill and do not fall within its terms. I should be interested to hear whether the Minister has a mechanism that can be part of the requirements of the Bill.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I have a lot of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. However, the operation of legislation would become tricky. I appreciate that he suggested that the amendment was a probing amendment. The amendments would extend the power of the Secretary of State so that he could add to the list of public authorities subject to the Bill by bringing a far wider range of bodies within its scope.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although the Government are committed to ensuring that as wide a range of public bodies as possible is included in the freedom of information regime, I see several difficulties and risks with the approach proposed in the amendments. I would be interested to know how the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome would approach them.
<P>
The number of bodies that could meet the amended conditions would be massive. Every local authority creates many organisations. Other public authorities such as doctors' surgeries might create consultative committees that we would have to include in all the consultative paraphernalia of creating a mechanism to deal with freedom of information. A school may create a parent-teacher association, which would be a public authority. Under this legislation, that too would have to create a mechanism to deal with the way in which it would provide freedom of information.
<P>
I suspect that there would be no problem with getting information from such bodies, but we might want to think about bringing them within the terms of legislation before we did so by adjusting the broad-based criteria. Some would argue that a parent-teacher committee set up by a school and a consultative committee of patients set up by a general practice surgery might not count as work of a public nature performed by a public authority that ought to be brought within the remit of the Bill. That may be a legitimate subject for debate.
<P>
Furthermore, several bodies that meet the conditions that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome suggests could continue to grow indefinitely. A school might set up a parent-teacher committee, which sets up various sub-committees—a fund-raising committee, a discipline committee, a trip-organising committee. Arguably, all those, depending on what they did, would suddenly be covered by the legislation. The parent-teacher committee would become a public authority under schedule 1, and the other committees would also meet the conditions for inclusion, assuming that appointments were made by the initial committees. The same would apply to any other committees established in turn. Any of those committees could become public authorities subject to all the paraphernalia of freedom of information.
<P>
Inclusion in schedule 1 should be subject to the discretion of the Secretary of State. It may be considered unlikely that he would want to exercise his powers to quite the extent to that all the sub-committees would become involved, but the Government believe that we have provided a framework and regime that will encompass most of the relevant aspects of our public life. It gives the Secretary of State the ability to extend the legislation to areas where there is some public support for freedom of information.
<P>
Clause 3 is specifically intended to cater for the many bodies established through central Government. Other bodies may be designated as public authorities by order-making power in clause 4 if they meet specified conditions, especially if they exercise public functions. The provision is therefore designed to help certain types of organisation. However, if we accepted the hon. Gentleman's amendment, we would be obliged to include matters that it may be better to leave to the Secretary of State's discretion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's explanation. He is a little guilty of a reductio ad absurdam, as he has already resisted an amendment that would have changed ``may'' to ``shall''. Therefore, there is no requirement on the Secretary of State to list everybody that may fall within the definition. As the Under-Secretary resisted such an amendment, I am confident that my amendment would not require—that is an unfortunate word to use, as we have different definitions of ``requiring''—the Secretary of State to list all definitions by virtue of the Bill's wording.
<P>
There is still, potentially, an important lacuna in relation to a public authority set up by another public authority. However, it would be absurd to suggest eventualities that might come about. It would not be far-fetched, for instance, to imagine an important national archive outside the direct control of a public authority, but to which a public authority had access by virtue of joint arrangements. Indeed, such a scenario might be likely, now that there is access to funds from the lottery or elsewhere, and would involve a body with important public functions to which members of the public would quite rightly expect rights of access and information. Nevertheless, that would not fall within the Bill's capacities and could not be properly included in the scope of the schedule.
<P>
The Under-Secretary drew our attention to clause 4, which we have yet to discuss, but which appears to differentiate between a person and a body. Clause 3 makes a separation between an office and a body. Clause 4, however, refers to a ``person''. I shall be reassured if the Under-Secretary tells me that, in that context, a person includes a body, and is a legal body.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien indicated assent.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I see the hon. Gentleman nodding, which reassures me that the Secretary of State will have a mechanism to designate the sort of body that I am discussing. The matter deserves further consideration. However, I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's reply and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 4</center></H4>
<H4><center>Further power to designate public authorities</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> In relation to clause 3, the Under-Secretary had a good stab at listing all the authorities included in schedule 1, and I am sure that he will do better in future. However, there is no such list to guide us in relation to clause 4. Have the Government identified what kind of organisations may be affected by the general description of organisations which, to the Secretary of State, appear to exercise functions of a public nature or provide under contract—perhaps to a public authority—any services within a function of that authority?
<P>
That leads me to my second question—what is a function? I shall return to my previous illustration—because the factual ones are always the best—of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council. Following the Government's announcement that they intended to abolish the council, it subcontracted all its administration to the Institute of Insurance Brokers, of which I am president. If it had not done so, its entire operation would have collapsed. That is common knowledge within the industry. I take it that if the council were to be listed, the administration of a list of insurance brokers could be argued to be a function. The institute is undertaking the sending out of requests for membership fees and the collection and banking of those fees. It receives all the information that insurance brokers have to send to the regulatory body each year in order to comply with the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. The only function that the council continues to reserve to itself is that of the disciplinary proceedings that come into play when things have gone wrong. I would assume that in those circumstances the body concerned is carrying out a function.
<P>
On the other hand, in many organisations work may be subcontracted by a public authority to another body, but that work can in no way be regarded as a part of the function of the authority. There are bound to be grey areas in the middle. For example, if a school subcontracts its canteen services, is it a function of the school to feed the children? I am not sure that it is, but I understand those who argue to the contrary.
<P>
Equally, many local authorities subcontract the provision of home-to-school transport. I expect that you have the same problem in the wilds of Essex, Dr. Clark, that we have in north Yorkshire, in that there are a number of subcontracted school buses. Is that a function of the local authority, which will, of course, automatically be caught by the Bill? If a parent wanted to know how the contract was let, and what arrangements had been made, would they be able to seek that information direct from the contractor? Those are new concepts in the availability of information that we have never had before in this country. That may become one of the legislation's real pluses.
<P>
I hope that I have made it clear that, while we do not necessarily wish to amend the Government's proposals, pertinent questions of definition and intention need to be asked in relation to the number of organisations that the Under-Secretary expects to be affected. Having listened to what he has said, especially during his exchange with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I can now see why it is essential for the Home Secretary to have discretion as to whether to list some of the organisations. However, if one leads people to expect that they can get hold of a certain kind of information, and they then discover that the Home Secretary has taken it upon himself not to designate the body in question, friction may arise. I look forward to the Under-Secretary's response to the matters that I have raised.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The points that the hon. Gentleman has made are good. It is right that we should identify our broad thoughts at this stage of the Bill's passage. I have in my hand a list of some of the organisations that we are currently considering, which are private organisations that carry out functions of a public nature or provide contractual services to a public authority. I shall list some of the organisations, but it is only a draft list and not final, so the organisations that I mention should not take the view that they will be included in the formal list that is put before the House.
<P>
I shall begin with the Lord Chancellor's Department because some of the organisations on the list are obviously private organisations that may carry out public or statutory functions. They include the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Institute of Legal Executives, the Council for Licensed Conveyancers, the Master of the Faculties, Relate, the Family Welfare Association, the Jewish Marriage Council, Marriage Care, the African Caribbean Family Mediation Services, the Tavistock Marital Studies Institute, Reunite and the National Council for abducted children.
<P>
<H5>6.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Home Office list includes bodies that may be contracted by the Secretary of State or subcontracted by the contracter to provide or run a prison or part of a prison in accordance with section 84 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 or who provide prisoner escort and custody services under section 80 of that Act, bodies delivering education services to prisons and prisoners under contract, bodies providing library services to prisoners under contract, bodies providing offender behaviour programmes to prisons and prisoners under contract, bodies participating in the running of prison industries under contract or in partnership with the prison service and bodies participating in the provision of work for prisoners in a joint venture scheme with the prison service. Other organisations include the British Board of Film Classification, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, Documents Evidence Ltd., Forensic Alliance, including the AEA, Technology Cellmark Diagnostics and Forensic Access Organisation, the Immigration Advisory Service, the Jockey Club, the National Greyhound Racing Club, the Refugee Legal Centre, Victim Support and the, video appeals committee. There are others, but I shall give the broad flavour and not list all of them. They include the Horniman museum, which carries out some public functions, and the museum of science and industry in Manchester.
<P>
The Department for Education and Employment list includes the British Academy and Capita Managed Services, which carries out some contractual services of a public nature—the issue is the extent to which its activities would come within the freedom of information provisions. Also included are the Further Education Development Agency, the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the Technology Colleges Trust, and the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. I could continue with a long list of organisations which are being considered—I emphasise that they are only being considered.
<P>
The Foreign Office list includes the Commonwealth Institute, which may become a charity, in which case the impact of that would have to be considered.
<P>
The Department of Health list includes the College of Radiographers, the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicines, the General Dental Council the General Medical Council and medical royal colleges.

<P>

<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Presumably the Benefits Agency and the Child Support Agency will be included on the Department of Social Security list.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> They relate directly to Government Departments, so they would come within the definition of a Government Department. Motability is an example of an independent voluntary organisation which may carry out public functions and within the terms of those public functions may be subject to the legislation. I am choosing my words carefully and saying may be rather than will be.
<P>
Some of the organisations will have to be consulted and we must consider the way in which they carry out their business. The hon. Member for Ryedale suggested an example—the Insurance Brokers Registration Council and the Institute of Insurance Brokers. In so far as they are carrying out a public function or providing contracts to a public authority in relation to the carrying out of that duty, they might come within the terms of the legislation. That is the limitation. We are not seeking to go into areas that are properly the realm of business, and that should remain confidential and private. It is important, however, to indicate that some areas are of a public nature, or provide services of a public nature, and might come within the terms of the legislation. It is useful to tell the Committee the kinds of organisations being considered.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am glad that I asked the question, and I am grateful for the Minister's explanation.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 26, in page 3, line 26, after `owned', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, or controlled,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 27, in page 4, line 2, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2A) For the purposes of this section, a company is controlled by the Crown or by a public authority if it is a body in which Ministers of the Crown, government departments, public authorities or publicly-owned companies (individually or collectively) own at least fifty per cent. of the shares.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> This is a simple amendment, which would extend the principle of the wholly owned public company—one wholly owned by a public authority—to that which is controlled by a public authority. Again, the private finance initiative and the blurring of public and private sectors will make that more and more common. A hybrid company within the control of a public body will have a substantial private sector holding within it. The amendments modestly define a publicly controlled company in that context as one in which a public authority, either individually or collectively, holds at least 50 per cent. of the shares. Often, that will not be the case—the public authority will own less than 50 per cent. of the equity, but it will have effective control of the company through a golden share or other device.
<P>
Clearly, Ministers felt that it was appropriate that publicly owned companies should fall within the Bill's ambit. Publicly controlled companies could be in exactly the same position and perform exactly the same functions yet fall outside the scope of the Bill, simply because current provision does not extend to companies that are controlled by a public authority. That would seem to be a shortcoming in the Bill, and it would seem appropriate to table amendments to address it. I look forward to the Minister's reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The amendments seek to expand the scope of clause 5 to include publicly controlled companies in addition to those that are wholly publicly owned.
<P>
While I am sympathetic to the intention behind the amendments—to increase freedom of information coverage to encompass areas of clear public interest—I cannot accept them. Clause 5 defines a publicly owned company for the purposes of the Bill. It provides for such bodies to be brought automatically within the freedom of information regime. That means that, if a company is wholly owned by either the Crown or, with certain exceptions, any public authority that is listed in schedule 1, it will be caught by the Bill. The clause is a powerful and clear provision that will significantly extend the scope of freedom of information. There will be no doubt about whether a company meets the criteria. No one is likely to challenge whether a wholly owned public company can properly be regarded to be carrying out a public function—that will be self evident.
<P>
In comparison, the situation that the amendments would create is not clear. They would run the serious risk of not carrying the public's automatic support. A wider clause 5 would risk involving many companies without properly considering whether they should be covered. It is by no means evident that the companies that are only partly owned by public authorities are necessarily appropriate candidates for inclusion in the freedom of information regime. I am not satisfied that the amendments contain workable provisions.
<P>
Let us take the case of a company that is 45 per cent. publicly owned. What would happen if a 5 per cent. stake was taken in that company by a medical practitioner in support of his pension fund? Under our provisions, that would automatically bring the company within the scope of the freedom of information regime, but the company would be removed again if there was a change in the doctor's pension plan arrangements. How can a company or a potential applicant be expected to know that its status has changed? Such coverage would create uncertainty among the relevant companies and the public.
<P>
Perhaps the most telling criticism of the amendments is that, in a sense, they are unnecessary. The Bill makes provision for bodies, including companies, that are controlled but not wholly owned by the state to be brought under the Bill's provisions. That involves the order-making power in clause 4 or, if the body meets the conditions that are contained in clause 3, the inclusion arrangements in schedule 1. Clauses 3 and 4 sensibly allow for questions about whether a body should be covered to be considered properly. That is the right way forward.
<P>
For those reasons, I cannot invite the Committee to support the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am interested in the Minister's explanation. I appreciate the slightly odd case involving a marginal holding of 45 per cent or 50 per cent. In this context, we need to consider those who wish to circumvent the Bill's provisions rather than the great majority of public authorities, which will embrace them and support the Bill's spirit. Would not a company that was fully publicly owned quite properly fall under the Bill's provisions and be subject to the freedom of information regime? Could that be avoided by, as it were, disposing of the small or token part-ownership of a company? That would avoid the need to apply the clause's provisions. The Minister seemed to suggest that, in that situation, the Secretary of State would apply the provisions of clause 4 to the company and, despite the fact that it was no longer wholly owned, bring it back within the scope of the Bill. If that is his argument, my amendment may be redundant.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I did not say that the Secretary of State would do that; I said that it would be open to him to bring that organisation, for the period during which it was partly owned, within the scope of the Bill. That is a matter for the Secretary of State to determine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I am grateful for that explanation. However, that still begs a question. What is the difference between a company that is held 100 per cent by a public authority and one which is clearly controlled by a public authority, but which involves shareholdings elsewhere? It does not seem particularly logical for the Government to argue that there is a difference in kind between two identical companies that have a slightly different pattern of share ownership, rather than control. However, I shall not prolong proceedings, because I doubt whether we shall progress much further with that argument. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 4, leave out lines l2 and 13.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No 44, in page 4, line 14, leave out `or amending'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> This is an important amendment that deals with a power that has crept into the Bill. The Secretary of State will have the discretion to exclude large areas from public scrutiny, with only the merest nod towards parliamentary proprieties. I am worried that the provision will undermine the Bill's intentions. Through a negative resolution procedure that is subject only to such scrutiny as the House can provide, the Secretary of State will be granted sweeping powers effectively to exclude from the Bill's scope the activities of public authorities across a wide area defined only by the Secretary of State.
<P>
I do not know in which circumstances the Under-Secretary envisages that the provision will be used. He may say that it is to be used in contexts similar to those that we discussed in relation to the Bank of England. He said that some of the Bank's activities should fall outside the scope of the Bill, and one could argue that private banking functions, for example, are a case in point. Where the Secretary of State assumes the power to exclude from the Bill many of the activities of public bodies, the Bill should at least afford effective scrutiny of such decisions. Ideally, such powers should not be granted. It should not be within the Secretary of State's discretion to exclude bodies that, according to Parliament, fall within the scope of the Bill by virtue of its enactment.
<P>
Amendment No. 44 would remove the words ``or amending'' because, as drafted, the clause will not only allow the Secretary of State to lift an existing limitation but to amend it. It is proper to empower the Secretary of State to lift a limitation if he so wishes, because that is in the spirit of a Bill whose overall thrust must be the provision of as much information as possible. It would be improper for a limitation to remain in force where it was no longer appropriate. However, I question whether the Bill should empower the Secretary of State to amend a limitation, rather than remove it or part of it, because ``amending'' suggests that the existing limitation will be replaced with some form of new limitation.
<P>
That may run entirely counter to Parliament's intentions in enacting the Bill or to its intentions at the time that the change in the limitation was made.
<P>
We should give serious consideration to the extent to which the Bill gives the Secretary of State scope for taking decisions that would not, I hope, be arbitrary—no Secretary of State should behave in an arbitrary way—but that would necessarily not be given the same degree of consideration that the inclusion in the schedules of classes of bodies or individual bodies would be given during the course of the Bill's parliamentary progress.
<P>
I repeat—the provision was not in the draft Bill; it has been introduced since then. There must be a reason why the Secretary of State feels that he must have this power at his disposal. The Committee should know what that reason is and decide whether the power is appropriate, given that it has the potential to undermine the entire principle of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Clause 6 is an important part of the Bill. When I first read it and considered how it should be amended, the interpretation that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome put upon it—which has also been described in a briefing note from the Campaign for Freedom of Information—did not cross my mind. My impression was that the clause is relatively benign. However, the more that I have considered it today, the more I have formed the view that, while its intention is benign, there is a degree of ambiguity in its drafting. The acknowledgement that the Under-Secretary has just given suggests that he is about to explain that our fears are unfounded. That would be a welcome reassurance.
<P>
However, under the interpretation that was described by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, the clause appears to give the Secretary of State the power to delete whole sections of public information from public authorities that are listed in schedule 1. Perhaps the matter can be clarified by referring to the first line of clause 6, which begins:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Where a public authority is listed in Schedule 1''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot believe that the Under-Secretary intends the bodies that are listed in parts I to V of schedule 1 to fall within that category. My impression is that it refers to the bodies that are listed in parts VI and VII, where there may be a case for having limited information access because much of the information would not be of any public interest. That would be beneficial to the organisations concerned. We have not yet considered in detail the Bill's potentially horrendous implications for many organisations in terms of increased bureaucracy, to which I briefly referred in an intervention this morning. If the intention is to avoid unnecessary work, and to allow access to only that information in which the public would generally have an interest, I would have no quibble with that. That is the interpretation of the clause that I first took to be the case.
<P>
Can the Under-Secretary clarify—not necessarily today—which parts of schedule 1 could be caught by the clause? If he were to say that any part could be caught, the concerns that were expressed by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome would be well founded, because technically speaking a Government Department could be included—``Any government department'' is the first category listed in part I of schedule 1. I cannot conceive that the Government would seek to limit, through an amendment to schedule 1, information relating to such public authorities. I suspect that the wording is capable of alternative interpretation, and that some ambiguity may exist. We are comfortable with what we think is the Government's intention. If there is doubt, however, I hope that the Minister will at least agree to think about the wording, and find one that is more satisfactory and reassuring to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> I hope that I can assure the Committee that this is a benign and sensible clause, and that the fears expressed about it are entirely unfounded. The reporting of the clause in The Guardian today verged on paranoia—it was way over the top.
<P>
The clause is necessary and relatively innocuous, and I shall provide a couple of examples of that. It is necessary to give the Secretary of State power to amend schedules as functions of public bodies change, new ones are created and others cease to exist. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry is an example of a body that was created, altered and ceased to exist. Certain of its functions might have been the subject of the freedom of information legislation. The BBC gives rise to other examples of restriction on the nature of information that may be subject to freedom of information. It is a good example because information held for the purposes of journalism, art or literature is not covered by the Bill. In general, it is right that the BBC, as a public body, should be covered by the Bill. We must ensure, however, that its journalistic integrity is not undermined by the legislation. All Committee members would agree with that. While I have been in Committee, my pager has been working, albeit quietly, and it appears that the National Union of Journalists has been busy calling me. I suspect that it is concerned about the need for a clarification provision within the legislation.
<P>
Freedom of information might inadvertently be applied under some parts of the Bill. A common agreement might exist, such as that for BBC journalists, whereby information collated could not be demanded under the Bill The Secretary of State should be able to clarify that. From time to time, other bodies might need to be included in the schedule because of certain functions, while the functions of bodies already in the schedule might need to be removed from or added to the scope of the legislation. Powers under clause 6 permit such good housekeeping, but those powers cannot be used in the broad-based way that was suggested, for instance, in The Guardian today. Parliamentary controls would prevent that happening—proposals would be subject to the negative resolution procedure, under which there is inherent scrutiny—and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments would be able to consider any provision. If it is being suggested, in a paranoid way, that the Home Secretary might introduce the Bill and then pass further legislation by way of negative resolution to subvert it, that is in the realm of absurdity.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
What we have are proper provisions under which the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments would be able to examine the matter. Any hon. Member would have 40 days in which to consider the order, and if it were objectionable could pray to bring it before the House. If the Secretary of State tried to make an order which would destroy the purpose of the Bill, the Joint Committee would report that as unusual or unexpected, if using parliamentary language, or, if using unparliamentary language, would say that the Secretary of State had gone mad. That will not happen. We are discussing reasonableness in the context of the way in which we do things in the House.
<P>
Some have suggested that a less responsible Government might take a different view. Under our unwritten constitution, Governments are always subject to the law and no Parliament can bind a later Parliament. Abstinence from abuse of power has always been one of the key requirements of Government under our unwritten constitution. We cannot overcome in the Bill all the doubts, concerns and paranoias felt by some people about Government, but we must put in place good housekeeping provisions, allow functions to be clarified, to protect journalistic integrity—as in the case of the BBC and perhaps the Stephen Lawrence inquiry—and enable the Secretary of State to adjust to changes in circumstances as organisations and functions change.
<P>
The clause does not have the dramatic implications that some have suggested, but it is a fairly mundane and benign provision. I hesitate to use the word modest because I used it during a BBC interview at lunchtime and was told that Jonathan Swift referred to a modest provision in ``Gulliver's Travels'' and it was to chop off people's heads. I shall avoid the word and say that it is a good housekeeping provision, which does not merit the fear and concern that some have expressed. I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I did not find the Under-Secretary's reply convincing. His intention may be benign and his purpose may be purely housekeeping, but he should reconsider the provision because it is ill drafted. It allows the Secretary of State to delete any area of information from any part of any organisation listed in schedule 1. It is not paranoia to say that that could happen. The fact is that the Secretary of State is taking those powers. It is no good the Under-Secretary saying that no Secretary of State would want to use those powers. If that were so, they should not be in the Bill. The Under-Secretary must work a little harder. His point about housekeeping and remaining up to date and relevant was reasonable, but he must redraft the provision to achieve that without giving those extraordinary powers.
<P>
This is not a question of paranoia or of malign Secretaries of State. There is no point in listening to the House pass legislation that does things that it does not need to do. Members on both sides of the Committee accept the good faith of the Minister when he says that the intention of the clause is benign, but the Bill should reflect that. He must take it back before Report, or on Report, and draft proposals that achieve his aim, to replace those that at present greatly exceed his intentions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I shall try to be an honest broker between the Under-Secretary, his hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome. I believe that the intention of the clause is benign, but the suggestion that subsection (3) gives sweeping powers, which, in the Under-Secretary's own words, no sane Secretary of State would ever use, is a matter of concern to the Committee.
<P>
I return briefly to a point that I made to the Under-Secretary to which he did not specifically respond—I do not criticise him for that, because we have asked him a great many questions today. I asked whether there may be scope for amending the measure to limit its application to those parts of schedule 1 in which the organisations to which it could apply are listed. Earlier the Under-Secretary cited the BBC and the Bank of England, and there are compelling reasons why there could have to be a restriction on the information available in those bodies listed in part VI of schedule 1.
<P>
However, I cannot see why such powers need to exist in respect of a limitation on a Government Department, an education authority or a local authority. Surely the object of the measure is to encourage all information relating to those organisations to be made available. In any event, those bodies would still have all the class exemptions, and the other exemptions in the Bill, available to them. There is, therefore, a case for the Under-Secretary agreeing to take a fresh look at this matter. I am reassured by what he said in terms of intention, but I do not see why the clause has to be drawn as widely as it appears to be, especially in subsection (3).

<P>

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> First, I shall deal with the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. He said, in an unnecessarily truculent way, that the measure allows the Secretary of State to take it upon himself to delete areas of information. The wording of clause 6(3) is plain. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State may by order amend Schedule 1''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Secretary of State must bring an order before the House to effect such amendments.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman ignores the way in which Parliament would ensure that it protects itself, its rights and its ability to pass legislation, which is respected by the Secretary of State. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments examines these matters. Any Member of the House has can pray against an order. The House can intervene and deal with issues involving an abuse of power by a Secretary of State. This is not a case of a Secretary of State taking on to himself the ability to act in contravention of the will of Parliament. He does not have that power, and this clause does not give him that power. It enables him, with the consent of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, to make changes that amount to mere good housekeeping. To suggest that the Secretary of State intends to do more than that is not justified.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central and the hon. Member for Ryedale have said that we need to constrain the clause. I shall review the points that have been made and consider whether we could provide further reassurance about our intentions. The clause's intention is entirely benign—it is merely a good-housekeeping measure. Our proposals, and the protections that will ensure that no Secretary of State can abuse the power, should reassure Committee members that our intentions are as we have stated them to be. The Bill makes it clear that the provisions involve good housekeeping and attempt to meet the House's wishes.
<P>
I have heard what Committee members have said, but I do not think that their arguments are justified. However, I shall consider the matter again and establish whether we can achieve the same purpose in a way that does not raise unnecessary and unfounded—and, in many ways, paranoid—fears.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath:</B> I do not think that the hon. Member for Stoke on-Trent, Central expressed himself in an unnecessarily truculent way. If the slightest hint of truculence was present, it may have been necessary to make it clear to the Under-Secretary that we do not question whether his intentions are benign or what he and the present Secretary of State intend to do—their intentions are transparently clear. The issue is about whether the Bill's provisions will be eroded, and the Under-Secretary failed to convince me that they will not be. The Bill therefore contains a significant failing.
<P>
If the Bill's drafting is kept as it is, every bureaucrat and official who is worth his salt will queue up at the Secretary of State's door to tell him why parts of their work should not be covered by the Bill. The current Under-Secretary and Secretary of State may say, ``On your bike,'' but a future Minister may not do so. I cannot believe that there are not better and more restrictive ways to carry out good housekeeping without risking an erosion of the Bill's basic principles.
<P>
Earlier, we discussed the fact that we do not have a constitution in this country. This Bill is the nearest that we shall get to a piece of legislation that has a constitutional effect, and I should hope that future Parliaments will respect the present Parliament's intentions. If they do not, that decision should be the subject of proper parliamentary debate.
<P>
The Under-Secretary may have specific problems in mind—he mentioned several times the role of journalists and he accused them of paranoia. However, I wonder whether he has a slightly paranoid view of journalists.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that I have an entirely benign view of journalists.
<P>
<B>Mr Heath:</B> I am sure that the Under-Secretary is glad to clarify the position.
<P>
If the Under-Secretary is aware of potential difficulties, he should raise them in Committee or on Report. We must make the provisions as near perfect as we can. If changes have to be made to bodies that are currently listed in schedule 1, in addition to the classes of exempt information that are in the Bill, that aspect should be subject to greater scrutiny than is currently available.
<P>
I am not convinced that the provision is in the long-term interest of ensuring access to information held by public bodies. It is a matter to which we must return at a later stage, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will do so. If a more appropriate proposal is not found, we shall have to ask the opinion of the House. However, for the moment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 4, line 33, at end add—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(8) The Secretary of State shall not designate information as ``excluded information'' by order pursuant to subsection (7) unless he reasonably believes that the disclosure of such information would be against the public interest.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Subsections (6) and (7) provide a mechanism for the Secretary of State to make an order excluding certain information from the provisions of the Bill in respect of publicly owned companies. The amendment is a probing amendment, through which we want to ask the Under-Secretary about the intention behind the provision. The powers that will be granted to the Secretary of State will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, but, in seeking such powers, what does he have in mind? What will constitute excluded information? Why does the Secretary of State need such powers to exclude information, given that the Bill will provide other exemptions, including those relating to matters of commercial confidentiality. As we are discussing publicly owned companies, perhaps it is such matters that the Secretary of State has in mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Clause 6 will provide for public authorities to be brought within the scope of the Bill in respect of certain information that the public authority holds, but not in respect of other types of information. The clause will provide an order-making power to allow the Secretary of State to add or amend an entry in schedule 1 accordingly.
<P>
I accept that, as the hon. Member for Ryedale has said, amendment No. 13 is a probing amendment, but I have two major difficulties with it. It is concerned with the Secretary of State's powers to make an order in relation to publicly owned companies, and would prevent him from designating information held by a publicly owned company as ``excluded information'' unless he believed that disclosing that information would be against the public interest.
<P>
The first difficulty is that the amendment is concerned only with the order making power as it relates to publicly owned companies. In effect, it would treat such companies differently from other authorities that are brought into schedule 1.
<P>
My second concern is that the amendment is unnecessary, in so far as it would impose an entirely different requirement to consider the public interest when excluding information. The Secretary of State will be required to have regard to the purposes of the Bill when specifying information as excluded, including the public interest served by disclosure. In that sense, the Secretary of State will have to consider the public interest in any event, but he must also have regard to the legitimate interests of the bodies concerned, which will compete in a commercial environment. It would be irresponsible to preclude consideration of this aspect and a number of companies and proper commercial activities could be unduly prejudiced, so we need to frame the clause in this way. I therefore hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment. I note that he described it as probing, and I hope that I have dealt with some of his concerns. We cannot provide many concrete examples—
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Try one.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If we knew which information was concerned, we would have to make special provision, as we have done in relation to the Bank of England. We must, however, be careful not to overburden business organisations operating in a commercial setting. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree with that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary. I am not entirely sure that we have thrashed out the point to its complete conclusion. I take seriously what he said about not burdening companies, and perhaps we can return to the matter. It is possible that the whole of clause 6 needs to be reappraised. In view of the fact that the Committee may have had enough for one day, I shall not press the matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Further consideration adjourned.—[Mr. Mike Hall.]
