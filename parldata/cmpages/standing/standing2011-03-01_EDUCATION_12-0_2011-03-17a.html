wish to return to Members’ concerns about young carers in
relation to the clause. I agree with them that support for young carers
is crucial. As I said this morning, there is already a legal
requirement in the Education and Inspections Act 2006 that disciplinary
penalties must be reasonable in all circumstances, and additional
legislation would do little to help such children. The current
requirement for 24 hours’ written notice does not guarantee that
alternative arrangements can be made to cover their caring
responsibilities. The key issue, as hon. Members have said, is that
teachers are able to recognise which children are carers and make the
necessary arrangements to support them in all aspects 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 446<a class="bkMark" name="Column446">&#160;</a>
                           </div>of their education, including arranging any disciplinary penalties in a
way that does not undermine their caring
responsibilities.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000022">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I accept that a responsible
teacher would act in that way, but does the Minister agree that there
is strong evidence that teachers in schools are not always fully aware
of the home situation of young carers, and that at least if there were
24 hours’ notice, there would be a chance for the young carer to
try to make some alternative arrangements with relatives and so
on?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000023">&#160;</a>

                              </span>
                           </strong> I understand that point, but we have to go further
than that and ensure that we put in place strategies to enable schools
to identify who the young carers are. It was only on Wednesday last
week that Moira Fraser from the Princess Royal Trust for Carers said to
me that until we know who the young carers are, we cannot do much to
support them, which reflects the hon. Gentleman’s
intervention.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000024">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Legislation
is not the answer in this case. I urge those Members who raised the
issue to look at the work that the Government have done and are doing
on issues affecting young carers. The Government’s carers
strategy, “Recognised, valued and supported: Next steps for the
Carers Strategy”, encourages local authorities to consider
adopting the memorandum of understanding, “Working together to
support young carers”, which states that no care package should
rely on a young person taking on inappropriate caring
roles.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000025">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
Department for Education is working closely with the Department of
Health to provide the National Young Carers Coalition with a healthy
schools e-learning module that will help schools to identify and
support young carers. The Government are also working closely with
voluntary organisations such as the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and
the Children’s Society which will receive funding over the next
two years through my Department’s new voluntary and community
sector grant
programme.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000026">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that hon. Members will agree, given the safeguards that are in
place, that we should trust head teachers to make appropriate and
reasonable decisions about notice to parents of a detention, taking

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his response. It is only
fair that I should say at the outset that when a little piece of
detailed policy suffers a little under intense scrutiny, there is often
a temptation for a Minister to move into an unfocused, existential,
generalist rant about something. I may have ranted at the beginning of
this morning’s
debate—<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000028">&#160;</a>

whether that is true, but the Minister may have responded in kind with
his implicit accusation that people on this side of the House do not
care about behaviour and discipline in schools. Of course we do. In
fact, the record shows quite clearly the measures that were taken

                           </div>by the previous Government to strengthen this, as we will see once we
get out of the party rhetoric and return to the measure we are talking
about—the clause, the amendments and the detail of it—and
away from the existential crisis, the idea that the country is going to
hell in a handcart, that seems to emerge whenever we probe the detail
of the Government’s behaviour

have had a good debate, as you have said, Mr Williams. We

Committee says that we are more liberal now. I am not sure that this
really qualifies as a liberal measure; I suppose it depends on which
flexible definition of that term one chooses in order to define
one’s philosophy. Not to prolong matters any further, I will not
press amendments 40, 41, 42 and 44 to a vote, but I ask the Committee
to join me in voting for amendment 43. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

                           </strong> Clause 6 repeals the duty to enter into behaviour
and attendance partnerships. If I were being unkind to the Minister,
which I do not want to be—I assume that he is replying to
this—I would launch into an existential rant at this point about
the world going to hell in a handcart because of the way he is diluting
the previous Government’s commitment to behaviour. The previous
Government created a duty, as recommended by Sir Alan Steer in his
independent report to the Government on behaviour, to enter into
behaviour and attendance partnerships. I could also go down the route
of accusing the Minister of being weak on behaviour, but he will be
relieved to know that I shall not do so. Instead, I will focus on the
detail of the proposal and our
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000063">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment is to prevent the abolition and repeal taking
effect—if the Government are absolutely intent on ramming the
measure through using their majority in both Houses—until
behaviour and attendance partnerships have had a chance to get up and
running fully across the country. I recognise that partnership working
by its very nature requires co-operation, but I also recognise that in
order to kick-start productive partnership working a bit of stick is
required. Sometimes a duty needs to be created to get something
embedded thoroughly into the culture of a system. The amendment would
ensure that behaviour and attendance partnerships become thoroughly
embedded across the country and aims to avoid the risk of issues
arising in areas without behaviour and attendance
partnerships.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000064">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
recall the creation of grant-maintained schools back in the 1980s and
1990s, when a culture was created that meant schools were deeply in
competition with each other, rather than being part of a family of
schools, serving the children, young people and families of those
communities. Often, that led to some extremely unhealthy outcomes in
terms of behaviour policies, exclusions and so on. The advantage of
behaviour and attendance partnerships is that there is a commitment on
the part of all schools in an area to work together to tackle some of
these issues. When that happens, schools become more empowered to deal
with the issues. Unlike the Minister, I feel that a concern about
making sure that we have good standards of behaviour and attendance in
our schools is shared across the House. Instead of creating a
fragmented system, the Government should be working hard to make sure
that schools are working in partnership with each other and with other
bodies best to meet the needs of local students, their families and the
local community.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000065">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Partnerships
create capacity by enabling groups of schools to employ specialist
staff—whether that relates to the psychiatric support that might
be required or to social workers, parent support workers and so on.
Individual schools can struggle to do that on their own often because
there is a lack of economy of scale—or, indeed, financial
economies of scale—in the expertise that is required. That
position is certainly supported by the National Union of Teachers,
which told us that<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“Behaviour
partnerships have worked well in most areas…Partnership working
between schools and alternative provision including short stay schools
and special schools is a positive way in which staff can work more
effectively together to support pupils in managing their own behaviour

schools to facilitate ‘managed moves’ with the least
disruption to the
pupil.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000445">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>For
all those reasons, this kind of partnership is very important,
particularly for small schools and primary schools. The clause exposes
the fact that, in thinking about the matter, the Government have not
given deep enough thought to the needs of the small primary schools for
which this kind of partnership can be extremely
important.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000067">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
clause exposes a lack of coherence in the Government’s thinking.
On the one hand, for example, they say that they are trying to create
academy chains of schools, which is to be welcomed. On the other hand,
they are effectively downgrading—watering down and sending out a
signal—about the concept of school partnerships. We need schools
to be able to deal with their own problems, wherever that is humanly
possible, but they should also ensure that structures are in place to
get the support of other schools, should they need
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000068">&#160;</a>

that exists. The duty is important and the Government should think very
carefully before they withdraw it. Children and their families are
entitled to a good quality service from the local schools, wherever

NASUWT was backed up by the NUT, which said that the requirement that
maintained schools and academies must co-operate with each
other—with at least one partner, anyway—for the purpose
of promoting good behaviour and discipline among pupils was an
important
one.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000075">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
NAS was worried that the removal of the duty for a school to be
involved in a behaviour and attendance partnership constituted a
retrograde step and undermined a cohesive and co-operative approach to
sharing responsibility for pupil behaviour. Its fear was that schools
that acted in isolation from other schools to tackle issues of pupil
indiscipline could adversely impact on local communities, because it
would mean that there was not a joined-up approach to antisocial
behaviour or to truancy. For that reason, it felt that the clause that
the Government have introduced was not in the public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000076">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Schools have a
responsibility to the community. Most accept that and most behave well
in trying to discharge that responsibility. However, sometimes it is
not discharged well. I have certainly seen that happen in my
professional career. Such a duty is important because, without it, the
impact on schools, communities and pupils can be severe. Partnerships
lead to schools establishing and following a code of conduct in the
interests of all, and the amendment would ensure that those
partnerships are well in place and working properly before the
Government abolish the duty if they are intent on doing so. I commend
it to the

necessarily make them work and that voluntary participation was needed.
However, everyone agreed on the importance of co-ordination and working
together. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, as long as the message

question. We must remember that the duty was not something that the
previous Government introduced lightly. I understand the concern of the
Minister not to introduce over-bureaucratic burdens on schools and head
teachers. It was a duty recommended by Sir Alan Steer as part of his
work on behaviour and attendance. I visited his school while he was
still a head teacher and saw his work on behaviour and attendance, and
I must say how impressive it was. He certainly never gave up on anyone
despite their difficult backgrounds and problems that they had
experienced as young people, often leading them to achieve tremendous
results. We did not introduce the duty to put a bureaucratic burden on
schools, but because Sir Alan Steer asked us to introduce it. The duty
has not really been given a chance to work by the Government, so it
should not be taken away. However, if they insist on its removal, we
must know the consequences, so we will be happy to support the hon.

October 2010, the Government made the sensible decision to free schools

general drift of giving greater trust, power and autonomy to head

together, when they might not naturally wish to do so. We need to
remember that, although the Government are removing the requirement,
they are not abolishing behaviour and attendance partnerships. They are
not saying that schools should not co-operate. They are not saying that
schools should not find common sense ways of working together, whether
on managing moves or academy change. I guess that we will hear from the

White Paper proposed the piloting of a new approach to managing
permanent exclusions, whereby schools would be held accountable for the
pupils they exclude. We have discussed that already in the Committee,
or we have discussed the possible incentives that that would create for
schools to behave in positive ways and more negative ways. Of course,
if that piloted approach were to be extended more widely, that would be
likely to act as a disincentive to exclusion, but would perhaps
encourage schools to work more in partnership
together.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000096">&#160;</a>

framework that set up the right incentives for people to behave in the
right way, and which, in general, led to that, then that would be a
better situation than one in which we, sitting at this level of
Government, prescribed precisely how people should behave. Therefore I
hope—though I am by no means certain, which is why I tabled my
amendment—that the Government will be able to correct that
framework and have those positive outcomes, but my amendment suggests a
review to find out, on the ground, whether that does
deliver.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000097">&#160;</a>

very rude about the suggestion that schools should remain responsible
for excluded pupils—extremely rude about it, as I recall,
suggesting that it was entirely crazy. There are difficulties, but if
the pilot were to become more general—we have discussed that
already—then that continuing responsibility, and the fact that
the cost of alternative provision is so high, would hopefully lead to
very early intervention. I hope that that would lead schools to
co-operate with other schools in the surrounding area. I hope that they
would seek to maintain partnerships with nearby schools at which
children might be more likely to be happy, well adjusted and able to
learn.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000099">&#160;</a>

Education Committee heard mixed evidence, so compulsion to participate
may not be the right answer. The Government and the Minister need to
send out a clear message that the measure is not a signal that we think
every school should be atomistically fighting only for itself, and
should put its head down and solve only its own problems. When it comes
to behaviour and discipline, co-operation with other schools is a
strength. Such co-operation should not only be between schools that are
dealing with same cohort; secondary schools should work with primary
schools, and they should have consistent policies. The great message
from Alan Steer, and everyone else who has ever looked at behaviour and
discipline, is that we need consistency. When we walk into a school, we
should see on every classroom, board, and whiteboard: “This is
how we do things here.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000100">&#160;</a>

many children kick off when they move to secondary school and go into
an alien environment. We should create consistency between primary and
secondary schools, so that such transition is less challenging. The
more we build co-operation and a smooth path for young people, the more
we are likely to promote good behaviour, and thus learning and so
on.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000101">&#160;</a>

the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness, who is starting to arrive
at some of the same concerns that we have about some of the changes,
and their implications in reality. There is a difference between
arguing for what we would like to see happen and how we get there. If
everyone agrees that partnership working and collaboration between
schools is a good and helpful thing, duties to work in those sorts of
ways are not restricting—they are empowering, because they
ensure that everyone participates and every area benefits from the
positive results of people working together.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000106">&#160;</a>

the Government believe that partnership is a good thing. I am sad to
see that the amendment I have tabled is not in the group, because it
relates to my experience on the ground of people working together,
particularly on gang violence and gang behaviour, and the implications
of those not only for schools, but for the wider community outside the
school gates. From my experience, we cannot resolve such issues within
a school alone, or even within a small partnership with a number of
schools. In areas where there are several schools that face challenging
issues in the locality, such partnerships allow people to get to grips
with what happens inside the classroom as well as outside the school
gates.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000107">&#160;</a>

discussion on Tuesday was about how to deal with young people who have
challenging backgrounds, who exhibit challenging behaviour in the
classroom, and for whom teachers may find it difficult to find an
appropriate learning environment. The danger is that the way in which
the Bill approaches exclusions will be used increasingly as a way of
dealing with those concerns, rather than looking for other ways of
working with those children and understanding that, often, the child is
not on their own and that there may be other impacts on, and other
people involved in, their behaviour that need to be addressed and that
may not be directly in the school

repealing behaviour and attendance partnerships, all of the things that
we agreed on Tuesday about the importance of early intervention and of
working with other services, and about being able to get schools to
work in that way, are undermined. That is exactly what behaviour and
attendance partnerships have started to do. They have started to bring
people together to work in that whole-school and, indeed, whole-family
approach—which is what the Government say they are concerned
about—to look at how they might deal not only with challenging
behaviour in the classroom, but with young people with special
educational needs, and to look at schools and their environments in a
locality and to see which would best suit them. I think that is why a
wide range of people who work in education are expressing concern about
the clause. I am mindful in particular of the comments of the NASUWT,
which believes that it would be a retrograde step, particularly for
those schools dealing with particularly challenging behaviour. I am
afraid that I do not have the specific reference to hand and am sure

Gentleman has now decided against anything we do from the centre that
might encourage or facilitate that and show the seriousness with which
we treat such issues and think they might be done more effectively.
This is not about a single school acting on its own. For every school
that wants to work with others, there may be another school that will
do that only once such actions are taken seriously and seen as a duty
and something that should be prioritised. Many Labour Members feel that
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000121">&#160;</a>

particularly in a locality, challenging behaviour cannot be dealt with
by a single school. Even with the best will in the world and the most
energetic and engaging head teacher, a school needs not only other
schools but the local authority, social services, youth work services
and police to help it and take its issues seriously. The duties reflect
not an obligation but a seriousness about those kinds of

want to work within the communities that they serve and with other
schools to be innovative and creative. If there are problems in a
locality and some schools do not wish to work in that way, that can
exacerbate the challenges faced by all schools. We will all benefit by
making this a duty and stating that such a measure is important. The
commitment to dealing with behaviour, and giving schools options other
than exclusion for young people who express challenging behaviour in
the classroom, is important. We will all benefit from such
co-ordination. The hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness may be
concerned about my socialist tendencies, but I want every young person
to benefit from a school system that works in that way. We must work at
a national level and say that this matters and that we want every
school to be part of that process. Every pupil should be involved in a
school that looks at behaviour in the classroom and takes it

for reforming how the process works and for asking what best practice
is and why it matters to have every school around the table. It is not
an argument for saying, “Let’s just wait and see what

Does he take the same approach to safeguarding issues? There are some

co-operation to people involved in safeguarding issues, which may not

us who have dealt with gang issues in our local area in Walthamstow and
Waltham Forest, the partnerships developed with the police and youth
and social services are just the start of attempts to deal with very
challenging problems. It would be a retrograde step to take schools out
of the mix. I accept that good schools would want to be a part of that
partnership, which is why they do not see such a duty as onerous. Hence
why you are seeing genuine bewilderment, from people working with young
people in the behaviour sector, about the Government putting at risk
the work that has been done so far.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000136">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is worth
looking at the terms of reference for behaviour and attendance
partnerships to see what they do, and ask coalition Members whether
they really do not think that the issues are important. Those terms of
reference include improving the overall standards of behaviour in
schools; reducing rates of persistent absence; developing more positive
pupil behaviour so that it can make a strong contribution to learning;
reducing the number of permanent and multiple fixed-term exclusions and
the incidence of differential rates of exclusion; and reducing
persistent absence by pupils with special educational needs,
looked-after children, and pupils from particular ethnic groups. If
those are not important issues, and if it is not worth saying that we
want schools to work together despite knowing that it will make a
difference for them, I question the Government’s commitment to
dealing with behaviour in schools and to those working with children
with special educational needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000137">&#160;</a>

reference of behaviour and attendance partnerships allow bringing the
voluntary sector and the police into the mix. That kind of activity
could not be possible without partnership, because it is an onerous
task to co-ordinate it on your own. Head teachers
dealing with a range of issues in communities like mine welcome the
opportunity to work together and share the burden of organising such

that they would say, “We are sure it will happen anyway”,
rather than making sure it happens since the benefits to the young
people and schools involved far outweigh any concern about having to
organise meetings. Why not get involved in reforming them and call for
a review of what the practice is and say that we want to see it

those young people. I know that the Member for Grantham and Stamford
does not find this interesting; I invite him to come to Walthamstow and
see for himself the challenges that we have been dealing with, in terms
of gangs, and the roles played by safer schools partnerships and the

repealing it reduces bureaucracy, but I think that is partly because
Opposition Members do not understand how behaviour partnerships work.
In my experience, we are not talking about a
roomful of people, or every school, having to turn out. It is not a
bureaucratic burden on schools that takes up time. In my experience,
the only people for whom it is compulsory are specialists from the
local authority, child and adolescent mental health services, or social
care. School head teachers told us in the Select Committee that when
there is a crisis, they are desperate to get those people in the
room.<a class="bkMark" name="11031829000001">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Oh, they did not introduce it. Nevertheless, the
partnerships are not an onerous bureaucratic burden on schools. Most
behaviour partnerships have a rota, and head teachers turn up according
to that rota, if they wish to. Those head teachers who are desperately
in need of support and help will turn up because they have a crisis.
Most schools are very keen to get involved. Nevertheless, as we saw
earlier, even with partnerships that work very well, there have been
occasions when schools have not been keen to be involved and have not
turned up. In most cases, those are the schools that are excluding the
most.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000145">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is absolutely correct: the
commencement of the order in question was revoked by a statutory
instrument in September last year. The duty was introduced, on the
recommendation of Sir Alan Steer, because the partnerships, which the
previous Government had encouraged through exhortation and positive
policy, had broadly reached a stage of acceptance across the piece. Sir
Alan Steer felt that creating a duty would ensure that everybody
participated, and that the practice was embedded in the system. Does my
hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham agree that that shows that
we are not talking about an onerous duty, but one which would complete
a

                        <p class="tabbed">Behaviour
partnerships were introduced as a result of a crisis. There were rising
numbers of exclusions. In the early part of the 21st century, we faced
a real crisis. I remember being placed in a local
authority—“placed” is the operative word; I did
not go there voluntarily—with many challenges. Shortly after I
arrived, it had its 149th permanent exclusion—and a person could
spit from one end of the authority to the other. The situation was out
of control. Behaviour partnerships came out of schools and local
authorities. They did not come from Alan Steer; they came from looking
at good practice. The first thing we had to do was analyse those
permanent exclusions and look at where they came from. We then invited
the head teachers and chairs of governors from the three highest
excluding schools to come and meet us. It was an interesting meeting,
because they took very different approaches to it. One head teacher
came in with huge piles of paper; he was determined to convince us that
every permanent exclusion was justified. I remember saying to him,
“I don’t for one second disagree that the incident that
led to the permanent exclusion was justified. I am interested in what
you did that led up to that, and what you did to prevent that
happening.” Other head teachers came in and simply said,
“We need help. We accept that it is out of control, and we do
not know what to do.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000153">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The local
authority was not doing what it needed to do, and the schools were not
doing what they needed  to do. The obvious thing was to bring
them together, which is where the behaviour partnership came from. It
is clearly in everyone’s interest to have that, but even then,
there were schools in that authority—the highest

                           </div>achieving, and correspondingly the highest excluding,
schools—that did not take part. To my knowledge, they still do
not take part. One of them was the one I referred to on Tuesday, when I
spoke about the child Lewis, who was permanently excluded for swearing
although he had a statement for Tourette’s syndrome. No matter
what we do, there will be schools that, unless we compel them, will
simply not take part and do their fair share. We know how that happens.
It is not just by permanent exclusions; it is by having a quiet word
with parents and saying, “I think your child would be better off
in the school down the road.” There are not only exclusions, but
unofficial exclusions as well.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000154">&#160;</a>

concern is that if we do not have compulsion, we will have schools that
simply do not take their fair share. There is an issue around
compulsion, but I do not know what the problem is. Would we suggest
that, because we have come so far, we no longer need measures such as
the sex or race equality legislation? The low number of women in this
place is an absolutely shocking national scandal; I did not realise
until I came here how few there are. In those areas, compulsion, in the
form of legislation, came first and culture followed, so I am not sure
about the philosophical argument on
compulsion.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000155">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
concern is that we might go back to where we were. If we take our foot
off the pedal and tell schools that they are not compelled to take
part, those that have been most reluctant to take part will go off and
do their own thing. They will go back to where they were,  and
we will be back to having London boroughs with 149 permanent
exclusions—that is, 149 ruined lives.  We know what that
means because, as we have  discussed over the past couple of
days, exclusions are disproportionately high among children who have
special educational needs or are disadvantaged. I do not understand why
the Government are taking away the duty to comply in the face of the
evidence that behaviour partnerships work. I ask the Minister again:

schools have entered into behaviour and attendance partnerships that
would not otherwise have done so. That is not the case; the duty was
not due to come in until September 2010 and, as the shadow Minister
correctly said, we introduced a statutory instrument to prevent the
duty from coming into force in September. The purpose of the clause is

ensure that partnership working between schools is effective and
beneficial for schools, and for the pupils and communities that they
serve. The best way to do that is to give schools
the freedom to choose what partnerships they form, and to hold schools
accountable for the outcomes that they achieve. The answer to the hon.

hon. Member for North West Durham was concerned about sharing
challenging pupils and ensuring that some schools are not busy saying,
“I do not think this school is appropriate for your
child.” All schools are obliged by the
admissions code to be part of the fair access protocols. That duty will
still exist, separate from the duty on behaviour and attendance
partnerships. Repealing the duty will not abolish existing partnerships
or stop new ones from forming. Behaviour and attendance partnerships
appear to have flourished without being mandatory. I refer to Sue
Bainbridge, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and
Holderness; Sue Bainbridge cited partnership working in Tower Hamlets
as a “really good example”. She

                           <strong> </strong>I have not done an assessment, but my
instinct as a member of the human race is that if someone is forced to
do something against their will, they tend to do it as a tick-box
exercise to complete the duty. It would not be entered into in the
spirit intended, so in theory, it would not have the beneficial effects
that one would expect from partnership. Evidence gathered by the
National Audit Office in 2009 indicates that Government policy may not
be the most important factor in schools establishing attainment
partnerships. It found that school partnerships had most commonly
developed in response to local
needs.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000175">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Cardiff West said that schools will not be able to
co-operate in pooling budgets, but a feature of behaviour and
attendance partnerships that already exist voluntarily is that schools
pool resources to buy in specialist resources, including, for example,
special educational needs provision. There is no reason why that should
not continue after the clause is agreed 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 465<a class="bkMark" name="Column465">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to. I believe that schools will continue to form partnerships where they
need them, and that the measures in the Bill to reduce bureaucratic
burdens on teachers, to allow them to reassert their authority, and to
bolster their disciplinary powers, and the measures holding schools to
account for performance of their core functions will lead to schools
taking whatever steps they judge best to improve
behaviour.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000176">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
turn briefly to amendments 45 and 46, which would delay the repeal of
the requirement to form behaviour and attendance partnerships until
September 2013 and only repeal it after Ofsted had reported that
voluntary partnerships on behaviour and attendance were working in all
authorities. If we measure the existence and effectiveness of
partnerships in all local authorities, that assumes that creating
formal partnerships will be a necessity for every school to improve
behaviour. Furthermore, recording the existence and effectiveness of
partnerships and measuring whether a particular structure is in place
is the wrong focus for inspection. Ofsted should focus on
schools’ outcomes, including how good behaviour is in each
school.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000177">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
previous Government clearly recognised that it was not sensible to
monitor local partnerships. No arrangements were planned to monitor or
enforce the duty on schools to form partnerships and no resources were
allocated to schools to help them with the administrative burden that
it would have been imposed. Had the requirement on schools to join
partnerships commenced, some schools would have paid lip service to
those partnership arrangements, and that would have led simply to a
culture of compliance, rather than the culture of innovation referred
to by my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness. That would
have shown, once again, why it is simply not necessary or practical for
central Government to issue detailed
instructions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000178">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
revised Ofsted school inspection framework will give more attention to
behaviour. If poor behaviour and attendance is identified as a key
issue for a school, it will have to prioritise it and take appropriate
action. Asking Ofsted to report on partnerships in each local authority
is not practical or proportionate; it would only add to the bureaucracy
in the school system, and I ask the hon. Member for Cardiff West to
withdraw his
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000179">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
69 would require the Secretary of State to commission a report within
24 months of eliminating the duty. That follows from the Education
Committee report that recommends that the Government be prepared to
reverse their decision on behaviour and attendance partnerships if
voluntary partnership working fails to deliver behavioural
improvements; I hope that I can give my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness some comfort on that point.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In direct
response to the challenge about the direction of travel signalled by
the clause, I point out that it does not promote the philosophy that
every school is an island entire of itself. In fact the White Paper
“The Importance of Teaching” is replete with references
to the importance of schools working together, and to
promoting best practice and peer-to-peer support through national and
local leaders in education. It insists, for example, that academy
converters—outstanding schools that become

			Column number: 466<a class="bkMark" name="Column466">&#160;</a>
                           </div>academies—work with a partner school. We are
also publishing regional families of school data, which will allow
schools to identify similar schools in their region that are performing
differently, so they can collaborate with them and learn from
them.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000181">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
understand the thinking of my hon. Friend, but I am concerned that
evaluating the effect of the Government’s proposed repeal will
be rather difficult, given that the partnerships have never been
mandatory and no previous formal evaluation has been undertaken. I
believe that the best way to achieve improvements in behaviour and
other matters is to give schools as much freedom as possible to make
their own decisions, including the freedom to choose the partnerships
that they form, while holding schools accountable for the outcomes that
they achieve for their pupils. With those few words, I urge the hon.
Member for Cardiff West to withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I thank the Minister for his response to the
debate, which has been interesting. We have ranged rather far and wide.
I know that it was not intended, but it devalues our debates if
“Stalin” or such words are mentioned. Stalin was a
monster. We are talking about a narrow range of views along a spectrum
and when it is appropriate for the Government to compel something, and
when it is appropriate to take a laissez faire approach. This is a
philosophical debate. We could say that it was an ideological debate
because philosophical on our part is ideological on the part of those
on the Government Benches. However, such debates occur from time to
time and the pendulum swings backwards and forwards. No doubt it will
continue to do so as the dialectic goes on for many years to
come.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000183">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">What
we are saying about behaviour and attendance partnerships is, in a
sense, somewhat ironic because attendance partnerships are created
because we compel children to attend school. In the eternal debate
along the philosophical-ideological continuum, I can imagine a similar
debate taking place probably in this very room in the 1870s about
compelling children to go to school. We can see the faces of those on
the Government Benches, many of them perhaps saying what an outrage it
would be to compel families to send their children to school and how
disgraceful it is for the state to interfere in family
life.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000184">&#160;</a>

compulsion was ever introduced in the 19th century, although given the
authoritarian tendencies of his party, it is understandable that he did
not. There has never been a compulsion in this country to send
one’s child to school; there has been a compulsion to give
one’s child an education. It was the institutionally based
biased and narrow focus that led to the near victimisation that was
fortunately averted at the last minute thanks to the efforts of my
Front Bench, which stopped the stigmatisation, licensing and oppression
of home educators throughout this land. However, the hon. Gentleman has

ironical that, if an attendance partnership is about making sure that
children—who are compelled to attend, if they are enrolled in
the school—turn up  to school and that it is compulsory
for them to do so in such circumstances, we do not
compel the schools themselves to bother to turn up
at the attendance partnerships in which they are discussing the
importance of children attending if they are enrolled and not being
home educated, which is what the hon. Gentleman’s tirade was

correct, but the duty has not been given a chance by the Government to
see whether it can make a difference to entrenching and embedding the
reforms to behaviour and attendance that were introduced by the
previous Government. The hon. Gentleman really wants to strangle it at
birth probably for ideological or philosophical reasons rather than to
give it a fair chance. That is a

that the Government have not given the duty a chance to work because
they are being unpragmatic and a little ideological. Not only is the
Minister intent on strangling the duty at birth, but he is not even
willing to compromise on amendments that would examine the impact of
the decision to do so. The reasonable amendment from the hon. Member

have the Government commission a report to evaluate the impact of this

become embedded as a duty and so that there would then be a duty for
the inspectorate to report on how the voluntary partnerships are

                           </strong> We have had an extremely interesting debate on the
amendments to clause 6. It is interesting to see whether this divide,
between compulsion and a belief in a more liberal trusting of the front
line, is philosophical or ideological. I would like to say that it was
a left-right thing, and that the left were always into compulsion.
Perhaps I suggested that earlier. The cynic might add that those in
opposition are always in favour of greater freedom and liberalisation,
while those in government tend over time to become ever more
authoritarian, and as they become frustrated, they get more interested
in compulsion. It is interesting that the Opposition, so freshly out of
power, are still hanging on to their habits, but moving in a liberal
direction. It will be interesting to see whether the coalition can stay
true to its Conservative-Liberal instincts. As Ministers become
frustrated by the failure of the front line to deliver what they want
to see, they may be tempted to bring in more and more provisions. That
will be interesting to see over time. We may have the amusing sight of
a reversal of political
positions.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
Minister has set out clearly that he favours co-operation between
schools. That is in line with the Government’s view that we
should not over-prescribe from the centre and tell people what to do.
We should allow freedom on the ground. There is plenty of evidence from
the main head teachers’ unions—both of
them—suggesting that compulsion does not offer a great deal of
benefit. Others, such as Alan Steer, took a different view. I believe
that we should look at the position on co-operation on behaviour and
discipline in a year and a half or two years’
time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
my hon. Friend the Minister rightly suggests, it is not that we never
put such things in a Bill, although we have rarely done so. I hope that
the Minister will take on board the points that have been made today. I
know he will. I hope that the Minister will go on to be one of our
longest serving Ministers. I am sure he will certainly be the most
distinguished Minister with responsibility for schools that we have
seen in many a long year. I know that he is a listening Minister and
self-confident enough to change tack if the evidence were to so
suggest.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000196">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I sense that the hon. Gentleman does not intend
to press his amendment to a Division. From the comments that the

                           </strong> I had hoped that the Minister might have found it
possible to go a little further in reassuring the Committee that the
Government, though confident of their course, were prepared to review
the provision 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 469<a class="bkMark" name="Column469">&#160;</a>
                           </div>formally or informally. In discussions with the Minister beforehand, it
was suggested to me that if anyone were to do a review, as Chair of the
Education Committee, I could. That was not an
entirely unreasonable line thrown back by the
Minister.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000198">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope that the Government, with their resources, will keep an open mind
on the matter. Even if such a review were to come about, and even if it
was decided that things were not as good as they should be, it might
not be that compulsion was regarded as the right option. It might be
that further changes to the accountability mechanisms that apply to
schools, and other changes in the framework in which schools operate,
might be more appropriate in order not to stifle the freedom of schools
to co-operate to best serve their pupils rather than to fit some
bureaucratic fiat sent out from this place, which the previous
Government all too often issued. Despite his reasonableness, the hon.
Gentleman was in the Government that did
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000199">&#160;</a>

7 will abolish the General Teaching Council for England. I appreciate
that the GTCE will go to its grave largely unmourned, but it would be a
shame if some of its good work was lost in the rush to abolish it. I am
concerned at the speed at which it is being abolished—it is too
quick and happening without due consultation and consideration of the
consequences. I am also concerned that it would leave the teaching
profession without the kind of regulatory body that other professions
have.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000250">&#160;</a>

established by the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. I had looked
the proceedings of the Committee that considered that Bill, and serving
as a Back Bencher on the Committee was a thrusting young buck, the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings, who is no longer in his
place. I do not want to mislead the Committee in any way, but I can,
now that is not here. He seemed to be quite keen on the principle of
the GTCE. The Lib Dem spokesman at the

Knaresborough. He welcomed the idea of transferring powers away from
the Secretary of State to a more independent GTC, so it will be
interesting to see, in the event of a Division, how the Lib Dems will
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000251">&#160;</a>

purpose of the GTC was to be the independent professional body for
teaching in England and to give teaching the same status as other
self-regulating professions such as nursing. The functions of the
council, as set out in section 1 of the 1998 Act, were
twofold:<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000252">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“to

                        </p>
                        <p>I
think the Committee would agree that it remains crucial that improving
standards of teaching, quality of learning and professional conduct in
the teaching profession should be a key part of the Government’s
education policy.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000253">&#160;</a>

                        <p>However,
since then, there has been precious little detail about how that would
be undertaken, including in the Bill. This group of amendments
therefore probes the Government to provide further details as to how
those functions will continue. On that basis, amendments 47 and 48 seek
to delay the abolition of the GTCE until arrangements have been
introduced on teacher registration and maintaining standards of teacher
professionalism to the satisfaction of Parliament. The proposals would
ensure that when the GTCE is abolished, there will be ongoing
arrangements for a number of matters. First,<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000255">&#160;</a>

                        <p>I
shall focus on two of those aspects, which are particularly important.
First, will the Minister confirm that there will continue to be a code
of conduct and practice for registered teachers? The GTCE code of
practice was established under section 5 of the Teaching and Higher
Education Act 1998, and is currently used in regulatory
hearings.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000259">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The White
Paper states that there will be a review the GTCE’s code of
conduct and practice, which will be led by head teachers and teachers.
Can the Minister provide more detail on that? Does he recognise that
the GTCE has recently conducted an extensive public consultation on a
new code of conduct and practice for registered teachers? I understand
that more than 3,000 respondents took part, and the new code came into
use in October 2009. Given the Government’s direction of travel,
they will presumably hold another consultation for the revised code of
practice. Will doing so be an appropriate use of resources, considering
that there was a consultation and a revised code only a matter of
months ago? Secondly, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 472<a class="bkMark" name="Column472">&#160;</a>
                           </div>can the Minister confirm that the code will continue to play a part in
the regulatory hearings that I have mentioned? That matter is not
included in the descriptions of the Secretary of State’s power
under the clause.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000260">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Subsection
(6)(c) in amendment 48 proposes maintaining a register of all people
who have been granted qualified teacher status. In getting rid of a
comprehensive register for the teaching profession, the Bill has
significant and serious omission. As it stands, it allows for a
database of barred teachers only. In its response to the Committee,
ASCL stated:<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000261">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“We
strongly believe that there is a need for an online database of all
qualified teachers which is accessible by schools to replace the GTCE
register. To remove the database will create additional red tape and
threaten streamlined procedures for recruitment. We would like to see a
clause inserted into the bill which puts a duty on the Department for
Education or one of the proposed executive agencies to do
so”.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000472">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="hs_brev">“by abolishing
the GTCE and not having a suitable replacement to the GTCE register the

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Whilst
the proposed legislation addresses the transfer of the GTCE’s
regulatory functions, it does not appear to cover  the
functions relating to the registration of teachers, as set out in
section 3 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. Clarification
is needed, in particular, about whether the Secretary of State would

whether a registry of all qualified teachers, trainees, overseas
trained teachers, etc. would continue to be maintained. Much work has

teachers in terms of their status and their professionalism is higher
than it has ever been. Independent observers conclude that the quality
of teaching in this country is at an unprecedentedly high level. In
terms of the recruitment of the brightest and best of our country who
want to go into teaching as a vocation and a profession, that is to be
welcomed.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000273">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
is unclear from the points made by the Government, since the
publication of the White Paper and the Bill, whether the 200-odd staff
of the GTCE, who are currently involved in carrying out functions that
will be retained, might be transferred—under the Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and 2006 or
other arrangements—to the Department for Education, so that
their experience and expertise of handling hearings can still be used.
Under the new remit, that might be on a more limited basis, but it
would be helpful if the Minister could give us an idea of what will
happen.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
that uncertainty, the amendment would provide the safeguard that
Parliament had to be satisfied that the Secretary of State is
demonstrably capable of taking on the misconduct functions before they
are transferred to him. If he takes them on without the necessary
resources and expertise, he risks repeating some of the experiences of
previous Secretaries of State of both complexions—whether Labour
or Conservative—when people who should not have worked with
children were not banned from
schools.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
hope the Ministers will take this in the spirit in which it is
intended, as I like and respect them enormously, but there is a real
question about the administrative capability and capacity of the
Secretary of State and the ministerial team at the Department for
Education. We have recently seen that in the handling of
correspondence. This week, I raised a point of order on the Floor of
the House about 563 unanswered questions. Only 10% of named day written
questions have been answered, and only 20% of correspondence from hon.
Members has been answered. There are real issues about hon. Members
being able to hold the Government to account and to pass on their
constituents’
cases.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the Bill’s themes is to centralise powers, duties and
functions with the Secretary of State. Frankly, does he have the
capability and the capacity to be able to handle that? Individual
teachers and the profession more widely must have confidence that the
Secretary of State will be capable of, and competent in, carrying out
the GTCE’s functions. On correspondence, the record of the
Secretary of State and his ministerial team is disappointing, but on
wider policies—such as Building Schools for the Future or the
school sport partnerships—it is fair to say that the Secretary
of State has so far failed to inspire confidence in the teaching
profession. He is good at making speeches and he is good at telling
gags but, I do not want Peter Kay running education policy in this
country. Interestingly, when he wears his glasses, the Secretary of
State looks like a very young Eric Morecambe, but if I pursue that
point I think you will rule me out of order, Mr
Williams.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000278">&#160;</a>

a serious note, it is important for the teaching profession and the
wider country that the Minister gives greater detail about when the
GTCE is to be abolished—transferred in-house to the
Department—and whether the resources, the expertise and the
capability will exist. I ask him to say something about that matter,
which the amendment has attempted to probe.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000279">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As the shadow Minister has said, the GTCE will
probably be little mourned, but its abolition leaves open many
questions, and I hope that the Minister will fill us in on them during
this debate. One question, which was pretty much put by the shadow
Minister, is how will getting rid of the GTCE help improve the
professionalism of teachers. That is a central question. Those of us
interested in education—as everyone in this room is—know
that, as the White Paper rightly put it, the importance of teaching is
pre-eminent. The quality of teaching—attracting, retaining and
motivating the best-quality people in teaching—is the most
important
factor.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
ugly corollary of that is having to face up to those who are not able
to contribute in the classroom. Most teachers who struggle, like most
of us who struggle in our jobs at times, do not need to be removed or
stigmatised, but need to be supported and helped, and to have a plan
put in place to allow them to come up to acceptable standards and to
contribute. With the GTCE, there was the idea of having a central
database, and during the last Parliament there was talk of having a
licence to teach. This is very much the idea of the teacher as a
professional. I do not know whether teachers are currently held in the
highest esteem ever in this country, though I slightly doubt it, but
there has been an increase in teachers’ professionalism in
recent years and in the perception thereof. If the Government are going
to improve educational standards, they must build on that progress and
further improve the standing of teachers as professionals. We therefore
need to understand how the abolition of the GTCE fits into
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000281">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I recognise
the desire to move away from unnecessary central databases and
bureaucracies. On the other hand, there may be benefits in maintaining
an existing and paid for database of all teachers and professionals who
have the qualification. I am delighted, Mr Williams, that following a
campaign by various people—including myself when I secured a
debate last year, supported by my predecessor, as Chairman of the
Education Committee—calling for further education teachers and
lecturers to be able to teach in schools, the Government have acceded
to it following the Wolf report. I hope that the Minister may be able
to say something about the benefits of retaining the
database.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000282">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
have spoken to the Minister and know that he is taking it seriously,
but I hope that this is an opportunity to put on the record that the
closure of a number of non-departmental public bodies by the Department
is being carried out in as thoughtful a fashion as possible to make
sure, Mr Williams, that any babies who may be sitting in the bathwater
of those organisations are not flushed away and that there is careful
thought. Like bureaucracy, databases can be good or bad—it
depends who they belong to before you like or dislike them. But there
are databases that are expensive to create and maintain and we need to
ensure that all useful and valuable information and data held in these
non-departmental public bodies is retained, transferred to the
Department and not lost. It would be a great shame, not least for this
Government who are so committed to applying common sense and good
financial judgment to the management of public finances, if we were to
throw away things that currently exist, only to recreate them later at
vast additional cost to the public purse.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000283">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It may be going
a little wider, but could the Minister spell out who stands between
the Government and individual teachers? England is
a large education system. In McKinsey’s work on education
systems and on appropriate interventions at different times in such
systems’ development, it does not talk about national systems
but smaller ones. England is very large and so may not be an individual
system at all. Yet, with the GTCE going and the reduction in the role
of local authorities, how does the Minister sees what stands, in this
quite large country, between the Secretary of State and the individual
teacher in the classroom, who may or not be held on a database? How can
this relationship be mediated so that we have a system that supports
the teacher to the greatest effect, instils public confidence in his or
her professionalism, and makes sure that, in each staff room
nationwide, we have the best possible people doing a job where they are
supported and celebrated, but if necessary, Mr Williams, challenged
where they are not delivering as
expected?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000284">&#160;</a>

the retention of the register. We could look back in history, with
teachers having their teaching numbers held by the Department for
Education, or whatever it was called in those various past emanations
of the Department, going forward into the GTCE. It is very useful to
have that information held centrally and where it is accessible. I can
say, as a former governor of schools, that it is very useful in the
recruitment of staff to know that there is verification that someone
being interviewed is registered as a qualified teacher without having
to go through all sorts of other vetting
procedures.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There
is another, wider purpose to having a list of qualified teachers. I was
talking to the Minister yesterday about the numbers of men teaching in
primary schools. One advantage of a central register is being able to
look at how many teachers are in different phases of education; what is
their gender; what is their ethnicity. We can then look to see how we
can improve recruitment into certain phases, how we can ensure that
there are men teaching in primary and women teaching in secondary and
that there are black and ethnic minority teachers teaching in our
schools. It seems to me that there is a good purpose to holding a
central register of qualified people—it is not just about
recruitment, it is also about monitoring the profession and targeting
recruitment at different times. I urge the Minister to maintain a list
of qualified teachers, not just the list of people who are
barred.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000286">&#160;</a>

want to make progress so I will not detain them too long, but I will
just respond to the hon. Gentleman on the position that my noble Friend
Lord Willis took at about the time of the creation of the General
Teaching Council. We have heard across the Committee that, at the time
of its creation, there was a feeling that this might add value and make
a useful contribution. However, unlike some of the other provisions
that we have already debated, where there has been a range of views in
the evidence presented to us, there has not been a huge support out
there for the continuation of this body, notwithstanding the issues
hon. Members have raised about the value of its work.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000287">&#160;</a>

frustrating when a constituent operates in a certain profession, or
feels that they have been disadvantaged in some way by someone who is a
professional in that field, and the only recourse they have is to a
body made up of people who carry out that function. There is sometimes
a lack of trust that they will get a fair result. While that is a much
wider debate than we are engaged in now, I just note in passing that
self-regulation has not always been successful and is not always the
answer. Based on the evidence we have, the Bill is doing the right
thing in seeking to move on from that. Certainly, talking to teachers,
as I have, I do not think that there will be huge mourning for the

                           </strong> I will be very quick. I have a series of questions
that I would like to ask the Minister. Post-GTC, who will award
qualified teacher status? Will the Department continue to maintain a
register and will that include teachers from overseas? That is really
important in parts of London. Will the code of practice remain in
place? My reading of the Bill is that employers must consider referring
cases of misconduct, when there is currently a requirement. Is this a
change and, if it is, will the Minister explain what the change is?
Will the Secretary of State continue to collect statistics on equality
and diversity to support recruitment and
retention?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000289">&#160;</a>

clear and unequivocal standards. That will be an independent review led
by some of our best teaching professionals. I am delighted that Sally
Coates, the principal of Burlington Danes academy, has agreed to chair
the review. We expect it to help develop clear standards, which will
help schools make judgments about teacher conduct and competence. We

less  than clear, and there are many of them. There are also

Conservatives when we were in Government was that we did not allow
teachers to teach, that we were providing them with unnecessary
guidance and bureaucracy, and that all that was needed was to free up
their time to allow them to teach in a classroom. Will not the teachers
be thinking, “Haven’t we just done this? Haven’t
we just been consulted about standards and the code of practice?
Can’t they leave us alone to allow us to teach and to allow that
code of practice to embed?”, because the guidance has been
subject to consultation and has been shortened considerably as a result
of teacher
involvement?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000301">&#160;</a>

between the various nations of the United Kingdom? As I understand it,
the provisions in the Bill maintain the GTC for Wales. Given the
abolition of the council in England, what happens if a teacher from
England goes to Wales, or vice versa? Will that not cause unnecessary,
and possibly avoidable, bureaucracy in the case of, for example, head
teachers in Wales checking up on English teachers or vice versa? What
will happen on that situation between the
nations?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000315">&#160;</a>

as each of those regulatory bodies do, will continue. If I have not got
that right, I will correct it. It is my understanding that those

not be a registration system, as there is in the devolved

will just refer to two other points raised by my hon. Friend the Member
for Beverley and Holderness. We are carrying out a methodical and
thorough check of

                           </div>functions and activities, including all the databases that exist at the
GTCE. He made a good point about not throwing the baby out with the
bathwater, and we want to ensure that we do not delete, abolish or
incinerate data that we may later require. There is reference to that
in the paper that we circulated. There is also the issue of qualified
teacher learning and skills. In her final report, published on 3 March,
Professor Wolf recommended that QTLS status should be recognised in
schools for the delivery of vocational education. I know that my hon.
Friend has been advocating that. I am pleased to confirm that the
Government have accepted his recommendation. We have already begun
working on making it happen in
practice.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000317">&#160;</a>

the report to Parliament should include the

                        <p>I
agree with the need for us to be clear on the implications of
abolishing the GTCE and the need for us to provide information about
the specifics of the new system relating to teacher regulation in the
future. I refer the hon. Member for Hartlepool to the detailed policy
statement that I circulated at 17.18 pm last Thursday. I hope that that
provides the reassurance that he
seeks.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000319">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
49 and 50 would require that before the Secretary of State exercises
his new regulatory functions for the teaching profession, he would need
to provide Parliament with a report to demonstrate that he has put in
place arrangements with sufficient resources and expertise to carry out
these functions. I understand hon. Members’ concerns that we
must ensure that robust arrangements are in place for the delivery of a
new system, prior to the abolition of the GTCE and the commencement of
the new arrangements. I want to reassure hon. Members that we are
already working very closely with colleagues at the GTCE, as I
mentioned earlier, to ensure that expertise is retained and that smooth
transition plans are developed and delivered. There is already a
transition board, which includes the GTCE chief executive and members
of the GTCE senior management team, as well as officials from the
Department who are managing the transitional arrangements. We will
continue to work closely with the GTCE to learn from its experience as
well as the experience of other
regulators.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000320">&#160;</a>

redundancies. Can the Minister outline, perhaps in a letter, how that
£8 million is

                           </strong> These issues are obviously more complicated than
simply redundancies. We are making savings across Whitehall and within
the Department. There is clearly a reduction in the number of functions
carried out by the GTCE, but what happens to individuals who are
working for the GTCE and their future within the state sector is a
matter for sensitive negotiations. I do not want to be drawn any
further on those matters. It would be wrong for me to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000324">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
will move on and finish speaking to the amendments. In practice, the
new system of regulation will be undertaken by a new work force agency,
which will be an executive agency of the Department. Where functions
that the GTCE currently undertakes are transferring to the new agency,
it is likely that the GTCE staff working on those functions will have
the option of transferring with them. I can assure hon. Members that
transfers of staff will be managed according to relevant legislation
and Cabinet Office guidance. I hope that that provides some
reassurance.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000325">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Within
the new system of regulation we propose that the investigations of
disciplinary cases will be able to draw on a range of expertise as
required, including, for example, from the teaching profession and
legal and medical expertise. Only the most serious cases will proceed
to a hearing panel, which will decide whether the person may need to be
barred from teaching. Hearing panels will include expertise from the
teaching profession, and lay person representation and panels will be
able to seek further professional expertise as appropriate to the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000326">&#160;</a>

summary, I hope that I have been able to reassure the Committee that we
are putting arrangements in place to ensure the smooth delivery of the
new regulatory arrangements, and that we have plans in place to address
the wider concerns raised in the amendment. Given those plans, I hope
that the Committee will concede that a requirement in law to report to
Parliament on this matter will not be necessary. I therefore urge the

hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. There was a degree of
consensus on some aspects of the debate. I want to cover a number of
things. I am pleased to see that 17.18 is the new 4.34, but we are
getting later, which is a concern. The Chair of the Education Committee
made what I thought was a pertinent point about registration being an
effective use of resources. It is being designed and built now, and
knocking it down and starting again would be a gross misuse of public
money. Any reassurances from the Minister are
welcome.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000328">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
the potential £8 million of savings identified in the impact
assessment, I reiterate my request that the Minister write to the
Committee with further details. I realise that matters regarding
people’s careers, professions and lives are sensitive. However,
96% or 97% of the GTCE’s money comes from the £36
subscriptions from 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 483<a class="bkMark" name="Column483">&#160;</a>
                           </div>teachers. The impact assessment states that there will be savings of
£8 million, but it seems that there will have to be substantial
cutting if that £16 million subscription income is lost. That
income will be absorbed by departmental costs, so how can savings of
£8 million be made? I would find reassurance useful, preferably
before Report—or imminently, if the Minister wants to
respond.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000329">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I do not want
to detain the Committee much longer, but I am concerned about the
profession. We want teaching to be seen as the profession of choice for
our brightest and best. It is a huge vocation, yet it seems that the
Government are creating a curious situation in which the teaching
profession is not trusted with any degree of
self-regulation—they want to bring it in-house. A curious
comparison would be if the Department of Health were regulating the
nursing profession. I cannot see why the Government want to go down
this route.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000332">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Through
different stakeholders, there might be a recognition that the GTCE has
not performed as we would have all wished, but surely there has to
be—to use the Chair of the Education Committee’s
word—a buffer between the Secretary of State who is responsible
for education policy in England, which is a large country in these
terms, and the teaching profession. If there is a problem, why must the
solution be abolition and not reform or replacement? Why does the
responsibility have to be centralised to the Secretary of
State?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000333">&#160;</a>

want to test the Committee’s opinion. I may want to return to

continue the discussion that the Minister has begun on how we regulate
the teaching profession. As I have said, one of the key factors in
improving education lies in enhancing the quality of our teachers,
which the Government acknowledge. Parents remain, perhaps, the single
most important people in the educational life of a child, but quality
of teaching is the next most important factor.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000344">&#160;</a>

to improve the quality of teaching further. The White Paper, which came
as the John the Baptist to the Bill, was called, “The Importance

pleased to say that I ended that criticism of the Bill by managing to

                        <p class="tabbed">A question
remains, which I hope the Minister will be able to answer, although
perhaps he will not be able to do so because the review is happening.
It seems odd that the Bill says that those guilty of offences and gross
misconduct will be included on this astonishing central list to be held
by the Secretary of State, but those who show sustained incompetence
will not be. That is what I wanted to tease out. It is also rather odd
that schools have to consider whether they refer someone. There are
various figures available, but I think everyone would accept that fewer
than 20 teachers have been struck off in the last decade. If there are
as few as that on the central list, it will be quite a big thing to be
on it for the individuals concerned, with implications not only for
their professional lives, as they will no longer be able to teach, but
potentially in other areas. It is therefore slightly odd that it is up
to the school to consider whether it refers them or not, which may lead
to a bit of a lottery as to whether someone finds their name on there,
and it may not be related to what they have
done.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">According
to “Panorama” last year, only 18 UK teachers have been
struck off for incompetence in the past 40 years. That seems
extraordinarily unlikely, but if people are aware of other figures,
they struggle to come up with the numbers. That is despite estimates
that some 17,000 teachers may not be up to the job. I know from
personal experience of what tends to happen in a struggling school that
has struggling teachers. We move in to provide support for those whom
we think we can bring up to standard, but we lean on the others, one
way or another, and they have a tendency to move on. They tend not to
leave teaching, but to move to another school. All too often, teachers
who are showing sustained incompetence move to another school, and
there is not a great deal of incentive for schools to do something
about it. It is possible that there will be even less incentive to do
anything about it when it is necessary to report all the way to the
Secretary of State about their behaviour. That would, of course, be an
argument against my amendments, but I would like to know whether the
Minister has any thoughts about how we are going to create a system in
which those who are failing young people are better held to
account.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000354">&#160;</a>

                        <p>That was in November of
last year. In almost half of local authorities almost nobody had been
removed from teaching. I am sure that you would agree, Mr
Williams, that in politics—indeed, in the House of Commons, even
with its requirement for thousands of people to vote for you in order
to get here—a sizeable number of people, regardless of politics,
are fundamentally incompetent. Fortunately, none is on this Committee:
well, one hopes not. We recognise that happens in any

would hate to be misinterpreted. I think that the role of teachers in
our society is fantastic; I want to celebrate it, I want to reinforce
it, I want them to have the status and preferably, if money ever
allows, I would like the pay of teachers to be raised, because what
could be more important than shaping the childhood of somebody so that
they can progress in life and, hopefully, enjoy the day that they are
being educated as well? There is no more important profession in this
country than teaching and we owe it to those teachers who put such
effort into giving a high performance to make sure that their staff
room does not have people in it who have clearly either lost the will,
or never had the ability, to contribute in the way that the best do to
the betterment of the children in their classes. That is why we need to
hear from the Government, while we discuss a Bill which follows a White
Paper called “The Importance of Teaching”, how precisely
the Minister for schools thinks we can improve the current situation,

                           </strong> It is a pleasure to respond to the amendment of my
hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness. To take up his
first challenge, about why there is not more in the Bill regarding the
quality of teachers, the fact is that we are not in the business of
putting declaratory sections and clauses into legislation. That was a
slight habit of the previous Administration and we are keen to
legislate only when we need to, because every piece of legislation
complicates the statute book. In fact, most of these Bills will amend
other pieces of education legislation and we are keen to legislate only
when
necessary.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
effects of amendments 70, 71 and 72 would be to require that
allegations of both professional incompetence and misconduct are
considered at the national level, which would replicate the current
GTCE arrangements. Amendment 70 would mean extending the new national
system of regulation to cover cases of sustained professional
incompetence as cases of misconduct. Amendment 71 would require
employers to consider whether to refer cases of sustained professional
incompetence as well as serious misconduct cases. Amendment 72 would
require supply agencies to consider whether to refer cases of sustained
professional incompetence as well as serious
misconduct.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000363">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
single most important factor in ensuring a good education for every
child is, as my hon. Friend so ably said, that they have a good
teacher. I remember my favourite teacher, Brian Rogers, who taught me
A-level economics. He was from the left, which is probably one reason
why I became a Tory. He was a very good economics teacher, and I owe
him a huge debt of gratitude for what I believe is my good
understanding of economics, although it does not come anywhere near the
understanding of the Chancellor or the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000364">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Teachers are
our greatest asset, and we want to help them to do their job even
better by encouraging schools to provide them with the support and
professional development that they need to fulfil their potential and
to help their pupils do so, too. The White Paper, “The
Importance of Teaching”, has set out our approach to achieving
that, including our plans to make it easier for schools to address
teachers’ poor performance. The majority of our teachers are
highly competent professionals, but where poor performance occurs it is
critical that that is tackled, as my hon. Friend
said.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000365">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
drafted, the Bill proposes that only cases of misconduct will be
considered by a national regulator. I would like to reassure my hon.
Friend that I share his concerns about the need to tackle poorly
performing teachers, and to ensure that poor teachers are not recycled
or transferred around the system. The question is how we can best
address those concerns. It is clear that the current system of
considering cases of incompetence at the national level is not working.
As my hon. Friend said, since the GTCE was formed in 2000, nearly two
thirds of local authorities have never referred a case of incompetence
to it, despite employers being under a duty to do so. From 2001 to the
end of January this year, the GTCE concluded only 82 competence
hearings and struck off only 14 teachers for incompetence. Although the
majority of our teachers are highly competent professionals, I, like my
hon. Friend, simply cannot believe that in the past 10 years there have
been only 14 incompetent teachers. That can be said about the
members of no other
profession.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000366">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
National Centre for Social Research undertook a comprehensive study
into low referral rates to the GTCE for incompetence. It was published
last year, and revealed that employers were reluctant to make referrals
to the GTCE on the basis of poor performance. It found that that was
because they felt either that the GTCE “has no teeth” and
that there was no point, or that striking a person off the register for
a performance issue was too severe an action, and one for which they
did not want to be responsible. As I quoted in the debate on the
previous group of amendments, the report stated
that<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000367">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“there
is no consistent understanding of the GTC’s regulatory role with
regard to
incompetence.”<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000493">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>There
was a clear sense from employers that referring a case of incompetence
to the GTCE meant a “duplication of local procedures”.
The research also found that employers expressed the view that
performance can be contextual—that is, an individual whose
performance is in question in one context may perform to standard in
another. Moving schools might therefore transform the
individual’s performance
ability.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000368">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">My
hon. Friend may recall that David Smellie, an eminent employment
lawyer, gave evidence at the public evidence session. He has

                        <p class="hs_brev">“Independent

                        </p>
                        <p>It
is evident that the arrangements for teacher regulation under the GTCE
have not been effective, partly because the duty to refer acted as a
disincentive to a head

performance of a colleague if, by going through the capability
procedure, he has to refer the teacher to the GTCE, where they may be
struck off and have their career terminated? For any human being that
might be regarded as too much to go
through.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000371">&#160;</a>

empower and support them to do so. I have already referred to, and will
not repeat again, the fact that we have asked Sally Coates to review
teaching standards. We will shortly consult on similar arrangements for
performance management and tackling poor capability, which will
streamline the system and remove the current duplication that employers
have found to be a barrier to tackling such
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000372">&#160;</a>

performance, the threshold—I am not sure if it is still called

supposed to be a hurdle that the best performing teachers would get
over, but the perception was that over time it became something that
people were just given through service rather than on the basis of
quality. Does my hon. Friend have any thoughts on how we incentivise
high performance and recognise where it exists, and do not have a

conclusion, it is only through empowering and supporting employers to
play their role in properly addressing performance issues that we can
begin to tackle the issue of poor teachers being recycled around the
system. We already know that employers are reluctant to make referrals
to a national regulator on the basis of competence and the revised
regulatory arrangements seek to learn from that. The new arrangements
for regulations proposed under the Bill, combined with our plans to
empower and support employers to tackle poor performance, will ensure a
less bureaucratic system that can better ensure the quality and high
standards of our teaching profession. On that basis, I urge my hon.
Friend to stick to his guns that the amendment was a probing amendment,
and to withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000376">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
purpose of the amendment is straightforward and simple. It would make
the sanctions available to the Secretary of State match those currently
available to the GTCE. Under current arrangements, if a teacher were
found guilty by a professional competence committee, they can be
punished in several ways: by a reprimand, which is kept on record for
two years; a suspension, which can stop the teacher from working for up
to two years; or a prohibition order, which bans teachers from the
profession. In some cases, teachers who have faced a prohibition order
can reapply for teacher registration after two
years.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000380">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Under
the Bill, the Secretary of State has only two proposed judgments for
cases coming before him: barred or not barred. Those prohibition orders
would be very blunt instruments to use in often quite complex cases.
The GTCE had a variety of judgments at its disposal, which could take
into account individual circumstances, and I cannot understand the
rationale behind the Minister moving from what is a targeted and
individual way of providing sanctions and punishment towards a somewhat
blunt
tool.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000381">&#160;</a>

Minister is considering whether the full list should be retained, if
there is a way of keeping it going administratively in a simple and
cost-effective way, which would allow a more graduated set of measures
to be recorded. I am not sure why the whole list, as opposed to a small
list, would necessarily help, but if there was a thinking that it
needed to be kept as simple as possible, that was one of the reasons
for having what the shadow Minister called a blunt instrument. I would

and fully considered, with people who may have done something pretty
poor, it may be seen that there is an appropriate punishment other than
being permanently struck off. That would mean that we would not lose
someone who made a mistake, who deserves to be punished for it, but who
does not need to be barred for all time and cast into darkness from the
educational firmament. I hope that the Minister will consider the issue
further. As this Bill goes through Parliament, it may be possible to
reconsider the

                           </strong> I want to add my support to this amendment. If we
think about other professional bodies and other professions, such as
the medical profession, we have more options than just barring people
for life. There needs to be something that is proportionate and, in
some cases, remedial. We share a concern that previous cases have not
been referred to the GTC when they should have been. Going forward, we
share a concern that cases may not be referred to the Secretary of
State when they should be. People may see that barring someone for
life, for what could be a poor decision or practice at that point in
time, but from which they could learn, is extreme, when they could
retrain or be barred for a period of time.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000388">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I urge the
Minister to look at whether there should be other sanctions. If we want
to ensure that teachers are referred and that we deal with incompetence
and those who should not be teaching unless remedial action is taken,
unless we look at other sanctions that can be taken, we will be in a
situation where teachers are not being referred to the Secretary of
State. I urge the Minister to add alternatives to the ban for
life.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000389">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> In essence, in responding to the hon. Member for
Bolton West and my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness,
the purpose of the new arrangements is that teachers should be referred
to the panel only if people want the teacher to be banned. The issue to
be referred has to be of such seriousness that those referring a
teacher would expect that to be the consequence. Amendment 52 would
allow the Secretary of State to issue a teacher with a reprimand, a
conditional registration or a suspension, as well as the prohibition
order. In essence, that would reinstate the range of intermediate
sanctions that the GTCE currently has at its disposal when considering
a disciplinary case. That is not what we want to achieve with this
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000390">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We do not
believe that the GTCE system was successful. I have already pointed out
that over the past decade, there were only 14 cases of teachers being
barred for incompetence. Where there are concerns about a
teacher’s performance or conduct, those should be addressed by
the school. We are trying to develop a serious relationship with
schools. We want to trust professionals to tackle those issues of
competence and conduct effectively. Only the most serious cases will
lead to a dismissal at the school level. Only cases of gross misconduct
should be referred to the national level. We think that that is the
right
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000391">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> It is difficult to say. Only gross misconduct will
be referred to the Secretary of State, who will then refer it to the
hearing panel, so there will be fewer. I think 150 cases were referred
on the grounds of incompetence. Those will not be referred in future.
We want to see those dealt with at the school level. That is why we put
in place and are reforming issues of competence and capability
procedures. That is why we are reforming teaching standards and the
national professional qualification for headship. All that is intended
to assist and enable professionals at the school level to tackle
performance issues there. It seems rather absurd that one of the
GTCE’s recommendations should be for a teacher go on a course.
These are not matters that should be dealt with by a national
regulatory body. They should be dealt with at the school level by
professional head teachers. That is the kind of arrangement that we
want to have in place in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000393">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> One of the problems is that teachers are being
recycled. They may leave a school because they have taken a compromise
deal and not been sacked by the school. They are eased out, but are
then able to seek employment at other schools, either within the same
authority, a neighbouring authority or at the other end of the country.
That problem is recognised by all members of the Committee. I am not
saying that there are vast numbers of incompetent teachers, but we know
that some teachers do not provide a good service for young people, so
surely we should be asking how we can improve the situation to ensure
that teachers who are incompetent and who have committed undesirable
acts cannot then simply be recycled through the education system. If we
are simply to have a banning, fewer people will be referred. How will
the Minister deal with the
recycling?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000394">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady raises an important and serious point
that is of concern to all members of the Committee. We know that having
a national regulatory body—with competence being referred to the
GTCE—is not successful. We know that it does not work because of
the figures that have been cited—two thirds of local authorities
have never referred a teacher for incompetence, and only 14 teachers
have been barred from teaching on the grounds of incompetence. That
does not work, so we have to find another way. It is difficult, because
we are talking about human beings who train to be teachers and who want
to continue teaching. They may find it difficult to do anything else,
but it might be that by going to a new school or going on a course
recommended by a head teacher, they may be able to improve their
teaching
ability.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000395">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
a new environment, such teachers may flourish. They may not have
flourished in a comprehensive but may flourish in a grammar school.
They may not have flourished in the independent sector but may decide
to move into the maintained sector and do well. It is difficult for us
to know. We are trying to make it easier for head teachers to exercise
their professional judgment and management skills, and be enabled
either to help teachers become better teachers or to manage them out of
the school. Too often, they tend to give very good references to
teachers in the hope that they simply go on their merry way. It may be
that the capability or performance management procedures are so
complicated and lengthy

			Column number: 492<a class="bkMark" name="Column492">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that they find that an easier alternative. Then there is the worry that
if someone does manage to ease out or sack a teacher through the
capability procedures, they then get referred to the GTCE, which is not
something that most head teachers want to have on their conscience,
even if it is ultimately the right thing for the
teacher.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000396">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
are trying a range of measures to bring into our schools some of the
approaches to managing professionals that exist in other professions.
That is what we hope to achieve. That will not eliminate the
problem—it cannot be eliminated. In every field, whether
accountancy, medicine or the law, people recruit and make mistakes, but
what we are trying to do will minimise that because it will reduce the
incentive to produce flattering references. Schools should take up
references when they recruit a new teacher, and we want to try to put
in place systems that decrease the incentive for providing an inflated
reference when one is sought. Head teachers need to give far more
honest
references.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000397">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
hon. Member for Hartlepool asked why the Secretary of State had an
interim power to prevent a teacher from teaching—he wanted to
know what that was about. If there is an allegation of serious
misconduct, we believe that there should be a power to prevent the
person from teaching while their case is being considered. Protecting
the safety of children has to be our prime concern. The GTCE had
previously called for such a power, and it has also been recommended by
the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, which provides best
practice advice on regulations. In fact, the majority of other
regulators already possess this kind of power. We expect it to be used
for only the most serious cases, and, if it is used, that the case will
be concluded as swiftly as possible. With those few remarks, I hope
that I have managed to reassure the hon. Gentlemen, and that the

not think that he has adequately explained the situation. In order to
make progress, I will not press the amendment to a Division, but I do
not think that he has explained how the provisions in clause 8 will
improve the situation. If one accepts the notion that there is
incompetence and gross misconduct in the teaching profession, as in
every other profession, it is not appropriate to move away from the
more proportionate and graduated response that we have under the GTCE
towards a blunt one—you are barred or you are not barred. The
notion that was put forward by the Chairman of the Select Committee
that people are put off because of that will not be dealt with under
the provisions of the Bill. They exacerbate the problem of inflated
references and recycling, which was a point made by my hon. Friend the

                           </strong> Amendment 73 follows the point that was made
earlier about the Government acceding to those with
QTLS—qualified teacher learning and skills—qualifications
in the further education sector being able to teach vocational courses
in schools, which, as I said, I entirely welcome. The aim of the
amendment is to highlight that issue further and ensure that we have a
consistent system so that schools know that, when they look at this
list, they can find those with a QTLS who are barred from teaching in
the same way that they can for those with a QTS. I hope that it is
straightforward and I will be interested to hear from the Minister
about it.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000409">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 79
touches on information held on such persons by the Independent
Safeguarding Authority. Again, I will be interested to hear from the
Minister whether he considers that to be a useful addition.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000410">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment 53
picks up the point I made earlier, as to whether it is appropriate,
given, as the Minister has said, that the aim of this list is that only
the most serious offences are referred. I think it is therefore odd
that the legislation suggests that schools should consider whether to
refer. The implications for the individuals are huge, and if the
legislation is designed to do what the Minister says, every school
should be obliged to refer to the Secretary of State. He could then
make his judgment, with the current set of powers, which might need to
be varied from the all or nothing situation we have at the
moment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000411">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, if
the circumstances are as the Minister described, we would expect
everyone to be referred. I am particularly interested to hear how the
Minister would feel were he to be guilty under this
provision— I know it is impossible to imagine this of
the Minister, he is such an upstanding individual and so professional, 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 494<a class="bkMark" name="Column494">&#160;</a>
                           </div>a man of near perfection in personality and professional application.
However, were he to make a mistake and find himself referred—not
just to a local authority body, embarrassing though that would be, but
to the Secretary of State far away in London—to be possibly put
on this small list of seriously barred individuals, I expect he would
feel pretty sore if he found himself on that list, but someone who had
behaved in exactly the same way had not been referred. He would be even
more upset if there were no mechanism by which he could insist on equal
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000412">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
a severe penalty is at stake, normal principles of justice would
suggest that those guilty of the same offence should be treated in the
same way. It should not be down to the decision of a body that is not
ideally constituted to make that decision. Governing bodies and head
teachers are not primarily in place because they know how to make these
kinds of judgments; they are there to help run schools. So I am
sympathetic to those amendments, and hope to hear from the Minister
that there is a sensible rationale for what on the face of it is the
possibility of two people doing exactly the same thing, but one of them
faces a higher penalty than the other, as a result of a decision by a
governing body which may make that decision for reasons hard to divine
from the outside, particularly if one is the person being
referred.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000413">&#160;</a>

these probing amendments to try and understand how these changes will
work with the changes that are also proposed to the Independent
Safeguarding Authority; the changes in the way information will be
collated in that proposal; who will have access to that information;
and possible contradictions within these proposals. It sounded earlier
as though the idea of any sort of central co-ordination might be amiss,
but central co-ordination is needed to get safeguarding
right—<em>[Interruption</em>

welcome the evidence and experience of a number of coalition Members. I
am sure that even with the stern looks of the Whips, it would not take
long to go through some of the issues with them. Having worked in child
protection in the voluntary sector, I am concerned about how the
information on the previous register was used, where that was
translated to child protection and safeguarding, where there might have
been cross-over with information that schools have access to and how
that might have been used within broader child protection and vice
versa.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000416">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The amendments
recognise that under the previous system, the organisation that
information was referred to was either the GTC or the ISA. There needs
to be clarity for all concerned about what information needs to be
passed on, to whom and in what circumstances, and about what
information will be held about people on the small list—and
about how those two connect together. I hope that the Department has
been involved 
<div class="columnNumber">

the dangers that we have seen. There have been tragic cases in the past

happened to make

79 would clarify how the information that the Secretary of State will
hold on an individual will meet the information held by the Independent
Safeguarding Authority, and how that will be shared with the public and
people who are interested in safety in schools. Amendment 53 refers to
the point raised by the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
regarding who would do the considering, and would provide clarity by
saying that all information, in issues of serious misconduct, should be
passed on.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000418">&#160;</a>

is about joining up the two different bodies and ensuring that
information that will be passed to the Secretary of State by schools
will also be passed to the ISA, so that where there are serious
concerns about an individual, their conduct and their access to
children, information is shared with the ISA and any other organisation
that may access the ISA database. From a voluntary sector perspective,
I suggest that people who are inappropriate to be involved in schools
should also not be involved in youth organisations or work with
vulnerable people. It is important that the proposals mesh together as
the changes take place—I think such proposals are being
discussed in another Committee Room—from an education
perspective.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000419">&#160;</a>

great deal to add to what the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
and my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow said. In the past, the
GTCE has worked closely with the Independent Safeguarding Authority and
has developed particular ways of working around cases that are not
necessarily clear-cut, where issues might be relevant to one situation
but not to another. Close working relationships were developed to deal
effectively with such situations. I therefore want to use the
amendments to probe the Minister about
that.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000420">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
80 is particularly important because it deals with the supply of
information by contractors and agencies. The hon. Member for Beverley
and Holderness has set out clearly the issues about consistency.
However, it is not just about that, but about ensuring that we are not
creating new loopholes. We know that the danger has gone the other way,
and that the vetting and barring scheme had to be reviewed because it
had gone over the top. However, if we leave a loophole, something will
inevitably slip through, and we will be back to the cycle of kneejerk
responses and again creating something that is not fit for purpose. The
amendments try to be helpful and probe the Minister’s
intentions. I hope that he will respond to our genuine

closer working relationships with the ISA; the amendments tabled by my

                        <p class="tabbed">Predominantly,
I want to talk to amendments 53 and 59 in my name and that of my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff West, although the Chair of the Select
Committee put the argument far more eloquently than I could with
regards to amendment 53. In discussing the last group of amendments,
the Minister explained the matter of referral to the Secretary of State
and of barring or non-barring in relation to the most serious cases of
misconduct. Surely following on from that, logically, the employer must
provide the information about the teacher to the Secretary of State. I
would like the Minister to outline why there seems to be some
inconsistency between his earlier remarks and the rationale behind the
current group of amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000423">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I would also
like the Minister to comment on the point that was made by Brian
Lightman from ASCL in the evidence sessions we had a couple of weeks
ago. I shall paraphrase Mr Lightman’s remarks. He essentially
said that head teachers—employers—will not want to follow
the proposed procedures because although they might think a teacher is
terrible and that they do not want them near their particular
institution, they do not want to wreck that person’s career. An
element of that culture still persists. How does the Minister wish to
address
that?<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000424">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">What
does the Minister think are the implications of the clause in terms of
safeguards when teachers are found guilty of serious misconduct? Under
the clause, what does he think would happen if a teacher had done
something for which they would ordinarily be struck off, but the
employer did not provide the information to the Secretary of State?
Again, that point was made by the Chair of the Select Committee. Does
the Minister think that, in certain circumstances, the employer must
provide such information because of the gravity of the situation? Will
he outline some such circumstances? Will he provide any information or
guidance to employers to help them determine whether to provide the
information to the Secretary of State, or will the onus always be on
the employer to determine whether it should be provided? Through
amendment 53, we essentially want to probe the Government’s
thinking on that matter and whether, given his earlier comments, all
information on the grounds of misconduct should be
provided.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000425">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
will speak briefly to amendment 59, the purpose of which is to probe
the Minister’s intentions behind removing the requirement that
only registered teachers may carry out specified duties. Under his
proposals, a teacher must still be qualified to carry out the specified
duties or qualified teacher status can no longer be demonstrated
through registration with the General Teaching Council for England. It
is not clear from the Bill what the implications of the clause are in
relation to teacher qualifications, although he has touched on that in
his earlier remarks. I ask the Minister to set out his intentions in
relation to the wider point about qualifications and QTS. Again, I know
that he has referred to that briefly in earlier remarks, but it would
be useful to get a bit more detail. By tabling amendment 59, we are
seeking to probe the Government’s intentions about the
qualification levels they expect from
teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000426">&#160;</a>

to all the amendments, which relate to aspects of the teacher
regulation system operated by the GTCE and the regulatory system we are
putting in place. That has been debated at some length this afternoon.
I shall try not to replicate some of the earlier debate, but to address
the specific points in the amendments. Let me first deal with amendment
59. As has been said, that amendment would retain a system of
registration for teachers in England. Although I share hon.
Members’ view that the current system has elements that would be
useful, it is my contention that the process of registration is not
necessary to maintain the supply of effective teachers in our schools
for reasons I shall go on to
highlight.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000428">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
colleagues have said, the GTCE collected myriad detailed information on
teachers, ranging from personal data and qualifications through to
information on the types of posts held in previous employment. The
point was made earlier that teachers’ social profile and their
history could be useful for good public policy. For that reason, I want
to remind myself of the data that we already collect. The Department
collects an enormous amount of data on the work force, and has access
to data collected by other bodies, such as the Training Development
Agency for Schools. It is always my aim to reassure the Committee, and
the Department is looking at all its data collection requirements, and
the data needed by the new work force agency to support schools in the
exercise of their legitimate business. It is right to collect data, the
Department does so, and that data could be used for the very purposes
that were mentioned earlier to gain profile information about the
character of the teaching work
force.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000429">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However,
the current arrangements are time-consuming and expensive, and I am not
sure that they are necessary to ensure that we have an effective
teaching force in our schools. I do not consider it essential in making
sure that employers and the public are able to determine which teachers
have been barred from working in England that we maintain the current
arrangements. That is clearly an objective that all responsible members
of the Committee—all members of it are responsible—would
want to secure, but I am not sure that we need the existing
arrangements, with all their costs and bureaucracy, to do so. Instead,
we will set up a list of teachers who have been barred from working in

is not an unprecedented principle. It is sensible always to err on the
side of making a list of those people who are prohibited, rather than
making a list of everyone, because that is a much simpler, more
cost-effective and clearer exercise of our responsibilities. Our view,

                           </div>and bureaucratic system of formal registration. However, as I have said,
I recognise—I acknowledge the arguments from the Opposition
Benches—that some aspects of the data and functionality provided
by the current register are of some value and use for employers, most
notably for recording the award of qualified teacher status. We are
therefore committed to considering carefully—I shall repeat that
because I want to make sure that shadow Ministers are absolutely
attentive—we are carefully considering what data that are
currently collected by the GTCE may need to be retained and used in
future.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000433">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We recognise
the central benefits of providing head teachers and employers with
access to a central record of who holds qualified teacher status. We
will explore whether and how to provide that in future. We want to
consider the demand for such a service alongside the need to minimise
burdens on teachers and schools while delivering value for money to
taxpayers. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the current registration system
costs taxpayers around £2 million a year, and requires employers
and teachers to update their records at least three times a year. I am
not convinced that that represents good value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000434">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
59 was referred to earlier. Against the background of what I have said,
I am pleased to say that the head teachers associations have already
offered to work with us on the matter, and I look forward to a
constructive dialogue with them on how to take forward the commitments
that I have just made.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000435">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As all members
of the Committee know, we are a listening Government, and a responsive
Government. We want to take the profession, schools, governors,
parents, and all Committee members with us on this journey to raise
standards for the future generation, for whom we are
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000436">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments 53
and 80 relate to the duty to refer all cases of misconduct, for which
the hon. Member for Hartlepool and others have made a case. I
understand that the intention behind the amendments is to place a duty
on employers to refer all cases of serious misconduct where teachers
have been dismissed, or would have been had they not resigned first.
Our measure proposes that we respect the professionalism and judgment
of employers, and give them the autonomy to decide for themselves which
cases of serious misconduct to refer to the national regulator. We have
debated that matter at some length.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000437">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Currently, as
has been said, all cases of misconduct must be referred to the GTCE. My
hon. Friend the Minister has drawn our attention to evidence that
suggests that the effect of that practice has not been as robust or
reliable as was originally intended. The approach has not ensured that
all cases of misconduct are referred, which is well illustrated by the
different patterns of referral across the country. For example, the
Policy Exchange research that was published in 2008 revealed that 27
local authorities had never made a referral for misconduct; yet three
authorities had made between 19 and 27. Such patterns suggest that the
system, as I have said, is not consistent, robust or reliable in
delivering its original intention.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000438">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Members of the
Committee have raised the perfectly proper concern that misconduct is a
matter to be taken seriously, which, of course, it is. I believe,
however, that something of a gap is growing between the two sides. I do
not want to exaggerate the point, but it seems that Government Members
in Committee have a powerful

                           </div>belief that our teachers and head teachers have, to some degree, been
infantilised by the excessive concentration on micro-management,
central control and bureaucracy of previous regimes. We, on the
Government Benches, are determined to remove some—indeed,
all—of that bureaucracy where it is unnecessary, and give
greater freedom to trust the professionalism of our school leaders to
believe in teachers.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000439">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I will happily do so. Perhaps I can move speedily
on the amendments without in any way abridging my commitment to the
teaching force of this country. Every great civilisation—Persia,
China, Greece and Rome—has revered teachers and elevated the
role of the educator. When we diminish that role, we diminish our
civilisation. I believe in our teachers and head teachers and make no
apology for doing so. I will continue to advocate their cause for as
long as I am a Minister and a Member of this House.<a class="bkMark" name="1103188000442">&#160;</a>
