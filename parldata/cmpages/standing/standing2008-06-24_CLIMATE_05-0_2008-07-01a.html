12</h4><a name="08070210000005"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Duty
to provide indicative annual ranges for net UK carbon
account</div><a name="08070210000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000320"></a><b class="B">Gregory
Barker</b> (Bexhill and Battle) (Con): I beg to move amendment
No. 53, in clause 12, page 6, line 40, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;( ) Before
determining each indicative annual range the Secretary of State must
obtain, and take into account, the advice of the Committee on Climate
Change.&#146;.</div><a name="08070210000013"></a><div class="hs_Para">Good
morning, Mr. Cook. Clause 12 is important. Conservative
Members in the other place did a splendid job in encouraging the
Government to introduce indicative annual ranges. The inclusion of the
ranges is a significant enhancement of the Bill. Friends of the Earth
described the inclusion of the clause as</div>
<a name="08070210000273"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;one of the most
important changes which the Government made to the
Bill&#148;,</div><a name="08070210000014"></a><div class="hs_Para">because
it adds political accountability. Members of the Committee will recall
that when the Conservative party launched our climate change Bill in
advance of the Queen&#146;s Speech in 2007, the inclusion of annual
targets was considered an essential part of the primary reason that any
five-year carbon budget would stretch across more than one
Parliament.</div>
<a name="08070210000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">We rightly
argued that we should not allow NIMTOism&#151;the new acronym,
meaning not in my term of office&#151;to infect carbon budgets. The
system is not sufficiently accountable, so a Government could sit
through a full term without ever having to report to Parliament on
their carbon reduction performance. It is conceivable that a future
Government could then dump their failure on a successive Government,
who would have to report on the budget in their first year in office,
having had little time to do anything about meeting
it.</div><a name="08070210000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need no better example of why the annual ranges are necessary than the
current Government&#146;s performance on cutting emissions. Despite
three manifesto commitments to reduce emissions by 20 per cent. by
2010, emissions have, in fact, increased since 1997, and the Government
quietly dropped their 20 per cent. target to just more than 15 per
cent. in 2006. That is what can happen without year-on-year
accountability. The addition of indicative annual ranges under clause
12 is a significant enhancement of the Bill, and it is a testament to
the sterling efforts of our colleagues from all parties in the other
place.</div><a name="08070210000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed,
Lord Rooker spoke favourably of annual accountability when he
said:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column162" />Column number: 162</div><a name="08070210000274"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;annual
transparency and accountability about progress towards meeting the
budgets are crucial for all of us. Some indication of the
Government&#146;s expected trajectory for reductions over the budget
period would help in providing them. It is important that there is no
divide between any sides of the House on
that.&#148;</div><a name="08070210000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government further stated in the other place
that</div><a name="08070210000275"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;setting
out an indicative range for the net UK carbon account for each year of
the budget period combined with greater clarity about the timescales of
policies to take effect...will ensure that the Government of the
day can be properly held to account for progress during each year of
the budget period, not just at the end of the
period.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report, House of Lords, </i>25
February 2008; Vol. 699, c.
496-7.]</div><a name="08070210000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we
all agree on that substantive point, I hope that we can also agree that
a range without definition is of little practical use to
anyone.</div><a name="08070210000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, if a five-year budget period has a total budget of 500 million
tonnes of carbon, it is hardly of any value to say that the indicative
annual range will be between 1 million tonnes and 150 million tonnes
per year, whereas it would be of real value if the indicative ranges
were set out year by year along the lines of year 1, which must be
between 115 and 125 million tonnes; year 2, which must be between 105
and 115 million tonnes; year 3, which must be between 95 and
105 million tonnes, and so
on.</div><a name="08070210000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the clause is worded, there is no obligation on the Secretary of State
to provide such an instructive range. He or she could set the range so
broadly as to be practically meaningless. That is why, in amendment
No. 53, we are proposing that the Secretary of State seeks
advice from the Committee on Climate Change before setting those annual
ranges. The committee would approach the exercise with not only an
expert but an apolitical and dispassionate eye. That should prevent any
unnecessary politicisation of the annual range, which could otherwise
be back-loaded, for example, so that much of the effort would fall into
the final year of a budget, by which time the Government who had set
the ranges might well be out of
office.</div><a name="08070210000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have further broad comments on the clause, but they relate to amendment
No. 54.</div>
<a name="08070210000023"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000321"></a><b class="B">Mr.
John Gummer</b> (Suffolk, Coastal) (Con): I am sorry to have
been two minutes late this morning, Mr. Cook. I make the
single point that, if one had the chance to read this morning&#146;s
newspapers, one would see just how cynical the public is about
politicians of all kinds. It made pretty miserable reading for any of
us who recognise that politicians in all parts of the House come to
this place to try and make the world a better place&#151;even though
we disagree with each other, that is why we are here. Today&#146;s
<i class="I">Daily Mail</i>, for example, is even worse than usual in its refusal
to believe the better of anyone, of any kind, in any circumstances,
from the Prince of Wales to the humblest Back
Bencher.</div><a name="08070210000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
I feel strongly about the amendment is extremely simple. We need to
provide the public with a mechanism whereby that cynicism cannot easily
be given rein. My hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle, in the
97 per cent. of his speech that I was lucky enough to hear, made that
point clearly. We need to ensure that there is clear recourse to the
Committee on Climate Change in order that the worst may not be thought
of politicians.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div><a name="08070210000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
self-denying ordinance not to praise the Ministers, because it has been
bruited abroad that that does them no good. Therefore, I take it as
read that they will behave properly. The Secretary of State, for whom I
have considerable respect, would certainly behave properly. However,
that is not the issue. We are, unusually, legislating for a long period
ahead. It is our purpose to create a framework within which we will be
working for a long time, under Governments of different persuasions and
Ministers of different
enthusiasms.</div><a name="08070210000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take that issue hard. During my time as Secretary of State for the
Environment, I took a great interest in the design and quality of
architecture, never realising that it was my personal interest that led
it to be moved forward along the agenda. Others did not have the same
interest in the quality of the built environment, particularly my
successor, the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East
(Mr. Prescott). He may have had other qualities, but not
that one. The result was that that agenda was not taken forward with
the enthusiasm and desire that I had
wanted.</div><a name="08070210000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Climate
change is also an area that can too easily rely on the enthusiasm and
commitment of individual Ministers. That is why I support my hon.
Friend&#146;s amendment. I do not think there is anything in it that
could possibly upset anyone, unless they did not want to meet the
parameters that I know the Government, the official Opposition, the
Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Nationalists all want to meet. It
does not seem to be an unreasonable
amendment.</div><a name="08070210000028"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000322"></a>The
Minister for the Environment (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
Two brief comments before I explain the Government&#146;s problem
with the amendment, although not with its intent. First, my advice to
you, Mr. Cook, and to all members of the Committee is not to
read the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i><i class="I">. </i>The problem goes away. Secondly, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East
(Mr. Prescott) is responsible for the renovation of
St. Pancras station. I must put that on the
record.</div>
<a name="08070210000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I always find
that it helps to go back to the explanatory notes to put the amendments
into context, and the explanatory notes for this Bill are especially
good. They explain the purpose of clause 12. As the hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle eloquently outlined, annual accountability was
discussed extensively in the other place and we have been over it many
times. Clause 12 addresses those concerns by requiring the Secretary of
State to produce a report setting out the indicative range for the
trajectory of the UK&#146;s net carbon account over the budgetary
period. The word net is important. I shall return to the expected range
in a moment. Clause 12 is a critical part of the Bill&#146;s
framework and will ensure transparency and accountability for progress
for every year of the budget period, not just at the end of the five
years.</div>
<a name="08070210000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">An indicative
annual range is superior to earlier proposals for a single-point annual
target because emissions can and do fluctuate from year to year for a
variety of reasons, some of which are well outside the control of the
Government of the day, such as the weather. A particularly bad winter
or a mild winter can have a big impact on annual figures. We all agree
that we need a system of annual accountability that can deal with
real-world fluctuations while still providing clarity about progress to
ensure that the Government of the day can be held to account
properly.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column164" />Column number: 164</div><a name="08070210000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
53 would require the views of the Committee on Climate Change to be
sought and taken into account in respect of the indicative annual
ranges before they could be set. That is not consistent with the role
envisaged by all of us for the committee. The committee has been
established to provide expert advice on the level of the carbon budget.
It is for the Secretary of State and Parliament, in consultation with
the devolved Administrations, to make decisions on the level of the
carbon budget and the policies needed to ensure that the UK remains
within that budget, which has been recommended and to all intents and
purposes set by the committee.</div>
<a name="08070210000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
formulating its advice, the committee will need to look at existing and
planned Government policies and the estimated impacts of those policies
in order to understand exactly what measures the Government have in
place to meet a given budget. It is then the job of the Government to
draw policy conclusions from the committee&#146;s analysis. That will
ensure that the Government of the day retain political accountability
to Parliament, and through that to the people, for their decisions. We
do not want the committee to be seen to be taking a particular policy
position, as that could undermine the credibility of the advice that it
provides on the carbon budget and its impartiality in performing its
scrutiny function.</div>
<a name="08070210000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">It will be
vital that the committee&#146;s advice is viewed as credible and
authoritative. For that to happen, it must be formulated outside the
political arena. The committee must therefore refrain from having a
role in the choice of policy mechanisms needed to meet a budget. The
question of decisions on the indicative annual range is no different.
It will be set based on the Secretary of State&#146;s analysis of the
policies that the Government intend to implement in order to meet the
carbon budget, and when they will take effect. That is why clause 14
requires that the Secretary of State should set out the time scales for
the policies and proposals.</div>
<a name="08070210000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The annual
ranges will depend on the policies implemented. Decisions on policy
matters should be made by the Government, not the Committee on Climate
Change, and we fear that amendment No. 53 would jeopardise that
position, as it implicitly requires the committee to provide advice on
the Government&#146;s policy mix for meeting their overall carbon
budget.</div>
<a name="08070210000287"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.45
am</div><a name="08070210000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall now answer the question from the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle about how wide we expect the range to be. Of course, if it is
too wide, it will not fulfil its function and will be meaningless. We
must look at the main factors that create uncertainties about annual
emissions and assess their likely effect on informing how the range is
set.</div>
<a name="08070210000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
already mentioned the weather; records show that exceptionally cold
winters, such as those in 1996 and 2001, caused an increase in
emissions by 4 per cent. compared with previous and subsequent years.
Another factor is the wider European context and the emissions trading
scheme, which covers about half of the UK&#146;s carbon dioxide
emissions and allows companies to make decisions over a five-year
horizon as to whether and when they abate their emissions. The actual
emissions in any one year would not necessarily be a fifth as those
policy decisions kick in.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div><a name="08070210000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee that the clause refers to the net carbon accounts, which
could fluctuate depending on how things are dealt with under the carbon
accounting rules. Other important factors include population growth or
shrinkage&#151;the annually revised population forecast by the Office
for National Statistics directly affects projected emissions. Put
simply, the more households that there are in the UK, the higher the
emissions are likely to be, although the goal of our housing policy in
new build is to neutralise carbon emissions.</div>
<a name="08070210000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point of
having annual indicative ranges, which are preferable, is so that we do
not simply take the five-year carbon budget, divide it by five and
declare that to be the annual target. We have some flexibility in
meeting the budget advised by the committee, which will give the
Government flexibility as well as the desired parliamentary
accountability. The intention of the amendment is to give more surety,
but we fear that it could inadvertently and unintentionally undermine
the committee&#146;s impartiality. That is my argument on amendment
No. 53.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000323"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I understand the Minister&#146;s argument, but
he has said some things that are slightly troubling, which I will
return to. Indicative annual ranges can take into account varying
circumstances or unforeseen events, to which the Minister has alluded.
The Committee on Climate Change, which I hope will be made up of
eminent but sensible people, will be able to take that in its
stride.</div>
<a name="08070210000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I find it
slightly strange that the Minister mentioned housing numbers as an
unforeseen circumstance. It is odd to think that we might suddenly be
taken by surprise at the number of houses built in any one year, as I
imagine that the Government can foresee the likely number of new houses
or dwellings that will be occupied. The weather, I agree, is out of
their control, but I expect them to have a firmer grip on the housing
stock. The Minister has alluded to severe winters, but there are mild
winters, too. We are more likely to experience milder winters than
severe ones as global warming continues apace.</div>
<a name="08070210000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">The crux of
the issue is the Minister&#146;s suggestion&#151;albeit implicit
rather than explicit&#151;that targets should follow policy rather
than policy should follow targets. He seemed to imply that it was not
for the committee to set policy and that we should therefore not have
indicative annual targets, because the policy may direct or produce
something rather different. Clearly, it should be the other way round.
We should have indicative annual ranges, which have inherent
flexibility, and policies should be designed to meet those ranges
rather than putting the ranges in place once we know the policies. The
policy is the servant, not the master, of indicative annual ranges and
the overall carbon budget. The danger with that slightly lazy thinking
is that it makes for less ambitious policy making and for the slight
sense that there is get-out-of-jail-free flexibility on the targets,
particularly if in the two or three years of the near term there is
some doubt whether the indicative ranges of the short-term trajectory
will be met. The trajectory should be the real spur to more ambitious
policies by Governments of whatever political hue.</div>
<a name="08070210000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The case for
indicative ranges is very clear, and I have not been persuaded by any
argument other than that they should be there. However, the Minister
has pointed 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>out his belief that that point is already in the legislation. Clause
12(1) sets out a duty to provide Parliament with a report setting out
annual indicative ranges for the UK. For the elimination of doubt, I
would have preferred that clause to be tightened by our amendment, but
if the Minister is going to resist on that point, I will not push the
amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="08070210000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000324"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 54, in
clause 12, page 6, line 41, leave
out from &#145;which&#146; to end of line 43 and insert</div>
<a name="08070220000001"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#145;the net UK carbon account for the
year must fall in order to meet the carbon budget for the relevant
budgetary
period&#146;.</div><a name="08070210000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 54 directly relates to our previous discussion. It is informed by
our concern that indicative annual ranges could be politicised,
particularly in a period of likely political change, when the end of
the carbon budgeting period would be likely to fall within the term of
a new Government. That could lead, if not to political shenanigans then
certainly a lack of ambition or other priorities on the part of the
Government of the day, whoever they
are.</div><a name="08070210000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">To
prevent that situation from arising, we have tabled amendment No. 54,
which would put a requirement on the Government to produce an annual
range that is tight enough to meet the trajectory required to meet the
carbon budgets. As clause 12 stands, all that the Government need to do
is predict where the carbon account should be in any given year.
Amendment No. 54 would ensure that the annual range is set
so as to fall inside the net carbon account for that budgetary period,

Mike Weir</b> (Angus) (SNP): I have a lot of sympathy with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s point, but, given the earlier discussion on the
ability of Ministers to amend the carbon budget within the five-year
period, how would his amendment fit within that, as it would mean that
the range has to show a fall within each year of the five-year
budget?</div><a name="08070210000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000326"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I will repeat the amendment for the hon.
Gentleman:</div><a name="08070210000277"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
net UK carbon account for the year must fall in order to meet the
carbon budget for the relevant budgetary period&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column167" />Column number: 167</div><a name="08070210000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is what we need to
be aiming for. If that budget were not met, an adjustment would be
required in the following year, but we should not anticipate that the
budget will rise or that the trajectory will be anything other than
down.</div><a name="08070210000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
all accept that there could be unforeseen circumstances, but we do not
accept that there are foreseen circumstances in which we would
anticipate a rise in the budget. If we can see factors that are likely
to push up carbon emissions, we should take other actions ahead of time
in other parts of the economy to depress carbon emissions. The whole
point of flexibility is to allow us to deal with unforeseen events,
which can only be addressed with the benefit of
hindsight.</div><a name="08070210000053"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000327"></a><b class="B">Steve
Webb</b> (Northavon) (LD): Will the hon. Gentleman help me
with my understanding of the clause, because I have become more
confused? In subsection (2), does &#147;fall&#148; mean decline? It
means fall within a range&#151;in other words, the provision states
that an indicative annual range is a range within which the figure must
fall. That does not mean that the figure must go down; it just means
that the figure must fall within the range. Am I right in that
understanding?</div><a name="08070210000054"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000328"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The hon. Gentleman is correct, but so too is the
assertion that the trajectory must be met. Obviously, the trajectory is
declining, and we do not anticipate that it will rise. The only reason
why it would rise is unforeseen circumstances. Does the Minister
foresee any circumstances in which we would anticipate the trajectory
rising and not take preventive
action?</div><a name="08070210000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000329"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> My understanding is the same as the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s&#151;&#147;to fall&#148; in subsection (2)
means to lie within the five-year budget. I cannot envisage
circumstances in which the trajectory would not fall, unless the
American presidential election throws up something really
unexpected.</div><a name="08070210000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000330"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I thank the Minister for that clarification, and
it has been useful to raise our concerns. I am looking forward to what
the Minister has to say on amendment No.
54.</div><a name="08070210000057"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000331"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for tabling a
helpful amendment. The amendment sounds like common sense, but I did a
bit of digging and the issue boils down to the difference between
&#147;expects&#148; and &#147;must&#148;. Let me
explain&#151;my argument is convincing and I am going to use
maths.</div><a name="08070210000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
clause requires the Secretary of State to set out the indicative annual
range within which he &#147;expects&#148; the net UK carbon account
to fall&#151;to lie within&#151;for each year of the budget period.
Amendment No. 54 would change that to the range within which the net UK
carbon account &#147;must&#148; fall to meet the carbon budget. I
consider the amendment unnecessary, given the existing provisions in
the Bill about both the Government&#146;s duty to meet the five-year
carbon budget and the strong framework for annual accountability. By
inserting &#147;must&#148;, the amendment would effectively change
the budgetary period to an annual one, which is not the
intention.</div>
<a name="08070210000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
explain the practical
problems.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column168" />Column number: 168</div><a name="08070210000288"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11
am</div><a name="08070210000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
way in which the Bill is worded makes it clear to Parliament, and to
everyone else, whether the Government are taking the necessary actions
throughout a budgetary period to ensure that the budget is met, but the
Government will not be acting unlawfully if emissions increase,
although I imagine that they could increase only slightly beyond the
level that the range sets out. Underpinning that, clause 5 places a
duty on the Government to ensure that the net UK carbon account for a
period does not exceed the carbon budget&#151;the five-year
period.</div>
<a name="08070210000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that the indicative annual ranges will effectively have to be set with
a view to meeting the budget. No matter where we are within the range
each year, at the end of the period we must still meet the budget. In
addition, there is the strong annual framework that I have spoken
about. Under clause 35, the annual report by the committee must set
out, inter alia, whether the budget is likely to be met. That is part
of the process which, I think, the other place urged upon us;
certainly, the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee did.</div>
<a name="08070210000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not sure
how amendment No. 54 would work in practice, as there would be both a
budget that had be met and a range for each year, which also had to be
met. The range recognises that emissions fluctuate&#151;we are agreed
on that&#151;so it would be possible for the net UK carbon account to
lie within the range for each year of a budget, but for the total net
carbon account to exceed the budget at the end of the period, because
if we hit the top of the annual range each year, that would, by
definition, be greater than the five-year budget. There is, therefore,
a practical problem with changing &#147;expects&#148; to
&#147;must&#148;. My argument is that it essentially makes the
annual period the budget and not a range, and mathematically, the
possibility of hitting the top of the range for each of the five years
would defeat the five-year budget target, which is more
important.</div>
<a name="08070210000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000332"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> That is a good explanation. Perhaps the Minister
would be kind enough to recognise the thought behind this amendment and
others, which was admirably expressed by the hon. Member for Angus. If
one looks at how the Bill must be written, the Government should be
able to make alterations, which may be up or down. Those of a cynical
disposition might say that that is all very well, but if the Government
were so minded, they could defeat the whole purpose of the Bill. We
know that it would be difficult, within the parliamentary arrangements,
for that to happen. It would be helpful, however, if the Minister
undertook to identify other parts of the Bill that exemplify the points
that he made in accepting the reasonable nature of the amendment. This
is one of those occasions where we must ensure that we are getting it
right and meeting public expectations. I have some sympathy with what
the hon. Member for Angus said, both today and in previous
sittings.</div>
<a name="08070210000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000333"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I have been reflecting that perhaps <i class="I">The
Guardian </i>is even more cynical than the <i class="I">Daily Mail</i>. It
certainly puts me in a worse mood. I can do what the right hon.
Gentleman requests. I do not believe that in the other place there was
a challenge to the point that he makes. I made reference to the
interrelationship with clause 5.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column169" />Column number: 169</div><a name="08070210000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
briefly put my mathematical argument, which I think is a convincing
one. Let us say that the relationship between a range within which
emissions must fall and an overall budget did not work. Suppose the
budget is 100, and for each year of the period the range is set
between, for the sake of argument, 15 and 25. If the net carbon account
for each year was 23, 22, 24, 25 and 21, we would still have complied
with amendment No. 54, which states that the net carbon account
&#147;must&#148; fall within the range, but we would have missed
the five-year budget.</div>
<a name="08070210000066"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000334"></a><b class="B">Martin
Horwood</b> (Cheltenham) (LD): The Minister&#146;s maths are
good, but his politics are less good. The annual targets do not release
the Government from the obligation to meet the five-year budget. The
mathematical possibility that the top of the range could be hit five
years running and the budget therefore missed does not mean that the
budget must not be met. That still applies. There are two sets of
complementary targets. Of course, if the top range of the budget for
the annual targets were hit repeatedly, budgets in later years would
have to be made tighter and
lower.</div>
<a name="08070210000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000335"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is why I said that the problem is the word
&#147;necessary&#148;. The amendment is unnecessary because of the
point made by the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle. By inserting the
word &#147;must&#148;, a duty is placed on the Secretary of State
under clause 12 that could be used to override the obligation that we
spent three hours debating earlier. It confuses budgets and annual
ranges.</div>
<a name="08070210000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000336"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> Again, the Minister is mathematically right but
politically wrong. The problem is not that the maths do not add up, but
that they would need to be added up only after the subsequent general
election. By supporting the amendment together with the Conservative
Front Benchers, we seek to hold the Government more precisely to
account on an annual basis.</div>
<a name="08070210000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000337"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am glad the hon. Gentleman accepts my maths,
even if he does not agree with me on the policy. I do not believe that
the amendment achieves what he wants it to do. In fact, it could
achieve the opposite. In the run-up to a general election, the
Government could set the annual indicative figure at the top of the
range. That would be within the law under the amendment, but outside
the law under the earlier obligation to meet the five-year carbon
budget. That would create political confusion. Precisely because I do
not want to do that, the amendment is
unnecessary.</div><a name="08070210000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would take us into an area where the annual indicative range
would effectively become an annual budget. That is not what we are
trying to achieve here or in the other place. I hope the hon. Gentleman
accepts that my policy is right, that my politics are right and not
particularly partisan, as this will happen in the future, and that
clause 5 overrides the need for amendment No.
54.</div>
<a name="08070210000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000338"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I have listened carefully to the Minister and have
endeavoured to follow his maths. His point is persuasive. I understand
and appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Cheltenham that
setting more 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column170" />Column number: 170</div>robust indicative annual ranges does not in any way negate or offset the
Government&#146;s legal obligations to meet the carbon budget.
However, I am mindful of the Minister&#146;s point that inserting the
word &#147;must&#148; could call into question the supremacy of the
five-year carbon account, and we do not want uncertainty or confusion
in the Bill.</div>
<a name="08070210000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clarity is
desirable, but I accept that the amendment may not be the best way of
achieving that. We will look again at the issue. In an ideal world,
there remains a case for tighter, clearer and more effective annual
indicative ranges within the context of a finite five-year carbon
budget. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

me make it clear that I am passionately committed to sustainable
development. I do not wish to remove the subsection from the clause,
but I am advised that such a suggestion is a means by which we can
discuss matters. I want to find out what the Government mean by
sustainable development, hence my proposal that we remove those words
from the Bill. My remarks will be brief because I want to hear the
Government&#146;s interpretation of &#147;sustainable
development&#148; and to know what their policies and proposals,
taken as a whole, will look like if we are to ensure that they
contribute to sustainable
development.</div><a name="08070210000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall define what sustainable development is not. What is unsustainable
development? I like the definition that an unsustainable situation is
one where the natural 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column171" />Column number: 171</div>capital&#151;the sum total of nature&#146;s resources&#151;is used
up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that
human activity uses nature&#146;s resources only at a rate that can
be replenished naturally.</div>
<a name="08070210000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Inherently,
the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept
of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of
environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life. Such
degradation on a global scale could imply the extinction of humanity. I
will not go down that route, which I explored in detail last week in
the context of biodiversity and rain
forests.</div><a name="08070210000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am passionately committed to sustainable development because it is one
of the main things that I spent a lot of time negotiating at Rio. When,
as a Minister, I had to negotiate a working breakfast with the Chinese
at 7 am, with the Indians at 8 am and with the Americans at
9 am, I needed a sustainable biodiversity system myself to
survive. Agenda 21 was one of the key documents that was signed and we
negotiated every word of it. As an incoming Minister, I had no idea of
the importance in UN-speak of getting each word correct. If we had
accepted the sloppy word, it would have meant &#163;3
billion extra being paid into some fund. Our representatives were
cautious as we negotiated the words.</div>
<a name="08070210000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Since 1992 in
Rio, the term &#147;sustainable development&#148; is thrown about
everywhere. With all due respect, I have a parish council that puts
down a new little park bench on the grass with a couple of daffodils
and says that it is fulfilling Agenda 21, the sustainable development
agenda. In some ways, the term is being diminished. There is utter
confusion about its meaning.</div>
<a name="08070210000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">With due
deference to the current Government and to the Government of whom I was
privileged to be part, I believe that the Brits are pretty good at
defining such matters. I left Rio understanding the meaning of
&#147;sustainable development&#148;, and I am certain that the
Government have a clear concept of its meaning. We should impose more
on the rest of the country and the rest of the world, because our
concept is probably right.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000348"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Clause 13 is an important part of the Bill. It
requires the Government to prepare a programme of emissions reductions
in order to stay within the carbon budgets established by the Bill.
However, we must be mindful that in order to reach macro-level targets,
by which I mean national and international level climate change
mitigation, many micro-level projects must be carried out. There is a
responsibility on us, as policy makers, to ensure that we do not
undermine the natural environment at a local level in the process of
trying to save it on a global
level.</div><a name="08070210000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border and I tabled
our amendments to get the Government to explain exactly how they
interpret sustainable development, taken as a whole, as opposed to
assessing each individual policy and proposal on the grounds of its
unique sustainability criteria. My right hon. Friend did an excellent
job if raising the issue of sustainable development as a term. I
wholeheartedly agree with him that the term is often meaningless and is
sometimes used as greenwash. I am not suggesting that that is the case
with this Bill, but it happens frequently elsewhere. A definition of
sustainable development would help to inform the wider debate around
environmental issues as a whole, and perhaps bring some clarity and
rigour back to our language on this most important of debates
nationally.</div>
<a name="08070210000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
55 would require the removal of the phrase &#147;taken as a
whole&#148;, which currently appears in line 13 of clause 13. Its
removal would require each individual mitigation option to be assessed
against the principles of sustainability, rather than assessing
proposals and policies only as a whole in the round. That would allow a
Government to appraise the different mitigation options available and
choose accordingly, rather than only viewing the sustainability of a
policy on a macro level.</div>
<a name="08070210000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">One need look
only at the unfortunate example of biofuels to see that just because
the ultimate Government objective is sustainability, it does not mean
that the policy goals to get there are themselves, largely through
perverse or unintended consequences, inherently sustainable. It is all
well and good to say that one cannot make an omelette without breaking
eggs, but surely everyone in Committee agrees&#151;I know that my
right hon. Friend agrees&#151;that it is nothing short of sheer
madness to chop down the world&#146;s single most precious natural
resource, the pristine rain forests, in the name of the environment to
achieve a nominal biofuel target.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column173" />Column number: 173</div><a name="08070210000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">While reducing
emissions from vehicles is an important part of reducing our overall

for example, would be to improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and
make significant transport emissions reductions, while at the same time
developing a biofuels policy that does not accelerate the destruction

species.</div><a name="08070210000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
understand that there will be difficult choices in assessing our
options for decarbonising the economy&#151;it will not always be a
win-win situation. However, as responsible stewards of today&#146;s
environment, as well as tomorrow&#146;s world, we want, as far as it
is possible to do so, to ensure that those choices are made
transparently and on the basis of a clear definition of sustainability,
rather than exclusively through the lens of cost-effectiveness or the
overarching 2050 emissions-reduction targets.</div>
<a name="08070210000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">For that
reason, Conservative Members in the other place successfully argued for
the requirement that the Government&#146;s programme of action should
meet the carbon budget in the Bill and be underpinned by the
principles of sustainable development. In doing so, the Government saw
fit to introduce a caveat into clause 13, which states that policies to
achieve our interim and long-term targets &#147;must&#148;,
when</div><a name="08070210000279"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;taken
as a whole...contribute to sustainable
development.&#148;</div><a name="08070210000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
light of that, will the Minister clarify his interpretation of that
phrase? I want to know that, in striving to achieve the
emissions-reduction targets to which all of us in this place are
committed, we are not legislating to allow Government policy to ride
roughshod over short-term or immediate sustainability
concerns.</div><a name="08070210000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000349"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> It is good to be serving under your chairmanship
again, Mr.
Cook.</div><a name="08070210000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
two amendments raise important issues, and it is particularly important
that amendment No. 55 is passed. Looking for a definition of
&#147;sustainable development&#148;, I can trump the right hon.
Member for Penrith and The Border by going back to 1987 and the report
for the UN by Gro Harlem Brundtland, &#147;Our Common Future&#148;.
That defined sustainable development
as</div><a name="08070210000280"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;development
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own
needs&#148;,</div><a name="08070210000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">which
is a wonderfully classic and succinct
definition.</div><a name="08070210000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
plucked that definition from the website of the Sustainable Development
Commission, which has rightly highlighted the risk that the various
definitions of sustainability, which include social and economic
factors as well as environmental ones, can be used to muddy the debate
and allow unsustainable policies to go forward. In particular, economic
sustainability is often taken to mean &#147;business as
usual&#148;, and it is used to justify policies that are the exact
reverse of sustainable when examined from an environmental perspective.
The biofuels example mentioned by the hon. Member for Bexhill and
Battle is interesting, although, frankly, a policy that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column174" />Column number: 174</div>allowed unsustainable biofuels to form the basis of our future biofuels
policy would not be &#147;sustainable&#148; under any of the
definitions.</div><a name="08070210000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
rather better example, which is specifically the responsibility of the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, involves setting
the shadow price of carbon, which had a direct impact on the decision
to endorse the third runway at Heathrow. The precise definition of the
shadow price used by DEFRA in effect reduced the social cost in
environmental terms of the Heathrow third runway from some &#163;13.5
billion, which it would have been if the methodology applied
by the Stern report had been used, right down to
&#163;4.8 billion, thereby making the difference between
that third runway going ahead or not. That is a brilliant example of
how the use of &#147;sustainable development&#148; needs to be
precisely defined. In that sense, taken as a whole, one could say that
the third runway at Heathrow is part of a package that the Government
might excuse as &#147;sustainable&#148; in the medium term. Looked
at in isolation, however, it is clearly not a sustainable
policy.</div><a name="08070210000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000350"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that another example
that illustrates that point is the way in which the Government make
their judgment about sustainable development and the protection of the
sea coast and rivers through the Environment Agency? By changing the
terms, what properly used to be considered as a matter for defence is
now being abandoned, because points are not awarded to anything that
might mean protecting the natural and historic environment. Again, that
issue concerns the definition of what is
sustainable.</div><a name="08070210000108"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000351"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman; he
obviously has expertise in this matter relating to his past
responsibilities and his constituency. He has made an important point,
although the sustainability of sea defences must be considered from an
environmental perspective as well as from a local
one.</div><a name="08070210000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
conclusion, definitions are important, and perhaps the Minister will
address the relative importance of economic and environmental
sustainability in his remarks. In light of the Stern report, we know
that long-term economic sustainability is intimately linked to the
environment, although in many parts of government there is still the
temptation to prioritise short-term economic growth over true
environmental
sustainability.</div><a name="08070210000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000352"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border
has referred to Agenda 21. He made the important point that the
profound effect of that conference was to set out a process that has
significantly changed how we and other countries look at the world. It
has had a significant effect on our analysis of economics, and it
challenged some of the basics of supply and demand economics in a
beneficial way. It has been noted that, on current estimates, we are
using the resources of three planets when we only have those of one.
That is not sustainable and people understand that.</div>
<a name="08070210000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will go
into the technical details to explain the Government&#146;s approach.
The purpose of the clause is to require the Government&#146;s
proposals for meeting carbon budgets to contribute to sustainable
development. That is central to Government policy&#151;we want to
live within environmental limits and we can only do so by means of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column175" />Column number: 175</div>a sustainable economy. That policy is partly expressed through the
Sustainable Development Commission, which was established in order to
provide scrutiny and encouragement and to ensure that Whitehall, and
its wider tentacles, are acting
sustainably.</div><a name="08070210000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
expression of the meaning of sustainable development is within the
SDC&#146;s remit, and I will outline it for the Committee. The
principles of sustainable development are ensuring a strong, healthy
and just society, living within environmental limits, achieving a
sustainable economy, promoting good governance and using sound science
responsibly. Those principles were outlined in
Rio.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000353"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Those terms are themselves open to interpretation.
What does the Minister believe a sustainable economy actually means?
That phrase is often abused or misused.</div>
<a name="08070210000272"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000354"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> A sustainable economy is a low-carbon economy that
puts a net contribution to carbon in the air in a downward direction.
It is about not only carbon, but how we ensure that we recycle and
reuse resources without a net depletion of the earth&#146;s natural
resources, including biodiversity. I am getting too academic&#151;for
the Committee as a whole, not particularly for you, Mr.
Cook&#151;and you are going to pull me back. I wish that I had not
said
that.</div><a name="08070210000290"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30
am</div><a name="08070210000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me turn to amendment No. 39. To ensure that we meet our objectives for
the five principles, we require that every Department publishes a
sustainable development action plan. In addition, the impact assessment
process, which must be applied to every new policy, requires appraisals
of the environmental, social and economic costs and benefits of
policies. As hon. Members know, we try to build the idea of
sustainability that stems from Rio into everything that we do. The
reason for enshrining the principle in legislation, therefore, is to
ensure that policy makers keep applying good sustainable development in
future years and under future Governments. We also expect to be closely
scrutinised by Parliament against the sustainable development
requirement in the Bill.</div>
<a name="08070210000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government added subsection (3), which the amendment would remove, in
the other place. We were responding to the strong views held there,
with which we agreed, that the proposals and policies should contribute
to sustainable development. For the reasons that I have explained, that
is important and something that should be retained. I understand the
intention behind amendment No. 39, but it would not achieve that
aim.</div>
<a name="08070210000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000355"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Does the Minister mean that the Bill should
contribute to sustainable development in the UK only, or that the
policies and proposals in the Bill should help to contribute to
sustainable development in the world, which would allow carbon trading
and so on?</div>
<a name="08070210000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000356"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Within the world. Our sustainability is dependent
on that point. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the often arduous
process of international agreement. The acceptance of sustainable
development in United Nations forums, and the fact that it is written
into treaties, is extremely important for this country and the rest of
the world. To try to extract that would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column176" />Column number: 176</div>practically impossible in terms of the global economy and dependence on
resources, food and so on. That would also take us back to the debate
on clause 1, which you, Mr. Cook, will not let me return
to.</div>
<a name="08070210000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
55, which relates to achieving sustainable development, is about
creating the right balance. We need to ensure that the UK&#146;s
package of policies for reducing emissions maintains the balance among
the key elements of sustainable development. It would be a good idea to
compare this policy with the carbon budget itself. Within the context
of meeting a carbon budget, some Government policies may give rise to
increased emissions, but the important principle is that the total net
UK carbon account should be restricted. Given that policies to meet
budgets are in that way considered as a whole, it makes sense that they
should contribute to sustainable development as a whole. I have already
set out the existing processes that are applied to every new policy
individually.</div>
<a name="08070210000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000357"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I am unhappy about that particular part of the
explanation. For example, the Ministry of Justice is just about to take
over a newly refurbished building that used to be the Home Office.
Despite considerable efforts, the Ministry of Justice still refused to
accept that putting in hydrofluorocarbon-driven air conditioning was
wholly contrary to any concept of sustainable development. It said
that, taken as a whole, what it was doing was better than what was
there before. Of course, it was Mr. John Gieve who did that,
as is the case on many such occasions. The fact of the matter is that
the one get-out that every civil servant and every Minister has is to
say, &#147;Taken as a whole, our policies are right, but we have an
excuse for this one.&#148; The new Home Office had the same excuse.
It said that it had signed up to the waste electrical and electronic
equipment directive, which would not allow non-HFC air conditioning. I
use that example because, after all, HFCs are 2,000 times as damaging
to the climate as CO<span class="Sub">2</span>. Unless we take everything into
account and do not allow Departments to get away with &#147;taken as
a whole&#148;, we will not win the
battle.</div><a name="08070210000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000358"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I felt uncomfortable in putting the argument
because I knew that the right hon. Gentleman would come up with an
example that would be difficult to justify. In practice, under the new
regime in the Bill, the carbon reduction commitment will include
Whitehall Departments, so the &#147;taken as a whole&#148; excuse
will be removed. I know that he will welcome that in the real
world.</div><a name="08070210000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second argument is stronger and more convincing. Consider the opposite
situation, in which one had to judge every action and policy as part of
the whole and to rule out any action or proposal that, in and of
itself, was damaging according to the sustainability criteria. An
ambulance trip that used polluting fuels, taken as a whole, would not
be allowed, and one could consider other examples. The right hon.
Gentleman shakes his head in mystification, but that is a good
example.</div><a name="08070210000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are times when actions are necessary. The impact of the action may be
negative, but it can contribute to an action that is positive overall.
It is rather like asking which is the most important wheel on the
car&#151;the front right, the front left, the back right or the back
left&#151;when all are needed.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column177" />Column number: 177</div><a name="08070210000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000359"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> On the Minister&#146;s example of the ambulance,
there can be no one alive who would not agree that it would be a
contribution to sustainable development to ensure that somebody got to
hospital in time. That must be the serious answer to the question. No
one would say that we should not do something because it costs a
certain amount of carbon to do
it.</div><a name="08070210000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
a question must be asked about the individual action. We cannot allow
an individual action to be smothered by the generality of &#147;taken
as a whole&#148;. I cannot imagine a single proper action that would
be stopped by the removing the phrase &#147;taken as a whole&#148;,
but I can imagine many improper actions that would be more difficult if
the excuse did not exist. I believe that in the Minister&#146;s heart
of hearts he knows that taking that little bit out would not put anyone
in a difficult position. Leaving it in will mean that they will go on
doing the things that they do now, as we have seen in the two examples
that I
gave.</div><a name="08070210000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000360"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I did not find the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument against my ambulance analogy very convincing. I thought that I
did well in picking that example against the much tougher example of
his experience of the Government
Department.</div><a name="08070210000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me reinforce my point. By including the phrase &#147;taken as a
whole&#148;, we are allowing for the carbon budget, and the policies
and proposals to meet it, to allow an increase in emissions in some
areas so long as they are paid for, and more so, elsewhere in the
economy.</div><a name="08070210000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cheltenham said that we had supported the third runway
at Heathrow. Let me be clear about the Government&#146;s policy. We
said that we would support the development of the third runway, but
only if we could be confident of meeting the strict environmental
conditions set out in the White Paper. There is clearly a net judgment
in all these matters. If one were simply to delete &#147;taken as a
whole&#148; from subsection (3), that would not allow our economy to
function properly. It would not allow people to go about their daily
business. It is the whole that we are trying to address, not each
individual part. The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal continues
to look
bemused.</div><a name="08070210000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000361"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> The Minister has explained the difference between
us. I do not believe that we should do anything that cannot be said to
contribute to sustainable development. That is why I am opposed to the
third runway at Heathrow, which is nonsense, and I am certainly opposed
to reworking the figures to make that fit the environmental
requirements, which is what the Government did, as the hon. Member for
Cheltenham pointed out. However, the point is that the Minister must
believe that the third runway at Heathrow contributes to sustainable
development, because if it does not contribute to sustainable
development, he cannot support it. That is the problem for us. We are
committed to a concept that nothing of that kind should be done unless
it contributes to sustainable development. If it is unsustainable, we
should not do it. That is why Opposition Members are very strongly
opposed to the methodology that the Government are using. That is why
the phrase &#147;taken as a whole&#148; is so
dangerous.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column178" />Column number: 178</div><a name="08070210000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000362"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. He has
outlined a principle very clearly, and I admire him for that. He is
right that I do not agree with him. I do not accept that we can run our
economy in a sustainable way, taken as a whole, based on the principle
that he has outlined. That would prevent us from doing many of the
things that we already do, and one could argue that in all sorts of
ways. I will stick with my ambulance example. He says that if there is
a policy in isolation that does not in and of itself contribute to
sustainability, we should not do it. I think that there should be other
judgments&#151;it might depend on who is in the back of the
ambulance.</div>
<a name="08070210000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me remind
the right hon. Gentleman of Ministers&#146; responsibilities. Let us
suppose that it was my certain belief, based on advice, knowledge and
certain communication&#151;I shall deliberately choose the difficult
example of Heathrow to try to pursue my argument&#151;that a failure
to expand Heathrow would inevitably result in an expansion of Charles
de Gaulle and Schiphol. I am not saying that, just in case the
journalists are quoting me out of context, as they never do in either
the<i class="I"> Daily Mail </i>or <i class="I">T</i><i class="I">he Guardian</i>. However<i class="I">,
</i>let us suppose that, and that the policies of the Governments of
the day of France and the Netherlands did not impose environmental
criteria on Charles de Gaulle and Schiphol and excluded them from their
considerations. Let us say, therefore, that the emissions caused by the
expansion of aviation at those two airports would be greater than those
predicted as a result of Heathrow. What would be the right decision
under the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
principle?</div><a name="08070210000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000363"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> But then the hon. Gentleman would be making what
he should be making: a decision on sustainability. He is saying that he
will have looked at the circumstances not in the round or as a whole,
but on that specific decision, given the particular parameters that he
has put forward, and he would be making a proper decision about
sustainability. It would not be about &#147;taken as a whole&#148;,
as he has interpreted it. He would have interpreted that phrase as
meaning that one can score off sustainability with other interests. I
am saying that the definition of sustainability&#151;this is why the
question of how one defines sustainability is so
important&#151;involves making the sort of decision that the hon.
Gentleman has just made. We disagree about the third runway at Heathrow
because I do not believe that it is necessary, because there are other
ways of doing things, and because the proposition that he put forward
is not true as it would not stop anyone else from building runways.
Indeed, it would encourage them. Therefore, the proposal is not
sustainable.</div><a name="08070210000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister continues to use his argument, he is making the same
references as I have made. He does not need the words &#147;taken as
a whole&#148;. That is what we are arguing about, not a runway. The
phrase is not necessary to defend him in his position. If it were left
in the clause, it would enable someone to decide to have a third
runway, even though that person had not made out a sustainable case for
it.</div><a name="08070210000291"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000364"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Fascinating, except that the Bill requires those
criteria to be judged. The logical consequence of the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s principled stand is that we would not need the rest
of the Bill. We would not need 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column179" />Column number: 179</div>carbon budgeting, carbon trading and the other things that we have been
talking about. We would simply say that an individual action must
contribute in and of itself to sustainability. I simply do not
agree.</div><a name="08070210000134"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000365"></a><b class="B">Tony
Baldry</b> (Banbury) (Con): Is not the candid explanation of
why the Government do not want to remove the phrase that if they were
to do so, it would be possible for any group to go to the High Court
for judicial review and say that a particular development was not
sustainable development? There would thus be an argument with the
courts about a nuclear power station, for example. That is why the
Government want the phrase. As I said earlier, they are desperate to
ensure that the Bill, when enacted, does not get anywhere near the
courts. It has been judicially proofed so that it cannot be
challenged.</div><a name="08070210000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000366"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> The hon. Gentleman must have been reading the
<i class="I">Daily Mail</i>. He is inculcated with cynicism. We included the
provision in response to the other place, not out of fear of judicial
action. I was trying to help. Sometimes when we read the <i class="I">Daily Mail,
</i>we conclude that we should not have bothered.</div>
<a name="08070210000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal outlined an important position and
showed the evolution of his policies and politics. I am not sure that
his point is shared by the hon. Members for Vale of York and for
Bexhill and Battle, nor do I think that the right hon. Member for
Witney (Mr. Cameron) would agree with it because there would
be huge consequences. However, I am repeating myself, so I shall now
sit down and shut
up.</div><a name="08070210000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000367"></a>David
Maclean:</b> I have listened carefully to the debate and I am
not convinced that the Minister has spelled out a good, sound British
definition of sustainable development, as I had hoped initially. The
hon. Gentleman&#146;s heart is in the right place, as is the
Government&#146;s, but I do not know where their head is. Perhaps the
cause is my thick head. I do not understand fully what the hon.
Gentleman was attempting to say and I am not sure that has he cut
through the confusion of the plethora of definitions of sustainable
development that exist throughout the
world.</div><a name="08070210000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Gro Harlem Brundtland Commission was a good starting point. When we
were in Rio, the
definition,</div><a name="08070210000281"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Development
that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their own

quoted about 10 times a day. It is simple and straightforward, but
applying it to every aspect of business and industrial development,
agriculture, farming, mining, quarrying, building and our lifestyle,
and then to the lifestyle of other countries with completely different
economic systems, takes us into severe
trouble.</div><a name="08070210000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to prolong the debate. I want the phrase to stay in the
Bill, so of course I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I
will conclude by trying to shed some light on the Home Office windows
and HFCs. I did not intervene in the debate&#151;it might have been
regarded as facetious&#151;but I spent four years in the old
building, where we were not allowed to open the windows because the top
half was heavier than the bottom half. They were hinged, almost in the
middle, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column180" />Column number: 180</div>and the top half could swing round, hit someone on the back of the head
and knock them down seven storeys on to the Scots Guards&#146; parade
ground below. The answer to the problem is not whether the gas is an
HFC or another one, but to let us just open the windows in future,
rather than use millions of pounds worth of air-conditioning. The same
may apply in this Room in
future.</div><a name="08070210000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
times, when we are looking at such highly complex subjects, we ought to
get back to a bit of simplicity. The concept of sustainable development
is simple. It is important. It is something to which Parliament will
return again and again, not necessarily in the Bill, but on other
occasions. It should stay in the Bill, but I hope that in future the
Government will be clearer about what they mean by sustainable
development. I beg to ask leave to withdraw my

following: Government amendment No.
5.</div><a name="08070210000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 33, in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000370"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We move on to clause 14. The reason for the clause
is that an essential objective of the Bill is to provide transparency
about the Government&#146;s plans and actions for tackling climate
change. As part of that transparency, the Bill requires the United
Kingdom Government to publish their proposals for meeting each carbon
budget. The report produced must be laid before Parliament as soon as
is reasonably practical after the setting of the budget. By providing a
clear indication of the strategy, the Government aim to reinforce
business and public confidence that robust plans are in place to ensure
that the budget will be met.</div>
<a name="08070210000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">The 15-year
plans published under clause 14&#151;the three five-year
budgets&#151;play an important part in providing the greater
predictability that the Bill aims to introduce. Businesses and
households that are planning investments will want to know not just the
overall level of the UK-wide budget, but the choice of policies that
could be implemented to ensure that the budgets are
met.</div><a name="08070210000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
right hon. Friend the Chancellor has announced that the first three
carbon budgets and the plans for meeting them will be set out alongside
the 2009 Budget. That timing draws an important parallel, also made by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column181" />Column number: 181</div>the Chancellor. Just as our public finances must balance over an
economic cycle, so we must live within our carbon budgets for the
health of the wider world and, therefore, for ourselves. The report
will be crucial in bringing together a range of policies and showing
how they will combine to meet the carbon budget. That will be a
combination of existing measures&#151;those, for example, contained
in the energy White Paper&#151;and new measures, to be announced
within the report or over the months before its
publication.</div><a name="08070210000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, clause 14 places the duty on the Prime Minister, reflecting a
change made to the Bill in the other place. I agree that, to tackle
climate change, we need a strong effort, not just across Government,
but across society as a whole. All parts of our society will have a
role to play. It is also the case that the Prime Minister is personally
committed to the fight against climate
change.</div><a name="08070210000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000371"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The Minister refers to the Prime Minster who, with
the best will in the world, does not have a long tenure left. Speaking
about legislation that he hopes will run to 2050, surely the Minister
cannot make such a reference and expect the Committee to accept
arguments based solely on the current occupant of No. 10? We do not
know what the personal commitment of any given incumbent of No. 10 will
be in 2020, 2030 or 2040. It does the Minister no good at all to set
out a personal conviction about the current, temporary occupant of No.
10 when defending the legislation.</div>
<a name="08070210000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000372"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I am grateful for the intervention. I was taking
the opportunity to make a partisan point. Hon. Members on both sides of
the Committee do that and the Government have the right to do so as
well. I do not argue that we should take direct reference to the Prime
Minister of the day out of the Bill because the current Prime Minister
is personally committed to the policy goals of the Bill. My argument is
based on the definitions of how we make legislation in this country.
Bills refer to the duties of the Secretary of State and throughout the
years that has clearly been interpreted to mean the Government
collectively. That is why actions and instructions are given in that
way.</div>
<a name="08070210000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">By placing
specific duties on the Prime Minister of the day, the wrong
interpretation could be given and political mischief could be made. The
<i class="I">Daily Mail</i> and <i class="I">The</i> <i class="I">Guardian</i> might suggest that not
putting the words &#147;the Prime Minister&#148; in the Bill could
be interpreted as meaning that the individual Prime Minister of the day
was not committed to the aims of the Bill, which would not be
fair.</div>
<a name="08070210000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000373"></a>David
Maclean:</b> Please correct me if I am wrong, but does not
Lord Stern continue to report to the Prime Minister on forestry issues?
If that is the case, surely it is inconsistent for the clause to refer
to the Secretary of State instead.</div>
<a name="08070210000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000374"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Knowing Lord Stern of Brentford, I do not think
that he considers that he reports to anyone. He says what he thinks and
he says it robustly. I do not accept the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s
argument. Amendment 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column182" />Column number: 182</div>No. 33 would have the effect of transferring further responsibilities to
the Prime Minister as an individual, in this case in relation to the
report required under clause 18. Amendments Nos. 76, 77 and 85 would
transfer responsibility to the Prime Minister individually for laying
before Parliament the Government&#146;s response to the annual report
of the committee, as required under clause 36. I have explained why we
disagree with the amendments, and I have moved new clauses to give
responsibility to the Secretary of State, which, let me make it clear,
means the Government collectively.</div>
<a name="08070210000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000375"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> My right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and
The Border makes a good point about Lord Stern, but he is not the only
senior policy adviser on climate change issues who reports not to DEFRA
but to the Prime Minister. Johan Eliasch, whom the Prime Minister
trumpeted with great publicity last year during his brief honeymoon, is
another individual who reports directly, privately&#151;I have not
seen any of his advice published or any interviews that he has
given&#151;and confidentially to the Prime Minister. How are those
considerations likely to be elucidated by the Secretary of State for
the Environment?</div>
<a name="08070210000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000376"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We are talking about law. It is the custom and
practice in the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament that duties are
placed upon the Secretary of State. As I have already explained, that
means the Government collectively. The Secretary of State delegates his
or her duties to his or her Ministers and we are all appointed by and
are accountable to the Prime Minister. That is clearly
understood.</div>
<a name="08070210000292"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="08070210000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are two intentions behind placing the duty on the Prime Minister. One
is including the Prime Minister&#146;s name as an indication that the
Government accept that this is a most important matter&#151;we have
described it as the most important matter facing humankind. The
argument put by others is, I believe, politically motivated, given that
a responsible Minister would take the advice of parliamentary counsel.
There are important reasons why, under legal process, the Secretary of
State is used. I am advised that it is not possible to take legal
action against the Prime Minister individually. It is possible to take
action against the Secretary of State only, the meaning of which is the
Secretaries of State collectively. There is good motive and bad motive
behind this attempt to include the Prime Minister. As ever, I am being
honest with the Committee.</div>
<a name="08070210000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000377"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Can the Minister help me on a boring machinery of
government point? We all understand how, for example, public spending
is worked out. Departmental Secretaries of State have bilaterals with
the Chief Secretary and eventually the Budget gets carved up. Clearly,
getting the carbon budget sorted out will require a fair amount of
negotiation among various Departments as to where the burdens fall. It
would help the Committee if we could understand whether a Cabinet
Sub-Committee will do this and, if so, whether that will be chaired by
the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Given
that I suspect that there will be some fairly serious horse trading on
this matter, one might imagine that, at some stage, the Prime 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column183" />Column number: 183</div>Minister&#151;whoever that might be&#151;will have to adjudicate.
Can the Minister give us some guidance on the machinery of government
process for setting the budget? That is something of a policy wonk
question, but the answer will be helpful to the
Committee.</div>
<a name="08070210000163"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000378"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is an important question. I bet that neither
the <i class="I">Daily Mail </i>nor <i class="I">The Guardian</i> will report the answer,
but that is probably because it is an important subject. I shall stop
making digs at those two newspapers as it is probably a bad career
move.</div><a name="08070210000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
answer to the hon. Gentleman&#146;s question is, as he will expect,
that the Cabinet will take overall responsibility, but there is an
existing Sub-Committee on Environment and Energy&#151;the ED(EE). I
occasionally get sent to it. The Cabinet Sub-Committee is dedicated to
the environment and energy and is chaired by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Its membership includes the Secretaries of State with
responsibility for environment, energy, transport and communities and
local government, and people from other Departments. That Committee has
been established under the authority of the Prime Minister to take
collective decisions in this area. We envisage that the Cabinet itself
will take the final decision. I hope that that has shed some light on
how we intend to proceed.</div>
<a name="08070210000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000379"></a>Several
hon. Members</b><b class="B">
</b><i class="I">rose</i><i class="I">&#151;</i></div>
<a name="08070210000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000380"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Rather than stopping interventions, I have now
prompted more, as transparency always
does.</div><a name="08070210000167"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000381"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Hurd</b> (Ruislip-Northwood) (Con): Will the Minister
confirm that Prime Minister Blair chaired the energy and climate change
Sub-Committee under the previous
Administration?</div><a name="08070210000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000382"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I cannot confirm that, but I shall come back to
the hon. Gentleman. The Cabinet Sub-Committee structure is much
improved in my view. It is much more streamlined, much clearer and more
pragmatic. Sofa government has ended and proper decisions are taken in
proper places under the new structure, which I welcome. The hon. Member
for Banbury asked an important question because behind it is
recognition of the importance of the carbon budget-setting process and
the policy-setting process that flows from
that.</div>
<a name="08070210000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000383"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> One of the Minister&#146;s arguments against
including the words &#147;Prime Minister&#148; in the provision was
essentially that we do not do that kind of thing in legislation. I am
sure that he will have been briefed and will thus be aware that the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 places a duty on the Prime
Minister to report to Parliament. One reason for that was that there
were concerns about the power and it was felt necessary to assure
people that the Prime Minister was involved. If it was okay in that
instance, is not the present one even more
important?</div><a name="08070210000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000384"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> Perhaps I may deal first with the point made by
the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood: the previous Prime Minister
chaired the previous Committee on energy and the environment, and the
Deputy Prime Minister was the deputy Chairman. The Committee is now
chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Ruislip-Northwood on his recollection and, perhaps,
homework.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column184" />Column number: 184</div><a name="08070210000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return to
the question asked by the hon. Member for Northavon, there is a
difference. I have checked out the list of things that the Prime
Minister is required by legislation to do, in contexts where my
predecessors as Ministers in this situation lost the argument. There
are some pretty obscure ones, but the difference is that the very
nature of the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman accepts, is to put a legal
duty on the Government to meet their carbon budget. It is not possible,
I am advised, to take legal action against the Prime Minister. Legal
processes relate to the Secretary of State. That should give the hon.
Gentleman the reassurances that he needs.</div>
<a name="08070210000172"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000385"></a><b class="B">Miss
Anne McIntosh</b> (Vale of York) (Con): I mean to help the
Minister. He says that he does not want the Prime Minister to be
mentioned in place of the Secretary of State in the provision because
the legal action that might arise could be pursued against only
Secretaries of State collectively. However, does he realise that what
we want the Prime Minister to do in this instance is report on the
policies, not deliver on them? If we consider the percentage of carbon
emissions for which DEFRA is responsible, the Minister will know that
the bulk of such emissions fall to other Departments. That is an
additional reason to agree to including the Prime Minister in the
provision&#151;purely with respect to the duty to report to
Parliament&#151;rather than the Department, whose duty it will be to
deliver.</div><a name="08070210000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000386"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I take the hon. Lady&#146;s point, although I am
disappointed that she does not support my efforts to increase the
standing of the work of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs in future&#151;the provision would have consequences in that
regard. My arguments about breaking with the way we do things remain
valid&#151;I do not use the term &#147;break with
tradition&#148;, as I am all in favour of that if it makes an
improvement, unlike, often, the hon. Lady&#146;s party. The
traditionalist wing of the Conservative party argues that we should
keep things as they are unless there is a good reason not to. A good
reason has not been put forward. Therefore, to be consistent, the
traditionalists should support the status
quo.</div><a name="08070210000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
point is that there is a good reason for designating Secretaries of
State in law, rather than the Prime Minister or other Ministers. It is
not just a matter of tradition, but part of our legal framework. I ask
the Committee to accept my explanation. I think that I have answered
the question asked by the hon. Member for Banbury by explaining the
seriousness that is given to the matter within the machinery of
Government. I hope that the matter will not be pressed to a
vote.</div><a name="08070210000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000387"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> I also want to move amendments Nos. 46 and 47 to
51.</div><a name="08070210000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000388"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. The amendments being debated with
amendment No. 4 are Government amendment No. 5 and amendments Nos. 33,
76, 77 and 85. Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 to 51 are in the next group
and are not to be discussed
yet.</div><a name="08070210000177"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000389"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I feel very strongly about this matter and think
the Minister has been ill advised as to why this is so necessary. I
remember when we started on this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column185" />Column number: 185</div>whole course, when the then Prime Minister set up the first committee
that was to report on these matters, under Sir Crispin Tickell. That
committee reported directly to the Prime Minister; that was the purpose
of it. Sir Crispin had access to the Prime Minister. He reported to the
Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister presented such reports as he
made. That was done so that we could say that the issue of climate
change was so important that it had to be a central concern of the
Government as a whole.</div>
<a name="08070210000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was in
the days in which there was a much stronger Department of the
Environment in the simple sense that&#151;and I make no
criticism&#151;it had control of local authorities. It spent a
quarter of the budget of the nation. It controlled planning, water and
other resources. It was a Ministry that had in its own hands the
mechanisms of delivery of many of the issues of sustainable
development. In particular, it had the mechanisms by which we would
meet our carbon budget. Even in those circumstances, and with a
Secretary of State whom I think most would admit actually cared about
these matters, and was in the same position as the present Secretary of
State for EFRA&#151;I am not making a distinction&#151;it was felt
by the Government to be far too important not to commit the Prime
Minister to that purpose.</div>
<a name="08070210000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the days
when I had to explain that, because the concept of climate change was
nothing like as central as it is today, I used to use the example of
the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s belief that if one runs a
business, even if one has a special health and safety director or
officer, health and safety should be the responsibility of the chief
operating officer. In every company on whose board I have ever sat, I
have always insisted that that should happen. Only by doing that does
one say that the most important thing about the business is that people
go away at the end of the day as healthy as they can. That is duty No.
1 of any employer. It is a mechanism of showing that a business has
chosen to emphasise what is the key issue for its future.</div>
<a name="08070210000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">The key issue
for the future of the United Kingdom and the world is dealing with
climate change. In history, in circumstances when that was much less
understood, the Prime Minister took that responsibility. Rather slowly,
it has emerged that under the Cabinet arrangements under the previous
Prime Minister, he took that view too. I remember the announcement when
he said that he had to be chairman of this, and the Deputy Prime
Minister had to be his deputy, because it was so important. I did not
choose the Deputy Prime Minister; he did, and that is the situation,
but if he were the Prime Minister, that was the right thing to
do.</div><a name="08070210000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
body is now chaired, if I may so, by the one man who appears to know
nothing at all about the issue, but who is there because it is accepted
that one cannot deal with these matters unless not just the
responsibilities of DEFRA, but the energy bit as well, are treated
together. As neither of those Secretaries of State could chair it, we
have to have somebody else. As happens in all Governments, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer is given the job, whether he knows anything
about it or cares about it. I think that that is a thoroughly bad way
forward.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column186" />Column number: 186</div><a name="08070210000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the quality
of life commission that I had the honour to chair, we proposed that the
new Department that we would create would be a much more powerful
version of DEFRA and would retain and bring back some of the powers
that were sadly removed from it ad hominem, or ad feminem&#151;we all
know how DEFRA was created. Our idea was that there would be somebody
in that Department who was the equivalent of the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury so that it was accepted that the carbon budget would be a
tough one and somebody in that Department&#151;the Minister might
find himself in that position&#151;would have the power that the
Chief Secretary has to say not just to DEFRA, but to all Departments,
&#147;You have to meet the budget.&#148; No doubt people would come
to that Minister, even though he was a junior in the Cabinet. The one
time someone goes to a junior Minister is when they go to the Chief
Secretary to argue their case. The Secretary of State for Defence would
be there arguing with the Minister about his carbon budget, although
the hon. Gentleman would then be a right hon. Gentleman and a very
powerful
man.</div><a name="08070210000293"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="08070210000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is the concept that we had. We recognise that it demands a serious
change in the structure of Government. If we could have put that in the
Bill, that would have been good. It would be non-party political to say
that the two Departments created ad hominem and ad feminam have failed
because they were each built for a person and not for a purpose. That
is one of the problems with the Department for Communities and Local
Government, and it is the problem with DEFRA too. I have no doubt that
any Government, including the present one, will change the structure of
Government given the effluxion of time, so that they face what has to
be done, rather than operating on the basis of personalities, of who
has to be given
what.</div><a name="08070210000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
that is the case, we will have a more powerful DEFRA, so the argument
could be that DEFRA should have the responsibility. However, that
argument does not stand, for a simple reason. It will be an uphill
battle for all of us to make people understand that doing the job that
we need to do is the central purpose of Government. We need those token
statements. I say that as a traditionalist. We should never change
things unless we can show that they are broken, but if we can show that
they are broken, we should change them rapidly. The present system is
broken. The Department is not strong enough. It does not even chair the
Committee that it should be dealing with. There is nobody in the
Department who has ever shown that he could make other Ministers meet
DEFRA&#146;s the demands. I say that with great sadness, because it
ought not to be
so.</div><a name="08070210000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have to find a way through, and I beg the Minister to think again. He
is making the situation worse. He knows perfectly well that if we had
&#147;Prime Minister&#148; in those places in the Bill, the
difficult legal situations would not matter a fig. I remind the
Minister what I said about the lawyers in the Department of the
Environment when I went there: they are there to deliver what the
Government want in a way that makes what the Government want legal.
They are not there to explain to the Government why they cannot have
what they want. If the Government wanted the words &#147;Prime
Minister&#148; in the Bill, they would appear there. That is a fact.
The Government would tell the lawyers to go 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column187" />Column number: 187</div>where they ought to go, to the underground dungeon where they find the
legal mechanisms to deliver the policies that the Government decide
on.</div><a name="08070210000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not support the proposition of the interesting argument about who
one can sue who for what. I just want to say to the Minister that if he
takes the words &#147;Prime Minister&#148; out of the Bill, he will
say something very clearly to the public. He may not mean it, but he
will say, &#147;The Government do not take the same view of the
importance of the Bill as the House of Lords took.&#148; It may have
been better for the House of Lords not to put &#147;Prime
Minister&#148; in, although I do not happen to think so, but as those
words now appear in the Bill, I beg the Minister not to remove
them.</div><a name="08070210000187"></a>

such as Lord Wakeham, who have been through the process so often and
who have understood at the sharp end how the machinery of government
works. The other House collectively put that in because it recognised
that the carbon budget will work only with such a
mechanism.</div><a name="08070210000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000391"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I am sure that is right, but I want the Minister
to take seriously what he would be doing by taking &#147;Prime
Minister&#148; out. First, I do not think it will be out
permanently&#151;the House of Lords will put it back in again,
because it is so clearly important. The public will see taking it out
as the Government resiling from the centrality of the
issue.</div><a name="08070210000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle was right to point out
that the issue is not about the present Prime Minister. Many of us have
our doubts about the present Prime Minister and his commitment to
climate change, but some people do not have those doubts. That argument
is perfectly reasonable and even party political, but I do not mind.
The measure relates to any Prime Minister. I want the incoming Prime
Minister to know that the issue is his or her responsibility. I want
people to recognise that until 2050 that is their responsibility, in a
way that nothing else is. That it is not in any other Bill, because the
Bill is not the same as other Bills. No other Bill has ever laid such
responsibilities on the Government. No other Bill has ever looked
forward, specifically, to a point so many years ahead. That is why the
Bill is important. If the Minister goes on in this way, I am seriously
worried about the impact that it will
have.</div><a name="08070210000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000392"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> Does my right hon. Friend agree that the argument
boils down to a simple issue&#151;leadership? On the issue of climate
change, which runs across the economy and society, involving every
aspect of our national life, not having the Prime Minister at the helm
sends an extraordinarily confusing and weak message to the British
electorate. The issue is so important, yet it can be devolved to a
Secretary of State whom they may never have heard
of.</div><a name="08070210000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000393"></a>Mr.
Gummer:</b> I hope the Government will show a greater
awareness of public feeling about the matter than has sometimes been
true of late. The Minister is the sort of Minister who might understand
that. I very much hope that he will desist from pressing the
amendments.</div>

Horwood:</b> I oppose Government amendments Nos. 4 and
5.</div><a name="08070210000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister has great intellectual powers, but even those are stretched by
trying to justify the removal of the words &#147;Prime
Minister&#148; from clause 14. He seriously suggested that it was
less confusing to have the words &#147;Secretary of State&#148; in
the Bill, arguing that that somehow implied responsibility across
Government. From our earlier debates, it is clear that the confusion
would be far greater if the words &#147;Secretary of State&#148;
appeared in the
Bill.</div><a name="08070210000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for South Swindon rightly pointed out, we are not
talking about the delivery of the policies in detail. We are talking
about a duty to report to Parliament. That seems an easy duty to lay,
legally, on the Prime Minister. The right hon. Member for Suffolk,
Coastal is exactly right. When I was in business, lawyers were paid to
tell us how to do things, not paid to tell us how not to do them or why
they are impossible.</div>
<a name="08070210000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
important for the words to be retained and extended to clause 18 as
well, and to clause 36 to take account not only of the initial
proposals and policies for meeting carbon budgets, but of the duty to
report on compensation for budget excess, if that occurs, and to
respond to the committee&#146;s periodic reports on progress.
Amendment No. 85 spotted a reference to the Secretary of State that we
had not identified, although probably not the most crucial one, in
respect of the person who lays the order. However, I am happy to
support it, for the sake of
consistency.</div><a name="08070210000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Northavon, with uncharacteristic unkindness,
once referred to DEFRA as a &#147;piddling little Department&#148;.
Let me put it more sympathetically. Staff and Ministers at DEFRA have
often proved themselves very committed and very understanding of the
issues of climate change. Indeed, its former Ministers have
periodically added to the ranks of the greenest Members of Parliament.
The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal is a case in point, but
there are some on the Labour benches as well. If DEFRA is piddling, it
is at least piddling in the right direction. The risk is that it is
simply outgunned by much more significant Departments.</div>
<a name="08070210000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Communities and Local Government refuses to accept that
housing targets should be amended in a housing downturn, when the
growth rate is half the rate anticipated when those targets were set.
The Department refuses to accept any arguments about the environmental
consequences of ploughing ahead with those high housing numbers without
democratic consultation at local level.</div>
<a name="08070210000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">When large
amounts of land are cleared for development&#151;both greenfield and
brownfield, to accommodate extremely high numbers&#151;the result is
that, in a downturn, the greenfield sites, having been released for
development and being the more profitable, are developed first, so the
environmental damage is greater. The argument should be in favour of
sustainable development, and the understanding of sustainable
development should be promoted in order to change such
policies.</div><a name="08070210000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department for Transport, contrary to what the Minister implied, is
giving a green light to the third runway at Heathrow and is responsible
for policies relating to the level of investment in our railways. It 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column189" />Column number: 189</div>seems an opportune moment to mention the Swindon-Kemble line, a crucial
part of that investment, where the doubling of capacity needed would
help to take people out of their cars in large numbers and stop them
travelling from my constituency to Swindon to avoid the terrible rail
service that we have at present. Such investment is crucial to the
local battle against climate
change.</div><a name="08070210000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000398"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful for your guidance, Mr.
Cook, and of course you are right. I should have been pointing out on
each of the examples that DCLG is responsible not to DEFRA, but to the
Prime Minister, that the Department for Transport is responsible not to
DEFRA, but to the Prime Minister, and that DBERR is responsible to the
Prime Minister, as is the Treasury, whose green taxes are such a
crucial element of the battle against climate change. We are seeing the
potential undermining of public support for green taxation because of
the Treasury&#146;s unwillingness to link green taxes explicitly to
reductions in other taxes to make it clear that it is
revenue-neutral.</div>
<a name="08070210000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
international Departments are similarly responsible to the Prime
Minister and not to DEFRA. They are responsible for climate change
negotiations at international level and for policies that will
influence the way in which Governments all over the world tackle
climate change in their own
environments.</div><a name="08070210000206"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="08070210000399"></a><b class="B">Ms
Karen Buck</b> (Regent's Park and Kensington, North) (Lab): Is
it not also true that all the examples cited by the hon. Gentleman
would, under the Bill, be subordinate to the targets that we are
setting for CO<span class="Sub">2 </span>emissions, so the issue of who is
responsible is
irrelevant?</div><a name="08070210000294"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000400"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> The hon. Lady makes an important point, but it
actually supports our argument for having 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column190" />Column number: 190</div>the Prime Minister&#146;s name on the face of the Bill. It is
precisely because all the policies and proposals set out in clause 14
will be implemented by a range of Departments that it is important to
make a Minister responsible for them and for laying the report before
Parliament. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs simply will not be responsible for most of those policies and
their
impacts.</div><a name="08070210000208"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000401"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Further to my hon. Friend&#146;s response, is it
not also the case that there is an aggregate target for the whole of
Government, rather than individual Departments? If the Prime Minister
is not responsible, the Department for Transport might say that it
would only do a small bit of the work, although it felt that the
Government targets were great, because someone else should have the
hassle of doing the rest of it. Only the Prime Minister has the
authority to bang heads
together.</div><a name="08070210000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000402"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> My hon. Friend is exactly correct. We are all
familiar with the experience of trying to raise an issue that seems to
blur boundaries at ministerial questions and being told by the relevant
Minister that it is a matter not for them, but for one of their
colleagues.</div><a name="08070210000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">DEFRA&#146;s
website sets out the precise impact of the various areas with regard to
carbon emissions. The 2006 figures showed a UK total of 554 million
tonnes. Of those, 221 million tonnes came directly from energy supply,
which is the responsibility of DBERR and through it the Prime Minister,
but not DEFRA. Business contributes 92 million tonnes, which, again, is
the responsibility of DBERR and the Prime Minister, but not of DEFRA.
Transport contributes 133 million tonnes, which is the responsibility
of the Department for Transport, and the residential sector contributes
81 tonnes, which is largely the responsibility of the Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Prime Minister, but, again,
not of DEFRA.</div>
<a name="08070210000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">The only
areas that are directly attributable to DEFRA&#146;s responsibility
were the 4.5 million tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> from agriculture and
400,000 tonnes of CO<span class="Sub">2</span> from waste management. Obviously, the
picture on methane is different, but even in that regard a substantial
amount comes from non-DEFRA areas of responsibility. Some of the larger
sources of emissions, such as transport and energy supply, are still
increasing, so it is vitally important not to send the wrong signals on
who will take responsibility.</div>
<a name="08070210000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is both
a political and a legal issue. Politically, the rapier-like question
from the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood precisely highlighted why we
have to worry about a lack of interest from the Prime Minister on the
issue. The fact that the Prime Minister has decided to abandon the
chairmanship of that vital committee is possibly an indication, which
Opposition politicians fear, that he is losing interest. This is a
wonderful political opportunity to reinforce the Prime
Minister&#146;s personal commitment and ensure that all future Prime
Ministers are held similarly
accountable.</div><a name="08070210000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
legal terms, my hon. Friend the Member for Northavon briefly mentioned
two pieces of legislation that set an important precedent&#151;the
Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act 2000. As GCHQ is located in my constituency, I am
particularly pleased with those examples. The point is that they cover
an important matter of absolutely vital national interest. It was for
that reason that the then 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column191" />Column number: 191</div>Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr.
Straw), made it clear why the powers in that Bill were being laid on
the Prime Minister and not on himself. He said that it would offer
public reassurance on the use of powers in that Bill, and the power
given to the Prime Minister was to lay before both Houses of Parliament
a copy of every annual report made by the interception of
communications commissioner under subsection (4), together with a
statement on whether any matter had been excluded from that copy in
pursuance of subsection (7).</div>
<a name="08070210000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is an
identical kind of reporting requirement to those that we are discussing
in relation to the clause. If it was legal for him, why is it not legal
under the Bill? That seems to be a powerful legal argument. The right
hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal made an eloquent plea for the Minister
not to wriggle out of the situation on legalistic grounds. That is
exactly right, otherwise we might suspect that fiddling is still a more
appropriate
description.</div><a name="08070210000215"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000403"></a>Mr.
Weir:</b> The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal made an
impassioned plea, and I endorse his argument. Throughout our
discussions, we have been saying that the United Kingdom is a leader
and is making a strong commitment by drafting the first Bill on carbon
reductions. A further signal would be to include the Prime Minister in
the Bill to show that the reduction of carbon emissions is the greatest
issue of our
age.</div><a name="08070210000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a more practical level, over the years carbon budgets will perhaps
become the most important part of the Government&#146;s business in
setting the carbon target to 2050. It will be a cross-departmental
process, and it will undoubtedly mean great squabbling between
Departments on how the carbon cuts are allocated. As has been pointed
out, many carbon-emitting industries are not under the control of
DEFRA. At present, 37.4 per cent. of carbon emissions come
from the energy industry, and 17.8 per cent. come from other
industries&#151;both sets of emissions are under the control of
DBERR. In effect, more than 50 per cent. of all carbon emissions come
from its departmental portfolio. It might therefore be more appropriate
for DBERR to have control of carbon emissions, not DEFRA. The
decarbonisation of our energy supplies will be crucial in whether we
can reduce carbon emissions in the first place, irrespective of what
form of energy we might support in the
future.</div><a name="08070210000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the Minister to consider a point to which he has referred on
several occasions. The reduction of carbon emissions concerns not only
the UK Government, but devolved Administrations. There will have to be
great contact between the various Administrations to reach agreement on
how they tackle their part of carbon reduction. For example, the
Scottish Parliament is to have its own climate change Bill, which is
due to be published shortly. There will be similar movement in Wales as
the Assembly gain more powers, which will happen under the measures
currently passing through this place. The same will apply to Northern
Ireland, so there will have to be great contact between the First
Ministers of the devolved Administrations, along with the
Prime Minister, through the Joint Ministerial
Committees.</div><a name="08070210000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we are to impose reductions and agreement is to be reached between
Departments and the devolved Administrations, the matter must be under
the personal 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column192" />Column number: 192</div>control of the Prime Minister. They must provide leadership to show that
we are all working together and demonstrate the importance of such
matters throughout the United Kingdom. The clause needs to retain
reference to the Prime Minister in order to send out a clear
signal.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000404"></a>Miss
McIntosh:</b> The most disappointing part of the
Minister&#146;s speech was his not accepting the outcome of the
debate and the vote in the other place. We are not convinced by his
argument why the Prime Minister should not play such a role. As I said
earlier, the Prime Minister should report. We are not asking the Prime
Minister to deliver, but it is only the Prime Minister&#151;whoever
they may be&#151;who has the international status and the domestic
gravitas to report on such
issues.</div><a name="08070210000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
for percentages, the energy industry, which falls to DBERR, is
responsible for more than 37 per cent. of carbon emissions. Road
transport alone, which falls to the Department for Transport, accounts
for more than 21 per cent., and other industries, which presumably
include aviation, shipping and others, account for almost 18 per cent.
and fall partly to the DBERR and partly to DEFRA. Residential
households produce 15 per cent., and the hon. Member for Cheltenham has
said that agriculture, farming and waste management constitute the
small amount for which DEFRA is responsible. I am not convinced by the
Minister&#146;s argument, although I welcome his assurances that he
wants to give more certainty to households and businesses.</div>
<a name="08070210000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mention has
been made of the Department&#146;s clout and responsibilities. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal referred to the
Conservative party&#146;s quality of life policy group and proposals
for beefing up the Department, and I believe that his point was much
more convincing. How does the Minister respond to that?</div>
<a name="08070210000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clearly, the
Prime Minister should be responsible for reporting to Parliament on the
matters before us. Page 18 of the Government&#146;s final impact
assessment

costs can be minimised by setting the right policies in place to
incentivise the most cost-effective methods of
mitigation.&#148;</div><a name="08070210000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely,
that should be a role for the Prime Minister, not individual
Secretaries of State&#151;albeit through the Secretary of State with
responsibility for the environment.</div>
<a name="08070210000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
2.3.10 on page 19 of the impact assessment
states:</div><a name="08070210000284"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
choice of policy instrument is also likely to have a significant
distributional effect: regulation, market mechanisms or fiscal measures
will have divergent distributional
impacts.&#148;</div><a name="08070210000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
assessment goes on to argue that businesses and households are looking
for continuity and determination in the Government&#146;s policy from
the outset. However, in moving the amendment, I did not hear from the
Minister why he believes that a Secretary of State is better placed to
fulfil that responsibility. Under the Intelligence Services Act 1994,
which was passed by a Conservative Government, the Prime Minister has
duties similar to those before us today and must report on national
security. The hon. Member for Cheltenham gave a similar example, but
there are also less obscure ones. For example, let us bear in mind that
a previous chief scientific adviser has said that climate change is the
greatest threat facing this
country.</div><a name="08070210000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for East Surrey
(Mr. Ainsworth) stated:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column193" />Column number: 193</div><a name="08070210000285"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The

<a name="08070210000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">We believe that DEFRA
is already collapsing under the weight of its responsibilities for
flooding, farming, food, nuclear waste, water supply, fishing, coastal

a vast number of new tasks.</div>
<a name="08070210000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the Prime
Minister&#146;s initial reporting duties were first mooted in the
other place, the Bill contained more of them than it does now. Most of
them dealt with reporting on facts and other historical issues, which
would not change as a result of the Prime Minister making the statement
and producing the report. Such responsibilities would require the Prime
Minister to report only on aspects of the Bill that are truly and
inevitably cross-departmental. Those responsibilities are, first, that
the Prime Minister must respond in Parliament to the Committee on
Climate Change&#146;s annual report on national progress towards
meeting out carbon budgets, and, secondly, that the Prime Minister must
report on Government strategies for meeting those budgets. The second
duty would occur approximately every five years. The Prime Minister
would be required, therefore, to produce just one report to Parliament
per year on certain matters, plus an additional report on strategy
approximately every five years. If the Minister puts the matter to a
vote and wins, I hope that he will at some stage&#151;either when he
sums up this group of amendments or on another occasion&#151;specify
what additional resources will be made available to his Department to
draw together those strands. Lord Rooker clearly stated to the EFRA
Committee, on which I have the honour to serve, that there will be no
further legislation or responsibilities, because the Department has no
resources.</div><a name="08070210000295"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000405"></a>Tony
Baldry:</b> Since the Bill was debated on Second Reading, Lord
Stern has advised that the cost of tackling global climate change has
doubled from his original estimate of 1 per cent. of GDP to 2 per cent.
Introducing carbon budgets will not be painless, and there will be a
hit on various sections of the economy. We all know that those various
sectors will go to their sponsoring Departments and make special pleas
as to why they should take less of the hit on carbon budgets than other
areas of the economy. That will particularly be the case in a time such
as this, when the economy is in some difficulty. One only has to pick
up the business section of any national newspaper or look at shares in
the house building industry to know that it is having a difficult time.
I suspect that many in the house building industry will then go off to
the Department for Communities and Local Government, which sponsors the
construction sector, and say, &#147;We should not have to take such a
great hit because of the impact that this will have on us in a
difficult economy.&#148; Therefore, someone within the machinery of
government will have to make some fairly difficult decisions on how the
carbon budget is allocated.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column194" />Column number: 194</div><a name="08070210000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is a
totemic Bill and a totemic clause. If the present Government wish to
remove the clause from the Bill, it is a matter for them, but it will
send out a clear political signal. I just hope that my right hon.
Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron) makes it clear
that when he becomes Prime Minister, he will chair the appropriate
Cabinet Committee. He, as Prime Minister, will chair the Committee and
every other Secretary of State will know that they answer to the Prime
Minister. I have to say that going to a Cabinet Committee chaired by
the Prime Minister concentrates the minds of Secretaries of State and
junior Ministers wondrously. If my right hon. Friend the Member for

them. However, without changing the legislation and without having to
amend an Act of Parliament, an incoming Prime Minister can achieve what
he wishes to achieve by making it very clear that that is how he
intends to conduct business in Whitehall. In so doing, he will make a
very clear statement that by voting blue, a person goes

Member for Banbury has said that it is a matter for the Government and
that the Government should live with the consequences, and I understand
his point. Let me put the arguments specifically and then generally.
Amendments Nos. 33, 76, 77 and 85 relate to later clauses in the Bill
and have been tabled by the hon. Members for Cheltenham and for
Northavon. They relate to subsections (1), (2) and (5) of clause 36,
and they create specific duties in relation to specific
actions&#151;for example, the Prime Minister, rather than the
Secretary of State, may by order extend the period in the Bill and must
consult the other national
authorities.</div><a name="08070210000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me repeat, however, that when one uses the phrase &#147;Secretary of
State&#148;, it means Secretaries of State collectively. Clearly, the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is not the
only Secretary of State to discuss issues with the devolved
Administrations; as we all know, the Transport Secretary, the Defence
Secretary and others also do so. Some of the amendments are therefore
too prescriptive and do not meet the general point that hon. Members
have made, because they do not signal the importance that the
Government give those issues.</div>
<a name="08070210000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">We gave a
great deal of thought to our reasons for not supporting these
amendments and for resisting the amendments in the other place. We want
to create machinery of government that makes the Bill work precisely
because of the point made by the hon. Member for Banbury. We are
talking about important decisions, and there will inevitably be
disagreements and conflicts in government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column195" />Column number: 195</div><a name="08070210000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Vale of York talked about the respective sponsored emissions
by transport and business. Again, I can answer her point technically by
saying that the phrase &#147;Secretary of State&#148; refers to
Secretaries of State collectively. However, let me draw a parallel with
finance, because Opposition Members&#146; arguments on carbon budgets
and reporting duties also apply to finance. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer reports the finance Budget, but one does not hear the
argument that the Prime Minister should do so or, by implication, that
the Budget is not an important document. We decided against naming the
Prime Minister, because we thought that that was tokenistic. We deem
the carbon budget to be important, so we want it to work within the
machinery of government.</div>
<a name="08070210000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">I will not
respond to the teasing of the hon. Member for Cheltenham, who implied
that I was a piddling Minister. I will not tease him in return about
his support for GCHQ, although I thought that he was against
surveillance and things of that nature.</div>
<a name="08070210000238"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000407"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for trying to
assure us that it is less confusing to have the Bill refer to the
Secretary of State than the Prime Minister. Will he explain precisely
how clause 18 would work? If we went over the carbon budget, and
Secretaries of State&#151;plural&#151;had to lay reports before
Parliament, would the Chancellor be the first one to do so because of
the taxation issues, and would he then be followed by the Secretary of
State for Transport, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government and so on? Alternatively, would the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs somehow include their
reports in his? How could that possibly work in
practice?</div><a name="08070210000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000408"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> It is a fair question. It would be the Secretary
of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. What I am trying to
get across, however, is that when the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Secretary makes such a report to Parliament, it will be cleared
across Government, as is the case with all written and oral statements
and with reports that are required by statute. That is how the
Secretary of State represents the Government collectively. The question
of which individual lays the report is not as important as the
machinery of government behind it, which entails a collective decision.
I will follow that line of
argument.</div><a name="08070210000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000409"></a>Martin
Horwood:</b> If the carbon budget was missed overwhelmingly
because of the contribution of transport&#151;let us say that
aviation emissions had got out of control and that that was the key
political issue&#151;would the Secretary of State for DEFRA answer
questions about emissions and defend aviation policy on behalf of the
Department for
Transport?</div><a name="08070210000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000410"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> That is how government works. I have already been
quizzed about Heathrow this morning. Transport Ministers often have to
answer for policies that are not directly within their remit, which is
the point. We believe that including the individual title &#147;Prime
Minister&#148; in the amendments is a token&#151;let me put it that
way&#151;if not tokenism, which is not the best way for the
Government to work. That is why we urge the Committee to resist the
amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cheltenham amendments and
return to this clause what was taken out in the other
place.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000411"></a>Gregory
Barker:</b> The Minister bases his case on procedures and
mechanisms in the machinery of government, but does it not boil down
simply to political clout? He has made a comparison with the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, but the Chancellor lives at No. 11 Downing street,
immediately adjacent to the Prime Minister, and occupies a great and
historic office of state that sits at the very top of Cabinet
precedent. With respect, unless the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Secretary has a unique personal relationship with the Prime Minister,
they will not have that standing in government. We know that, because
that position is usually somewhere in the middle or right at the bottom
of the list of Cabinet appointments. It is simply not living in the
real world to compare the punch and political authority of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary with that of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, let alone the Prime
Minister.</div><a name="08070210000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000412"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> I do not accept that that reflects an
understanding of how government works. First, policies need to be
cleared across government. Secondly, the introduction of carbon budgets
greatly enhances the importance of the policy decisions that flow from
them. If the hon. Gentleman accepts that&#151;I think that he does,
because he has said so&#151;I am grateful to him for his view. The
hon. Member for Banbury has also referred specifically to that point,
and he must also accept that the machinery of government has to be able
to cope. Just as finance decisions are addressed across Departments and
the ring is held by the Treasury, so carbon budgets must be spread
across government and the ring must be held by both the Treasury and
DEFRA. We are not arguing about that. We are arguing whether the Prime
Minister should be mentioned in the Bill, but the very nature of our
system of government is that Ministers are accountable to the Prime
Minister, which is
implicit.</div><a name="08070210000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000413"></a>Steve
Webb:</b> Does not the analogy with the Chancellor break down,
because the Chancellor has one thing that the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs Secretary does not have? The Chancellor raises money and
allocates it to Departments, whereas the Environment Secretary does not
have a pot of carbon to hand out between Departments and simply has to
hit a target. If the Department for Transport or another Department
were to say, &#147;No; we want a bigger share of the carbon
budget,&#148; the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary would
not have the clout to arbitrate and would have to go through the Prime
Minister, which is why the Prime Minister should be
accountable.</div><a name="08070210000245"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="08070210000414"></a>Mr.
Woolas:</b> We are all accountable to the Prime Minister for
everything. We are appointed by the Prime Minister and we are sacked by
the Prime Minister. That is the way in which we run this Government.
The Committee on Climate Change advises the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Secretary, and in that analogy they have a carbon
pot.</div>
