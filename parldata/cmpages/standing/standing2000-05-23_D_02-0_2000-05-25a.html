</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I remind hon. Members that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, my co-Chairman and I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any that may be reached during an afternoon sitting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): On a point of order, Mr. Sayeed. First, I welcome you to the Chair. I wonder whether it would be appropriate for the Minister of State to tell us, before we start the debate, the offences that are covered by the Bill. That relates to every amendment and the Bill as a whole. The latest parliamentary answer on the subject revealed that the Government did not entirely know. Before we debate the Bill, it would be helpful to know which offences are covered by it.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order. The Minister may wish to give that information during the debate on clause 1 stand part.

<H4><center>Clause 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Determination of mode of trial</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 13, leave out ``but not'' and insert ``or''.

<P>
I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Sayeed. We hope that the Committee will not take unduly long, but there are serious points that are bound to take a few sittings to debate.

<P>
I attempted to obtain an answer to the same question as that asked by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). I think that the Home Office cannot work out how many offences the Bill covers. My own research suggests that it covers about 700 offences in 390 different categories, but I have received approximately the same answer as the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
Either-way offences constitute the bulk of offences that come before the criminal courts and include some very serious offences: serious offences against the person, for example, grievous bodily harm, all the major drugs offences and most dishonesty offences. That is one reason why the Bill gives rise to such deep concern.

<P>
This seems to be a tiny amendment, but it is fundamental or at least close to the point that caused the Government to change the Bill between the withdrawal of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill-on which the Lord Chief Justice spoke in Committee in the House of Lords-and the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) No. 2 Bill. As the Committee knows, I am fundamentally and passionately opposed to the Bill on principle, but I hope that that will not affect my ability to argue the case. The amendment goes to the heart of the Bill, which says that the court, when considering whether the offence should be tried summarily or on indictment, shall consider

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the nature of the case;

<P>
(b) any of the circumstances of the offence (but not of the accused) which appears to the court to be relevant; and

<P>
(c) whether, having regard to the matters to be considered under paragraph (b)-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is important and I will return to that-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the punishment which a magistrates' court would have power to impose for the offence would be adequate.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause is deeply unjust and dreadfully confused.

<P>
Let us consider a small hypothetical case that exemplifies the situation that the Government consider to have been abused. Ministers tend to quote the Lord Chief Justice, for whom I have the highest respect, as I have for many people who take a different view on the Bill. He supported his view by describing a multiple offender whom he said was of weak intellect and who had about 60 previous convictions. The person did not plead guilty before the Lord Chief Justice, but he was duly convicted. Would the Minister be kind enough to find out what sentence he was given? That is material to the argument.

<P>
If the Bill becomes law, magistrates will be able to consider the fact that that was a shoplifting offence. We do not know how serious the offence was, but let us suppose that it was similar to that which the Attorney-General described when he opened the debate on the original Bill. I thought that his example was trivial, and I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden, a former Attorney- General, who said that he hoped that the authorities would rarely prosecute for a single banana. However, let us assume that the Attorney-General was merely illustrating his point, and that the item was a sweater from Marks and Spencer or some other frequently stolen item that is valuable, but not immensely so.

<P>
Magistrates could consider the nature of such a straightforward shoplifting case and the circumstances of the offence, such as the fact that the item was stolen from Marks and Spencer and that shoplifting occurs frequently and must be stamped out. However, they would not be able to consider the circumstances of the accused. That is where the injustice leaps to mind. At least in terms of broad justice, the Committee will instantly recognise that there can be huge differences between someone with a string of previous convictions and no character, and a housewife charged for the first time or a man who has a blameless reputation, whose job is on the line and who could lose his position in society because he has been charged for the first time.

<P>
For reasons on which I shall briefly expand, the original Bill's provision that allowed consideration of such circumstances was removed, and now magistrates will not be allowed to take into account the fact that an individual has 60 previous convictions, a fact that was important to the Lord Chief Justice. It is even more absurd that proposed new section 19(2)(c) of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 will not allow the court to have regard to previous convictions when considering the adequacy of the punishment that a magistrates court could impose.

<P>
Let us focus on that provision. It would be astonishing if a first offence of stealing a jersey, a bottle of milk or a tin of beans from Marks and Spencer gave rise to a custodial sentence. However, a multiple or serial offender with a string of previous convictions for dishonesty is likely to receive a substantial sentence, and, as many members of the Committee will agree, deserves and requires a substantial sentence well beyond the six months that magistrates are entitled to give. Under the Bill, the court is expressly forbidden to consider the circumstances of the accused, including their good character and position in society, the nature of their job, and the effect on that job of a conviction, or their bad character and frequent reoffending and the fact that they are a menace to society.

<P>
It has been said that the Government have one influential supporter for the principle of the Bill, and that is my respected right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard). I disagree with him on the fundamentals of the Bill-one can disagree passionately with right hon. and hon. Friends, and it is part of our duty to speak up and say so.

<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend put his finger firmly on that flaw in the Bill when he spoke on Second Reading and eloquently set out exactly what I have put to the Committee. Clause 1 is fundamentally flawed and does deep injustice. That does not require overlong repetition, because the depth of the injustice stands out. One may be trying a difficult case of someone whose whole life and reputation are on the line, or a straightforward case of shoplifting, which is common. My right hon. and learned Friend Lord Mayhew, with her permission, gave the example of his wife, who walked out of a supermarket, pushing a trolley, without paying. She crossed the road towards the car park and, realising what she had done, rushed back. She might well have been acquitted in the magistrates court, but in such a case anyone who has experience of the courts would advise someone to go for trial by jury.

<P>
One difficulty in asking for trial by jury is that it is considered to be a slight upon stipendiary and lay magistrates and suggests that one does not respect them. I hasten to say that that is not the case.

<P>
I come from a legal family: my father is a barrister and High Court judge, my stepmother for 40 years-my mother died young-was a magistrate for 25 years. She was chairman of the Dacorum Bench at Hemel Hempstead. In my early days, as the Parliamentary Secretary will have done, I appeared many times before magistrates. I have a high regard for them and for Crown court judges, but I genuinely believe that it is difficult for anyone who tries cases day in, day out, to consider matters with equal objectivity and not to become case hardened. One has to deal regularly with the police. A jury tries the matter for only a fortnight and tries only a handful of cases. As I said at our previous sitting, a jury is a little parliament. It can stand back from these matters and give a different and higher standard of justice. It is a standard of justice which, whether one regards it as higher or lower in the absolutes, is the justice of the norm of the ordinary people of this country. It is the great strength of trial by jury.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I, too, read Lord Mayhew's speech in the other place and I was genuinely puzzled about why his wife considered that she might not have had a fair hearing in a magistrates court. I was going to ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman whether he had any doubt about the objectivity, impartiality and effectiveness of the magistrates court. I do not and the Government do not. It is important that in this debate we demonstrate our confidence in the magistrates court system. That did not happen on Second Reading in the other place. I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has responded in this way and I look forward to his further comments.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We want to discuss this in a thoughtful way. I have genuinely high regard for the work done by the 29,000 lay magistrates. My experience of magistrates courts was about 25 years ago, during my early years at the Bar and I have been at the Bar for 35 years. Magistrates and Crown court judges do their best. Although my practice developed into employment law, industrial law, commercial law and, more recently, public and administrative law, I did a significant amount of work before magistrates in my first few years and a certain amount of work before juries. This is not to criticise the individuals but simply to state a fact of human nature: those who work as professionals in the system are part of the establishment. That applies from the very highest levels of the judiciary, down to the lay magistrates, who are in a sense the most junior judiciary although the most numerous. I am part of the system. I am part of the establishment. I sit as a recorder and I try cases as a recorder with the jury.

<P>
I shall give one or two examples of the kind of case where I would have done one thing and the jury did another and where, on reflection, I believe that justice was done and that our society is more comfortable with itself as a result. It is unlikely that the magistrates would have sent my first example for trial by jury. It was one of the first cases that I had to try as a junior assistant recorder at Southwark Crown court and it came from east London. It concerned a young man who worked in a hotel and was accused of stealing a telephone call to the value of £1.50. That was 10 years ago and it would be worth about £3 today.

<P>
One might ask why the case was brought. [
Interruption.] I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears) considers it surprising or understandable. It was brought because the making of unauthorised telephone calls, and thereby stealing a value, had become rife in the hotel. The hotel said that it had made it absolutely clear that anyone who was caught doing it would be sacked and prosecuted. The issue was not that the young man had made the telephone call, but that he thought it was permitted. He did not consider that he was stealing and did not intend to steal. That was the proper issue in the case. We heard evidence that the hotel had made the position clear, and were shown written notices. He then gave his evidence. I summed up absolutely fairly, as I thought, and straight down the middle. Although it was a small case and he was likely to be given a conditional discharge or a modest fine, if he was found guilty, I though that the jury would probably convict. I suppose that if I had been sitting as a lay justice, I would probably have convicted, as my colleagues probably would. However, the jury acquitted. Why did the jury acquit? That is something that we do not know. I believe, as did the late Lord Taylor of Gosport, that we are wise not to allow research into juries. I could expand on that but there are one or two other aspects to be dealt with. We will have to deal with Hedderman and Moxon and the research from Professor Lee Bridge. I have very real worries about research. I shall deal with that and in doing so be strictly within the rules of order.

<P>
<B>Miss Hazel Blears </B>(Salford): This is a fundamental part of the Bill's principles. Perhaps the right hon. and learned Gentleman will comment. Is it not the case that, advising defendants to choose a Crown court trial is more about their chances of acquittal than about guilt or innocence? The right hon. and learned Gentleman's example was one where he thought the defendant was guilty, yet he was necessarily acquitted in the Crown court. Is not this about the chances of getting off with the conviction rather than about guilt or innocence?

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Lady is on a slippery slope. The hon. Lady has said that she believes that that young man was wrongly acquitted by a jury. [
Interruption.] That is the implication of what she said although I have not thought it through completely yet. I have thought a lot about that. I suspect that the jury acquitted for several reasons. I suspect that they were less convinced than those who ran the hotel that the position had been made crystal clear as it had. It is possible that the jury felt-we shall never know-that this young man had been sacked anyway, and that enough was enough. This is a fundamental strength of the jury system. It is why a jury is a little parliament. A jury sets the standards for our society, and is why we are a freer society that is more comfortable with the standards of justice that are meted out than we would be if cases were always decided by people who are part of the Establishment.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor </B>(North-West Leicestershire): I must declare an interest as life member of the Magistrates Association. It appears that what my hon. Friend the Member for Salford is saying is that in the great majority of cases, those who opt for trial in a Crown court do so in expectation that their chances of getting off are improved-which is likely-and because it delays the evil day. In many instances, such people then continue to operate in a criminal and antisocial manner for that much longer. That is the thrust of the Bill and we should not be misled by the right hon. and learned Gentleman's example.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman continues, I should point out that the amendment is narrowly drawn. We do not want a continuation of the Second Reading debate.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I take careful note of what you said, Mr. Sayeed, but I beg to differ, insofar as one can do so courteously with the Chair. This is not a narrow amendment; it is probably the most important, and fundamental amendment to the Bill. To develop my argument, not to do battle with the Chair, I shall take for my text the words of the then Lord Chief Justice of England, Lord Bingham of Cornhill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Leigh </B>(Gainsborough): This is strictly relevant to the amendment and to my right hon. and learned Friend's example. We do not know the circumstances of the accused in the case; it may not have been a matter of whether he would get off. The young man may have been on an hotel management course; it may have been the start of his career. If he had been found guilty of the offence he would never have been able to work in the hotel business again, so the outcome of the case was vital to him. That is perhaps why we went to the Crown court; the fact that he had a fair trial and was acquitted was important to him.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</b> My hon. Friend is right. He made two points that are relevant to the amendment. The great importance to the man's personal circumstances is something that the clause as drafted utterly forbids the magistrates to consider.<P>

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman consider that juries should abide by their oath to try cases according to the evidence? Is he advocating a form of palm-tree justice, in which juries try cases and give verdicts not according to the evidence but to their own interpretation of what should happen?

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Of course juries should abide by their oath. I have no doubt that in the case in question the jury were abiding by their oath and I commend the hon. Gentleman to read Lord Devlin's Hamlyn lectures.

<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I have read them.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> In that case the hon. Gentleman will have had a full, careful and persuasive response to his argument.

<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice </B>(Lewisham, East): I listened carefully to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I was reluctant to intervene, as some of his arguments about what happens in a jury room and in magistrates courts seemed to be coming from a parallel universe. Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman leaves his interesting example, I ask him why he thought that a jury and magistrates were likely to find the young man guilty. The jury acquitted, against expectations, but no one knows why. Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman explain his logic in assuming that the magistrates were not also capable of doing something unexpected?

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I do not know whether it is a matter of logic, but it is certainly a matter of experience that the prospect of being acquitted in percentage terms is higher in the Crown court than it is before a magistrate. People are more comfortable with the decisions of their peers; that is one reason why trial by jury is so important.

<P>
I was about to quote the wise words of the former Lord Chief Justice, now the senior Law Lord, Lord Bingham, in the other place. Talking in general about the Bill, he said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The present procedure, which allows a defendant to elect trial by judge and jury on an either-way offence does not lead to unfairness; it does not lead to miscarriages of justice; and it does not undermine public confidence. There is therefore no imperative need to change the existing procedures on the ground that it fails those important tests. If it did, no doubt the rule would have been changed long ago.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 20 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1252.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Lord Chief Justice said that there was no imperative need for a mode of trial Bill. That is important; he specifically refers to confidence in the system of justice. It is my personal view-I do not want to overstate it-that if the Bill is enacted it will gradually sap confidence in our system of justice and begin to undermine the 29,000 lay magistrates, whom I applaud and respect, and I do not want that to happen.

<P>
<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
I return to what the former Lord Chief Justice said about the clause to which the amendment refers when the original Bill was debated in the House of Lords; the proposal is, of course, significantly different now. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am not greatly enamoured of the criteria set out in new Section 19(3)(d) and (e). I respectfully think that it is better to give magistrates and circuit judges a wide and almost undirected discretion.-[Official Report, House of Lords, 20 January 2000; Vol. 608, c. 1254.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Government use Lord Bingham's support at every opportunity in debates on the Bill, but far from following what he advises, they have gone flatly and completely against it. They have not given magistrates and circuit judges an almost undirected discretion, but a discretion that is so tightly fettered that it amounts to a grave injustice and makes nonsense of the question whether they have sufficient powers of sentence and whether, under substituted section 19(2)(c) in clause 1,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>having regard to the matters to be considered under paragraph (b), the punishment which a magistrates' court would have power to impose for the offence would be adequate.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The clause as drafted is fundamentally flawed, and will attract direct and devastating criticism from the Lord Chief Justice if he has to speak about it in another place. The amendment would remove the defects, although not my fundamental objection to the Bill. I suggest that under new section 19(2)(b) the court should consider any of the circumstances of the offence and of the accused-that is, all the circumstances of the case and, as Lord Bingham said, that the magistrates and circuit judges should be given a wide and almost undirected discretion.

<P>
I want the Minister again to focus his mind on new section 19(2)(c). How can the magistrates consider whether they have adequate powers? I look to the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Taylor), who is a magistrate. I heard him speak on Second Reading; he and I were present throughout the debate, and I respect the sincerity of his views. Magistrates should not regard the amendment as an attack on them; it is certainly not an attack on the hon. Gentleman.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner </B>(North-West Norfolk): I am not a magistrate, although I know many. The right hon. and learned Gentleman should make it clear why these case-hardened magistrates who are liable to make mistakes about the families and friends of Members of Parliament are still fit to take decisions on the vast majority of the cases that go to trial.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell </B>(North-East Bedfordshire): The hon. Gentleman makes a valid argument-well, it is mistaken, really, but it is raised by many people. It is said that the magistrates decide 95 per cent. of cases, so why cannot they be trusted to decide 100 per cent. of cases.-[
Interruption.] If the hon. Gentleman thinks that I have overstated the point, let me put it more precisely in his own terms. I am not saying that all magistrates are case hardened. I am not saying that the magistrates would not have acquitted the young man in the telephone call example. It is possible, though unlikely, that they would have acquitted him.

<P>
Let me provide another example-an early case that I defended on the old drunken driving law, before we had the breathalyser. The Crown court judge, a highly respected, liberal and seemingly fair-minded man, summed up strongly for a conviction, but the jury acquitted. The case against the accused was that there had been a crash; he had smashed into a car; when he got out he was shaking and appeared confused; his speech was slurred; and he refused to give a urine sample.

<P>
The defence was that he had had a crash, but it became clear-at least to the jury and me-that it was the fault of an idiot who had pulled out of a side turning bang in front of him. It was a late winter night and he had popped out to buy a packet of cigarettes from the local shop. He was wearing only a light suit; it was extremely cold, and he was shaken by the accident. His speech seemed slurred because the accident was in Hampshire and he came from the Orkney islands. He refused to give a urine sample because he had a kidney complaint. He did not flatly refuse, but said that he wanted medical advice. The jury rightly acquitted him, yet the judge summed up for a conviction. I can understand why the country is more comfortable with a jury.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Can the right hon. and learned Gentleman clarify his point? Is he saying that a jury is more likely to be aware of the social and geographical circumstances surrounding a case than are local magistrates on the Bench of a local town working and living in the area relevant to a particular offence? Are not the magistrates more likely than a judge to be socially and geographically aware of the circumstances of an offence? Justice is more likely-I put in no stronger than that-in the local magistrates court of a local market town than it is in a remote city in a Crown court presided over by a judge who knows little or nothing about the local circumstances of a case.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I agree with 85 per cent. of that. One of the great strengths of our 29,000 magistrates is that they are widely drawn from across the community. Magistrates have huge strengths, which I applaud. However, for hundreds of years, we have had a system that has been either the only solution or an express right in the 700 or so either-way cases of principal significance to criminal justice-excluding only serious offences such as murder and rape, which are indictable only. In a whole swathe of cases, the population could be tried under that system by a jury.

<P>
I emphasise that I have no reservations about the magistrates system. I have high regard for it. However, I and the whole country are much more comfortable with it in the knowledge that on crucial questions of dishonesty, possession of drugs, intention to commit violence and so forth, defendants can opt for trial by jury.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Under the provisions, appeals to the Crown court against the mode of trial decision of the magistrates are allowed.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right. The opportunity to appeal to the Crown court judge is provided for, which makes the Bill less bad than it would otherwise be. The Lord Chief Justice made it clear that that was an absolute requirement if he and other judges were to support the Bill. That mitigates, but only mitigates, gravely mistaken legislation.

<P>
I was focusing on the illogicality of proposed new section 19(2)(c). How could the chairman of the magistrates-say, the hon. Gentleman-affirm that he had adequate sentencing powers if he could not take previous convictions into account? The Minister may say that the Government intend to change that aspect of the provisions. We shall wait and see, but he has not tabled any relevant amendments. The amendment that I am proposing is central to the Bill.

<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice:</B> I apologise because I, too, should have declared an interest as a lifelong member of the Magistrates Association. Before the right hon. and learned Gentleman concludes, will he explain why his amendment uses the word ``or'' in line 13-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any of the circumstances of the offence (or of the accused)-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
as if to indicate an alternative? He has argued as though it should have been the circumstances of both.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> The hon. Lady makes a good point. I should perhaps have said ``and'' of the accused. The drafting of the amendment is not perfect. I wrote it in the middle of a busy Friday, sitting in a car park before visiting the chairman of our health authority. I telephoned it through to my secretary by mobile phone and it was then faxed to the Whips. Otherwise it would not have appeared on the amendment paper in time. Though it is not perfect, it makes the fundamental point that we are debating. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Luff </B>(Mid-Worcestershire): I am mindful, Mr. Sayeed, of your colleague Mr. Maxton's injunction for silent Whips. However, I was once at the centre of a case in which reputation lay at the heart of the considerations. I have been sorely provoked to speak to the amendment by several of the Minister's comments last night at the Dispatch Box. He accused my right hon. and learned Friend of listening only to lawyers on this subject. I was also provoked by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Ms Prentice) on Tuesday, when she said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are more lawyers on the Opposition Benches than on the Government Benches. This makes me wonder, cynic that I am, whether it is another case of their looking after their own interests rather than having a wider perspective.-[Official Report, Standing Committee D, 23 May 2000; c. 11.]<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Ms Bridget Prentice:</B> Was I that fluent?

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am sure that Hansard did the hon. Lady great credit. I have also been provoked sorely this morning by the comments of the hon. Member for Salford, again by the hon. Member for Lewisham, East and by the Parliamentary Secretary. The issue of reputation is fundamental. I am amazed that Government Back Benchers can be so cavalier in their consideration of such an important issue. I urge them not to put on their new Labour pager blinkers, but to listen to the arguments on this tremendously important matter.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N. Lyell) has said that it appears that the amendment may be technically a little wanting, which is sad, but the spirit that underlies it is crucial. Again, I urge the Minister when he responds not simply to rely on what he agreed with his officials in his early morning briefing, but to listen carefully to the arguments. There are many in the House of Commons-indeed I can think of a possible candidate on the Opposition Benches-who might change their mind about the Bill as a whole, were we to accept the amendment or the spirit of it today. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe, the former Home Secretary, might be one of those who could be so persuaded. The amendment is as important as that to someone who has considered these matters and takes a different view of the Bill.

<P>
I freely confess that I would not be persuaded. I shall still vote against the Bill, because it is wrong, but the amendment would at least make it less wrong. Reducing the right to trial of individuals is a serious decision for Parliament to take.

<P>
<B>Shona McIsaac </B>(Cleethorpes): I understand people expressing concern about the Bill, but is it not the case that in part of the United Kingdom-namely, Scotland-people do not have the right to jury trial? Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the entire Scottish legal system is deficient? Going back to what the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire said about the person from Orkney, he would not have had the right to jury trial if the incident had happened in Scotland. His other point about accent suggested to me that he thought that all Scottish people sounded drunk.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> If that was what the hon. Lady thought was meant by my right hon. and learned Friend, I am sure that he would immediately wish to disavow the notion. I have always found the Scottish accent-and especially hers-extremely attractive.

<P>
I am aware that there was a debate on Second Reading about exactly what the provisions of Scottish law mean. However, we are now, rightly or wrongly, dealing with a devolved United Kingdom, and I am concerned about the effects on my English constituents and arguing in their best interests.

<P>
The Minister suggested that all Opposition members of the Committee are lawyers. I must confess, as the Whip, that I thought that it might be helpful to have lawyers to consider these technical legal issues.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> That comes to the heart of the point. As they say, some of my best friends are lawyers, but one of the biggest problems about the debating of the Bill , which was reflected classically in the Second Reading debate in another place, is that almost all the participants were lawyers. They were very distinguished lawyers, and I make no complaint about that, but my point is that everybody, including magistrates, police, the community and victims should have a purchase on the debate. It is right for lawyers to take part, but only a part and they should not be as dominant as they have been heretofore.

<P>

<B>Mr. Luff:</B> Last night, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill, they listened to lawyers rather than the police or anybody else.-[Official Report, 24 May 2000; vol. 350, c. 1024.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Now I give the Minister and my colleagues the chance to listen to somebody else, who is not a lawyer, but who, it is true, was once briefly attracted to the prospect and decided against it-rather to his regret now, but that is another matter. Who are the experts in these matters? It is important that they are heard. They are judges and a number of them, of one level or another, are in the Room today.

<P>
There are lawyers, and we have rather more of them here. There are criminals, but we have none of them-although I did once defend myself in a magistrates court on a case of jumping a red traffic light. I defended myself successfully; the case was dismissed. There are witnesses, who give evidence in court proceedings. Some of us here may have done that. There are victims. I suspect that all of us in the Room have been victims of crime. I have, although I have never been required to give evidence.

<P>
There are also jurors. I once served as a juror. I wish-without breaching the confidence of the jury room-to draw on my experience as a juror strongly to urge the Minister to consider most carefully the question of reputation and to accept at least the spirit of the amendment.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> On the question of technicality, my amendment would be improved by the addition of the word ``and'', but ``or'' can be read conjunctively. I do not think that there is a technical error in my amendment; it is just that it could be improved.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> I am all in favour of improvement. I am grateful for my right hon. and learned Friend's clarification.

<P>
I have done jury service twice at a Crown court. One case-I was the foreman on this occasion-was of a young man, a foreigner to these shores, who was reading for the Bar in his native country. A telephone had been stolen-telephones seem to feature prominently today. This was in the days when British Telecom was still a nationalised industry and it was illegal to own a telephone: they were all rented from BT. This gentleman had bought one from somebody and claimed possession of it. There was no doubt whatever that he had committed an offence by owning the telephone, or believing that he owned it. It was stolen property, owned by BT. There was no doubt whatever that had his case been heard by magistrates they would have been obliged to find him guilty.

<P>
That, at least, was what the prosecutors told us. The consequence of a guilty verdict for that young man would have been the end of his legal career. There would have been no question but that it was finished. He elected for jury trial, to be heard by a group of men and women to whom the phrase ``case hardened'', which my right hon. and learned Friend used, could not be applied, and who had some discretion. This is where, I believe, the Parliamentary Secretary was wrong. In the jury room people are invited to use their common sense-a phrase often used by judges when summing up-and to bring to bear on a case their understanding of the real world. Without breaching too much confidence, I can tell the Committee that it was not difficult for that jury to decide to find the young man not guilty. It was clear that he had made a serious mistake, but it was an honest one, and condemning him would have meant the end of his career.

<P>
<B>Helen Jones </B>(Warrington, North): I am reluctant to intervene in view of the comments that have been made about lawyers, even by my hon. Friends. However, the essence of what the hon. Gentleman seems to be saying is that lay magistrates are less capable than lay jurors of judging such a case, but would not magistrates also have had to be satisfied that all the circumstances pertaining to theft, including intention permanently to deprive, had been proven, and would not they be equally able to return a not guilty verdict? That surely goes to the heart of the case. If it is so important to have the right to opt for jury trial in either-way cases, to protect reputation, it is incumbent on those who insist on that to prove that the standard of justice in a magistrates court is lower than that in a Crown court. What is the evidence for that?

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> It is not a question of the standard of justice. I urge the hon. Lady to listen carefully. We were advised by the judge in his summing up that the evidence pointed strongly to a guilty verdict. He was clear that the conditions were satisfied. The case was heard 20 years ago, so it is difficult to recall exactly, but my understanding is that the magistrates would have had no choice but to convict the man: their clerk would have told them that he must be sent down. That was the basis on which the matter came for trial. I recall that the case was accepted by the defence solely on the basis of the young man's reputation. I was a young man, serving on a jury for the first or second time, and my deep impression of the case was that the jury had done something fine in saving the young man from the consequences of one foolish act.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> As my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) said, the hon. Gentleman should cite to the Committee any evidence that the powers of magistrates in relation to findings of guilt or innocence are more constrained or restricted than those of juries. I am not aware that they are. He should also be aware that in the retiring room magistrates are often given strong advice by their clerks to do A rather than B. That is the quality of the magistrates court environment; they often set matters aside on a common-sense rather than a legal basis. In the case that I cited, the powers that were available in the jury room all those years ago are equally available to magistrates in the retiring room. If that is not so, the hon. Gentleman should tell the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff. The hon. Gentleman may be right, but he invites the Committee to take a great deal on trust. It must be clear that in such matters the adverse consequences that I genuinely believe may occur will not follow. In view of the small sums and the small number of cases involved, the amendment should be agreed to, allowing magistrates to take into account the character of the accused when deciding whether to put them up for jury trial.</B><P>

<P>
I have rested my argument so far on a specific case, but I recognise that hard cases make bad law and it is difficult to generalise from the specific. I remember my reaction to that case; that is why I feel so passionately, genuinely and sincerely about the amendment and want the Minister to respond sympathetically.

<P>
To turn from the specific to the general, I was intrigued to read what Justice said in its briefing on the Bill. The Minister will need to respond to the point when he winds up. It builds on what I have already said. Justice said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The controversial provision for the court to consider reputation and livelihood, which discriminated in favour of those with apparently good character, has been removed; but this is likely to lead to more cases being retained by magistrates. It should also be noted that the new criteria are likely to lead to a new, and diametrically opposite discrimination. Sentences are likely to be higher in respect of people with previous criminal convictions, who may therefore be outside the court's sentencing powers and fail the third of the three relevant criteria. As a consequence, those with a previous history of criminal activity may be more likely to be granted trial by jury, while those of previous good charater may be more likely to be tried summarily.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That seems a perverse consequence to the Government's insistence on pressing ahead with clause 1.

<P>
I feel passionately and sincerely that the Government are making an enormous error. The Bill would be more acceptable if we amended the clause. I urge hon. Gentlemen to consider seriously whether they are content to vote against the amendment in Committee or against a similar one on Report and on Third Reading and to vote for a Bill that allows no consideration of reputation when magistrates reach their decision. It is a very serious matter, and I urge Government Members to examine their consciences carefully.

<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We should be grateful to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire for the opportunity to debate the reputation issue, which is what the amendment is fundamentally about, given that it was a major change between the first and the second Bill. I was reflecting with my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard) on whether this should be a discussion among lawyers or non-lawyers and we decided that we are the dream team. We comprise one non-lawyer, one lawyer; one rural Member, one urban Member; one woman, one man; one younger, one older; and one with a criminal record and one without-although we will not tell the Committee which. We are sworn to silence on that.

<P>
My hon. Friend and I have both given evidence in court but not served on juries, although on the first day of our party leadership election last year, I was troubled to see in my post an envelope with ``Summons'' in large letters on it. It struck me as a threat to my chances of winning the leadership, even before my campaign had begun. I was relieved to discover that it was only a summons for jury service at Southwark Crown court. As the Prime Minister did when he received a similar summons recently, I wrote back to say that I was ineligible. Like many others here, I am ineligible on two counts: as a Member of Parliament and as a lawyer.

<P>
<B>Shona McIsaac:</B> And because you are insane?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a judgment for others to make.

<P>
The debate about reputation reveals that we should not be overly respectful about the Bills that draftsmen produce for Ministers. The drafting of clause 1 has changed considerably between the first and the second Bill. Even the bits that make the same point have been changed. We should not presume that the Bill before us is gospel. It is the second bash at a request that the Government made to civil servants but it is no more likely to have the right wording than the first. That is why the amendment is right. We must ensure that, whatever else we do, we get the drafting to say what we mean it to say so that least we debate the right issues.

<P>
In the first Bill, the clause stated that the courts should consider certain matters when deciding whether a case should be tried summarily or on indictment and then listed those matters. They included whether the circumstances made the offence one of a serious character, whether the magistrates would have adequate power to deal with the offence, whether livelihood would be diminished, whether reputation would be damaged, and any other circumstances. We have now whittled that down to three considerations. The nature of the case remains identical. It is the only consideration that does. The next consideration is the circumstances of the accused; considerations (b) and (f) under the old proposals are rolled together here. The power of the magistrates court follows. We need to stand back and reflect on whether the criteria for consideration generally arise as well as focusing on whether the accused's reputation is affected.

<P>
It is bizarre, to put it mildly, that when the Government were suddenly afflicted by the view that they needed to change from people having the right to choose jury trial in a number of offences to having no right to choose, with the decision being left entirely to the court, though with appeal, they did not even address the question whether there would be particular offences for which it would be appropriate to take away the election right. What the Government have done, at a stroke, is to choose a number of offences, the list of which is not finalised, or in their mind, and decide that all of them-from what the public might consider to be the least serious upwards-make up an appropriate group. I think that that is foolish.

<P>
It would have been better and more convincing if the Government had said, in response to the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire and to me, that they had attempted to reach a view about which offences the Bill covered. It is thought that approximately 700-plus offences may be covered. It would have been helpful if someone had decided exactly how many are covered. It would have been better if at the same time Ministers had assessed whether all offences in that category should go into one basket-to lose the right to elect-or said that some offences may be more serious than others and that the time has come to reconsider the category between indictable-only, summary-only or either-way offences, because views about the seriousness and frequency of offences, and about what charge to bring may change. There is no justification for the Government saying, ``Here you are, it's take it or leave it, and you've got to take the lot.''

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I intended to respond to that point and to the hon. Gentleman's point of information at the beginning of my summation but perhaps it will be convenient to do so now. The list of offences set out clearly in appendix 4C of the 1998 document containing the criminal statistics for England and Wales. There is no ambiguity whatever. Throughout the debate no one has been in doubt about which offences this reform would affect. I do not think that there is any lack of clarity.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In a written answer to me, the Minister said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no readily available list of triable either-way offences. Appendix 4 of the annual Command Paper ``Criminal Statistics England and Wales'' lists just over 370 triable either-way offence codes  Each code may cover more than one offence and these codes cover approximately 700 offences.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Those are the Minister's words, not mine. He continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Other triable either-way offences are grouped together under one `ad hoc' code.-[Official Report, 11 February, 2000; Vol. 344, c. 318W.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That answer was given three months ago. It would be fair to conclude that the advice given to Ministers and relayed by them to Parliament was that we could be approximate, but not accurate, about how many offences are covered.

<P>
I will be grateful if the Minister can say, now or later, that further work has been done and that he can now be categorical. To be honest, I would far rather we had a categorical list so that we know what we are talking about, but that still would not obviate my second point that it is difficult to justify the fact that the Government are saying at a stroke, in one Bill, that it is appropriate that all those offences will be ones for which the accused or defendant loses his right to elect for trial by jury. I would be grateful to hear the Government's justification for not having considered the offences individually when coming to that conclusion.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for drawing attention to appendix 4C. It makes the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) and I are concerned with, which is that a huge number of the offences cover a great swathe of very serious matters, and cover 10 tightly-typed pages.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is so, but what troubled me a bit more, was when, on the ``Today'' programme, I gave an example of an offence for which people will lose the right to have a jury trial, and the Home Secretary, who was interviewed separately later, said, ``No, the woolly Liberal is not right.'' I cannot remember exactly which polite phrase he used, but it was something like that. It was frustrating for me, because he was wrong: the offence to which I had referred was clearly an either-way offence. If, on advice, he speaks to the nation and cannot get right what is covered in the Bill, we all need to worry. The example that I gave was in relation to arson, certain types of which are either-way offences, where the defendant will lose the right to choose a jury trial.

<P>
The Government have made the mistake of going from the proposition that they were persuaded was right beforehand-namely, that reputation should be included-to eliminating any reference to the offender altogether. I want to put it on the record, for avoidance of later doubt, that my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton and I, along with our hon. Friends, take the view that the Bill should be rejected, not amended. Although we, like Conservative spokesmen, want to debate the specific proposal, we do not seek to make small amendments to individual bits of drafting, which might suggest that we were content that the Bill should go through in an amended form. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire implied, without expressly saying so, that this was a probing amendment. There are proper issues to discuss and where this is the case we will make comments but it does not change our view about the Bill.

<P>
The Government have gone from including the reputation proposals to excluding reference to the defendant altogether. That seems wrong. We were clear that it was wrong to include considerations about livelihood and reputation, particularly the latter, because increasingly it was agreed that that would be divisive. People with a higher income level or ``social status'' would be more likely to benefit than the young or those who are less established, less well off and less influential. I do not think that there is any argument that it is appropriate to have removed those sections.

<P>
However, consideration about the effect on livelihood is important. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) gave the example of someone working in an hotel. A first conviction can be fundamentally damaging to a person's career. I have a constituent who had been convicted of an offence; he pleaded guilty and was given a short prison sentence. Following conviction, he was suspended from his job, but as a result of disciplinary procedure he has lost it, leaving his two small children without an income earner. There is a disciplinary appeal pending and we are hoping that we can persuade the employers to allow him back as soon as he is out of prison. It is odd that the Bill as drafted does not consider the circumstances of the accused at all. In trying to avoid the reputation mistake, the Government have thrown the baby out with the bath water, and I ask them to reconsider.

<P>
The circumstances of the accused, and the way in which he or she reacts to the choice are fundamentally important. Like the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire, I was troubled by how the hon. Member for Salford perceived the process between defendants or accused people and their representatives, if they have any. I declare my interest: I remain a member of the Bar and of my chambers, but I have not practised for more than 10 years. I was in regular practice until I entered the House, and I did some criminal work, both in prosecution and defence.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
When I acted for defendants, my practice was invariably to advise them on the basis of their intentions. If a defendant wanted to plead guilty, I accepted that and simply checked that the plea was correct and in line with the law. If someone wanted to plead not guilty, I would say, ``Only you know whether you are guilty. I can advise you whether what you did was a crime in law.'' However, once the law had been explained to the accused, I never once had to discuss whether a guilty person should plead not guilty. I often told defendants, ``I don't think that a jury or a magistrate will believe you, because what you say sounds incredible, but you must make the decision.'' I was never given information that led me to the view that someone was guilty whom I then advised to plead not guilty. I am not saying that no lawyers give such advice, but it would be improper.

<P>
<B>Ms Blears:</B> I did not mean to suggest that respected and honourable members of the legal profession had those intentions. I declare an interest too: I am a solicitor, although I do not currently practise. I have experience in the criminal courts. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that experienced criminals with many previous convictions do not take into account the fact that they are more likely to be acquitted in a Crown court trial? They will spin out the system, engage the time of witnesses and police and cause victims great concern. They will also create months of delay during which they may remain at large, committing offences and bringing our justice system into disrepute.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I do not deny their existence, but I will deal with that point. The hon. Lady wraps up an anti-defendant view in her allegations. In consultation with their representatives, family or friends, defendants will weigh up all the implications of their choices. As Home Office research shows, defendants will consider their chances of acquittal, whether they are innocent or guilty. It is just as important for innocent people to assess their chances of acquittal as it is for people who may be guilty or who may have a track record.

<P>
If I were accused of an offence, I would take advice and assess which choice offered the best chance of being acquitted, even if I were innocent. Such a consideration is not improper. That goes to the fundamental point about the Bill. It is less serious if a criminal justice system does not catch all the guilty than if it catches some of the innocent. [
Interruption.] The criminal justice system often grapples with that dilemma. I would rather that guilty people were acquitted sometimes than that innocent people were convicted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Luff:</B> There seemed to be some dissent from Labour Members on that proposition, which lies at the heart of the criminal justice system.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> To be fair, I heard assent, which encourages me. I hope that that is their position. If it is not, I am troubled.

<P>
When I was in practice, no one who elected trial by jury, either unadvised by me or on my advice, ever did so in order to continue criminal activity between that time and the trial. I never once encountered that. Some may have done so in order to gain a better job record or to acquire a job when they did not have one. Some may have chosen a trial because they were worried about sentences and a baby had been born in the previous week. There were all sorts of considerations, but never once did I encounter a motive to commit further offences.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> There are some resourceful characters out there.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> After the experience of half a lifetime living on the Old Kent Road I have encountered many such characters. I was a youth leader there and I have practised as a lawyer in London as well as in an Oxford circuit. I am not naïve about these matters. However big the rogues-Charlie Richardson was one of my constituents and the Krays used to meet just down the road, so I have dealt with some sharp operators-I never encountered a case in which a jury trial was chosen in order to commit further crimes. I am not saying that it is never a consideration, but that in my experience it never was. If I went back over all the records, I am not aware that I would find a case in which further offences were committed between the decision and the trial. There may be some cases, but it is very rare.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Many.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Not as many as the hon. Gentleman thinks. He should look at the facts.

<P>
<B>Ms Blears:</B> Representing an inner city in which there are serious criminal problems, I may come to the subject with a particular view. My argument was that some people remain at large and continue their criminal lifestyle. They have adopted that lifestyle and if they have an extra six months to carry on with their lives as they have for the previous few years, further criminal activity is likely. They are not electing trial by jury in order to go out and commit more crime; but their lifestyle is such that that may well happen. Months of delay are potentially months in which criminals can carry on with their criminal lifestyle-with consequent effect on the victims.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I understand the hon. Lady's point. It is valid, but the answer is to deal with the speed of the criminal justice system. The previous Government, to their credit, addressed some of the problems after a review of effectiveness and the beneficial results can be seen in the system. The answer is not necessarily to change the choice of method of trial. There may, but need not be, a difference in the speed of a trial. I recognise the hon. Lady's point, but it need not follow that there is much more time to carry on being a villain on one option and no time at all on the other.

<P>
The hon. Lady will know that if someone elects for trial in a magistrates' court and pleads not guilty, the reality often is that it will not take place on the day that the plea is made. It will be put back to another date, sometimes several times because the police or the Crown Prosecution Service may not be ready. Even in magistrates courts, there can be a considerable time between plea and trial.

<P>
<B>Sir Nicholas Lyell:</B> There is another answer to the hon. Lady's point. What she says is true; it happens as a matter of fact. One would expect the magistrates to remand in custody people with a criminal lifestyle and previous convictions, so they could not continue their criminal activities pro tem. One would also expect a Crown Court judge to uphold that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is certainly true, and it leads me to my next point. Home Office research and research papers in the Library show what sentence a person would get if he or she were convicted. There is no doubt about the evidence; it is a fact that people who are sentenced in the Crown courts receive heavier sentences, not just because Crown courts have the power to impose longer sentences than may be given in the magistrates courts, but because that is what happens in practice. Defendants are aware of that fact and it mitigates in favour of their choosing trial at a magistrates court.

<P>
Defendants often ask me what sentence they will get if they are convicted and I tell them the magistrates' maximum powers. Of course, if a defendant who has previous convictions is found guilty in a magistrates court, he may be sent up to a Crown court, which has the power to impose a prison sentence of 10 years or more. Evidence shows that if a defendant pleads not guilty before a jury and is convicted, he is likely to get a longer sentence. That mitigates against his stringing out the case by opting for the Crown court. There are many considerations to be made, not only the chance of acquittal, but the mode of trial should be at the instigation of the individual, who must take a subjective decision.

<P>
That leads to the question whether we trust magistrates more than judges. I shall not beat around the bush: I trust a judge and jury more than I trust the Bench. That is my view, which is based on experience; I know that people get a better trial from a jury of 12 people who consider the facts and a judge who must direct them who knows that the case will be open to review if he gets it wrong.

<P>
Magistrates deal, first, with the pre-trial and non-trial issues; they consider one set of issues and then put it out of their minds. Secondly, they are often advised by clerks confidentially and we do not know what the clerks say. Many magistrates are absolutely dependent on the clerk's advice. Thirdly, some cases are heard by a stipe, a court of one, who can be extremely dismissive and offhand and ignore the case presented by a defendant or his representative.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> So can a Crown court judge.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> But in a Crown court the judge is not alone. That is my point. In the Crown court, there are also 12 people who do not sit in court every day. In almost any case, I would, if I had the choice, elect jury trial and I am clear that it should be my choice. If that choice is removed, it is given to the professionals, the regulars, the people in the courts. It is a transfer of power from the citizen, who is not in court every day, to the system-to the lawyers, the professionals, the stipes, the lay Benches, the new magistrates who have just been appointed and those who are more experienced. That system is more public and more open to scrutiny and checking in the Crown court than in the magistrates court.

<P>
We have a magistrates court system because many of the cases are routine; many people plead guilty and many cases do not raise difficult issues. The magistrates can deal with uncomplicated issues and dispatch them, as they clearly do, because many of their decisions are not subject to appeal. However, when complicated issues are involved and especially when the defendant wants to make a defence, we should take away the right of the defendant to put a case to a representative forum of people who are not case hardened only when we are absolutely certain that it will not prejudice the individual's rights. That does not mean that the 29,000 magistrates do not, by and large, seek to do their jobs properly and competently, or that we should not have magistrates-of course we should. It does not mean that I do not believe that magistrates are intended largely to represent the community. I nominate people to the Bench fairly regularly to try to ensure that it is representative. However, there is a move in the magistracy towards single full-time magistrates or stipes, and to what is effectively a one-person tribunal.

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
That is an unwelcome and unhelpful move. I understand why it is happening, but it gives much more power to one person. That is also a mistake in the criminal justice system. Tribunals in which one person is the judge and the jury-as is the case in a magistrates court-represent a move in the wrong direction.

<P>
<B>Mrs Joan Humble </B>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood): Like many of my colleagues, I declare an interest as a member of the Magistrates Association. I ask the hon. Gentleman to reconsider his description of magistrates as case hardened. First, as a magistrate, I did not sit daily. I did not have the time to do so, let alone be asked. Secondly, he said himself that much of magistrates' work consists of sentencing and dealing with people who have pleaded guilty, often to motoring offences, and that magistrates courts deal with trials on a much more limited number of occasions.

<P>
As a magistrate, I welcomed trials. I was not case hardened. I listened carefully to all the evidence presented and especially carefully to defence witnesses. I had no preconceptions about the weight that I should accord to defence or prosecution and gave the defendants a fair hearing. The hon. Gentleman's description is unjust to many magistrates.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The debate is going rather wide of the mark. I remind the Committee that the debate is on the circumstances of the accused. Many of the arguments seem to take us closer to a stand part debate, which will take place later.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Thank you, Mr. Sayeed. I certainly did not want to be dragged into a clause stand part debate. I was dealing with a view of reputation, so I hope that the debate was relevant. I was not generalising and I understand the hon. Lady's position. Clearly, many magistrates sit part-time. That is the basis of what they do. They have other lives, jobs and roles in the community.

<P>
Stipendiary magistrates are not in that position, and we are moving towards more of those. If the hon. Lady had accompanied me over the years to Tower Bridge magistrates court and the court dealing with prostitutes soliciting at King's Cross, she would have had to conclude that magistrates were case hardened. The cases were weighed off every morning at two minutes, one after another, because the magistrates had seen the people before. That was not the case with a new magistrate or a magistrate who did other things. I am not generalising, but I can say categorically that in my experience there were many more dismissive Benches and dismissive judicial actions in the magistrates court than in the Crown court.

<P>
Let me explain why the interests of the defendant are so much better represented in the Crown court. I remember a lad in our youth club who was taken to court for an offence and dealt with by magistrates. The truth is that he did not create a favourable impression, because of his attitude, background and behaviour, and the magistrate gave him a very hard time. In a Crown court, there would have been many people who, like him, were not professionals or from a well-educated background. They would have understood the way in which he responded to authority and the police. Although he chose to be dealt with by the magistrates because he wanted to be dealt with quickly and believed that he was innocent, in reality, there was prejudice and he did not receive as good a hearing as he would have done in the Crown court.

<P>
The circumstances of the defendant-and the reason why these are material considerations-are material in evaluating the option of being tried by 12 people who represent the community or by three or one. When making the choice, no one knows whether the magistrates court will consist of three persons or one. There are flaws in the Crown court and the High Court. I have seen Crown court judges, magistrates, jurors and clerks nod off. The judicial system is not perfect. That is why I would rather rely on 12 people to make a decision than one, two or three. In every case I should prefer that.

<P>

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> Every case?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In every case that is contested, because one receives a more representative answer. Uncomplicated, run-of-the-mill cases-such as speeding offences, where people plead guilty by post, do not turn up or come and plead guilty-are properly decided by magistrates. Exceptional cases, such as extradition, are judged by a stipe who has the experience and expertise to deal with them.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> Let us be clear. The hon. Gentleman appeared to say that the right to trial by jury should be extended to trials of summary offences that are tried by magistrates alone. I am not talking about trivial, speeding-type issues, but serious offences that are dealt with by the magistrates court, where there is no choice or right to trial. Does the hon. Gentleman believe that we should extend the right to trial by jury in the Crown court to those offences?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> No. I will explain. I said that I should always prefer to be tried by a jury. I say that from my experience of watching magistrates courts deal with cases, how clerks advise, how influential they can be, and the fact that they do not always get it right.

<P>
 I believe that when we consider which cases should be tried summarily, be they either-way cases or indictable only, the review should be separate, so that we arrive at an objective consideration of whether cases are in the right place. As a matter of public policy, some cases would be better tried summarily, but are not. I said on Second Reading and in earlier debates that, in relation to this debate, some either-way cases would be better off if the decision were not left to the defendant. I am open to the review process, but I am not persuaded that one should suddenly take the 700 offences that are either-way and think that there is no distinguishing characteristic between the most and the least serious of them and transfer them lock, stock and barrel from one category, where the defendant has a choice, to one where they do not.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I understand the argument about how the review process takes place and will return to it in my reply, but is the hon. Gentleman saying that if he were charged with keeping a brothel, assaulting a police officer or other serious summary offence, such as drink-driving, in the review process that he described he and other citizens in his position should have the right to trial by jury that they do not currently enjoy?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I believe that that is a matter for review. The public policy answer is that we should consider it on a regular basis. I was giving a personal answer. I am sorry if it becomes influential outside and encourages more people to elect for trial, if, as I hope, they have the right to do when the Bill is enacted, but I cannot think of a case where, if I was charged and believed that I was not guilty, I would not prefer to be tried by a jury rather than a magistrate.

<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> The hon. Gentleman is saying that one should have the right to that choice, whatever the offence?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is what I would want for myself. That is my subjective view, but we should debate whether any defendant in any case who pleaded not guilty should have that right. We should reach a collective view on that. I understand the implications of the question. I am not stupid. The debate that we should have had was not held before the general election because the Government did not put it on the agenda when they were in opposition. No party put it on the agenda because no one proposed changes to the system. We did not have it after the election. We are only now having the debate on what offences should be summary only and which should be indictable and whether there should be either-way offences.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> Cannot we draw the inference that, with his impeccable Liberal Democrat credientials, the hon. Gentleman would not want for himself what would be denied to his 90,000 constituents, namely the right to include within the net of either-way offences the complete spectrum of cases that are heard by magistrates courts? Is that not an unsustainable line to take?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I argued from my experience. Other people have different experiences. We have had the public policy debate about what should be summary only. We are now debating whether we should extend the choice or diminish it. I want us to have that debate. Certainly it would be unfair for any of us to have an option that others did not. I do not want different treatment any more than the hon. Gentleman would if he were the defendant. I just want us to have the debate about the whole system at the same time and not suddenly to have the Government land on us a proposition that will take away the right to choose a jury trial for 700 offences in England and Wales.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> It is not as though the 700 or so offences had been set in concrete and passed down to us by previous generations. They have been kept under constant review and that process will not stop with the passage of this Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Of course it will not, but since 1855-I think that that is what the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire said-it has not been proposed that the defendant would lose the choice for every offence where he previously had the choice. No Government, Labour, Conservative, Liberal or National, has ever proposed that before. It is a major constitutional proposal and the defendant's consideration is not even in the equation.

<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> There is the right of appeal.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> We shall come to that. This is another nonsense. The right of appeal is a compromised nonsense. Anybody who does not get the decision he wants is being offered the chance of another decision that will delay the final decision. It will add more cost and involve other courts. It is another decision where there is no real subjective choice for the defendant. It is a decision by the establishment, not the citizen. It may be by the judge and not the magistrate, but it is still not the defendant.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> The Minister seemed to suggest that the hon. Gentleman wanted to go back to a system where he could insist on a trial by jury for a whole range of offences that are tried summarily at present. It is true that these offences have been extended repeatedly by Government. Governments want more and more offences to be tried summarily. The point here is that, however far they have been extended, if my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire is accused of an act of dishonesty, however minor, he has a right to a trial by jury. That is the key point. That is the key difference. That is what destroys people's careers, whether they are starting off or as distinguished as my hon. Friend.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Short interventions please.

<P>
<B>Mr. Leigh:</B> That is surely the answer to the Minister.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a central point. An offence might involve little financial value-shoplifting, perhaps, as in the Marks and Spencer example. However, the reality is that not only might it affect people's future career, because often on job application forms and so on one is asked ``Have you any convictions for dishonesty?'', but it might affect them emotionally and mentally. I have dealt with such cases. The ones I most readily remember happen to be women in middle age who had been charged following shoplifting in a supermarket. They had no previous convictions and they were emotionally destroyed so that, by the time they came to court, they were wrecks. In some cases they were not in paid work at the time, but that did not matter. Their self-respect and reputation in the eyes of family, friends and, if they believed in one, their creator, was gone.

<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Hawkins </B>(Surrey Heath): While the hon. Gentleman is on that particular subject, would he agree with me-[
Interruption.] I am sorry. My train of thought has been slightly destroyed by the sedentary intervention of the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall). Would the hon. Gentleman agree with me that not only those in middle age but those at the very start of their careers could be similarly affected? I go back to the example given by my right hon. and learned Friend.

<P>
I recently had a constituency case in which someone was facing the prospect of conviction. In fact, it was dealt with by a caution, and I know that as a result of the police deciding to proceed in that way, the youngster is now pursuing a potentially successful career in store management. That is precisely the sort of case in which, under our current legislation, a person would have had the right to choose jury trial. Had I been giving advice to that person as a criminal law client-as both the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and I used to do-it would certainly have been to elect in front of a jury, for the reasons that he gave.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am grateful. I understand what the Government Whip was trying to say, so I will be brief in order to finish this contribution in good time before the end of this morning's sitting. There are two further important considerations covered by the amendment, or a variation on it. First, the choice will depend on the circumstances of the accused and which system they think will give them the best chance of justice. That must be the fundamental issue. For the accused, one of the considerations is whether they believe that the entirely lay public-brought in, so to speak, off the street-should be involved in the criminal justice process. They must consider whether that is how they want the system to work. To take away that option is to disrespect the views of accused people.

<P>
<B>Helen Jones:</B> I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. The point that struck me most forcefully was that he said that if he were innocent, he would wish to opt for trial in front of a jury. The implication of that is serious. Is he saying that magistrates courts convict people who are innocent? If so, what is his evidence? Following on from that, does he believe that it is the duty of the courts-both the magistrates courts and the Crown court-to come to a fair finding of guilt or innocence, or should they be deciding what the effect will be on the reputation of the accused, regardless of whether they are innocent?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Lady raises all sorts of questions, some of which I shall leave until later. All courts have one obligation-to decide whether the accused is guilty on the basis of the evidence before them. I have no doubt that periodically the innocent are convicted by magistrates courts. Equally, I have no doubt that the innocent have also been convicted from time to time in the Crown court, sometimes because the evidence has been fabricated or corrupted, or because a mistake has been made. It is not a fact of magistrates or sheriffs courts that an innocent person is more likely to be convicted against a not guilty plea. A relevant issue for later debate is the number of appeals against conviction by those who pleaded not guilty. We need to compare the success of appeals against conviction in a magistrates court with appeals against Crown court convictions, but the outcome cannot be pre-determined.

<P>
It is because I am absolutely certain that magistrates have wrongly convicted that I would rather the decision about conviction was in the hands of 12 lay people than one or three magistrates. There is a greater chance of the correct verdict in a case decided by a mjaority of 10 or 11 out of 12 than by one, two or three out of three.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Taylor:</B> For the avoidance of doubt, will the hon. Gentleman say whether his perception of the difficulties in magistrates courts applies to the Benches of three as well as to stipendiary magistrates, on which I share some of his concerns?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> That is a perfectly valid question and the answer is yes. I have less confidence in the stipendiary system than in the lay system and the problem, which the hon. Gentleman will understand, is that the defendant does not know whether he will get the stipe or the layman if he elects for the magistrate. If the defendant knew that, it would be another factor for him to consider.

<P>
Another reason why the amendment should be accepted can best be illustrated by an example. As drafted, the Bill precludes consideration of the physical or mental ability of the accused. It would be a nonsense if the fact that a defendant was physically ill and about to have an operation, or had an incapacity or handicap, could not be taken into account in considering whether his circumstances were likely to change between the date of appearance in the magistrates court and the trial in the Crown court. There are all sorts of physical and mental conditions, things that are unrelated to the defendant's reputation, that might be relevant. I hope that, as the Bill proceeds, whatever the final outcome, we get that right, without going back to the reputation alternative which was rightly rejected.

<P>
Debate adjourned.-[Mr. Mike Hall.]

<P>
Bill to be further considered on Tuesday 6 June at half-past Ten o'clock.-[Mr. Mike Hall.]
