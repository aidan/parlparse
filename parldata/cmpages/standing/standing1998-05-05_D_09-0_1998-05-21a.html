Amendment moved [this day]: No. 289, in page 20, line 5, leave out `either' and insert `one'.--[Mr. Greenway.]
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 281, in page 20, line 11, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) that in any proceedings the court or the tribunal has, on the application of any party, made a determination to the like effect to a determination which the Commissioner could have made under section 43, with respect to the data in question.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway (Ryedale):</B> I was saying by way of a preamble to amendments Nos. 280 and 281 that subsection (4) provides for proceedings against a data controller to be stayed. Will the Minister consider first and foremost what the reason for action by a data subject might be? I want us to consider the mechanism by which the provisions in subsections (4) and (5) would work.
<P>
Essentially, an individual data subject would seek to make use of the data subject access provisions in clauses 7, 9, 12 or 13--the order has, I think, been reversed by an earlier decision of the Committee. What would the reason for data subject's action be in such circumstances? Would it be to stop the processing of material that was likely to cause damage or distress? That is the provision in clause 9. Would it be to correct inaccurate data that might, as we discussed earlier, be based on gossip and third-hand information, or would it simply be to find out what information the data controller had in his files and records? Those are all valid interests for the data subject to pursue.
<P>
At that point, he would not know for certain the data processor's intentions.
<P>
Subsection (4) refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``any time . . . in any proceedings against a data controller under section 7(9), 9(4), 12 or 13(8) or by virtue of section 11''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is at that point that the data controller would say, ``I am processing the data because publication would be in the public interest in freedom of expression and I intend to publish.'' He would say that he intended to rely on the defence in clause 31(1)(b) and (c).
<P>
The Bill would then provide for a stay on the proceedings that the data subject had instituted. His efforts to find out the information, to correct inaccuracy or to block the processing would be stayed until such time as a determination had been made under the provisions of subsection (5) on whether the data controller's public interest defence was valid.
<P>
The Government's clear intention is that any proceedings to enforce data subject access rights in those circumstances must be stayed pending a determination on the public interest test.
<P>
I want both Ministers to be clear that we entirely agree with the principle that underlies the decision to stay. The phrase that is often used in that context is the ``Saturday afternoon injunction''. We are entirely at one with the Government if they intend that the data subject access provisions should not be used as a means for somebody to try to block a publication.
<P>
However, the more one investigates the issue, the more one asks further questions. For example, does any stay by the commissioner or by a court freeze the right to publish until the commissioner or the court has ruled? Would it not offend natural justice if publication were allowed to take place before the public interest test that is underpinned by the special purposes exemption is determined? Material could be published prior to the determination in favour of the data subject that the public interest test was not valid. In other words, the data controller's argument would not be upheld. Where does the balance of justice lie in such circumstances--in allowing publication, or in blocking it?
<P>
If a court rules that publication must be frozen pending the outcome of the determination, how could the provisions be used by a data subject to circumvent the alternative actions that might be available to him? Those actions would inevitably be affected by the general principle of the Bonnard v. Perryman ruling, which states that if someone seeks to block a publication using the Saturday afternoon injunction, the courts must exercise discretion in favour of the publisher. I was told by an eminent Queen's Counsel who practises in this area that, over the years, there have been many attempts to get around the Bonnard v. Perryman ruling--that is, to find a means of blocking a publication.
<P>
Is it the Government's view that the Bonnard v. Perryman test would apply to any proceedings arising under these provisions? For example, a data subject may say to a court, ``I have an inkling that this particular data controller has information about me which I believe to be inaccurate. He intends to publish it and I would like to exercise my rights under the provisions of this Bill to find out what he has.'' The data controller may then go to the court and say, ``No--we are going to rely on the public interest test and the proceedings are stayed.'' It is not clear whether the legislation requires that the proceedings should be stayed in those circumstances. It was certainly not clear to the person from whom I sought legal advice whether there could be a freezing of the right to publish in such a case. That is crucial, and it goes to the heart of amendments Nos. 280 and 281.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar and her officials have told the Minister and his officials that they do not like the provisions of subsection (5). Hon. Members who have studied the responses sent to the Committee by the Data Protection Registrar and others cannot fail to have noticed the deep anxiety that they reveal about the conditions set out in subsection (5)--that the commissioner shall determine whether the public interest test is valid, and that the matter may go to a tribunal following that determination.
<P>
I have a briefing note from the Data Protection Registrar. I should be happy to copy it for the Committee, although I suspect that the Minister and his officials know its contents. It proposes a timetable in which the data subject applies to the court for compensation under section 11 of the Data Protection Act 1984, the data controller claims that he is processing for the special purposes, and then the application is stayed pending determination by the Data Protection Commissioner. It is suggested that that process would take six months.
<P>
A different route, taking four months, would involve the data controller applying to the Data Protection Commissioner for assessment under section 41 of the 1984 Act. If the commissioner considers the request of the data subject and needs further information, he would serve a special information notice on the data controller. It would take another 28 days to allow an appeal to be lodged. If the data controller appealed against the notice that he had not met the public interest test, the matter would go to a tribunal, taking the period involved up to eight months. The process is extremely long and drawn out.
<P>
I discussed the matter with my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary. Our feeling was that circumstances may exist in which that would be the appropriate method for dealing with the determination. So we do not suggest that the provisions in subsection (5) should be altered and an alternative procedure substituted. Amendments Nos. 280 and--especially--281 would provide that a court could make the determination as well as the commissioner or a tribunal.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar's understanding is that the Bill does not intend the public interest test to be determined by a court, only by the commissioner, subject to appeal to a tribunal. The amendment proposes the additional choice of using a court to make the determination.
<P>
Subsection (5) sets out the conditions as follows:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) that a determination of the Commissioner under section 44 with respect to the data in question takes effect, or
<P>
(b) in a case where the proceedings were stayed on the making of a claim, that the claim is withdrawn.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>This is an obvious choice.
<P>
Amendment No. 281 offers the third choice
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``( ) that in any proceedings the court or the tribunal has, on the application of any party, made a determination to the like effect to a determination which the Commissioner could have made under section 43, with respect to the data in question.'.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The application therefore could be made by either party, and the amendment provides an alternative way to deal with the matter.
<P>
Neither the Bill nor the notes on clauses make it clear why the court cannot decide either that the processing is not for the special purposes or that it is not done with a view to publication. The Bill is so procedurally complex that an ordinary person could be given an extremely hard time, whether by media organisations or by unmeritorious data controllers abusing the provisions of clause 31(4). The restriction of the Data Protection Commissioner and the specification of the time taken together confine the value of the provisions to those with deep pockets. The amendment would mean that a court or tribunal could clear that statutory blockage on the application of a party if it were satisfied about the matters set out in clause 43. The appeal would lie in the usual way, and the court would determine the matter.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Minister must tell the Committee why the courts cannot be trusted with the power proposed by the amendment, which was not tabled with the intention of weakening the ability to stay the proceedings. My initial questions are important because they concern such weighty and complex arrangements, which is why hon. Members will have to return to these matters on Report. If the staying of proceedings were to block publication, it would be highly likely that the data controller seeking to publish would prefer an alternative resolution that is speedier than the several months' procedure--I understand that purely on the word of the registrar--laid out in the Bill. The amendment would provide nothing but flexibility. As I said, the preference of the Data Protection Commissioner--the current registrar--is a determination by the court. We are not suggesting that; we believe that it should be an alternative. If publication were blocked on the staying of proceedings, a data controller or data subject might prefer the more speedy process of determination by the court.
<P>
I have outlined as best I can the questions in Opposition Members' minds. I again emphasise our belief that the stay on proceedings pending a determination is the right approach, as my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Sir B. Mawhinney) made clear on Second Reading. Given the uncertainties regarding implementation in relation to the courts and to the legal profession, which are far more expert than the Minister or I, the alternative of allowing a court to determine the public interest test would benefit the legislation.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth):</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Welsh, I should like to return to a point made this morning, to which I neglected to respond. My hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Mr. White) asked about the concerns of British Music Rights, to which the office of my noble Friend Lord Williams wrote earlier this week. The answer was that clause 31 is probably not relevant, but that transfers to third countries can be made with the data subject's consent. I hope that those who need to know that will have either already recieved a letter or be about to do so.
<P>
I note that the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) said that he had been advised on these matters by a leading counsel. I hope that he was not charged for the questions. A bit of pro bono work never goes far amiss.
<P>
His first question concerned the reasons for such an approach by a data subject. He felt that that was an important matter. In fact, any one of the three reasons that the hon. Gentleman gave could be the reason. It would obviously depend on the circumstances under consideration. I hope that he will recognise that that answers the points that he raised.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether any stay froze the right to stay publication pending a court decision, where the balance of justice lay, and whether it could be used to circumvent action.
<P>
The commissioner's determination, which lifts the stay on proceedings, is not related to the public interest as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest. It is--as clause 4 provides--about whether personal data are being processed solely for the special purposes or whether they are being processed with a view to publication of any previously unpublished material. The stay on proceedings to which the hon. Gentleman referred would not block publication. It allows processing to continue until such time as the determination is made. It is not for special interests and, for that matter, not with a view to fresh publication. I hope that that is helpful. It is the court action and not the proceedings that is stayed. The processing itself is unaffected in the meantime.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ryedale also asked about timing. The tribunal's rules of procedure can, in appropriate cases, provide for a fast-track approach to appeals against a determination by the commissioner. The hon. Gentleman made the reasonable point that all this would often be far too complex for individuals to understand. I accept that. However, clause 52 provides that the commissioner can assist individuals in bringing proceedings. That would involve making the provisions understandable, so that those individuals could make their way through the complex language.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman explained that his amendment would add a further condition justifying lifting the stay on proceedings that involved special purposes material under clause 31(4). Subsection (4) deals with circumstances in which proceedings are being taken against a controller involving processing for special purposes. It provides for the courts to stay those proceedings in certain circumstances. The stay on proceedings may be lifted only where one of the conditions in subsection (5) is met. Those conditions are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``that a determination of the Commissioner under section 44 with respect to the data in question takes effect'',<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or that, if the proceedings were based on a claim by the controller under subsection (4), that claim is withdrawn.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would add a third condition. The stay on proceedings could be lifted where the court or tribunal--I assume that that means the Data Protection Tribunal--had, in respect of the data in question, made a determination similar to that which the commissioner could have made under clause 44. The amendment refers to clause 43, but I assume that it should refer to clause 44. However, I shall not quibble about that.
<P>
I shall come straight to the point on this amendment. The Government cannot accept it because it would fundamentally undermine the purpose of the exemption provided in clause 31.
<P>
That clause, taken with other related provisions in the Bill, in particular clauses 43, 44 and 45, establishes a carefully worked out mechanism for ensuring that the Bill properly meets the requirement in article 9 of the directive for processing for the special purposes to reconcile individuals' right to privacy with freedom of expression. That is a key element from which we should not depart too far.
<P>
The directive provides for ccertain exemptions for that purpose. The mechanism built around clause 31 delivers them, as I noted in detail this morning. The Committee knows very well, in the light of our debate, what the Government's position is, and the reasons why we have followed the approach that we have.
<P>
We think it right that there should be no possibility of challenge to processing for the special purposes, prior to publication. We wish to avoid what has been called the chilling effect of pre-publication restrictions. That is, in our view, wholly inconsistent with freedom of expression. A central thrust of the arrangements made in clause 31 and the associated provisions is to achieve that principle.
<P>
Subsections (4) and (5) of clause 31, together with later provisions, are directed at ensuring that no injunctions or other forms of relief depending solely on data protection considerations may be used to stop processing pre-publication in special purposes cases. The amendment would seriously weaken this carefully constructed mechanism by allowing applications to be made by third parties for injunctive and other proceedings relating to the special purposes to go ahead prior to publication.
<P>
The major flaw in the idea of just allowing the criteria in clause 31(4) to be litigated in the way suggested by this amendment is that it would indeed reopen the door to injunctions relief and the often unwelcome effect of pre-publication court action on journalism in progress. We want to avoid issues that should be considered by the courts being dealt with in another way.
<P>
If we make the criteria for the stay justiciable, we enable those with something to hide and an interest in spiking investigative journalism to raise enough of a query about the application of the criteria to engage the court's inherent jurisdiction to injunct the journalism, pending further consideration. That would be self-defeating.
<P>
I know that there is a view that the current arrangements are too wide in that they allow any controller to claim that he was processing for the special purposes and to secure a stay on proceedings, whether or not that was the case. That is an important point, but the Bill does not neglect it. It deals with it through the power that it gives the Data Protection Commissioner to issue special information notices under clause 43.
<P>
That power enables her to make the necessary inquiries to determine whether processing is as a matter of fact being carried out for the special purposes with a view to publication of any previously unpublished material. The powers apply where she has received a request for an assessment under clause 41, or where she has reasonable grounds for suspecting that the processing in question does not satisfy the relevant issues.
<P>
If she finds that the processing is not solely for the special purposes, or that publication of previously unpublished material is not intended, she may make a determination to that effect. Once the determination has effect, the enforcement arrangements apply. This mechanism has been included in the arrangements in the Bill expressly to ensure that there is a safeguard against the abuse that the critics of the provision fear.
<P>
In cases of very flagrant abuse of the staying provisions, the commissioner might not even need to use her special information notice power. She may be satisfied on the basis of existing evidence that it is right to make a determination. There is no reason why that could not be done very quickly in appropriate cases.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, we should not forget that there already exists general provision to discourage flagrant abuse of court process, whether by way of costs orders or otherwise. We believe that all those checks are sufficient. We do not think that it is necessary to introduce the further condition for unstaying proceedings suggested by the hon. Member for Ryedale, as that would do considerable damage to the important arrangements that the bill makes to safeguard freedom of expression.
<P>
I realise that that is a technical response to the amendment, but these are technical and complex issues relating to important principles. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Obviously, we shall study the Hansard report of what the Minister has said with interest. I listened carefully to him and we are slightly at odds over two matters.
<P>
First, the Minister seemed to rule out any prospect that a stay on proceedings would in no circumstances present an opportunity for publication to be frozen. Legal advice may provide a different opinion. If the Bill makes it clear that there is neither prospect nor intention that the court should ever freeze publication, I should be grateful if he would write to me with details of the specific provision. However, my understanding is that it is not certain that a court may not, on occasion and in certain circumstances, consider freezing publication.
<P>
Secondly, the Minister suggest that fast-track procedures exist and that under clause 44 the commissioner, in cases of the most blatant abuses of the public interest test, could make a fairly rapid determination against a data controller. I appreciate that the amendment refers to clause 43, but clause 43(2) specifies that the purpose is to ascertain
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``(a) whether the personal data are being processed only for the special purpose, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> (b) whether they are being processed with a view to the publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artisitc material which has not previously been published by the data controller.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a positive finding in favour of the data controller. Clause 44(1) offers an alternative and states that the commissioner shall make a determination when it appears that personal data
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``(a) are not being processed only for the special purposes, or<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) are not being processed with a view to the publication by any person of any journalistic, literary or artistic material which has not previously been published by the data controller''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I shall not press the matter today, although the Minister will appreciate its importance. The advice that I have received from the Data Protection Registrar and her deputy is that, even on the most optimistic fast track, the process could take weeks or months. We shall need to take fresh advice on the matter. Our purpose in raising the matter was to encourage the Minister to consider providing an alternative mechanism. We asked in the amendment for the court to make the determinations in clauses 43 and 44. I am not convinced by the Minister's argument that that would knock a hole in the Bill's provisions, which seek to prevent people from using it to get Saturday afternoon injunctions to block publication.
<P>
As I said earlier, we are on all fours with the Government on the spirit behind that intention. We are simply asking, first, whether the Bill's procedures fully achieve the Government's intention. Is not there a danger that a court might decide to order publication to be frozen? Secondly, there is the alternative of using the courts. If the court makes a proper determination, no data controller or member of the press will have anything to fear. If the determination is that the material is being processed with a view to publication and for the special purposes, the court will so rule and publication will go ahead. There will be no bar to the press making their story available to the wider world. I agree with the Minister that if there is to be any tilting one way or the other, publication will take marginal precedence over the blocking of publication, as is clear from the Bonnard v. Perryman ruling.
<P>
We are talking semantics. this is a complex matter and I have said that we might want to return to it; it would be astonishing if other hon. Members did not seek to do so. The measures are of fundamental importance, and I hope that other hon. Members will find our discussion helpful. I am grateful for the opoortunity to raise the issue, and I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment at the appropriate time.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Howarth:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked whether the fast-track process would be fast enough in particular circumstances. That would depend on the circumstances. I am reasonably confident that a case in which a major and urgent issue was at stake could, under the proposed arrangements, be dealt with as expeditiously as was necessary or reasonable in the circumstances.
<P>
On the question of freezing, it is difficult to start bandying about legal advice. I am, however, confident that anybody with the necessary expertise who read the whole Bill and considered all the provisions on the subject would find that, taken together, they provide sufficient reassurance. The difficulty is that the advice that the hon. Gentleman used focused narrowly on the clause rather than on other factors later in the Bill that influence it. I do not want to make that a debating point; it is simply an important principle that one should read clauses in conjunction with later parts of the Bill.
<P>
That said, I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has agreed to withdraw the amendment. I am sure that he will have the opportunity to think further about it and to consider more closely my comments and the advice that he has received. If he feels the need, I am sure that he will return to the issue. I hope, however, that he will think that what I have said is reasonable and that, taken as a set of arrangements, our proposals are the best way possible of dealing with these complex issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Research, history and statistics</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 226, in page 20, line 23, at end add--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(1A) In this section research can only be carried out by or under the direction of an individual whose research credentials or qualifications have been approved by the Data Protection Commissioner.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This is a probing amendment regarding the Bill's exemption regarding research. The amendment is widely drawn, but essentially we should like the Minister to clarify whether such research will be well structured. Will he assure the Committee that the exemption will not be employed by all and sundry to process information that is not necessarily in data subjects' interests?
<P>
We suggest that such research should be carried out only under the supervision of an individual with an appropriate academic or professional qualification. A number of organisations within the credit card industry, which I have prayed in aid on several occasions, have expressed concern about our amendment. They are worried that a company with a staff of, say, 30 people who are researching the use and abuse of credit card arrangements might find that it has to appoint more expert staff at greater cost. That is certainly not the amendment's intention. We do not believe that it should be necessary to appoint a team leader who needs to be on the company's premises for every minute of every day on which research takes place. Our concern was rather that the research should be validated by means of some professional or academic qualification.
<P>
My reason for instigating this debate was to probe the Minister regarding the full extent of the exemption. Will he assure us that it will not act as a cloak by which processing could be carried out against the data subjects' interests? We agree that an exemption is necessary, but it should be propertly focused so as to avoid the potential for abuse.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Taylor </B>(Esher and Walton): I do not wish to dislodge my hon. Friend's cloak. However, I should like to address the needs of genuine researchers.
<P>
Having been the Minister responsible for science, I am aware that it is often necessary to ensure that one gets access to information without having constantly to worry about the processing of it, and about whether one is a data controller.
<P>
Some things masquerade as history but are in fact investigative journalism, and would have been better tackled in our earlier discussions about clause 31. We must distinguish between genuine researchers and those who merely claim to be researchers. I know that all the best investigative journalists on the so-called quality newspapers call themselves researchers. I doubt whether they would qualify for grants under the research councils for which I was responsible in the olden days. Will the Minister provide the Committee with some illumination on that point?
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> The hon. Member for Ryedale made it clear that amendment No. 226 is a probing amendment. I was relieved to hear that, for the reasons that the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr. Taylor) has just given.
<P>
As it stands, clause 32 is suitably flexible. The benefits that it offers are available subject to a straightforward test--that the processing is being carried out for research purposes. It is best to keep the test simple. It does not matter who is doing the processing--that is an important principle, which I shall explain in a moment. Who does it is one question, but the important issue is the purpose of the research.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment would, in effect, introduce a licensing system for people wanting to process personal data for research purposes and to take advantage of the benefits that the Bill permits, fully and consistently with the directive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Esher and Walton made an interesting point about the reputation or otherwise of those who may be conducting research, but I would argue that it would be too difficult to rule out one or another person on the grounds of qualifications or academic reputation. It is better to rely on the subject under consideration and the purposes to which the data will be put. From his experience of research in the scientific community, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that that is a better test than the persons involved. In other spheres, where the activity is governed by regulatory procedures, it is obviously necessary to ensure that the people conducting the work are properly qualified to do so. However, it is difficult to be that precise when dealing with data rather than, for example, specific experimentation.
<P>
The amendment would mean that anyone wanting to take advantage of the special arrangements for research would be obliged to have his or her credentials and qualifications approved by the Data Protection Commissioner. I am not sure that she would want to do that. It would be bureaucratic and burdensome, and would not necessarily improve the quality of research. It would be a huge disincentive to those who might want to carry out research for genuine purposes and it would disadvantage anyone using the special arrangements for research that are provided for. As a consequence, they might even pull out of a worthwhile and useful project.
<P>
It is open to anyone with anxieties relating to a particular researcher's compliance with the Bill to ask the commissioner to investigate. In such circumstances, she can, if necessary, use the existing enforcement powers. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman and that he agrees that clause 32 is about right. It would be unwise to proceed with his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. My worries have not been entirely dispelled, but he has certainly put the Government's views on the record. We are content to leave it there for the moment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Clause 33, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 34</center></H4>
<H4><center>Disclosures required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings etc.</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 227, in page 21, line 15, leave out `(including prospective legal proceedings)'.
<P>
I hope to make a brief contribution. This is a probing amendment. The clause provides an exemption in relation to legal proceedings, and includes the phrase ``prospective legal proceedings''. When I read the Bill, that struck me as fine, but I wondered whether some data controllers might seek to take advantage of the exemption through fishing expeditions, with no real intention to proceed. I see from your reaction, Mr. Welsh, that I have made the point.
<P>
As in many of its debates, the Committee has to be careful in trying to balance the rights of data subjects with those of data controllers. We must be careful not to give data controllers exemptions that allow people the opportunity to abuse the provisions. The clause struck me as providing such an opportunity. I am bound to say that the amendment is, in some respects, similar--it is only a similarity--to an Opposition amendment through which the Committee debated what constituted crime and the criteria for deciding whether a crime had been committed. The Minister was clear that the definition of crime was sufficiently widely interpreted by the courts for there to be no requirement to establish that a crime had occurred, and that suspicion of a crime would do.
<P>
Will the Minister explain why legal proceedings do not in themselves include prospective legal proceedings? When legal proceedings become legal proceedings and when they are prospective is, of course, another question. Can the Committee be sure that data controllers will not abuse the exemption, use it for fishing expeditions to obtain information about people and insist that it is for prospective legal proceedings but never proceed? By that time, it will be too late to protect the data subject's interests.
<P>
<B>Mr. George Howarth:</B> I shall be brief, and I believe that I shall entirely satisfy the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
The exemption about which the hon. Gentleman spoke could not be relied on for purely speculative purposes, or for fishing expeditions, as he put it. Proceedings have to occur in prospect, but that must mean more than wholly speculative proceedings. If not, the exemption would simply not apply. It is clear that that is the case. As that is the information that the hon. Gentleman was seeking, I shall say no more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 209, in page 22, line 12, leave out `consider' and insert `have regard to'.
<P>
The amendment proposes what we think would be a minor improvement in the clause. We shall not press it, but to require the commissioner
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to have regard to whether a contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in deciding about serving an enforcement notice would be marginally stronger than merely to invite the commissioner to ``consider'' so doing.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department </B>(Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): The amendment is so subtle that it escapes my understanding, but that may be my fault. Having missed the earlier sitting, I am probably not up to speed with the subtlety and sophistication of the hon. Member for Ryedale. He seems to be on a further chapter on his guide to amendments, this one involving proposing only slightly alternative versions of the Bill.
<P>
It is very difficult to envisage any distinction that might exist in practice between ``consider'' and ``have regard to''. The hon. Member for Ryedale has offered no illumination as to what that distinction might be, other than to say that his proposal might be slightly stronger. However, the Bill uses wording that is based on the experience of the Data Protection Act 1984. That wording has served us well and fulfils its function entirely satisfactorily. There is no need to change it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 228, in page 22, line 15, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may require the data controller'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may take the following amendments: No. 229, in page 22, line 16, at beginning insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'shall require the data controller'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 230, in page 22, line 21, after `party' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`may require the data controller'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This amendment is slightly more important. It focuses on another instance in which those who drafted the Bill will have thought long and hard about using the words ``may'' or ``shall''.
<P>
	In a sense the amendment is probing. I do not want to deprive the commissioner of flexibility where it is needed, but the problem is one of inaccurate data. An enforcement notice may require a data controller.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to rectify, block, erase or destroy any inaccurate data''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
For the life of me I could not see, at least on first reading of the provision, why such an enforcement notice would not require a data controller to deal with the inaccurate data, so it would seem more appropriate to use ``shall'' than ``may''.
<P>
	I appreciate that flexibility will be determined by the contents of the enforcement notice. However, given that the data subject will have sought to have inaccurate data dealt with properly by the data controller, I hope that the Minister will say in what circumstances the enforcement notice will not require that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Clause 39(3) deals with the content of enforcement notices where contraventions of the fourth data protection principle have taken place. The fourth data protection principle is set out in schedule 1 on page 43. It concerns the accuracy of data and the requirement to correct it, and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clause specifies that a notice may require either the inaccurate data and any expression of opinion based on them to be rectified, erased, blocked or destroyed, or certain other steps to be taken in the case of data that are inaccurate but which accurately record information received by the controller.
<P>
The amendment would make it a requirement for a subsection (3) enforcement notice to do the first of those, but leave the second discretionary. The hon. Member for Ryedale suggested that where data were inaccurate, it would always be appropriate for the commissioner to require them to be rectified, blocked, erased or destroyed. Had he said that it would normally be appropriate for one of those steps to be taken, the Government could have agreed. However, we cannot accept that that would invariably be necessary. Perhaps I can give some examples. 
<P>
	Circumstances might well arise in which it would not be right for any of those steps to be taken. One such set of circumstances is identified in subsection (3)(b), where inaccurate data accurately record wrong information given to the controller. For instance, an illness might be misdiagnosed. The patient's record will contain that inaccurate information and he or she might well have been given treatment on the strength of it. Imagine the consequences if that information had to be rectified, blocked, erased or destroyed. Supposing further treatment were needed to remedy the consequences of the wrongly given initial treatment. The information on which to base that remedial treatment would no longer be available or usable. That cannot be right.
<P>
	In our view, it is better for the commissioner to determine in the light of all the circumstances of a particular contravention what obligations should be placed on the data controller. Clause 39 leaves the commissioner with that discretion. The approach is modelled closely on that of the 1984 Act.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I apologise to the Minister for not mentioning that amendment No. 230 applies the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``may require the data controller''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to subsection (3)(b). the words ``shall require'' would relate only to subsection (3)(a).
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I can repeat the main point, which is that we have had this wording since 1984. We are reproducing the approach of the 1984 Act which, to the best of our knowledge and experience, has not given rise to any problems. In the light of that, the amendment would not improve matters and I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister and I apologise to you, Mr. Welsh, and to the Committee for not having made that point clear earlier. Again, we have had the opportunity to consider the issue and I hear what the Minister says about the wording of the 1984 Act. It is as well for us occasionally to check that it is still appropriate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 231, in page 22, line 33, leave out `if reasonably practicable'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 232, in page 22, line 35, leave out from `destruction' to end of line 37.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> This is just a probing amendment to find out what is meant by ``reasonably practicable'' in line 33. When a data controller corrects inaccurate information, why might it be unreasonable to require him to advise third parties to whom the data had been disclosed of the inaccuracy? I suspect that the Minister may say that in some circumstances, data could have been disclosed to a huge number of people and that there needs to be a caveat. I hope that the Minister can at least confirm that the general expectation is that third parties would be notified if the information was shown to be inaccurate.
<P>
Amendment No. 232 is obviously consequential on amendment No. 231.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for raising the question, which he has probably already answered. I will, however, try to explain the function of clause 39(4). It deals with the situation in which rectification, blocking, erasure or destruction of inaccurate data is required by an enforcement notice, or has already taken place. It recognises that the rectification, blocking and so on, may take place after the inaccurate data have been disclosed to third parties. Accordingly, it provides that an enforcement notice may require the data controller to notify those third parties of the action taken. However, the notice may do that only if the action is ``reasonably practicable'', and has regard to the number of persons who would have to be notified.
<P>
The amendments would remove the possibility for the practicability of notifying third parties to be taken into account by the commissioner in deciding whether to include such a requirement in the enforcement notice. If the words in the amendment were taken out, that would have the curious effect that the commissioner could include such a requirement in an enforcement notice, even if it was impracticable for the data controller to comply with it.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees that that would be rather hard on the data controller. He or she is subject to an enforcement notice. He or she wants to comply, not only because he or she wants to do what is right, but because non-compliance is an offence. But it is simply not practicable to comply. He or she cannot do what the enforcement notice requires. He or she is, therefore, put in a position of being in breach of the notice and of facing the possibility of criminal proceedings.
<P>
That is not fair. Although the matters could be the subject of an appeal to the tribunal we would not want to put the data controller in that position in the first place.
<P>
In including the provisions we are following the line established by the directive. Article 12 of the directive is the origin of both the requirement to tell third parties of the rectification and of the proviso disapplying that requirement where it would not be reasonably practicable to comply.
<P>
The provision will be new to UK law. It is right in principle that controllers should make reasonable efforts to ensure that third parties to whom inaccurate data are disclosed are alerted to the inaccuracy and that action is taken. That is what the clause achieves. It gets the balance right. The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale go beyond what the directive requires and the Government cannot accept them.

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 130, in page 22, line 43, leave out from `(7)' to `before' in line 44 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an enforcement notice must not require any of the provisions of the notice to be complied with'.<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss the following amendments:
<P>
No. 211, in page 22, line 43, at end insert

<P>
No. 213, in clause 42, page 24, line 32, leave out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`by reason of special circumstances'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It appears that Government amendment No. 130 and amendment No. 211 in the name of the hon. Member for Ryedale are intended to achieve the same purpose.
<P>
The Government amendment is intended to clarify the reference in clause 39(6) to the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``time specified in an enforcement notice''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that the hon. Gentleman's intention is the same.
<P>
Clause 39 provides the commissioner with a power to issue enforcement notices requiring data controllers to comply with the data protection principles. Subsection (1) makes general provision for what the commissioner can require the data controller to do. It also establishes that an enforcement notice may specify the time at which a data controller must comply with the requirements in the notice. That is the ``time specified'', to which subsection (6) refers.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar has helpfully drawn attention to the possibility that more than one time might be specified in an enforcement notice.
<P>
For example, an enforcement might require a data controller to do two things: one by, say, 31 January, and the other by, say, 31 March. Subsection (6) does not make it clear which of those dates is relevant for the purposes of the subsection. Government amendment No. 130 is thus required to clarify matters. Its effect is that, if more than one time is specified in an enforcement notice, none of them can be set at a point before which there has been a full opportunity to appeal against the notice.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Ryedale appears to seek to address the same problem by a slightly different route. If that is the case, and our amendment achieves the result that he seeks, I hope that he will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. We were indeed seeking to address a similar point. I believe that amendment No. 211 should have been withdrawn earlier in the Committee's proceedings. Committee members will no doubt be pleased to learn that amendment No. 205 is also of that ilk, and we shall therefore not move it.
<P>
On subsection (7), I want to know more about the special circumstances in which the commissioner would wish an enforcement notice to be complied with as a matter of urgency. If the commissioner considers that such a notice should be complied with urgently, he should be able to require that that takes place. A specific provision appears to be superfluous; we should sufficiently trust in the commissioner's decision-making powers to determine such matters without guidance. That is a small point, however. On the more substantial point, we agree with the Government amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> It is right that amendments Nos. 210 and 213 deal with a slightly different issue.
<P>
Clause 39(7) empowers the commissioner to require a data controller to comply with an enforcement notice as a matter of urgency.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by reason of special circumstances''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 42(6) makes similar provision in relation to the commissioner's power to issue information notices. The provisions release the commissioner from the normal rules that apply to the time at which the requirements of enforcement and information notices may come into effect. Special time limits apply. Compliance with the notices may not be required earlier than seven days after the day on which the notice is served.
<P>
Provisions of that kind are well-established. The provision in clause 39 follows very closely the corresponding provision in section 10(7) of the 1984 Act. The provision in clause 42, which creates a new power for the commissioner to issue information notices, again follows that established model. We are not aware that there have been any difficulties with those arrangements.
<P>
Provision must be made for a ``fast track'' enforcement notice and information notice procedure. It is not difficult to envisage circumstances in which there is an urgent need for information, or speedy enforcement action needs to be taken. For example, a series of processing operations may take place that involves particularly sensitive data, which is causing considerable harm to data subjects and therefore needs to be stopped quickly. Application of the normal rules would allow the processing to continue and further harm to be caused. It is right that the commissioner should be able to take urgent action in such cases. However, there must be a test that justifies the avoidance of the normal rules, which serve as safeguards for the data controllers.
<P>
We have emphasised throughout our discussions on the Bill that we do not want to place unnecessary burdens on data controllers. To remove the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``by reason of special circumstances''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
would considerably weaken the test. It would be left entirely to the commissioner's discretion as to whether enforcement action or further information was needed as a matter of urgency. The Government do not believe that it is right for the commissioner to be able to exercise her discretion without limit in that way.
<P>
A reasonable balance must be struck between the need for speedy intervention in pressing cases and the need to spare data controllers unnecessarily burdensome interventions. We believe that the 1984 Act got the balance right, and see no need to depart from that approach. The Bill reflects that. I hope that the hon. Member for Ryedale will therefore not press his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> By all means. As I said, we support Government amendment No. 130.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Clause 39, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.
