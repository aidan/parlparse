<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000381"></a>The
Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform (Mr. Jim
Murphy):</b> Thank you for calling me, Mr. Hood. I
congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair&#151;co-Chair, lead
Chair or whatever&#151;of our proceedings. The Clerks or
Mr. Amess might have informed you that we had a relatively
well-informed debate in good tone while trying to work our way through
some important details of the Bill. At the start of our second of 16
sittings, I seek to continue that
approach.</div><a name="06101774000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was
responding to a point about migration raised by the hon. Member for
Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander). I said
that the migration strategy will be based on the premise that those who
have been out of the labour market for the shortest time will be
migrated first, simply because those people have a greater chance,
based on objective analysis, of returning to the labour
market.</div><a name="06101774000018"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000382"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): If somebody has been out of
the labour market for a long time but is mad keen to get back&#151;if
they are strongly motivated and extenuating circumstances explain why
they have not approached it&#151;would the Minister consider at least
in principle that they should be able on application to advance in the
queue and to enter the new
arrangements?</div><a name="06101774000019"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000383"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates one of three points
that I wish to make about migration. One is proximity to the labour
market based on time out of it; the second is child poverty. The No. 1
priority of the Department for Work and Pensions is to eradicate child
poverty. By general acknowledgment, the Government have set the most
ambitious child poverty reduction target of any Government on the
globe: we aim to halve it by 2010 and to eradicate it by 2020. In terms
of migration strategy, it is important that those with dependent
children&#151;</div><a name="06101774000020"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000384"></a><b class="B">Adam
Afriyie</b> (Windsor) (Con): The Minister talks about
eradicating child poverty. Which measurement of child poverty is he
discussing in this context&#151;relative or
absolute?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 46</div><a name="06101774000021"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000385"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We are committed to abolishing all measures of
child poverty till there are no kids in poverty. It does not matter
which measure is used, but the one that we are using for our target is
relative poverty. By all acknowledgment, that is the most ambitious
measurement of child poverty, because it is a measure of relative
income across the economy.</div>
<a name="06101774000022"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000386"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> On a point of clarity, if the Minister is
referring to relative poverty, it would seem mathematically impossible
to eradicate it. If he is talking about the lowest percentile of income
for a family with children, that is a mathematical
impossibility.</div><a name="06101774000023"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000387"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am pleased to hear from the hon. Gentleman. He
has involved himself in an important part of the conversation. However,
we are committed to that target, and we are even more committed to
developing policies to get us to that target by 2020. It is really a
question that he should have addressed to his own Front-Bench Members.
As he will know, they have apparently now committed themselves to that
objective. As so often, his party wills the ends without identifying
any of the means; nevertheless, it is a small move forward for the
child poverty
target.</div><a name="06101774000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
migration strategy, we are looking for ways to maximise the income of
those with dependent children and to eradicate child poverty. The
general assessment is that this Bill and the measures in the Green
Paper could remove about 100,000 kids from relative poverty. Those and
other measures on child support reform play an important
part.</div><a name="06101774000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the point
made by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell), we are
considering ways of ensuring that volunteering happens. Someone out of
the labour market for three, five or seven years may, because of a
change in circumstances, have the determination to get on and get up.
We are considering ways to make that a
reality.</div><a name="06101774000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I
turn to the point raised this morning by the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey (Mr. Hunt) about clause 1(3)(e). I confirm that
someone wishing to make a benefit application would contact Jobcentre
Plus and discuss the available options. For some people, only one
benefit&#151;jobseeker&#146;s allowance, for example&#151;would
be available. However, some would have the opportunity to
choose.</div> <a name="06101774000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">This morning,
I gave the example of a lone parent who also had a disability; they
would be able to claim employment and support allowance or income
support. The customer, in discussion with Jobcentre Plus, will make
their own decision about what would be most appropriate for their
circumstances; the key point is that they would make the decision. As
we know, they would be entitled to only one income-related benefit at
any one time.</div><a name="06101774000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point raised by the hon. Member for South-West Surrey was not an issue
of principle but of whether clause 1(3)(e) was fit for purpose. I
looked into that point during the recess. I shall say something about
the work entitlement, which the hon. Gentleman asked about. A person is
entitled to a benefit only if they meet all the conditions and make a
claim for it. Those are the two stages: entitlement to the conditions
and making a claim. That is the legal, constitutional and legislative
argument on entitlement.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 47</div><a name="06101774000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just before
the end of this morning&#146;s sitting, I was about to say&#151;it
was on the tip of my tongue&#151;that, in common with other social
security legislation, the Bill will achieve what I have set out by
amending section 1 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992
through a consequential amendment, which can be found in paragraph 4(2)
of schedule 3.</div> <a name="06101774000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
may be a dry assurance, but I hope that it is what the hon. Gentleman
sought at the end of this morning&#146;s sitting. I have been advised
that it has the correct and proper legal meaning and that it achieves
the purpose that we wish to set out. I thank the hon. Gentleman for
raising that issue and giving me the opportunity to clarify
it.</div> <a name="06101774000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put
and agreed
to.</i></div><a name="06101774000032"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause 1
ordered to stand part of the
Bill.</i></div><a name="06101774000011"></a>




<h4 class="hs_8Clause">Schedule
1</h4><a name="06101774000006"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Employment
and support allowance: additional
conditions</div><a name="06101774000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000388"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 78, in
schedule 1, page 49, line 2, after
&#145;Act,&#146;
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;( ) a contributory
allowance,&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am slightly worried about saying it, but this should be a brief debate
on the amendment, which involves a drafting omission. As Committee
members will be aware, schedule 1 is duplicated from existing income
support and incapacity benefit legislation, but we omitted to include
the phrases contained in the
amendment.</div><a name="06101774000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment extends the definition of &#147;benefit&#148; given in
paragraph 1(5) of schedule 1, which defines what is meant by
&#147;benefit&#148; for the purposes of paragraph 1(4) of schedule
1. We use the current regulations to relax the first contribution
condition so that it can be satisfied if sufficient contributions have
been paid in any one tax year, not necessarily one of the previous
three tax years. We want to be able to do the same in future for people
who have been entitled to contribute to ESA and to do so we must ensure
that to contribute to ESA is defined as a benefit in paragraph 1(5). I
apologise for that drafting omission.</div>
<a name="06101774000036"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment agreed
to.</i></div><a name="06101774000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000389"></a><b class="B">Danny
Alexander</b> (Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey)
(LD): I beg to move amendment No. 164, in
schedule 1, page 50, line 41, after
&#145;receiving&#146;, insert &#145;full
time&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000390"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 170, in schedule 1, page 51, leave out line
28.</div><a name="06101774000039"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000391"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b><b class="B"> </b>I join the Minister in welcoming you the
Chair, Mr. Hood. I look forward to serving in this Committee
under your chairmanship.</div>
<a name="06101774000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are designed to probe, in order to clarify the
Government&#146;s definition of education with respect to the
qualifying criteria for the ESA. Paragraph 285 of the explanatory notes
states that regulations will set out what is to be treated as education
and when it may not apply, but we need to hear a bit more from the
Government about what they mean by education and how they wish it to
apply in this case.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 48</div><a name="06101774000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example, income support
entitlement is usually allowed for part-time students and not full-time
students, so amendment No. 164 would insert the words &#147;full
time&#148; to make that clear. Indeed, exceptions in the case of
income support that allow full-time education include, for example,
students who are eligible for the disability premium and deaf people
who receive the disabled students&#146; allowance.</div>
<a name="06101774000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point that I wish to make
is that the rules surrounding this benefit must not be a disincentive
for people to learn. The Bill should allow more opportunities than at
present to improve employment chances through education and training
and it is particularly important that the terms of the Bill do not put
up new barriers to people who might be suffering an impairment,
condition or disability to access education and training while
continuing to be able to claim their benefits.</div>
<a name="06101774000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to bring some relevant
figures to the attention of the Committee, for which I am grateful to
the Disability Rights Commission. Of those currently in receipt of
incapacity benefit, 40 per cent. have no qualifications whatsoever and
15 per cent. have literacy and numeracy problems. It is worth noting,
too, that having qualifications can increase the chances of a disabled
person being in paid employment by 30 per cent. for men and 45 per
cent. for women. In the context of the overall objectives of the Bill,
encouraging education, training and gaining qualifications is
vital.</div> <a name="06101774000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the
disability premium for income support will be abolished under ESA, will
the Minister clarify how students will be identified as qualifying for
income-based ESA while studying full-time? People who receive income
support can get reductions in their course fees and sometimes fee
waivers. That does not apply to people who are on incapacity benefit,
although some colleges individually allow fee waivers. Will the
Minister explain how he thinks that people who receive income-based ESA
will be supported in the high cost of post-16 education? Will a fee
waiver apply to ESA recipients in the context of the Bill?</div>
<a name="06101774000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to the
Minister&#146;s
response.</div><a name="06101774000347"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.15
pm</div><a name="06101774000046"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000392"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Jeremy Hunt</b> (South-West Surrey) (Con): I take this
opportunity to welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood. I look
forward to serving under your no doubt wise and erudite
chairmanship.</div><a name="06101774000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wish
to speak in strong support of the amendments. We have reflected
carefully on them and we support them because the role of education
needs to be fleshed out if the Bill is to achieve the objectives that
the Government have set out. In particular, part-time and even
full-time education are often vital stepping-stones towards getting
back into full employment. The Committee will be aware that one of the
most iniquitous problems facing disabled people trying to lead an
independent life and contribute fully to society is the education
disadvantage that they suffer. Statistics such as the fact that a
disabled person with a higher education qualification is more likely to
be out of work than a non-disabled person with no qualification ought
to give pause to anyone and make them think. In considering the
drafting of the Bill we must be careful 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>not to ignore inadvertently the fact that education
is part of a solution, not part of the problem. Although we understand
that for obvious cost reasons it is not possible to give the employment
and support allowance automatically to everyone in full-time education,
we would have much greater success in getting people into the labour
market if we had a more positive attitude to the role of
education.</div><a name="06101774000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I must
declare an interest: before I was elected to Parliament last May, I ran
my own publishing business. We published guides and websites to help
people get on the right course and choose the right university or
college. My hon. Friends might be relieved to know that it was a
healthily capitalist occupation for me&#151;at that time, of course,
it was a different Conservative party.

Hood.</div><a name="06101774000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">I declare that
interest to show that I have some degree of knowledge of the business
background and of how courses have become a vital way for people who
are out of the labour market to re-engage in it. I used to have an
image of adult education as being flower arranging, cake-making, Latin,
Japanese, Shakespeare sonnets and other such wonderful and enjoyable
pursuits. In fact, when visiting adult education colleges one finds
that a huge number of the courses offered equip people with relevant
skills.</div><a name="06101774000052"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000395"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> Is my hon. Friend aware that in the technology
industry, many people with learning difficulties and mental health
challenges attend courses and are subsequently able to be placed with
employers? There is definitely an opening for part-time and full-time
courses to assist in meeting the Bill&#146;s
objectives.</div><a name="06101774000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000396"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that
point, which brings me in a relevant way to my other points. Education
is an important part of the solution, so the Bill needs flexibility.
The amendments tabled by the hon. Member for INBS, as I think I shall
call him from now on&#151;the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey&#151;would at least make part-time education
possible.</div><a name="06101774000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
when we discuss education we will consider it also in relation to the
support part of the new employment and support allowance. We shall come
to that later, but if the Government are serious about wanting to allow
people on the support package to volunteer for the pathways programme,
they need to understand the role of education in making that possible.
Education might not be a matter simply of job placement, although that
is what it is most likely to be for people on the work-related part of
the allowance package. I support the
amendment.</div><a name="06101774000055"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000397"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> May I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Hood? You have probably picked up on the fact that the
debate has been broadly consensual and good-natured, and I shall not
subvert that. I wish to add only one or two comments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column49" />Column number: 50</div><a name="06101774000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, one should always have
regard to the control function as well as the relaxation function, so
Ministers may need to reflect on the current definition of education.
For many people education will be perceived as attending an institution
in which education is delivered, but the internet and online learning
may require Ministers to draw the definitions widely to embrace the
appropriate restrictions. I am not anxious to encourage them to go
further, but I put those views on the record.</div>
<a name="06101774000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">On my second point, I should
declare an interest as one of the parliamentary patrons of the National
Institute of Adult Continuing Education. The Minister is looking at me
wryly. As he will well remember, as a former Minister with
responsibility for higher and further education, I am deeply committed
to the cause of lifelong learning and I look only for allies on both
sides of the Committee in relation to it. We all believe that it is
important&#151;whether in an employment-related or support-related
context, or in a context unrelated to other matters. It is a good in
itself, quite apart from the employment side of it, although I endorse
the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Surrey on its
relevance to employment for people who have been out of the labour
market for some time and whose lack of prior attainment, though not
ability, may disqualify them or hold them back from reaching the
appropriate level in that
market.</div><a name="06101774000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
although the words have not been mentioned, I suspect that somewhere,
stalking this debate, is the mythic figure of 16 hours concerning
people&#146;s availability for full-time work, or their potential
availability for it were they able to go through the pathways and get
access to work. The suggestion is that there should be a distinction.
At the time of my ministerial experience of more than a decade ago
there was a rigorous distinction between the student support package
and the support that is available through the benefits system, and that
has broadly been maintained, but the explanatory notes already indicate
that there is some possibility of eroding or eliding it for disabled
students. I do not think that Ministers will expect me to declare the
end of the 16-hour rule as far as the Opposition are concerned. If they
do, they will be disappointed; it is a debate for another occasion.
However, and I speak in all seriousness, the role of education is
important, and we should like to feel that the system works to
facilitate it so as to encourage people back to work. We do not want it
to be used unduly pedantically so as to exclude people from the labour
market by making it, while theoretically possible, practically
impossible for them to qualify for future
employment.</div><a name="06101774000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000398"></a><b class="B">Alison
Seabeck</b> (Plymouth, Devonport) (Lab): I apologise for being
late for the start of the Committee, Mr. Hood.</div>
<a name="06101774000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unlike a number of Committee
members, I am not an expert in these matters. Paragraph 4(1)(a) of
schedule 1 refers to &#147;prescribed cases&#148;. Will the
Minister clarify what could be classified as such a
case?</div><a name="06101774000061"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000399"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I shall endeavour to respond to the points
mentioned. The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey raised some genuinely important points about the role of
education, and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 51</div>importance of education in the skills and employment gaps, the income
and wealth gaps, the opportunity gap, and in all the other
differentials that we know have been endemic in our society for many
decades. Education is the key part of that. When we examine social
mobility, we see that the first factor to make a big impact is
childhood and family poverty, which we have already considered in
response to the comments made by the hon. Member for Windsor, and which
we may have a further opportunity to discuss. The second is the role of
the family, social networks and the social capital that families can
provide. The third is education, and predominantly primary education.
Although the context of the Bill is later years, primary education and
early years education is one of the key three drivers of social
mobility and the transformation of life chances, so the hon. Gentleman
is right to raise the issue.</div>
<a name="06101774000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Daventry drew on both his current involvement in education
and his distinguished career as a higher education Minister. He will
recall that we have spoken about this before, but during a previous
life I served as the president of the National Union of Students for
the UK. He was one of the few Ministers whom we looked forward to
meeting, because he was always willing to enter into a
conversation&#151;there was a dialogue, not a diatribe. I hope that
he does not mind my saying that he was a new Conservative before being
one became this year&#146;s vogue.</div>
<a name="06101774000063"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000400"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Minister might be in danger of inadvertently
breaking up this afternoon&#146;s friendly consensus by suggesting
that the modern compassionate Conservative party is a vogue, when it is
in fact much more fundamental than that.</div>
<a name="06101774000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000401"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Mr.
Hood&#151;</div><a name="06101774000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000402"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Yes, I am about to rule you out of
order.</div><a name="06101774000066"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000403"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have not said anything yet. All I can say is
that we are judged by our actions as well as our words. The hon. Member
for South-West Surrey has not been here long enough to vote against the
new deal, tax credits or all the investments that have helped to drive
our labour market interventions, which make some of the Bill entirely
possible.</div> <a name="06101774000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">To return
to the point that the hon. Member for Daventry and others made, my
experience is not based on statistical analysis or the fact that I was
the president of the NUS. I went back to a further education
college&#151;Cardonald college, on the south side of
Glasgow&#151;to have another shot at doing my school qualifications
part-time, and I remember the sheer diversity of that college, in the
mid-&#146;80s. Further education has played an enormous role, and
will continue to do so, in supporting people from all sorts of
backgrounds, particularly those with a disability and a fluctuating
mental health condition. I think back to that time, when the college
played a remarkable role in trying to intervene and improve
people&#146;s lives. Further education is not all about basket
weaving or recreational Japanese, as the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey, speaking for the new Conservative party, belatedly
acknowledges.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 52</div><a name="06101774000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000404"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am just going to bring the Minister back to the
debate for a moment. He mentioned disability, and one of the concerns,
which I am sure he will be able to address quickly, is that the draft
regulations, which he kindly sent to us before the Committee started,
have not been published in an accessible format. I wonder whether he
could look into that, because we have received indications that his
Department was unwilling to publish the draft regulations in an
accessible format. I am sure that that was an oversight, the simple
reason being that the whole Committee depends very much on the input of
disability organisations, with disabled people giving an important part
of that feedback. We would not want not to have that feedback on the
draft regulations.</div>
<a name="06101774000069"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000405"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman is entirely correct that we
must ensure a diversity of feedback. If the point that he raises is
genuine, I will of course look into
it.</div><a name="06101811000001"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000406"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Ruffley</b> (Bury St. Edmunds) (Con): On that point, the
publication of the Green Paper in an accessible form was delayed, so we
are not suggesting for a minute that the Department is not aware of the
issues. I received complaints that an accessible form of Green Paper
was not available at the time that everyone else had it, so perhaps the
Minister could share his thoughts on
that.</div><a name="06101774000349"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30
pm</div><a name="06101774000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000407"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I have already offered my thoughts on it. The hon.
Gentleman will be aware that we extended the consultation period on the
Green Paper for that very reason. That was the reasonable thing to do
at the time. Of course we as a Government and all public agencies must
continually find ways to ensure that our communications, our
conversations, our websites and our electronic communications touch the
lives of people, regardless of their experience and
background.</div><a name="06101774000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning
to the point about education, I should stress that education in its
various forms will be an important part of work-related activity as
envisaged in the Bill. The chance to reskill and retrain would be an
important part of work-related activity. It is our intention to bring
forward into the contributory and income-related allowances the
corresponding provisions from incapacity benefit and income support.
These rules currently mean that where someone has been sick or disabled
for more than 28 weeks they will normally be able to claim
income-related benefit while in full-time education. The Bill, as
drafted, would allow us to maintain the current position and we intend
to do just that.</div><a name="06101774000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
rules are intended to draw a distinction between short-term sickness
while in education, and education while in a period of long-term
sickness or disability. The Bill as currently drafted allows us the
flexibility to accommodate changes in the way that education is
provided and studies are funded. I realise that the amendment tabled by
the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey was a
probing amendment, so I will not make a substantial point about it.
However, it takes away some of that flexibility by seeking to insert
&#147;full time&#148; before &#147;education&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 53</div><a name="06101774000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">The nature of
income-related benefits is such that they need to take account of other
support that is available to people. That is why the provision relating
to the income-related strand of the benefit does not specify that it is
full-time education that is incompatible with receiving the benefit. We
have a provision allowing us to define the meaning of
&#147;education&#148; in regulations, as the hon. Gentleman is
aware.</div><a name="06101774000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
also want people to undertake education in respect of work-related
activity, and if necessary we can make adjustments to the rules through
regulations to ensure that the interface between education and
work-related activity is fit for purpose and makes possible the type of
thing that we all wish to see which we have already mentioned today. I
think that is the point that the hon. Member for Daventry wanted me to
address.</div><a name="06101774000075"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000408"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> The Minister said that that flexibility applies to
people on the income-related part of the ESA. Should that flexibility
not also apply to people on the contributions-related part? For
example, if someone with acquired brain injury from a very bad car
crash goes on a course, it might be a stepping-stone towards part-time
education and then full-time education. He or she may well be on the
contributions-based element of the ESA rather than the income-related
one. Should that flexibility not also apply to such a
person?</div><a name="06101774000076"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000409"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises a reasonable point. We
can continue our conversation about who has access to what aspect of
education and whether it is income-related or contributory. The
important point, which I made in my response to the hon. Member for
Daventry, is that we will take the flexibility to ensure that the
regulations can evolve through time in response to the changing nature
of education and the changing opportunities in information technology
and the changing demands of the customers of ESA, in terms of their
educational
aspirations.</div><a name="06101774000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
regulations will set out in more detail the policy, but the current
definitions of education for income support are in regulations and we
will bring forward what is currently in income support regulations<i class="I">,
</i>for example, in schedule 1. How will students be identified as
qualifying for income-related ESA while studying full-time? We will
define that in regulations. There will be consultation with the
organisations that one would expect about the draft regulations which
will be entirely appropriate. But we intend to bring forward the same
definitions as currently apply to disabled students. I think that will
reassure the hon. Gentleman on the specific point that he
raised.</div><a name="06101774000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said this
morning, Mr. Hood, our officials often write excellently
drafted and crafted speeches and they also write excellently drafted
and crafted paragraphs. I shall share one with the Committee and then
explain what I think it means. Paragraph 6(4) of schedule 1 provides
that we can treat a claimant as being in education when they are not
and a claimant who is in education as if they are not. I was puzzled by
that. To pre-empt questions from hon. Members, the paragraph is what is
generally regarded as a training provision and is standard in social
security legislation.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 54</div><a name="06101774000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again, to reassure hon. Members,
if someone is in education but we want to treat them as though they are
not, so that they can still claim income-related allowances, the power
in the paragraph enables us to do so. For example, if they are
undertaking approved training to enable them to evolve their skills and
career we would define them as not being in education for the purposes
of those ESA contributions. I hope that that reassures hon.
Members.</div><a name="06101774000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Specifically
on the points raised about prescribed places, I am advised that we
shall stipulate in regulations, following consultation, exactly what my
hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck) asked
about. I would be happy to see her take part in the conversation about
how we get those regulations just right.</div>
<a name="06101774000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">With that, I encourage the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, in the spirit in
which he tabled them, to consider withdrawing his probing amendments.
If there are additional specifics that need discussing, we can continue
that conversation as we consider the drafting of the regulations to
which I have already
alluded.</div><a name="06101774000082"></a>

Minister did not, however, answer my question about fee reductions and
waivers. Although he might not have an answer now&#151;I see from his
expression that he might not&#151;I should be grateful if he would
give the matter further consideration because it is important to ESA
recipients given the additional cost of some educational provision,
particularly that which might not be counted as work-related activity
in the way that he described. It would be useful to have some

about that.</div><a name="06101774000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">In

Robertson:</b> May I, too, welcome you to the Chair,
Mr. Hood? I know that your words of wisdom about temptation
will be taken on board by every Member, even myself. There are three
kinds of MP in the Room today&#151;the good, the bad and the weak. I
might be weak, but I am never bad, so I shall do my best to adhere to
your instructions.</div><a name="06101774000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
tabled my amendments in order to probe the Government and to tease out
some more information from them. Clause 2(1) deals with the amount of
contributory allowance<b class="B">. </b>The amount of the contributory ESA is
not set out in the Bill, but will be set out in regulations. Page 42 of
the Green Paper states that the additional amount for the work-related
activity group</div><a name="06101774000338"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will fix
the total received by a claimant at a rate above the current long-term
rate&#148;.</div><a name="06101774000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of the
support group it
continues:</div><a name="06101774000339"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;After
the assessment phase, they...will receive more money than they do
now.&#148;</div><a name="06101774000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that while we are asking people to take part voluntarily,
we look after them to ensure that they are not worse off and that we
protect the most vulnerable at all times. Under the IB scheme,
additional amounts can be paid if conditions are met. They are
age-related and adult dependent additions. The intention is that the
ESA will not contain those
additions.</div><a name="06101774000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure
that people on ESA are not worse off than on the current scheme and
taking the statements in the Green Paper to mean that no one will lose
out financially, the amount of contributory allowance must be at least
equal to the stated rate of the IB scheme, including any additions to
which they will be entitled; otherwise, the effect will be to push more
people into the means-tested element of ESA. That might be the
Government&#146;s wish and unless someone has come up with a better
way of assessing whether people need allowances, I appreciate that we
must go down the road of means-testing. I hope that the Minister can
assure me that the effect on those who most need help will be
considered individually.</div>
<a name="06101774000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion, these amendments
are small but the amount of money that people receive in cases of
hardship must be looked at and taken care of. These are probing
amendments because I want to hear from the Minister that the Government
will always consider the people who most need
help.</div><a name="06101774000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000415"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I want to speak briefly because the hon. Gentleman
has raised some interesting points. On the precise level of the
benefit, can the Minister confirm 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 56</div>whether he intends that people who go on to ESA on an income-related and
contributory basis will be given the same level of benefit? Obviously,
the income-related basis will take them up to a certain level of
income, but the intention is that that level should be the same. I am
concerned about minimising complexity in a system that is already
complicated.</div><a name="06101774000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
level of benefits and ensuring that people do not lose out, I notice
that the intention is that people on the support element of the package
will receive slightly more than those on the work-related element. It
is extremely welcome that people with the severest disabilities will be
given additional help, but it is also the Government&#146;s intention
that people should transfer from the support element of the package to
the work-related element. One case study in the regulations is of
someone who transfers from one to the other. Was there any evidence in
any of the pilots that people are deterred from transferring from the
support element to the work-related element because of the small
reduction in benefits? That would be of great concern as the purpose of
the Bill is to move people towards the world of
work.</div><a name="06101774000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000416"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> In response to the brief points that have been
fairly raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West
(John Robertson), as he said, the amendments refer to the rate of
benefit and we said throughout the process&#151;in the Green Paper
and since&#151;that all existing customers will have their rate of
benefit protected and new customers will have a higher rate of benefit
than the current long-term rate of incapacity
benefit.</div><a name="06101774000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
180 would introduce benefit rates into the Bill, but the
Government&#146;s commitment is about protecting rates for existing
claimants and putting future customers on a higher rate than the
current long-term IB
rate.</div><a name="06101774000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">There was an
important concession on benefit rates in the Green Paper. We had
initially intended to set a youth rate in the main phase. Not
unreasonably, representations from the TUC and others said that that
would be the wrong thing to do, so we announced that we would not be
introducing a youth rate in the main phase, which has been welcomed as
an important
concession.</div><a name="06101774000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
different rates will remain in the assessment
phase&#151;</div><a name="06101774000350"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.45
pm</div><a name="06101774000106"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000417"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b><b class="B"> </b>On the issue of rates for ESA, can the
Minister confirm that the level will be similar, not directly
equivalent, to the ESA that has been available through the pathways to
work pilot? Will it be at the same
level?</div><a name="06101774000107"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000418"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We have announced our intention that the ESA rate
will be above the current long-term IB rate. The hon. Gentleman would
not expect me to go further than that today but I shall make a couple
of points on the comments made by the hon. Member for South-West
Surrey. There remain three different rates in the assessment phase: one
for customers aged under 18; another for those aged 18 to 24; and
another for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 57</div>those of 25 and over. The reason for the assessment phase is to ensure
that the rates line up with jobseeker&#146;s allowance
rates.</div> <a name="06101774000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">We do not want
to make any assumptions during the assessment phase about a
person&#146;s capability, which is why we deliberately sought to
align benefit rates with the JSA rate in the three-month assessment
phase. That means that the customers who are not entitled to the
employment and support allowance can move back on to JSA at the
existing
rate.</div><a name="06101774000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the new age discrimination legislation shows, the Government are
committed to combating unfair treatment on the grounds of age; in the
case of benefit levels there are differentials because in general
younger people are likely to have fewer demands on their income. For
example, they are less likely to have dependants and more likely still
to be supported by their family. I acknowledge that those are
generalisations, but they have permeated the benefit system for many
years.</div><a name="06101774000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have said that no young people on incapacity benefit now will be worse
off under the employment and support allowance. I go further: we will
continue to make special provisions so that many young people can
access the contributory allowance even without meeting the national
insurance contribution conditions. That is a small measure in the Bill
but it is very important as it removes any unforeseen penalisation of
young people on the basis that they are unable to qualify for the
contributory allowance because of their
age.</div><a name="06101774000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are
introducing an entirely new structure for the ESA which moves away from
a system where benefit rises with the length of incapacity, which we
believe undermines incentives to return to work. We have made it clear
that existing customers&#146; benefit will be fully protected and the
new structure ensures that new customers will gain after the end of the
assessment phase. The allowance has a two-tier structure because it is
important to distinguish between those whom we would reasonably expect
to participate in work-related activity and those whom it would not be
reasonable to encourage to do
so.</div><a name="06101774000112"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure my hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West that we are determined not to
write anyone off but we recognise that some people on ESA will have
severe health conditions and disabilities, and they will need our
support. The existence of the support component will enable us to
provide extra financial support to those who suffer the most severe
conditions.</div><a name="06101774000351"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.49

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000419"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I was on the verge of drawing my comments to a
conclusion, having offered reassurance to my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West that the benefit rates of current customers will be
protected. In respect of new ESA customers the commitment will be above
the present long-term IBA rate, as I
said.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div><a name="06101774000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
turn briefly to two specific questions: the first was about the income
allowance and whether the contributory level will be the same. It is
our intention to set the contributory level and if a person on the
income allowance has no other income, it will of course be at the same
level. However, with the income allowance, as with other benefits, the
state will take additional income into account in any assessment. In
general, what was suggested was
correct.</div><a name="06101774000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
will discuss the second point on the existence of a support group a
little later, but the hon. Gentleman asked about the evidence provided
by pilot schemes. We had not set up the structure when we started the
pilots, so the structure will not be used with the new benefit until
2008, but our manifesto stated that we would provide additional
financial support to those with the most severe disabilities. We have
to structure that carefully so that we do not write anyone off. It is
important to ensure that that when creating a support group to support
those for whom there is no conditionality&#151;they will get a higher
level of benefit&#151;that we do not reintroduce a version of
incapacity benefit for a relatively small but important group of
people.</div> <a name="06101774000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">For example,
we are now considering how to ensure that those in the support
group&#151;it is based on a limited capacity of work, with
assessments being made through the severe disablement
allowance&#151;can nevertheless say that they do not want to be
written off; we are seeking to ensure that those folk can volunteer
for, and not be forced into, the support that is available to others.
We have worked through the details, but it is important to set out the
principle. Although there is no conditionality and people get a higher
rate of benefit, we also wish to say clearly to each individual in the
support group that they can volunteer for the appropriate support. That
is an important distinction when compared with incapacity benefit. I
hope that I have reassured the Committee.</div>
<a name="06101774000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">With those comments, and given
the tone in which my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West
moved the amendment, I encourage him to consider withdrawing
it.</div>
<a name="06101774000120"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000420"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his words. Needless
to say, I am convinced by his argument; however, I shall keep an eye on
future matters. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
</div><a name="06101774000121"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment, by

the&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000422"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss the
following amendments: No. 185, in
clause 2, page 2, line 22, leave
out &#145;are&#146; and insert
&#145;is&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">No.

in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000423"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> My intention is to probe the Government about
the rationale and structure of the two-tier benefit and the support
group, the criteria for 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>including people in the support group and how it is intended to work in
practice.</div>
<a name="06101774000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">Conceptually, at least, it is
an important point. In the context of our brief discussion on the
longer-term objective of simplifying the benefit system, serious
questions have to be asked about the justification for having a higher
rate of benefit for the support group. Is the Minister&#146;s
justification that it will replace some of the income lost because of
the likelihood of someone being on benefit for longer? Is it trying to
meet the extra costs that such a person might have because they suffer
a more severe impairment or condition? If it is the latter, might it
not make more sense simply to have one rate of ESA, and to provide the
additional support through the mechanism of the disability living
allowance? That would have the further benefit that the additional
amounts would be provided on an extra-cost basis and would not
necessarily be withdrawn when the person receiving them found
work.</div> <a name="06101774000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
longer-term objective is to move to a single working-age benefit,
having the two different rates will be an additional complication that
might not be necessary. The objective&#151;it is a good one&#151;of
meeting the extra costs of people who are more severely impaired or
disabled might better be met through the disability living allowance
system. That is food for thought for the Minister, and I invite him to
explain in full the rationale behind the two
components.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000424"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman not share my concern that
having the support level at a higher rate could have an unintended
consequence? Those who get on to the support level will want to protect
their position and will not want to risk going on to a lower level by
transferring to the work-related part of the package. Is that a cause
that drives him to move his amendment?</div>
<a name="06101774000131"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000425"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> There are two different unintended
consequences. The first is that which the hon. Gentleman describes, but
the difference between the support component and the work-related
activity is not only the level of benefit, but the level of obligation
or conditionality of that benefit&#151;the exchange for undertaking
or not work-related activity. Both could provide an
incentive.</div>
<a name="06101774000132"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000426"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> Is not there another difference? If a man or
woman were on the work-related component, they could access cognitive
behaviour therapy through condition management programmes and so on.
There would be a difference in the level of active
support.</div>
<a name="06101774000133"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000427"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> The hon. Gentleman anticipates a point I was
going to make. There are questions to be answered. The Minister said
that those people in receipt of the support component will have the
opportunity to opt in to employment support and other pathways aspects.
That is welcome, but will the Minister guarantee the same opportunities
for those who go into the support group, given the concern I expressed
this morning about the finance for the introduction of pathways to
work?</div>
<a name="06101774000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision
is calculated on the basis of assisting principally new claimants, not
necessarily &#147;the stock&#148;&#151;a ghastly term used in
such proceedings&#151;of claimants. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 60</div>Taking one step back, with new claimants in the support group, will the
Minister describe how it will work in practice? Will he assure the
Committee that resources will be available for those people in receipt
of the support components, so that they can take part in those
opportunities?</div>
<a name="06101774000135"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000428"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> As I interpret the hon. Gentleman&#151;and I
shall be grateful for his confirmation&#151;he fears that, with
reference to any point decision, Ministers might find it more
convenient to park persons in the support group and pay them off with a
higher allowance, rather than commit resources to their re-engagement
in the labour market. Ministers might also find it more convenient to
do similarly with new entrants, who would go on to the employment and
support allowance, leaving substantially untouched the historic cases
who are on incapacity benefit. Other members of the Committee might
share the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
fears.</div><a name="06101774000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000429"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am not so fearful about the first point. From
the Minister&#146;s tone, I genuinely do not think it his intention
to try to park people in the support group. When so many provisions are
left to regulations, however, there is the risk that a future
Minister&#151;from another party perhaps&#151;might see the
convenience of the point that the hon. Member for Daventry
outlines.</div> <a name="06101774000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
other hand, there is great uncertainty about the &#147;stock&#148;
of claimants, and how people from that group who end up in the support
group will access help, given the restricted funding on offer. First,
what is the conceptual basis for that distinction and the justification
for the different rates? Secondly, I should be grateful if the Minister
could flesh out the way in which the provision will work in
practice.</div> <a name="06101774000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
criteria for inclusion in the support group have not been provided, so
the Committee is being asked to endorse a division or distinction that
has not been outlined in detail, let alone rationalised. Will, for
example, the distinction between the support group and the work-related
activity group be determined principally on medical grounds, or by
other criteria? Will the Minister say something about that? With
reference to my earlier point, will other labour market disadvantages,
such as the refusal of employers to provide employment opportunities
for certain categories of people, be taken into account? I know that
several hon. Members have expressed particular concern about the
exclusion from the labour market of people with mental health problems.
Will other factors such as child care and care responsibilities be
considered when making the
distinction?</div>
<a name="06101774000353"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.15
pm</div><a name="06101774000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The question
that still has to be answered is how easy will it be in practice to
draw a clear dividing line through the operation of the revised
personal capability assessment. The decision as to whether someone
qualifies for the support group rather than the work-related activity
group will be taken very quickly in the PCA. That will determine
whether someone has to come back 10 minutes later for their
work-related, health-focused assessment to establish the amount of
work-related activity that they can 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>undertake. If we could hear a bit more, therefore, about the dividing
line and how it will be established in practice through the PCA, it
would be gratefully received.</div>
<a name="06101774000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps the
Minister could also say a bit more about the difference in income for
the support group, as against other ESA recipients. Will the increased
amount be determined on the basis of the likely duration of benefits or
extra support requirements? Importantly, how will the dividing line
work as regards people with fluctuating conditions? Several hon.
Members have mentioned such conditions and, depending on how the
dividing line is drawn in the PCA, it would be quite possible for
someone to be assessed one day and put in the support group, but to
turn up another day, when their condition was going through a better
phase, and end up in the work-related activity group. Clearly, that
would have substantial implications for the conditionality regime in
which that person might be engaged and for the income that they would
then receive.</div> <a name="06101774000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">For a
number of reasons, therefore, I am concerned about whether the
distinction is needed and, if it is, about how it will work in
practice. I would be grateful for the Minister&#146;s response before
I decide how to proceed on the amendments.</div>
<a name="06101774000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000430"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> I have just one point to make, which is of great
concern to me. It relates to those who suffer a mental health challenge
and, in particular, to mainstream sufferers with bipolar depression or
one of the various flavours of depression that are around, of whom
there are approximately 2 million to 3 million at any one time. There
is an enormous number of people in the variable groups that we are
discussing, and some within them&#151;particularly those with
depression&#151;are among the most vulnerable people in society. Will
the Minister clarify how the Bill will give due heed to the needs of
those people, whose conditions vary from day to day? That is my primary
concern in relation to these provisions.</div>
<a name="06101774000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000431"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I support several of the sentiments expressed by the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey. If we stand
back from the Bill, we see that there are some general themes. It is
important to think not only about the Government&#146;s intentions in
the Bill&#151;Conservative Members share many of them&#151;but
about what will happen in practice, when the Bill is implemented. When
we step back and take a helicopter view of the Bill, we see that there
is one group of people whom the Government consider it reasonable to
ask to look for work and then to work, and another group of whom they
do not consider it reasonable to make that request.</div>
<a name="06101774000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Bill,
the Government aim to solve the problem of those whom it is reasonable
to ask to look for work, and that is what the work-related component of
the ESA will do. The trouble is that the same opportunities do not
appear to have been made available to those whom it is not reasonable
to ask to look for work. The Bill is a huge opportunity not only for
those with milder disabilities, but for those with more severe
disabilities who are looking to it to give them the opportunity,
perhaps for the first time, to be included in the world of work. For
example, people with learning disabilities might require a huge amount
of coaching, and there 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 62</div>might need to be a huge amount of employer support. That is exactly the
kind of thing for which a pathways adviser would be perfect. We must be
careful that those kinds of people do not get parked.</div>
<a name="06101774000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
something good and something bad about what the Government have done.
The good thing is the statement by the Secretary of State that people
in the support
group</div><a name="06101774000340"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;will be able to
volunteer to participate in work-related activity and access all the
appropriate support available, but it will not be a condition of their
entitlement to any part of their benefit.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official
Report</i>, 24 July 2006; Vol. 449, c.
623.]</div><a name="06101774000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">In addition, the
explanatory notes to the Bill state:</div>
<a name="06101774000341"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the Government&#146;s intention
is that those receiving the support component should be able to
volunteer to take part in these if they wish to do
so.&#148;</div><a name="06101774000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is excellent but it is stated as being the Government&#146;s
intention only; that people in the support group should have a
statutory right to involve themselves in the work-related component is
not part of the primary legislation. That is important. We are talking
about people with severe disabilities, so it is not just a question of
saying, &#147;Here&#146;s the programme, volunteer for it if you
wish.&#148; For the programme to be meaningful for them, it is likely
to have to be a different type of programme from the ones being set up
for people with less severe disabilities. Such a programme is also
likely to want to draw on the resources of such specialist
organisations as Mencap, which have expertise in dealing with people
with more severe disabilities.</div>
<a name="06101774000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the programme is set up with
contractors who are geared up towards the larger group of people who
are nearer to the labour market and if that is all the funds will
stretch to, there is a risk of the people in the support group being
what the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey
described as &#147;parked&#148;. Unintentionally, that could be
exacerbated by people in the support group getting a higher rate
allowance than people in the work-related component. It might be
sensible to consider giving that extra help through other channels. I
would be grateful if the Minister would reflect on
that.</div>
<a name="06101774000149"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000432"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I agree with the argument that my hon. Friend is
making. Is he not also concerned that if the nature of the contracting
process into the private sector or voluntary providers is such as to
have a limited number of very large providers who are, as it were,
generalists, some of the specialist services for particular kinds of
disability, for example those in mental health, which may be required
by members of the support group will simply not be available through
the contractors who win the particular contract in that
area?</div><a name="06101774000150"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000433"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> As ever, my hon. Friend&#146;s experience shines
through his comments. He is right to say that there is a possible
danger in the way that these contracts are awarded. In the most
lucrative contracts, particularly if they are operated on a
payment-by-results basis&#151;whereby contractors get paid when they
manage to place someone in full-time employment&#151;the most
attractive client group from a financial point of view will obviously
be those nearest the labour market: that is, those with the less severe
disabilities. It is important that the structure of the contracts is
set up so that it does not inadvertently discriminate against people
with more severe disabilities.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 63</div><a name="06101774000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000434"></a><b class="B">Kali
Mountford</b> (Colne Valley) (Lab): I am worried about the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestions on two grounds. The first is that,
as he has just described, people who are usually described as
&#147;difficult to reach&#148; are difficult to reach. One
difficulty is people not being, and not willing to be, work ready. That
must be dealt with. A group of people who are not only not work ready
but who perceive themselves as never being work ready because of the
nature of their illness, and who are in addition fearful that we might
interfere in the living arrangements that they have established for
themselves, would be even more difficult to reach.</div>
<a name="06101774000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the things that perhaps
makes a person more capable of moving from one group to the other is
their willingness to change their circumstances. I understand what the
hon. Gentleman is saying about being
parked&#151;</div><a name="06101774000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000435"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid that the hon. Lady will have
to make her comments a little shorter than
that.</div>
<a name="06101774000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000436"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am grateful, Mr. Hood. The hon. Member
for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) makes an important point; we must
examine the motivations of individuals. One of my concerns is that, by
setting the support level slightly higher than the work-related level,
we inadvertently create a major disincentive for anyone in the support
group ever to want to transfer out of that group. Opposition Members
fully support giving more generous support to the people with the most
severe disabilities, but we ask whether this is the right mechanism by
which to do so.</div><a name="06101774000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put
it to the Government that if we go for the big goal&#151;making the
world of work more accessible even to the people with the most severe
disabilities&#151;and we have to have two groups of people, we need a
seamless transition between the two. The difference between the two
might be the conditionality&#151;the requirement to participate in
the programme, which is decided at the outset&#151;but at every stage
we want to encourage people in the support group to be willing to
transfer themselves into the work-related category so they do not feel
scared that they will lose &#163;5 a week or whatever from their
benefits if they do
so.</div><a name="06101774000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">All I am asking
the Government to do is to be as bold in their ambitions for the
support group as they are for the work-related group, because there is
a real opportunity to transform the lives of people with severe
disabilities. I accept that the Government have excellent intentions in
respect of this Bill, but there might be an unintended consequence
whereby that transformation does not
happen.</div><a name="06101774000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000437"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Again, we have heard a very interesting set of
contributions from a variety of hon. Members and again, with the
Committee&#146;s indulgence, I will save my excellent speech for
another time and simply respond to many of the points that were
raised.</div><a name="06101774000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked why we were
taking this approach. I alluded to this earlier. Again, it is a
generalisation but the people in the support group would be more likely
to be out of the labour market for a longer period, and the statistics
show that the longer people are on incapacity benefit, the less likely
they are, in general, to get into work.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 64</div><a name="06101774000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000438"></a>Adam
Afriyie:</b> The Minister points out that people who may move
into the support group have historically been supported for longer by
the state, but is that not partly because of the lack of treatments
available for people with mental health challenges? About 1 million
people on incapacity benefit have depression or anxiety disorder and it
is clear, with regard to the treatment recommended by the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, that cognitive-based
therapies would possibly lift half of them out of that predicament, so
I am just a bit concerned about the assumption that the Minister is
making that that situation cannot
change.</div><a name="06101774000160"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000439"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> That is not the impression that I gave or sought
to give, as I think the hon. Gentleman, when he reflects on the record
of the debate in <i class="I">Hansard</i>, will realise. It is just an assessment
of the reality of the unfortunate nature of incapacity benefit to say
that it rewards people financially for being on the benefit longer. The
hon. Gentleman scowls, but it does. It should not, but it does. That is

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000441"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The weakness in the current system is that it pays
people for being on the benefit longer, there is no parallel level of
support and, until now, there has not been pathways. We can have a
conversation about whether pathways is effective, as we would all like
it to be, and we will of course have that conversation as we go through
Committee, but I say gently to the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam
Afriyie) that pathways is the first initiative of its type that has
achieved the scale of success that it has for this group of customers,
who have had so many different and complicated experiences in their
lives. It is the first such initiative to deliver in that way that any
Government have managed to
introduce.</div><a name="06101774000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman has not been in the House long enough to make this
mistake, but it is my understanding that, when these issues arose in
relation to the Finance Bill and elsewhere, not everyone in his party
supported the additional investment that pathways has brought about,
the other labour market interventions that have brought about the
effectiveness of pathways, the new deal for the disabled, which goes
alongside that, or, indeed, all the new deal labour market
interventions. They are part of an overall strategy that can, if
everything is put together co-operatively across government, deliver
the success that all of us in Committee today seek, in principle, to
achieve.</div><a name="06101774000354"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.30
pm</div><a name="06101774000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I say again gently to the hon. Gentleman is that although it is fair to
say that not everything has been achieved, and we all acknowledge that,
there has been a remarkable increase in investment and real
determination in policy structure, sometimes in the face of fierce
opposition from other parties. That is simply a statement of recent
parliamentary history.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 65</div><a name="06101774000165"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000442"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I wish to put it on record that, as evidence of
our support on Second Reading, the principle of pathways and its
objectives and its results have so far received the unambiguous support
of my party. There are, of course, issues the Minister has alluded to
about how pathways can be made more effective but it is, as he would be
the first to admit, a work in progress. We agree the principle, but how
can we all make it better in the
future?</div><a name="06101774000166"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000443"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I accept and welcome what the hon. Gentleman says.
However, pathways is, of course, part of the support available to
people from different backgrounds and experiences, and those with
different disabilities are partly supported through the new deal for
disabled people. The Conservative Front-Bench team only recently
described the new deal as an expensive
flop.</div><a name="06101774000167"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000444"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I do not know the shadow spokesman to whom the
Minister is referring. However, in March, as <i class="I">Hansard</i> shows, I
made an intervention in which I said that the Conservative policy at
the last general election of scrapping all new deals and putting
nothing in their place was no longer our policy and was not something
the Department for Work and Pensions shadow team supports. There are
active market interventions that we support, but we just might not call
them new deal.</div>
<a name="06101774000168"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000445"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Thank you, Mr. Hood, for allowing us
this latitude and this gentle boxing&#151;and it is gentle compared
to what has happened before. Before I move on to something more
specific, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the Front-Bench
spokesperson I have in mind is someone he knows: it is his boss, the
shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for
Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr.
Hammond).</div><a name="06101774000169"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000446"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I hate to break up this debate about what the
policy of the Conservative party is today, entertaining a diversion
though it is, but before that diversion was entered into, the Minister
said something I agreed with very much. He said that on the one hand,
one of problems of the current structure of incapacity benefit is that
it offers people incentives to be on benefit for a longer period. On
the other hand, he said that the justification for having a higher rate
for the support group was that those people are likely to be on the
benefit for a longer period. Does the Minister think that is entirely
consistent?</div>
<a name="06101774000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000447"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I wonder whether I might be encouraged to make a
little progress because I am still trying to answer the first of the
many questions that were raised. My hon. Friend the Whip will I am sure
scowl shortly because we are not making as much progress as he
anticipated.</div>
<a name="06101774000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">The rationale
is simply that the longer someone is out of the labour market, the
greater the preponderance of poverty. We know that that is the nature
of people&#146;s experiences in this country. It is our assessment
that, in general, those people who go through the PCA and are assessed
as having the greatest limited capability for work should be in the
support group, and we should not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 66</div>demand any conditionality of them or force them to do something that in
many circumstances may indeed make their condition worse. We should not
force them even to go to interviews or into work-related activity, but
we should allow them time, if appropriate. Simply, we should not be
adding to the challenges that they face. However, neither should we
write them off, and that is why we have said that we will enable those
in the support group to volunteer.</div>
<a name="06101774000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I reassure the hon. Member for
South-West Surrey and others who raised this matter: if a customer in
the support group was to volunteer but say, &#147;I acknowledge what
you&#146;ve said about my condition, but I don&#146;t want to be
written off and treated the way people used to be treated when they
were on incapacity benefit. I want to volunteer for some of the support
that&#146;s available&#148;, we would say, &#147;Good.&#148;
Not only that, but we would say that the person could keep the higher
rate of benefit so that there were no perverse incentives to stay in
the support group: they can keep the higher rate of benefit without
going through the conditionality. It is important that, when someone is
objectively assessed and goes into a support group, no additional
hurdles to leaving that group voluntarily should be placed in their
way. Those two concessions are very
important.</div><a name="06101774000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000448"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> I am reassured by the Minister&#146;s comments,
but why, if that is so, does the primary legislation not mention that
people in the support group will have the right to volunteer for the
pathways
programme?</div><a name="06101774000174"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000449"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> We will, of course, make that clear in the
regulations. However, perhaps I can make some progress, with the
Committee&#146;s indulgence&#151;and in response to points that
have been made&#151;because there are various outstanding issues that
I have not had a chance to address
yet.</div><a name="06101774000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member
for Windsor asked about the safeguards that would be put in place. Some
of the safeguards are identified on page 6 of the draft regulations and
supporting materials, and we can discuss those as the Committee
progresses. The hon. Gentleman also asked quite reasonably why the
assessment cannot be a snapshot but has to be about understanding
someone&#146;s condition through a period of time. He is entirely
right. We will ensure that that is how we will give effect to the
reformed PCA. We will continue to provide work-focused interviews and
so on, which are not based on one moment of one day of one week. The
new PCA will try to capture, much better than the current PCA does, the
range of people&#146;s experiences, and it should reflect how
every day&#151;and for many people, every hour&#151;is often
different. Our approach has to be reflected in the way we treat people
in those
circumstances.</div><a name="06101774000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Daventry was uncharacteristically
negative&#151;although he is entirely entitled to be so&#151;in
suggesting that we will structure a system that will allow people to be
parked in the support group. I know that that is what used to happen.
People who were unemployed used to be parked on incapacity benefit.
That is why incapacity benefit numbers trebled and why in two years in
the 1980s 1 million people went on to incapacity benefit. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>For a Government, and a government system, incapacity benefit was seen
as an alternative to the unemployment claimant count. There is a
general acceptance that that is so. We can, if hon. Members wish, have
a conversation about whether or not that happened, but in structuring
this new benefit we do not want to recreate the sort of
system that led to what happened throughout large parts of the
1980s. We will ensure, through the way we structure contracts and
advice and through the way the PCA operates, that people cannot be
pushed into and get trapped in the support group, as the hon. Member
for Daventry rather uncharitably described
it.</div><a name="06101774000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other points were
raised about contracts and how we ensure that private and voluntary
sector providers are not incentivised simply on outcomes. Not all
pathways will be provided through the private and voluntary sectors; at
least one third will be provided through Jobcentre Plus, as in the
first roll-out. I have had conversations with those who have expressed
interest in providing this private and voluntary sector support to ESA
customers in future, and officials continue to discuss the matter with
them. We will structure the contracts so that people and organisations
are not just able to support those people who are easiest to support.
We will ensure that that does not happen, and it is appropriate that we
do
so.</div><a name="06101774000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
passing, there was an exchange in the Chamber about how we intend to
structure the contracts and the outcomes. I think we have settled on
about 70 per cent. outcomes-based funding in terms of reward for the
private and voluntary sector. Those on the Conservative Front Bench
were arguing for 100 per cent. outcomes-based
funding.</div>
<a name="06101774000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000450"></a>Mr.
Ruffley</b> <i class="I">rose&#151;</i></div>
<a name="06101774000180"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000451"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course, because I made that comment I shall
allow the hon. Gentleman to
respond.</div><a name="06101774000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">On balance,
we thought that 100 per cent. outcomes-based funding would not enable
smaller organisations, charities and the voluntary sector to get the
necessary investment to set up the infrastructure to provide these
contracts. Frankly, 100 per cent. outcomes-based funding would provide
unreasonable advantage to those established, large private voluntary
sector organisations, although they have an important part to play. It
would be a mistake and would prevent smaller organisations from being
able to provide the niche support that we all wish to be
provided.</div><a name="06101774000182"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000452"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> We will make a fuller announcement on that point,
but&#151;I hope that hon. Members will take at face value my good
faith on this&#151;our proposition was never for a 100 per cent.
payment-by-results system. I do not have time in an intervention to set
this matter right, but we will discuss this later in our debates. The
30 per cent. guaranteed fee, which I believe the Minister has spoken to
contractors about, will clearly be necessary for a lot of niche and
smaller
providers.</div><a name="06101774000183"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000453"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000454"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I do not want to have to start telling
Members off for being disrespectful to those who are addressing the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000455"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Mr. Hood, this Committee has 16
sittings; I wonder whether we will have 16 separate policies from the
Conservative Front-Bench team. Like my hon. Friend the Member for
Glasgow, North-West, I wonder how many will last the entire 16
sittings.</div><a name="06101774000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
I can say to the hon. Gentleman&#151;again gently&#151;is that it
was his boss, the shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who
pushed me on 100 per cent. outcomes on the Floor of the House not long
ago. That was certainly the impression that was then created. I will
look again at <i class="I">Hansard</i>, and we will, I am sure, return to this
point in future
sittings.</div><a name="06101774000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000456"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I think that <i class="I">Hansard</i> will demonstrate that
the shadow Secretary of State was talking about a 100 per cent. system
tied to existing claimants, and that he was talking about a very
specific part of the target audience. It will be my pleasure to discuss
the <i class="I">Hansard</i>
report.</div><a name="06101774000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000457"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I am not sure that Mr. Hood will allow
that.</div><a name="06101774000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000458"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I advise Front-Bench Members that I do
not want us to go over history, previous speeches and what is in
<i class="I">Hansard</i>. I ask the Minister to return to the Bill and address
the amendment that we are debating so that we can let the business
proceed.</div><a name="06101774000190"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000459"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Of course, Mr. Hood. I am drawing my
remarks to a conclusion, but I want first to respond to a couple of the
points raised by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey. I know that he is concerned about pathways and funding for
pathways, and I seek to reassure him. We have made it clear that the
future contracting model for the roll-out of private and voluntary
sector pathways will, to a large extent, be based on the current
contracting model. It will not be pathways on the cheap, because that
investment in pathways and the national roll-out of pathways by 2008 is
absolutely essential if the measures we are considering are to be made
a reality on the ground. It is a fundamental principle of the Bill that
it will be underpinned by the national roll-out of pathways properly
funded in a way that can provide support to people with learning
disabilities, which the current system does not, and with mental or
physical health conditions. I hope that that reassures the hon.
Gentleman and that I can tempt him to withdraw his
amendment.</div>
<a name="06101774000191"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000460"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for that
response. He explained his justification for having a higher rate for
the support group. I am not convinced that that necessarily justifies
paying the higher rate of benefit through the ESA system, but I accept
the justification for paying a higher rate of benefit to people in the
category that he described. I am not sure that the disability living
allowance system might not be a more effective way of doing that, but I
do not want to press that point.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 69</div><a name="06101774000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister did not address my points about how the division between the
support group and the work-related activity group would work through
the PCA. I know that we do not have the regulations before us, but I
would be grateful if he would say a bit more about how that distinction
will work in practice when someone goes into the assessment. How will
it be decided whether someone is in one group or another? That is
crucial. Subject to receiving that assurance, I will, of course, be
happy to follow the Minister down the tempting line he offered and
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06101774000355"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45
pm</div><a name="06101774000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000461"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Committee members have the details of the revised
PCA, which sets out how we would deal with the important issues raised
by the hon. Gentleman. The new PCA discusses in great detail mental
health descriptors and how it will take account of learning
disabilities; the current PCA does not take account of
them.</div><a name="06101774000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that I shall reassure the hon. Gentleman by telling him that we
intend to pilot the reformed PCA alongside the existing one. We are
starting that work now, over a two-week period. Current customers will
be assessed against both the existing and new draft PCAs to ensure that
we have the details right, that we have not inadvertently created
unintended consequences or perverse incentives and that there is not an
entirely divergent outcome; the existing customer will be sitting in
front of an Atos Origin doctor. Our intention is to ensure that the
revised PCA delivers the outcomes that we want in respect of learning
disability and mental illness. At a later point, we shall consult
further on how the PCA will
operate.</div><a name="06101774000195"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000465"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I am still trying not to be weak,
Mr. Hood, although it was difficult during the last
contributions.</div><a name="06101774000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
Nos. 174 to 179 are to do with the assessment phase. They are probing
amendments; I intend to tease from the Government more information
about how we can help those who most need it. The amendments would
ensure that young people were not discriminated against during the
assessment phase and that sick and disabled persons received the
appropriate support from the beginning of their claim, rather than from
the end of the fixed assessment phase.</div>
<a name="06101774000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">The issue of the 13-week
assessment period and the problems that would ensue during it was
raised by a number of hon. Members on Second Reading. In their Green
Paper and consultation report, the Government accepted that they did
not intend to penalise young people by aligning the basic rates of
main-phase ESA with jobseeker&#146;s allowance rates. That was
mentioned previously, and it is reflected in the Bill. However, young
people appear to be penalised during the assessment phase, as the
holding benefit is paid in line with JSA rates. That discrimination
will leave some sick and disabled people with inadequate incomes for
three months, simply because of their age.</div>
<a name="06101774000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would also
remove the requirement for the assessment phase to have ended before
the work-related activity or support component is paid. The Bill
proposes that those who can be immediately identified as severely
disabled and eligible for the support group will receive only JSA rates
for the first three months of their claim&#151;substantially below
what might be their real entitlement.</div>
<a name="06101774000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would enable all
claimants who subsequently pass the personal capability assessment to
go on to the main phase of ESA and receive the appropriate financial
support from the start of the claim, rather than from the end of the
13-week period. The Bill proposes that such people will be paid only
JSA rates for those 13 weeks; they are well below the financial support
required by sick and disabled pensioners and could increase poverty and
social exclusion. As I said earlier, many colleagues raised the 13-week
assessment period on Second Reading. It is of concern not just to them
but to many of the groups that have aided and abetted us. It is time
that I mentioned some of them. The Child Poverty Action Group,
Disability Alliance, Citizens Advice, Citizens Advice in Scotland, CPAG
in Scotland, Barnardo&#146;s, Poverty Alliance and Margaret Blackwood
Housing 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column70" />Column number: 71</div>Association all associate themselves with the amendments. A broad range
of concerned bodies have made these
suggestions.</div><a name="06101774000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Is it not
unfair that people who will be rewarded should have to wait 13 weeks
for an assessment as to whether they are entitled to money that they
should get? They may experience payment problems or have to live in
poverty for that length of time only because of their age and
disability. What kind of help or assistance will be given to those who
find themselves in debt because of their age or the assessment? I hope
that my hon. Friend will answer those
points.</div><a name="06101774000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000466"></a>Mr.
Hunt:</b> Briefly, I believe that the hon. Member for Glasgow,
North-West makes an important point. Has the Minister done any analysis
of whether it would be expensive to set up an assessment process that
took only four weeks rather than 13? Given the number of claimants,
getting people through the system more quickly might not involve any
extra cost, and then we could avoid some of the problems that the hon.
Gentleman described. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment
on
that.</div><a name="06101774000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000467"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I would like to express my support for the
amendments that the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West tabled and the
points that he made. They are important, particularly in respect of the
younger group of
claimants.</div><a name="06101774000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The group
also contains amendments that my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil
(Mr. Laws) and I tabled to get further clarification on some
related issues. I shall take a couple of minutes to describe them and
to ask the Minister for further reassurance or
clarification.</div><a name="06101774000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
amendments Nos. 3 and 6, I should be grateful if the Minister would
explain a bit more about the scope of the powers given in clauses
2(2)(c) and 4(4)(c) to prescribe conditions for qualifying for income
and contribution-based employment and support allowance. What
qualifying criteria will and will not be set beyond
those</div><a name="06101774000342"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;relating to
health, disability or capability for work-related
activities&#148;,</div><a name="06101774000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">if any? For
example, will replacement of the PCA take into account labour market
disadvantages? Is the power that is set out in the clauses intended to
be used in that
way?</div><a name="06101774000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendments
Nos. 4 and 7, I should be grateful if the Minister would say a little
more about the use of delegated legislation. Will it be limited to the
regulations made under clauses 10 to 15, which deal with
conditionality? If not, what else is intended by the
powers?</div><a name="06101774000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">With amendment
No. 202, we are trying to provide an opportunity for backdating ESA
payments to the start of the claim. This follows on from the point made
by the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West that the Bill allows
backdating to a maximum of the 13-week period, but if someone&#146;s
case has taken longer than 13 weeks to process, for whatever reason,
there is no provision to allow backdating to the date of the claim.
Amendment No. 202 would provide powers to allow the Secretary of State
to specify a date earlier than the 13-week period in cases where that
is necessary. That 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 72</div>backdating power does not provide any additional incentive for people to
apply for the benefit over jobseeker&#146;s allowance, because the
backdating takes place only once a decision about a person&#146;s
eligibility for the benefit has been made. The intention is merely to
ensure that someone who has perhaps been subjected to a delay in the
assessment period of longer than 13 weeks is not disadvantaged unduly
by how the Bill is currently
phrased.</div><a name="06101774000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In amendment
No. 202 we deal specifically with the contributory allowance, but
similar points could be made in relation to the income-based allowance
too. I hope that the Minister can set my mind at rest on those points,
particularly in relation to amendment No. 202, which the Government
might wish to bring forward themselves, to ensure that the point is
taken into account.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000468"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I support amendments Nos. 222, 50 and 223, which
stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends, and amendments Nos. 4
and 7, which stand in our names and those of the Liberal
Democrats.</div> <a name="06101774000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 222 is designed to simplify and clarify the conditions to
entitlement for the support component of contributory ESA and would
delete subsection (2)(c). The conditions of entitlement for the support
component of contributory ESA are set out in clause 2. They are that a
claimant has been assessed and found to have</div>
<a name="06101774000343"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;limited capability for
work-related
activity&#148;,</div><a name="06101774000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">which would
seem to be sufficient. From the claimant&#146;s point of view those
conditions are pretty transparent and fairly easily understood, one
hopes.</div> <a name="06101774000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
subsection (2)(c), which amendment No. 222 would delete,
refers to additional conditions, but it is difficult to envisage what
additional conditions the Secretary of State might wish to prescribe in
relation to the support component and claimants of it. It is not
possible to assess the desirability of any such conditions referred to
in subsection (2)(c) without a better idea from the Minister of exactly
what those conditions might be. What do Ministers potentially intend?
Amendment No. 222 therefore invites the Minister to clarify what
additional conditions may be prescribed. Because of its importance, we
would press amendment No. 222 to a vote if such clarification was not
forthcoming from the Minister.</div>
<a name="06101774000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the interests of dispatch, I
can say that corresponding deletions on the same logic that I have
outlined would be made by amendment No. 223 in relation to
income-related ESA for those on the support component, by amendment No.
4 in relation to those claimants of the work-related components of
contributory ESA, and by amendment No. 7 in relation to work-related
component claimants who have income-related ESA. The point in those
four cases, which are all analogous, is to seek clarification and
elucidation from the
Minister.</div><a name="06101774000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 50 stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry, and nobody else. It would insert a new subsection (4)(d), to
the effect that regulations
may</div><a name="06101774000344"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;prescribe
circumstances in which paragraph (b) of subsection (2) is not to
apply&#148;.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 73</div><a name="06101774000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The purport of amendment No. 50 is so
great that I am sure the Minister and his colleagues have thought about
it. It is to allow ESA claimants to move from the work-related activity
component to the support component after a period during which they
have not progressed toward work through work-related activity. Let us
say that for all the best efforts of those who have been lending
support, the condition management programme&#151;or the training or
voluntary work, or whatever the work-related activity might
be&#151;has not resulted over a long period in a placement in full or
part-time work, as the claimant and all of us would wish, and the
person realises that they
are&#151;</div><a name="06101774000356"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000469"></a>Alison
Seabeck:</b> I have a question. You refer to a long period of
time. Do you have a particular fixed period in
mind?</div><a name="06101774000232"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B">The
Chairman:</b> Order. The hon. Lady should not be asking me questions.
She should be asking the hon. Gentleman
questions.</div><a name="06101774000233"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000470"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I hope that the hon. Lady will not think that I
am avoiding the question by saying that I do not have a number in mind,
but it would be a long period, as judged by the personal adviser and by
the claimant themselves, in which work-related activity was not likely
to get that person into work. It could be a year, 18 months or two
years in which the condition was not susceptible to work-related
activity. In that hypothetical case, the higher rate of the support
component would be judged by the personal adviser and the claimant to
be a more appropriate part of
ESA.</div><a name="06101774000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am advised by the Child Poverty Action Group, the Royal National
Institute of the Blind, Action for Blind People and other groups that
departmental officials have briefed them this year that claimants who
have not progressed toward work after undertaking work-focused activity
for some time&#151;I shall not put a number on it&#151;could be
moved into what is described as a self-managed phase of ESA. I should
be grateful for the Minister&#146;s elucidation of what that might
mean in practice. We tabled the amendment because we share the fear
that those with disabilities might be sidelined after time, with
serious help and support re-prioritised to newer claimants who might be
nearer the labour market.</div>
<a name="06101774000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">Were that to occur, it would
mean that claimants would be stuck, for want of a better word, at the
lower rate of benefit in the work-related component, even if it were
understood that that would not work for them. Even worse, they might be
sidelined from getting the higher rate in the support group, where they
should be and where they and the personal adviser felt that they should
be.</div><a name="06101774000236"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000471"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Is it clear to my hon. Friend&#151;it is not
completely clear to me&#151;whether there is a free-standing right to
apply for a fresh capability assessment? Even if that were established,
would it not be a rather long-winded way of making the entirely
reasonable changes he is advancing, as against an agreed and consensual
change of status?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 74</div><a name="06101774000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000472"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> My hon. Friend anticipates me. The Minister could
well have a good answer. Logically, based on the clauses that we will
come to in the next few days, there could be a reassessment on the
request of a personal adviser and a claimant. It is not clear to me
that rights in the Bill will meet the case of the hypothetical
recipient of the work-related activity component who believes that it
will not work for them, that a route back into work will not happen
through work-related activity and that they need higher support. But
how will they get it? Will they not be between two worlds? How do they
access the support component without getting a rapid assessment and, I
suggest, a right to self-assessment, when all agree that the support
component is likely to be the more appropriate one for them?</div>
<a name="06101774000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not know whether the
answer is the prescription of circumstances, which is the meat of the
amendment and is for Ministers to outline, or whether provision is made
elsewhere in the Bill for a rapid reassessment for someone in that
situation. I ask in a spirit of good faith and general inquiry, even
though the problem might not apply to many people. It is more than a
theoretical possibility and it would be useful to hear the
Minister&#146;s thoughts on
it.</div><a name="06101774000239"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000473"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> A number of points have been raised, and I shall
again seek to address as many of them as possible. The amendments cover
various matters relating to clause 2 and also touch upon the provisions
in clause 4 on the structure of the contribution
allowance.</div><a name="06101774000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of the
amendments are on the conditions of entitlement to work-related
activity and the support components of the allowance. They would either
remove our ability to prescribe further conditions of entitlement, or
limit the conditions to those relating to the health or disability of a
customer. We currently have no specific intention to prescribe further
conditions of entitlement, but the power to do so in future is
essential to enable us to respond to new developments and to make
changes in light of the operational experience of ESA and the success
and lessons of the national roll-out of pathways. That flexibility will
be crucial as we learn from the experiences of pathways, build on what
has worked in the ESA system and identify what has not worked as well
as we had expected. We need to be able to take account of societal
changes and changes in the make-up of the ESA customer base. Failure to
do so could result in entitlement to the support component for
customers for whom it was not designed. Conversely, the benefit could
be denied those to whom we wish to make it
available.</div><a name="06101774000241"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000474"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I hear what the Minister is saying, but will he
give more examples of circumstances that he believes might require
flexibility on the part of the Secretary of State? I understand his
point on the need for flexibility, but in relation to what is it
needed?</div><a name="06101774000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000475"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I seek to make no party point, but I imagine that
if we had had this conversation only five or 10 years ago and were
designing regulations and benefit entitlements, we would not have
foreseen the growth that there has been in fluctuating mental health
conditions, which have become common among 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column74" />Column number: 75</div>incapacity benefit claimants. Some 40 per cent. of claimants are now
coming into the incapacity benefit scheme as a consequence of such
conditions. There have been societal changes such as the introduction
of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which places employment in a
different legal context. There has been a change in the governmental
and cross-party perception of the role that those with learning
disabilities can have in the labour market. We would not have been able
to predict the extent of such changes 10, 15 or 20 years ago. We
therefore need flexibility in the Bill to enable us to take account of
any further changes in family structure, trends in health and poverty
and all sorts of other trends such as those in the past 15 years that
we could not have anticipated. I offer that as a reasonable point
without apportioning party political blame or responsibility for
changes. I hope that that addresses the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
point.</div><a name="06101774000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second set
of amendments in the group is on the assessment phase. As I said on
clause 1, that phase is key to the structure of the new allowance. It
is important to assess all customers, not just those in the younger age
bracket. We want to avoid making assumptions about any individual until
they have been through the personal capability assessment. I know that
my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West offers us a probing
amendment to tease out the Government&#146;s thinking, but someone
should be entitled to the ESA not at the point of application but at
the end of the assessment phase. We have set that at 13
weeks&#151;three months&#151;based on our experience of what we
think has worked in the pathways to work programme and the way in which
we have been able to support people.</div>
<a name="06101774000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">We think that that assessment
phase is important and we also believe that it should be a standard
length. We have returned to the second basic principle of ESA, which is
that there should be a national set of rules and regulations. It would
be unfair for some people to move to the higher rate of benefit earlier
than others because of a geographic or postcode lottery based on how
quickly the assessment can take place.</div>
<a name="06101774000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wonder whether by offering
that assurance to my hon. Friend I can tempt him to withdraw his
amendment. If the assessment phase takes longer than 13 weeks, not
because of the actions of the customer but because of problems at DWP,
Atos Origin, or the health service, or because of any other
circumstance outside the reasonable control of the claimant or
customer, we will backdate to that point. So, if the assessment phase
were to last 16 or 17 weeks because of pressures in the health service
or a lack of availability of other advice, we would certainly backdate
to the 13-week limit so that people would not be punished through a
postcode lottery. It is important to put that on the record.</div>
<a name="06101774000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of
amendment No. 50, our general approach is that people should be in the
support group based on an objective assessment through a PCA. We have
had the conversation about labour market disadvantage. The PCA should
be a medical assessment of their functional capability and what they
can still contribute to the labour market. It would not be right to put
an arbitrary time limit on that commitment and to say that, after a
certain point, we will allow, in some instances, the reinvention of
incapacity benefit. We are determined 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 76</div>to ensure that people should not be written off wholesale. We should not
say, &#147;You should not be written off&#151;unless we have tried
really hard for six, nine, 12 or 18 months. Gosh, we have not been able
to help you. You have been passported, now enter the support
group&#148;. That is not the right way to go about things.</div>
<a name="06101774000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an alternative,
however, which is to allow additional PCAs. If the condition changes,
the revised PCA is a much better way of dealing with the matter. It
will primarily be based on medical advice that the circumstances have
changed. At that point, someone in the work-related activity group
could be assessed in their revised PCA so that they go into the support
group, and, to be truthful, that could happen the other way
round.</div>
<a name="06101774000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000476"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Will the Minister hazard a guess as to the
proportion of such cases that is likely to come along, and the amount
of resources that will be required in order to conduct the repeat
PCAs?</div><a name="06101774000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000477"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> Gentle as the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
encouragement is, I shall not be tempted to hazard a guess at the
specific number or the cost. It should be based not on an arbitrary
Government target, but on the objective medical assessment of each
individual. For us to set an arbitrary target nationally and to say
that Atos Origin must ensure that 4 per cent., 7 per cent., 11 per
cent., 1 per cent. or any percentage of folk should go into the support
group, be taken out of it or be put into it from the work-related
activity group after a second PCA is a wrong-headed way of looking at
it. It is about an individual objective assessment of someone&#146;s
capability, and that is the way in which people would change between
one and the other.</div>
<a name="06101774000250"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000478"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> On amendment No. 50, although not on amendment
No. 222 and the related amendments, the Minister is satisfying me. Will
he nail this point down for me? In the example I gave of someone who is
in the work-related activity component but wishes to try to move onto
the support component, what would be the mechanics of getting a new
assessment? Would there be a right to it and how quickly could it be
done? In other words, how could a new PCA be done and what rights would
the individual have?</div>
<a name="06101774000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000479"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> One of the weaknesses in the incapacity benefits
system is that the gap is far too long. We say that it is about three
years, but in truth there is great variation across it. In saying that
I mean no disrespect to the folk at Atos Origin, who are working very
hard and who have improved their operations in recent
years.</div><a name="06101774000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but my response is
similar to the one that I gave his hon. Friend the Member for Daventry:
we do not wish to set an arbitrary target. If, based on a medical
assessment, someone&#146;s condition is considered to have improved,
or deteriorated, it is then that it is appropriate to have a new PCA,
rather than after nine months, or 14 months and three days, or anything
of that nature. It should not be time limited&#151;it should vary
based on the individual.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 77</div><a name="06101774000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman warmly

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000481"></a>Mr.

my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West, and I shall happily
respond during that
debate.</div><a name="06101774000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have reassured the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr.
Ruffley) on clause 50. We recognise that there are some customers who
may not demonstrate the level of functional limitation that would place
them in the support group, but for whom the support group is still the
most appropriate group. That is why we have taken the powers in
paragraph 9(a) of schedule 2, so that in prescribed circumstances we
can treat people as having limited capability for work-related
activity. That brings us to the point that was raised by my hon. Friend
the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. David), which we shall
discuss with the next set of
amendments.</div><a name="06101774000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power
to prescribe such circumstances is similar to the power that we have
taken in other legislation. For example, the Child Support, Pensions
and Social Security Act 2000 incorporated section 44A into the Social
Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. It was used in 2001 and
it came into force in 2002. It is important to have the power to
implement flexibly, in the light of circumstances&#151;whether
concerning the workplace or societal or legislative attitudes&#151;so
as not to have to revisit primary legislation within a very short time
in the light of changes and trends in society. Given those comments and
that rationale, I encourage Opposition Members not to press their
amendments.</div><a name="06101774000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000482"></a>Mr.
Ruffley:</b> I take on board the Minister&#146;s remarks
about amendment No. 50, and I am happy not to press it. Nevertheless, I
know that there is concern among Opposition Members about having such
open-ended powers. Societal changes happen, but the prospect of
Ministers having powers in their hands without having to come back to
the House of Commons to justify what is a sensitive area of public
policy means that I shall seek to press amendment No. 222 and the
related amendments.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000500"></a>John

clause 2, page 2, line 43, at

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000501"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment No. 140, in clause 2, page 3, line 2, at end
insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(6) For the
purposes of this Part, the assessment phase for a person who is
terminally ill as prescribed through regulations will be no longer than
one
month.&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000284"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000502"></a>John
Robertson:</b> These are emotive amendments and the issues are
always difficult to deal with, but they are extremely important. The
amendments are possibly more important than any others I have spoken to
today. They are in my name, that of my hon. Friend the Member for
Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown) and others and their aim
is to include in the support group patients undergoing cancer treatment
and those with terminal illnesses. We want those undergoing active
treatment to be included in the support group for a minimum of 12
months.</div> <a name="06101774000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">At this
point, I want to thank Macmillan Cancer Support and many others who
have assisted, including the Disability Benefits Consortium. There are
too many names to read out, but I particularly want to thank Macmillan
Cancer Support, not simply on a personal level for the help that it has
given many members of my family who unfortunately had cancer but for
its help in drawing up these
amendments.</div><a name="06101774000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome
the inclusion of terminally-ill people in the support group and the
commitment to achieving that through paper-based assessment rather than
requiring a face-to-face medical assessment. Not all patients
undergoing active debilitating cancer treatments are included in the
support group. I also welcome the inclusion of the majority of people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column78" />Column number: 79</div>undergoing chemotherapy treatment in the support group. However, I am
concerned that the regulations as drafted do not cover all patients
undergoing active seriously debilitating cancer treatment. In
particular, I feel that it would be of value to ask the Minister
whether the Government intend to treat patients undergoing oral
chemotherapy as having limited capability for work as they are not
included in the draft regulations on certain persons to be treated as
having limited capability for work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06101774000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will patients undergoing
radiotherapy be treated as having limited capability for work-related
activity? Will patients undergoing or recovering from major surgery for
a serious or life-threatening illness, such as cancer, be treated as
having limited capability for work-related activity? It is not clear
for how long people undergoing active treatment would be included in
the support group, so it would be valuable to clarify for how long
people would be included in the support group before being subject to
review. The wording of the draft regulations suggests that they would
be included during chemotherapy treatment and it is felt that
12 months to allow for several months of treatment and a period of
recovery is a reasonable fixed period after which to review support
group status for these claimants. It may be helpful to note that our
support for inclusion in the support group for a fixed period of 12
months of someone undergoing or recovering from chemotherapy or
radiotherapy or major surgery is based on advice from clinician
Professor Jane Maher, chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support
and consultant clinical oncologist at Mount Vernon cancer centre at
Hillingdon hospital, where she has worked for the past 20 years with
Dr. Gareth Tuckwell, medical director of Hospice in the Weald, Kent and
a member also of the Macmillan board of
trustees.</div><a name="06101774000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">Further
evidence, if it is needed, of the distress caused by the current poor
implementation of discretion, comes from Macmillan benefit advisers who
have encountered a number of cases in which Jobcentre Plus staff have
imposed inappropriate attendance requirements or conducted focus
interviews with seriously ill patients. I believe that Macmillan has
provided the DWP with some case studies. I shall read out only one so
that members understand its train of thought.</div>
<a name="06101774000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">In September 2005, a Macmillan
benefits adviser in the west of Scotland was advising a terminally ill
client attending a hospice and receiving disability living allowance
under special rules. The client needed to make a new claim for IB so
the adviser telephoned the Glasgow Jobcentre Plus office on their
behalf to say that the client was bed bound, but the official refused
to waive the interview. Instead, the official sent out a visiting
officer. On arrival at the hospice, it quickly became obvious to the
officer that the client was seriously ill, and unfortunately the client
has since
died.</div><a name="06101774000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
140 concerns fast-tracking those with a terminal illness. The aim is
for all people with a terminal illness, including new claimants, to be
fast-tracked to the support group through a swift and simple
paper-based assessment. There are concerns about the draft regulations.
We welcome the inclusion of terminally ill people in the support group
and the commitment to achieving this through paper-based assessment
rather than face-to-face medical 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 80</div>assessments, as is currently the case. However, it is not clear whether
terminally ill people will be able to access the support group
quickly.</div> <a name="06101774000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
it is not clear from the draft regulations and support material whether
the DWP intends to fast-track the claims of terminally ill people. We
feel that that would be valuable in clarifying certain matters. For
instance, how long will a new, terminally ill claimant have to wait
before being included in the support group? As stated previously, we
feel that one month is a realistic and appropriate length of time. They
should not have to spend 13 weeks on a low-rate JSA. Furthermore, how
long will an existing claimant, receiving the work-related activity
component who then becomes terminally ill, have to wait before being
included in the support
group?</div><a name="06101774000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that my
hon. Friend the Minister is sympathetic to my amendments and my
concerns, and I ask him on this occasion to accept them, or at least to
draft his own to satisfy the points that I have
raised.</div><a name="06101774000293"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000503"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I would like to speak briefly in support of the
amendments and the remarks by the hon. Gentleman on the inclusion of
terminally ill people in the support group and the introduction of the
fast-tracking procedure for them. The fast-tracking procedure exists
for terminally ill people&#151;those with six months to
live&#151;to be fast-tracked to the higher level of disability living
allowance or attendance allowance under the special rules process, so
it ought to be fairly straightforward for a similar process to be put
in place for the employment and support allowance as
well.</div><a name="06101774000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">Likewise, the
idea that someone who is terminally ill might be placed in the
work-related activity component and therefore be expected to attend
work-focused interviews and, potentially, other activities related to
that component, under the possible threat of conditionality, simply
does not bear thinking about. In that spirit, I hope that that Minister
will accept the
amendments.</div>
<a name="06101774000359"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30
pm</div><a name="06101774000295"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000504"></a>Mr.
David:</b> My apologies for jumping the gun earlier,
Mr. Hood. I want to reinforce what has been said. This is a
difficult, sensitive issue, but many people understandably feel
strongly about it, and I want to make one additional point. At present,
where the prognosis is that someone is likely to live for six months,
there is a fast-track procedure under the special rules process for the
higher level of disability living allowance or attendance allowance. A
precedent has therefore been set, and it would be extremely useful and
well received if a similar principle were applied to the new allowance.
Many people are concerned about the present situation, and it would be
helpful to have some clear indications from the Minister. If he is not
able to accept the precise wording suggested by my hon. Friend the
Member for Glasgow, North-West, I hope that he will be able to suggest
alternative wording that would be
acceptable.</div>
<a name="06101774000296"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000505"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I thank my hon. Friends for the way in which they
have made their case. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow,
North-West said, this is a highly sensitive issue and he was not
deprecating his previous 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 81</div>amendments when he said that these are the most important amendments
that he has tabled thus far. Hon. Members on both sides of the House
know that there is hardly a family that has not been touched by cancer
at some point, so it is quite appropriate that my hon. Friends have
raised this important issue.</div>
<a name="06101774000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the amendments, our general
view is that an individual who is found to have limited capability for
work-related activity will be placed in a support group, as we have
said. People in the support group will not have to participate in
work-focused interviews or undertake work-related activity as a
condition of receiving ESA. However, we accept that there are
circumstances in which it would be sensible to allow entry to the
support group, even if the individual did not have limited capability
for work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06101774000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph 9
of schedule 2 allows us to set out in regulations provisions to treat
certain groups of people as automatically having limited capability for
work-related activity. Our draft regulations include provisions for
people who are terminally ill and those who are undergoing certain
forms of invasive chemotherapy&#151;intravenous, intraperitoneal or
intrathecal&#151;which have very disabling side effects on those who
undergo them. It would be entirely unreasonable to require people to
take part in work-related activity in what could be the final few
months of their life. Equally, it would be wrong to require people
undergoing treatment that, in itself, had very disabling side effects
to take part in such activity.</div>
<a name="06101774000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.
140 would also shorten the assessment phase for people with terminal
illness. Macmillan Cancer Support has raised the issue, and I have met
its representatives myself. Many members of the Committee, including my
hon. Friends, have raised this issue, and I am sure that they have
followed it up in correspondence. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for
Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg) raised it on Second Reading. As I have
previously stated, I would like to consider the options proposed in
Committee, as well as the observations of others, including my hon.
Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South and Macmillan, about how the
principle before us could be implemented in practice. Perhaps I can
reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West that to
achieve the effects that he and others seek, there is no need to amend
the Bill, because the regulations are sufficiently flexible. For
example, we have taken powers in clause 21 which mean that we can
prescribe when the assessment phase will end. We can make different
provisions for different cases, if we wish, using the standard powers
in clause 22.</div>
<a name="06101774000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
agree absolutely with my hon. Friend about how folk with terminal
illnesses, in particular cancer, are treated through employment and
support allowance and personal capability assessment in the Bill, I ask
him to withdraw his amendment, not because I disagree with it, or
because he has the wording wrong, but for two reasons: first, the power
is already in the Bill; and secondly, we are determined to get the
specifics right. I am happy to meet and correspond with him and others
to ensure that we do exactly that.</div>
<a name="06101774000301"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="06101774000506"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): I hear what
the Minister says, and he reassures me somewhat. At the end of the day,
I am sure he accepts that 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 82</div>Members in Committee are considering the Bill in detail, and from what
he says, he will consider it further. The Bill is fine, but I remind
him that when it is implemented and dealing with people who are
severely and terminally ill, or recovering from invasive treatment,
those good words should become good deeds.</div>
<a name="06101774000302"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000507"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have
discussed how cancer affects families, but one reason&#151;although
not the main reason&#151;why we want as much assessment as possible
on paper is so that there is never a need for people in those
circumstances to come face to face with someone to try to persuade them
of their condition and prognosis. We all know from family experience
that people in those circumstances do not need the Department for Work
and Pensions to call them for interviews, or encourage them to take
work-focused interviews or work-related activity.</div>
<a name="06101774000303"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree with all that has been
said, but I invite my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West to
withdraw his amendment. We have included the power in the schedules and
in clauses 21 and 22 so that we get right the detail of the way in
which we frame the regulations and shape implementation throughout the
country.</div>
<a name="06101774000304"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000508"></a>John
Robertson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for his words. Under his
guidance, I shall withdraw the amendment. I shall take a close look at
the regulations and what transpires, and I shall happily take up his
offer of a meeting. I know that Macmillan will be happy to discuss the
finer points, too. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000509"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 189, in
clause 3, page 3, line 23, at
end insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">&#145;(e) make
provision for the disregard of payments made in accordance with
subsection
(1)(c)&#146;.</div><a name="06101774000308"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment relates to an issue that we touched upon earlier this
morning. It is about the need to encourage disabled people to take part
in public life, particularly through appointments to or elected offices
in local government. I seek to clarify the Government&#146;s
intentions towards the treatment of any income or expenses payable to
people engaged in public appointments, for example as local councillors
or in similar roles. I shall be grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response to these points.</div>
<a name="06101774000309"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the rules on incapacity
benefit, any work that is done in the role of local authority
councillor is disregarded when deciding whether someone is incapable of
work. Councillors&#146; allowances are taken into account, and they
reduce the amount of benefit payable if they exceed the earnings limit
of &#163;86 a week. Will the Minister clarify the Government&#146;s
intentions, particularly in relation to whether existing provisions for
incapacity benefit for councillors will be carried over into both
components of ESA, whether income-related or
contribution-related?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 83</div><a name="06101774000310"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall be
grateful if the Minister will also say whether the rules could be
extended to a limited range of other public appointments, because
participation in civic and community life can be important in
increasing the opportunities for disabled people to make a recognised
contribution, to interact with non-disabled people and to acquire new
experience and confidence which may help them to find employment. On
average, only 3 per cent. of appointees to public bodies are disabled.
Real and perceived disincentives in the benefits system can prevent
benefit recipients from contributing to society in that way. At the
moment, for example, people who do so may feel that they risk being
invited for another personal capability assessment which could then
question their entitlement to benefit in the first place and benefit
could cease if expenses in relation to public office amount to more
than the permitted work limits per
week.</div><a name="06101774000311"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall be grateful if the Minister will clarify whether the current
rules for councillors will apply under ESA and whether he will consider
having further discussions about a limited range of additional public
appointments to which similar rules apply for the purpose of ensuring
that disabled people are not faced with further disincentives to take
part in public
life.</div><a name="06101774000312"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000510"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I think we can readily endorse both the spirit of
the amendment and the way in which it has been moved. Many of us in
different capacities have campaigned on and off on an all-party basis
for greater involvement in public life by disabled people generally.
The point is that not only is that part of their civil rights, but it
is positively beneficial to the public good if there is active hands-on
involvement.</div><a name="06101774000313"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have a
gloss on the points made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn,
Badenoch and Strathspey about participation by disabled people in
consultation or advisory exercises on behalf of public bodies. I do not
want to rehearse or question your decision, Mr. Hood, but
you will have noticed that we tabled new clause 7 on that point and it
is germane to this debate. The issue involved the Disability Rights
Commission and other disability
bodies.</div><a name="06101774000314"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem is
the overall fear that in some way people on employment and support
allowance would be disqualified from participation in any public
activity, whether as councillors, Members of Parliament if that were
still possible&#151;it is unlikely&#151;or as consultees in a
public exercise. A number of recent public measures&#151;for example,
on care standards&#151;other related action in the health field, and
the whole concept of the new provisions of the public duty on
disability actively encourage participation, and those are exactly the
people that we want to participate. The particular concerns set out in
the new clause were, first, that people who participated as consultees
should not, as a direct consequence, be treated as capable of
work&#151;that is directly analogous to the point made by the hon.
Gentleman on public office.</div>
<a name="06101774000315"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is the issue of
recruitment of service users as consultees by public organisations. At
the moment there is a difficulty, particularly for people on
means-tested benefits, who are effectively excluded because there is a
fear that they might lose those benefits. The problem is that that
immediately skews the consultee sample because only the relatively
better-off will be able to take their place as
consultees.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 84</div><a name="06101774000360"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45pm</div><a name="06101774000316"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is also a question about preventing designated, reimbursed expenses
incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily as a result of the
involvement from being treated as income, so that they are not knocked
off benefit.</div>
<a name="06101774000317"></a><div class="hs_Para">Returning to the wider point
and the fifth part of the new clause that we have tabled, there is a
wish to ensure that some people will not be excluded from involvement
as a result of benefit laws. The new clause would allow people
simultaneously in receipt of the employment and support allowance to
choose to volunteer their advice to public organisations. They would
not get caught in what might be termed the &#147;notional earnings
trap&#148;.</div> <a name="06101774000318"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
said enough to express some of the concerns that were set down in that
new clause and they are entirely congruent with the concerns of the
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey in relation
to public office. Nobody wants somebody to simultaneously claim this
allowance and have a huge source of outside income through their public
work. That is why, whatever the theoretical possibility, the MPs who
are not actually working here&#151;I think they are office holders
for that purpose&#151;could not claim the employment and support
allowance simultaneously.</div>
<a name="06101774000319"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, it is wrong, in the
same breath, to make it impossible for people who can make a
contribution&#151;who are likely to be either in the work-related
component or the support component&#151;to make such a contribution.
If we ask the people who know about it, we are likely to get a better
answer than if we do not. If we exclude them by the way we set up the
benefit rules, we are the losers
too.</div><a name="06101774000320"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000511"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The amendment&#151;as we heard in the reasonable
explanation by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and
Strathspey and the informed comments of the hon. Member for
Daventry&#151;seeks to create a power to disregard some payments that
would otherwise be deducted from the contributory allowance by
regulations under clause 3(1)(c). It might help the Committee if I
explain how the Government intend to apply this provision and the type
of payments we intend to apply it to.</div>
<a name="06101774000321"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that the hon. Gentlemen
have had the opportunity to read the note on page 13 of the draft
regulations and supporting material booklet to show that our approach
is not changing. The best example of that is one mentioned by the hon.
Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey in respect of the
councillor&#146;s allowance. Currently the rules for incapacity
benefit recognise that an entitlement should not be lost just because
someone carries out activities as a local councillor. The rules also
recognise that there is a balance to be struck between allowing a
person to take an active part in representing their community and
protecting the public purse. That is why, as he fairly said, any
councillors&#146; allowances that exceed &#163;86 per week are
deducted from a person&#146;s incapacity benefit.</div>
<a name="06101774000322"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those amounts do not include
expenses reasonably incurred in carrying out their functions as
councillors. Our intention is that the contributory ESA should apply
those same rules to councillors and their 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 85</div>allowances. We will take the same approach across, including the
disregard applied to reasonable expenses. I hope that that reassures
the hon. Gentlemen. We would do this through regulations under
subsection (1)(c). The power in that provision refers to:</div>
<a name="06101774000345"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;payments of a prescribed
description.&#148;</div> <a name="06101774000323"></a><div class="hs_Para">That means
that regulations could, for example, state that it is payments after
deduction of expenses that are prescribed for the purposes of the
deduction. We do not&#151;and this is something that we can consider
and reflect on in Parliament more generally&#151;have any plans at
this moment, as a matter of policy, to extend the deductions to anyone
other than councillors. However, it is important to have the power
contained in this clause which would enable that to take place, if that
became the Government&#146;s policy or any Government&#146;s policy
in the future.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000514"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> The hon. Gentlemen can decide for themselves who
will intervene
first.</div><a name="06101774000327"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000515"></a>Danny
Alexander:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I
would suggest that he has discussions with his other ministerial
colleagues on this point because I can think of several other
examples&#151;such as participation on the board of a housing
association&#151;where this type of consideration might be usefully
extended beyond councillors to people in that sort of role. Some
community council involvement means that considerable amounts of time
are spent on consultation; it is not just whether such work should be
disregarded in deciding whether someone is entitled to benefit but also
whether any expenses that might be received should also be taken into
account. I hope that the Minister will take the matter further; I shall
be happy to have further discussions with him outside this
room.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000516"></a>Mr.

Daventry.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000517"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b><b class="B"> </b>These serial interventions are becoming
rather a habit. I reinforce that point for the Minister, not to prolong
his response. The DRC and others have identified a potential problem
for service users. I would emphasise that there is often the deterrent
effect of the possibility that even when they are merely a
reimbursement these payments might be taken into account or might in
some way affect the benefit because the person will be judged to be
capable of work. They are real concerns; I hope that the Minister will
reflect on them and perhaps consider whether he can be a little more
flexible without busting his budget in the process. I ask no more than
that.</div><a name="06101774000330"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="06101774000518"></a>Mr.
Murphy:</b> I would be happy to continue the conversation. I
hope that in Inverness being invited outside the room has a different
meaning from that in Glasgow.</div>
<a name="06101774000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we seek to implement the ESA
we must bear in mind the wider sense of work-related activity and the
relationship with voluntary work. The Committee has not yet had the
opportunity to discuss the role of voluntary work, which we will come
to later. Perhaps at that point we will have a debate about what will
be permissible under work-related activity in respect of the points
that have been
raised.</div><a name="06101774000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The power in
subsection (1)(c) is important as it would allow the very thing that
Opposition Members have sought to push us towards this evening. The
hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey sought
reassurance that the current arrangements will be carried forward,
which is what we seek to do. In terms of how we go further, I make a
commitment to continue our conversations on the matter in the context
of allowing volunteering, permitted work and other issues which of
course fall within the Bill. I would encourage the hon. Gentleman to
ask leave to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="06101774000333"></a>
