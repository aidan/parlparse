<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.—(1) In Chapter IV of Part V of the Taxes Act 1988 (provisions relating to the Schedule E charge: other exemptions and reliefs), after section 187 insert—
<P>
``Contributions in respect of share option gains
<P>
Relief for 
contributions 
in respect of 
share option 
gains.
<P>
187A.—(1) Where a person (``the earner'') is chargeable to tax under section 135 on a gain, relief is available under this section if—
<P>
 (a) an agreement has been entered into allowing the secondary contributor to recover from the earner the whole or part of any secondary Class 1 contributions in respect of the gain, or
<P>
 (b) an election is in force which has the effect of transferring to the earner the whole or part of the liability to pay secondary Class 1 contributions in respect of the gain.
<P>
(2) The amount of the relief is the total of—
<P>
 (a) any amount that, in pursuance of any such agreement as is mentioned in subsection (1)(a), is recovered in respect of the gain by the secondary contributor not later than 60 days after the end of the year of assessment in which occurred the event giving rise to the charge to tax under section 135; and
<P>
 (b) the amount of any liability in respect of that gain that, by virtue of any such election as is mentioned in subsection (1)(b), has become the earner's liability.
<P>
(3) Where notice of withdrawal of approval of any such election is given, relief under subsection (2)(b) is limited to so much of the earner's liability in respect of the gain as is met before the end of the 60th day after the end of the year of assessment in which occurred the event giving rise to the charge under section 135.
<P>
(4) Relief under this section shall be given by way of deduction from the amount of the gain on which the earner is chargeable to tax under section 135.
<P>
(5) Any such deduction does not affect the amount of the gain for the purposes of—
<P>
 (a) section 120(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (amount treated as consideration for acquisition of shares), or
<P>
 (b) section 4(4)(a) of the Contributions and Benefits Act (amount treated as remuneration for contributions purposes).
<P>
(6) The agreements and elections referred to in this section are those having effect under paragraph 3A or 3B of Schedule 1 to the Contributions and Benefits Act.
<P>
References to approval in relation to an election are to approval by the Inland Revenue under paragraph 3B of that Schedule.
<P>
(7) In this section—
<P>
`the Contributions and Benefits Act' means the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 or the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992; and
<P>
`secondary Class 1 contributions' and `secondary contributor' have the same meaning as in that Act.''.
<P>
Section 187A inserted by this subsection applies to any agreement or election having effect as mentioned in subsection (6) of that section, whether made before or after the passing of this Act.
<P>
(2) Section 203FB of the Taxes Act 1988 (PAYE: gains from share options) is amended as follows—
<P>
 (a) in subsections (2) and (3), for ``subsection (7)'' substitute ``subsection (6A)'';
<P>
 (b) after subsection (6) insert—
<P>
  ``(6A) Where section 203F has effect in accordance with subsection (2) or (3) above, subsection (3) of section 203F shall apply as if the reference in that subsection to the amount of income likely to be chargeable to tax under Schedule E in respect of the provision of the asset were a reference to the amount on which tax is likely to be chargeable by virtue of section 135 in respect of the event in question, reduced by the amount of any relief likely to be available under section 187A.'';
<P>
 (c) in subsection (7) for ``any of the preceding provisions of this section'' substitute ``subsection (4) or (5) above'' and for ``section 135, 140A or 140D'' substitute ``section 140A or 140D''.

Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> I welcome you back as the Chairman of our proceedings, Mr. Cook. I am also pleased that Dr. Clark is present. I am sure that the whole Committee will be delighted with the multiplicity of chairing talent looking after us for what could well be our final sitting.
<P>
Before the break, I was concluding my remarks about the comparison between the tax arrangements for unapproved share options, with which the new clause deals, in the United States and the United Kingdom. I was saying that the comparison is favourable to the UK. It depends on the state where the business is located, but by and large one would expect to pay a lower overall rate of tax on unapproved share options in the UK. There is an alternative regime for approved options in the US, as there is in the UK, and—this is probably what the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) was saying—the terms of the approved scheme are more generous in the US than in the UK, although the enterprise management incentive introduced by the Bill is more generous.
<P>
Finally, I took the opportunity of the break to inquire about the trip to Brussels that was featured in a newspaper report and referred to by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I am pleased to confirm that no such trip took place.
<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): I would not dream of speculating about where anyone may have gone. I thank the Financial Secretary for having enabled the Committee to have a much more interesting debate about the new clause than I would have imagined possible. I was wrong, not only technically but in substance, in what I said on the subject in my introductory remarks, As the debate has brought out, the new clause is much worse than I had imagined. The essence of the matter is, it transpires, that the new clause is based on the quaint but wholly fallacious assumption that employer national insurance contributions are somehow part of the contributory principle connected with labour and that such contributions should therefore be made under all circumstances—whereas, as we all know, employer national insurance contributions, especially in relation to the huge prospective sums that we are talking about, are simply a form of corporation tax. They are constructively transformed by the new clause—for which we are grateful—into a form of income tax. As the Financial Secretary said, as a form of contingent corporation tax they would have devastated British industry and the British economy; they now merely have the somewhat deleterious effect of creating a 47.3 per cent. tax rate on risk labour, compared with, depending on the character of the asset and the length of time it has been held, a tax on risk capital that can be as low as 20 per cent. That is completely irrational—I use the word advisedly. It has been some weeks since I used the word and I could not close my remarks without using it again. The new clause is a sterling example of irrationality and I very much hope that my hon. Friends will join me in voting against it. I hope that we can return to the subject on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I have enjoyed the hon. Gentleman's latest elaboration on the theme of irrationality. I am grateful for his acknowledgment that he was mistaken this morning—but he is also mistaken this afternoon. Many firms want the new clause to be included in the Bill and want to take advantage of the change that it will make. The Opposition would be seriously mistaken to resist the offered tax relief.
<P>
<B>Mr. Letwin:</B> Let me make it abundantly clear that we shall vote against the new clause, but not because we think that the status quo is tolerable. The status quo is catastrophic. The new clause is merely very bad. It is not the purpose of Her Majesty's Opposition to enact very bad legislation on the grounds that, otherwise, Her Majesty's Government will keep catastrophic legislation. We shall return on Report with a proper amendment to the catastrophic arrangements, possibly in agreement with the Liberal Democrats.
<P>
<B>Mr. Howard Flight </B>(Arundel and South Downs): To echo that point, I shall say that it is clearly better to have 47.32 per cent. than 52.5 per cent. However, I assure the Financial Secretary that SISCO and the venture capital industry regard it as extremely unjust to levy an income tax of 7.32 per cent. higher than the standard top rate of income tax on individuals working in the sort of businesses that we all want to encourage. The new clause is an unsatisfactory solution to a problem that the Government have made for themselves.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
As we draw to the end of our deliberations, I hope that the Government will see fit to implement the substance of the new clause, if not its drafting, for two reasons. One is that it is a good and fair proposal. The other is that the Government's measures already enable its substance to be achieved, but by a heavily administrative and unnecessarily complicated route.
<P>
As hon. Members will know from their constituencies, many people volunteer to drive people to hospital, for example, on behalf of various charities. In such circumstances, subject to keeping records, we propose that they should be able to offset what they spend on petrol against their income for tax purposes. Under the new gift aid rules, the same can be achieved. If an individual were to give, as gift aid, 80 per cent. to the charity, and the charity paid for the petrol, the 18 or 10 or 22 per cent. that the charity gets back would be roughly equivalent to allowing such an individual to claim such expenses for tax. The net effect is already achievable by that cumbersome route.
<P>
The same thing would happen for higher rate taxpayers. If a donor donated 80 per cent., the charity would receive its 18 per cent. and the donor 22 per cent., so those concessions could be used towards the cost of that petrol. The Government have made it clear that charities may reimburse people for such out-of-pocket expenses—that is the other bit of the equation.
<P>
The complicated route that I have described could be cut through along the lines that I am suggesting. People should keep records when they incur such expenditure to be able to claim it as a gift to the charity for which they have incurred it. Those who give to charity in cash should not be in a different position from those who spend cash on something used by the charity.
<P>
I am referring, in part, to those who transport others free to hospital. That is a necessary adjunct to our inefficient health service, with the failure of ambulances to take old ladies to visit their husbands, and many people having to travel further as more hospitals close down. It is crucially important that lots of people volunteer to drive others to hospital when they want to visit relatives or their illness is not serious enough for them to command an ambulance.
<P>
The cost of the proposals would be zero, and the net tax effect would be the same as the original provision because the charities could organise themselves in the way that I described. Therefore I urge the Government to take up the matter and sort it out in a straightforward way, for the sake of the worthy citizens involved.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Miss Melanie Johnson):</B> I sympathise with the intention behind the clause. The Government have made clear their wholehearted support, and I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgment of the help that we have given to charities and to the whole of the voluntary sector. We recognise the time and effort that volunteers give to their communities, and that those who do hospital driving runs form a key part of the service by helping people get to hospital by means other than an ambulance.
<P>
We launched the active community initiative to promote and encourage voluntary and community involvement. We want to make it easier for people to get involved and remove the real or perceived barriers to volunteering. I say ``perceived'' because, for example, it is not always understood that organisations can reimburse volunteers' out-of-pocket expenses without tax consequences. No returns have to be made to the Inland Revenue in such circumstances, so the system is simple.
<P>
I have listened carefully to the comments made by the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight). Such comments have been made before, and to an extent I agree with them. However, the problem with the clause is not as much with its principle—although the general rule of our tax system is that only expenses incurred in earning a source of income are deductible for tax—as with its practicalities. In making it work, a substantial burden would be imposed on everyone involved, especially the claimants and the voluntary organisations. The hon. Gentleman said that his proposal would reduce the burden but, in fact, it would substantially increase it.
<P>
Most people give their time to what they believe to be worthy causes, and they do not expect to be able to claim tax relief for incidental expenses. It is difficult to estimate how many volunteers who do not have their expenses reimbursed would bother to claim a tax deduction. For many, the sums involved would not be worth the candle, and for others, who might otherwise not have to deal with the Inland Revenue because they were retired or on small incomes and did not have to fill in self-assessments, the sums to be claimed would be small. I doubt whether many voluntary organisations would welcome having to verify claims to make the scheme work, but a system would have to be set up to provide more information beyond that from simply allowing people to log the number of hours of voluntary activity that they had completed.
<P>
The additional regulatory burden would be disproportionate to any benefit that people might derive from the proposal, so I must reluctantly ask the Committee to reject the new clause. As I said, one of the aims of the active community initiative is to remove real and perceived barriers to volunteering. As part of that process, I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security will work with the active community unit at the Home Office and with voluntary organisations to identify the issues causing problems and how the Government can best tackle them. I assure the Committee that we will consider sympathetically any proposals emanating from that work.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I wonder whether the Economic Secretary knows that in a debate that I had with the Paymaster General recently on low-income pensioners and the Inland Revenue, it was said that the Inland Revenue would work closely with the active community unit to consider volunteer schemes to help pensioners and all people on low incomes with filling in their tax forms, similar to the projects that the Economic Secretary talked about. Can she or the Paymaster General write to me in due course with details of how those negotiations are progressing?
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I cannot yet give the hon. Gentleman any update. His debate with the Paymaster General took place only two or three weeks ago, and probably not much has changed since then. However, we are happy to examine the matter and either the Paymaster General or I will write to him.
<P>
The proposal would place an impossible burden on organisations using volunteers and would probably not be attractive to volunteers. I hope that the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs will understand from the assurances that I gave that we have every sympathy with his position, and I hope that he will withdraw the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> The cost of petrol is approaching 90p a litre and many of the people involved in volunteering are retired. In my part of the world, people must often drive 40 or 50 miles and back, so providing petrol is a considerable expense for those who are not on large incomes but who normally pay tax.
<P>
As the Economic Secretary said, the issue is not new, and the Treasury has probably received plenty of correspondence about it. I do not entirely agree that the admin needs to be complicated, but if I accept that for a moment, and assuming that the Economic Secretary understood what I said earlier, I must ask whether the Treasury will explain to charities that there is now a way of achieving what they want. Charities want to open accounts with garages to which their people go for petrol, and pay for that petrol directly. Then the charities can say to all their volunteers, ``If you gift aid us 80 per cent. of what you are likely to spend, we will get the tax back and you will get the tax back if you qualify.'' That will produce the same effect as making the tax deductible. If charities know that, the objective can be achieved. That is within the rules, and I assure the Economic Secretary that such a system would make many people in the world of volunteering feel happy instead of feeling as though a great injustice were being done.
<P>
<B>Miss Johnson:</B> I shall reinforce the fact that volunteers can claim back their out-of-pocket expenses. Charities do not carry out any administration for the existing system, so it incurs low regulatory and bureaucratic requirements. I am sure that those in various charities will read the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I know that he realises that we are keen for charities to maximise all the benefits of the ``Getting Britain giving'' package that we introduced this year. We are keen to see that they get the maximum benefit from that. I recognise that volunteers are an important part of this and that it is best to return their out-of-pocket expenses by the existing methods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> I see no point in pressing my arrangements, as they will not be accepted. I will ensure that all the charitable organisations know how to achieve what they are after. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Davey:</B> New clause 2 and new schedule 1 attempt to take on the Government's programme of encouraging savings, particularly among those on low incomes, by trying to raise the relevant limits for friendly society policies. Currently, friendly societies are exempt from tax on profits from life or endowment business arising from policies under which premiums payable in any year do not exceed £270. The new schedule would increase that limit to £1,000. That is rather a large increase, but it is in line with the quite generous limits for tax-free savings in individual savings accounts.
<P>
The new clause and the new schedule also contain a few technical changes, which I shall try to explain briefly. I should say from the outset that I have been helped by the Association of Friendly Societies. I have no vested interest. I have a savings plan with the Family Assurance friendly society, but I gain nothing from tabling the amendments. They are designed to probe the Government's thinking on their future policies towards friendly societies.
<P>
The technical changes aim to improve the way that a rise in the premium limit would be taken up by savers. The current legislation requires a friendly society policy to have level premiums to qualify for tax exemption. In other words, it must have either one annual premium or payments of equal value throughout the year. Previous amendments to increase the tax-exempt limit provided a window during which existing policies could be increased to the new limit, without being considered to have broken the requirement for level premiums.
<P>
The new schedule again makes such a provision in paragraph 3, but with two relatively minor changes. On earlier occasions, the window has been less than a year, with the result that for some policies, increases could not wait for the annual renewal date, which has been administratively inconvenient and expensive. The new schedule provides for a longer window to run for one year from the passage of the Finance Act 2000. However, even if a policy qualifies for tax exemption, tax is potentially payable on surrender of the policy or discontinuous premiums within a 10-year period or three-quarters of the term, if sooner. That is sometimes known as the quarantine period.
<P>
Section 540 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 starts a new quarantine period whenever there is an increase in the rate of premium, thereby seriously limiting the attraction of taking advantage of any increased limits. Paragraph 3(4) of the new schedule disapplies that section to enable a premium increase to be made during the window without triggering a new quarantine period. Effectively, policies are treated as running from their original commencement. Those two technical amendments would ensure that, if the Government were minded in a future Finance Bill to increase the limit in a way that the new schedule proposes, the changes would be more effective. They would be easier for the friendly societies to administer and more attractive to people who are currently saving through these schemes to take up. I recommend them to the Government as they look at this important area.
<P>
One other important issue is not directly obvious and I gave the Minister notice of this. Friendly society savings schemes could be used to promote savings particularly directed at paying for a child's education and training after they have reached the age of majority. The Association of Friendly Societies put this proposal to the Government before the Budget and I am taken with the idea. It seems to me that increasingly we want to encourage people to focus on their children's studies as they leave full-time education and to make financial provisions for them by saving, so that later in life they can take advantage of further education or training. A tax-efficient scheme designed to assist in that respect, and directed towards relatively low levels of saving so that some equity is maintained, would be desirable.
<P>
The Government have considered individual learning accounts, which were suggested by the Labour party-inspired Commission for Social Justice in 1994, when the idea of a learning bank and individual learning accounts came into common parlance. I support those ideas, which were promoted by the commission. Such a scheme, linked to tax-exempt savings for a child's education and training, would take it a stage further. There are tax-exempt schemes for specific purposes, such as pensions and retirement savings and, as we move to the knowledge and information-based economy, it would be sensible to have a parallel scheme for education and training later in life.
<P>
Such a scheme could be designed to ensure that it was not simply a means of allowing the rich to escape tax, which my party, like the Government, is not keen on doing, but was tailored to ensure that it promoted investment in education and took account of genuine educational needs.
<P>
I recommend the idea, which was floated by the Association of Friendly Societies, to the Government. I want the Minister and her colleagues to imagine how the friendly societies would promote such a scheme if it was tailored to education and training needs. They would promote the idea of saving for children's futures in all groups in society. Friendly societies have much greater contact than institutions such as banks and building societies with people on low or modest incomes. They are better placed than any other institution to promote such saving and the idea of self-help and mutuality, which will encourage people to invest in the future of their offspring. I hope that the Government will consider the proposal favourably now and, perhaps more important, in the run-up to the Budget.
<P>
<B>Miss Melanie Johnson:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton for his explanation of the thinking behind his rather detailed new clause and schedule. At first, I found it difficult to understand why it had been tabled, and I am grateful to him for writing to me and explaining the proposal.
<P>
A similar measure was rejected in proceedings on the Finance Bill 1998 and I did not think that anything had changed since then, but the hon. Gentleman introduced a new twist to the arguments. I am happy to respond to what he described as a probing measure.
<P>
The proposal is that an increase in the friendly society tax-free limits should be available only to those setting up an account to fund a child's further education needs. The Government wholeheartedly endorse the ideals that underlie the friendly society movement of thrift and providing protection and savings for those on modest incomes; many members on both sides of the Committee share that view. However, increasing the tax exemption, even when it is targeted in the way suggested, is not the right approach for several reasons.
<P>
First, an account to encourage saving for the cost of further education cannot be the preserve of friendly societies. The life assurance products offered by friendly societies would not always be the best way of saving in such circumstances. We want all sectors of the financial services industry to be able to market such accounts to ensure that savers get the best possible deal and choice.
<P>
Secondly, to introduce an account specifically aimed at a child's further education would be complex. Rules would be needed to ensure that it was used for the purpose intended and not simply as an extra tax-free savings vehicle. It would be difficult to find rules that were easy to apply yet sufficiently focused on the purpose of the account. Also, policing complex rules would be costly and undermine the value of the account to savers.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, a successful account—the ISA—is already available to help people save for such an eventuality. The first year of ISAs has been a great success, with more than £28 billion placed in more than 9 million accounts. ISAs have proved to be a more attractive savings vehicle than the arrangements that they replaced, with an increase of around a third on the sums put into PEPs and TESSAs in 1998–99.
<P>
People are attracted to the flexibility and choice that ISAs offer. I am pleased that several forward-looking friendly societies, including some of the smaller ones, offer ISAs. It is disappointing that more societies have not risen to the new challenge, and I urge the societies that have not done so to respond to the changing environment. Seeking imaginative new ways to increase tax breaks is not the way in which they should want to proceed.
<P>
ISAs offer investors a choice in how they can save. There is no stipulation about how people use them or for how long people save. ISAs can be used for any of the events of a lifetime, such as marriages, births and retirements, as well as making lives more comfortable by assisting in the purchase of assets such as cars and houses. Of course, they can be used to save for a child's further education as well.
<P>
I accept that people under 18 cannot open ISAs. That issue has been raised as part of the Inland Revenue's review of the operation of ISAs. Children have a personal allowance. Therefore, for the vast majority of children, income or capital gains arising on investments other than those derived from their parents will be exempt from tax. Extending ISAs to children may not be worth while as it may simply complicate the savings sector, but the matter is being considered in the review.
<P>
No response on this topic would be complete without mention of how the Government are encouraging lifelong learning by individuals. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton remarked on the subject at some length. People over 18 who pay for a wide range of vocational and other eligible courses to improve their skills by means of an individual learning account will soon qualify for a Government discount on the cost of courses. The discount will generally equal 20 per cent. on the first £500 a year, and will rise to 80 per cent. for certain computer and other courses. That is a much better targeted and simpler way of ensuring that help directly subsidises learning by adults of any age. Everyone aged 18 and under is, of course, entitled to free education. The new clause would not achieve that directness and simplicity.
<P>
I sympathise with the view that there should be ways of encouraging people to save for their children's further education, but a specific account operated only by friendly societies is not the right way to do that. The ISA is the right way, and it already exists.
<P>
The technical points raised were sound. When appropriate in the future, we might want to reflect on them in any changes made on the subject.
<P>
The new clause is unnecessary. It would not provide the measures that the hon. Gentleman would like it to, and I hope that I have reassured him that the means to provide them already exists.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's reply, especially her comment that the Government would reflect on the technical aspects of the new clause and perhaps draft new legislation in due course. I understand many of her arguments and would like to pick up on two points that she made.
<P>
The Economic Secretary said that ISAs were not available for children, although that is part of the ISA review. I believe that friendly societies are an excellent vehicle for promoting savings for and by children. I hope that the Economic Secretary will take that on board and consider such societies in the review. I hope that it will cover not only ISAs but all tax-efficient savings.
<P>
I understand that the Government are developing some good policies on individual learning accounts and promoting saving for education post-18, but I want to raise their ambitions to match those of the Commission on Social Justice. It had much wider ambitions. It wanted to create a more profound education culture, in which people saw providing a good education as the most important thing that they could do for their children, and to ensure that that message reached all groups in our society. The measure that I have suggested is a way of helping to push that message, along with many other messages that the Government are already sending. Let us imagine the power of the friendly-society sector in promoting schemes. It would help the Government to drive the message through and enable the ingenuity and innovation in that sector to be directed at all groups in our society.
<P>
I do not intend to press the new clause to a vote. I am grateful for the Economic Secretary's remarks, but I hope that she will reflect on the issue further and discuss it with colleagues. The Government have taken the initial steps on individual learning accounts, but they could make many further moves to promote education. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.
<P>
Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.
<H4><center>New clause 5</center></H4>
<H4><center>Simplification of taxes: Report to Parliament</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`The Treasury shall, before the end of the current parliament, submit a report to parliament on options to simplify the UK tax system under the headings of—
<P>
(a) indirect taxes,
<P>
(b) personal taxes,
<P>
(c) company taxes.'.—[Mr. Heathcoat-Amory.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory (Wells):</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause would require the Government to present a report on tax simplification. It breaks the task down into three approximate headings to make that undertaking slightly less daunting. I do not underestimate the size of such a task, but I believe that the Government have not paid sufficient attention to the problem in recent years. In their search for additional revenue, they have laid down hundreds more pages of tax legislation, which has created new burdens for the tax-paying public and the Revenue authorities.
<P>
A comprehensive review and simplification of the language and structure of our tax system is sorely needed. Tim Smith, a former Member of this House, paid a great deal of attention to that. In 1996, largely through his influence, the previous Government set up a tax law rewrite project. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack), who cannot be present, is closely involved in that project and takes an enthusiastic interest in its work. The chairman of the steering committee is my noble Friend, Lord Howe of Aberavon, and I cannot imagine a better qualified person for the task.
<P>
<B>Mr. Timms:</B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding the Committee of the amendment that Tim Smith moved to a Finance Bill. I remember it vividly, as it was my first Finance Bill. Will the right hon. Gentleman remind the Committee how he voted on that amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It was a long time ago, Mr. Cook, and you know how forgetful ex-Ministers can be.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> It is unusual for me to rise to assist the right hon. Gentleman, but in this case I shall do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Graham Allen </B>(Nottingham, North): With his memory?
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> No. In the right hon. Gentleman's day, the tax system was becoming less complicated; it is now becoming more complicated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's unexpected assistance and I shall return to the matter.
<P>
The honest answer is that I probably put up a brief but rather unenthusiastic struggle against the proposal made by Tim Smith, who was then my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield. I am glad to say, as a testament to him, that it was accepted. Perhaps I knew that I was on the losing side. I hope that I was excused for reading out the Treasury brief. I am delighted that Mr. Smith's achievement is progressing under such a distinguished chairman. I understand that the draft capital allowances Bill is more or less ready to go through the House and that some progress has been made on income tax. I hope that the Paymaster General is taking a personal interest in the matter and ensuring that the project is fully staffed. It is always tempting to move draftsmen to other tasks, such as drafting Finance Bills, at the expense of a long-term project.
<P>
The initiative is most important and I was therefore disappointed to find little evidence of its work in the Bill, parts of which are written in an almost impenetrable style. I draw attention to the 83 pages of the climate change levy schedule, which is often opaque. There is no excuse for that; the Government are introducing some measures that build on the antiquated existing structure, but in the case of a new tax, I hoped that the Government would take on board at least the style of drafting that is being pursued by the tax law rewrite project.
<P>
The stamp duty proposals, especially the anti-avoidance measures, are being bolted on to some unreformed legislation that will be very difficult for taxpayers to understand. It did not matter when the top rate of stamp duty was 1 per cent., but as the Government have increased it to 4 per cent. the tax has additional prominence. I hoped that the Government would at least try to put it higher on the agenda for a rewrite, or carry out a more fundamental reform of it.
<P>
The tax law rewrite project is constrained by its terms of reference. It cannot rewrite the underlying law; it can only put the language in a more accessible and simplified form, which is very important. The new clause is important because it urges the Government to take a more radical look at the tax system. We do not suggest that that will be easy or quick, but a start must be made.
<P>
One problem is that we are a very old country and many of our taxes are of great antiquity. When I was in the Treasury, I had a group of officials who seemed to be knowledgeable in the history of taxation, and I am grateful to them for giving me some examples of how the tax system failed in the past, perhaps providing lessons for the present. William Pitt the Younger was responsible for laying down the bones of our modern tax structure. By the time that he died in 1806, the main elements of our tax system—the income tax, the rating system and most of the excise duties—were in place. He was an inventive tax reformer, and if one examines his actions and those of his predecessors, one is struck by the fact that they faced many of the issues that face a modern Treasury Minister.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
All Governments have revenue demands. Pitt had to finance a war, so he looked for new sources of revenue. The search was always for ways of raising the maximum amount of revenue while causing the least damage to the economy and without making the Government too unpopular. I think that it was the French Finance Minister Fouquet who, when explaining taxation to the King, said that the aim was to pluck the maximum amount of feathers from the goose with the minimum amount of hissing. That phrase is probably written above the desk of all modern Treasury Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Flight:</B> My right hon. Friend alludes to a matter of great historic importance. We won the Napoleonic wars because we were able to finance them. The French ran out of money. At the end of those wars, we had a national debt of 150 per cent. of GNP, and it has never been higher.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> My hon. Friend is right. Pitt set in train a sinking fund to try to reduce the national debt.
<P>
I shall mention one or two failed taxes to show the problems that all Governments face, from which we can draw lessons. Property has always been a most tempting target. An early attempt to tax fixed property was the hearth tax, which was extremely unpopular and intrusive, because officials had to enter people's private property to assess it. That tax became the window tax, which could be more easily assessed by simply walking round the outside of the property. Bachelors and widowers were taxed between 1695 and 1706. It is not clear why bachelors were targeted. Perhaps it was to encourage marriage or because they were assumed to have a higher taxable capacity. The fact that the tax existed for only 11 years suggests that it became unenforceable. Clocks and watches were taxed not at the point of purchase, but on ownership. Gloves, hats, cards and dice were also taxed.
<P>
We can perhaps all think of newer and better examples for the list of consumption taxes. Salt was taxed; spirits were, and still are, taxed; tobacco pipes and leather were taxed; and there were riots in the west country when cider was taxed. The tradition of hostility to new taxation still lingers among my constituents. Famously, tea was taxed at threepence in the pound, and the attempt to extend that tax to north America led to the war of American independence. One could say that the United States was founded on a tax revolt.
<P>
My last example of a failed tax was introduced by William Pitt, so it slightly undermines his reputation for good taxation. In 1796, he gave in to a suggestion by a Mr. Dent for a tax on dogs. Mr. Dent was the Member of Parliament for Berkshire, and he quickly became known as ``dog Dent''. His aim was to prevent the multiplication of dogs and his idea was that the tax would become self-liquidating. Perhaps he thought in the same way as Treasury Ministers, who always advance the idea that the tax on tobacco is designed to stop people smoking, but get down on their knees every night in hopes that that declared aim is not a success because it would create an enormous hole in the Revenue if it were. The dog tax was not a success and was quickly withdrawn. Governments must therefore be careful about what they tax and how they tax it and be aware that taxes that are tolerable and enforceable at low levels can become intolerable and unenforceable at high levels. The efficiency and effectiveness of a tax system is just as important as the gross sum that it tries to raise.
<P>
A good tax system is a national asset and has always been seen as such. I end my brief and anecdotal trip around the British tax system by recalling the words of Edmund Burke, who studied the matter. In 1767, after studying the state of revenues of many of the principal nations of the continent, he asserted that, if called upon to do so, he could prove beyond possibility of dispute that England was the most lightly taxed of any of the great states of Europe and that we had the best constituted and best managed revenue that the world had ever beheld. That was a proud boast, and I hold it out as an aim—one that I am afraid that the Government have not achieved. A good and efficient tax system is an asset that the whole country enjoys. Taxes should be widely spread, modest in their incidence and properly enforced.
<P>
In conclusion, I turn to the initiative of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which I heartily endorse. It published a document called ``Towards a Better Tax System'' in which it sets out 10 principles of good taxation. By way of illustration, it examined a piece of new legislation, the IR35 sections of the Bill, and tested it in the light of its principles. It gave the legislation marks under each heading; I regret that its overall conclusion was that the tax scored only 30 out of 100. I repeat a recommendation of the Treasury Select Committee sixth report 1998–99 that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government gives its considered view on the options for simplifying the tax system . . . and sets out its own proposals for a systematic programme of simplification.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our new clause tries merely to encode that recommendation by an all-party Committee, and I urge it on the Government.

<P>

<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Enjoyable though the right hon. Gentleman's tour of the tax system is, the new clause may concentrate too closely on one element of an ideal taxation system—simplicity to the exclusion of fairness. I, too, could propose a simple and easily enforceable tax that would raise a great deal of money. We could levy, say, £10 a head on people represented by Conservative Members of Parliament. The people to be levied would be easy to identify and the principle could be stated in one paragraph, but it might not be fair.
<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> I thank the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) for giving me the opportunity to speak on the issue at the end of what has been a long but none the less enjoyable Committee. To save his blushes in regard to the Standing Committee debate of March 1995, he did not reply for the Government but simply voted with them as a Minister—and voted No. If it is any encouragement to him, I confess that I was in opposition at the time and voted Aye. In fairness, perhaps we should all pause and reflect. This is my fourth Government Finance Bill, and I think that it is my eighth in total as I was on the Opposition Front Bench for four. It strikes me, as it must the right hon. Member for Wells, to reflect on our respective roles depending on the sides of the Committee on which we sit. It has been interesting to consider some of the fair points made by the Opposition and the Government responses to them.
<P>
The new clause affords us a short debate at the end of our proceedings on some basic principles. The first is the question of simplicity and fairness, as was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer). Legislation must be clear and signal its intention. It must provide certainty, but we live in a complex society. As we have heard in our debates, some ingenious people seek to achieve different interpretations and outcomes of our legislation. That places enormous responsibility on all Governments.
<P>
On several occasions, we have touched on the rapidly changing economy in the United Kingdom, and its position in the world. We face challenges from e-commerce, the speed at which decisions can be taken and the location of companies. It is important that such activity does not pass tax systems by. Equally, tax systems should not seek to frustrate, undermine or shackle that dynamism and development in all our economies. I think that all Members of the Committee would agree with those basic principles, although our different political philosophies mean that we respond to and prioritise them in different ways.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells is right that the Government are committed to achieving a balance of certainty and clarity, not to mention simplicity when we can manage it, although the circumstances are not always such that we can do so. As he knows, there has been considerable debate about the growing complexity of anti-avoidance legislation and whether it is possible to have some general regulation that would cut down the need for more such measures. Detailed anti-avoidance legislation composes much of our Finance Bills to support and protect enabling measures.
<P>
In the Government's consultation, that solution was not widely welcomed as an alternative. People accepted the proposition that it is right for Governments to seek to protect their legislation; hence the need for anti-avoidance measures. Out of that consultation came the request that our anti-avoidance legislation should be specific and targeted on each occasion. In a sense, the Government started with consultation about the nature of our tax system. We inherited the tax law rewrite project from the previous Government, and we continue to support it. I shall say a few words on that in a moment. People cannot have this both ways. They cannot argue for simplicity if they want the freedom to find ways around our legislation. They must expect us to defend that legislation. Often the complexity concerns safeguards.
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the tax law rewrite programme is to modernise direct tax law and to make it clearer and easier to use. As the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, the first rewrite Bill on capital allowances will be ready for enactment towards the end of this calendar year. There has been full consultation with users of tax legislation throughout the process. The Government have moved to a position that has been widely welcomed. The outcome is not always widely welcomed, but the process of extensive consultation on the proposals that we bring forward has been.
<P>
The use of the pre-Budget report to lay out strategic directions and to announce consultations has been a significant part of our work. On this Finance Bill alone, there has been extensive consultation on fiscal marks, the climate change levy, corporate venturing relief, research and development and new tax incentives for small and medium-sized companies. The taxation of intellectual property rights, enterprise management incentives, the new all-employee share ownership scheme, the tonnage tax, powers to combat serious fraud, the review of charities taxation and even the somewhat unpopular IR35 have all been subject to the most rigorous consultation, with clauses being published in draft form.
<P>
The idea that the Government are not undertaking consultation and are not examining the work of our tax system and looking for ways to improve it is mistaken. We have taken that on in all our work since 1997. Indeed, we are swinging round the Inland Revenue in terms of its enabling facilities. We are looking critically at the compliance costs and undertaking new and further work to find ways to streamline our contact with business and to minimise its compliance costs. We have provided materials in a whole range of ways directly to business and individuals to ensure that they know their rights and understand what they have access to. We brought the Contributions Agency into the Inland Revenue. We started a programme of consultation on a range of issues surrounding national insurance with those who use the system, to find ways to improve it to achieve the very thing that the right hon. Gentleman suggested.
<P>
There have been calls for some considerable time from the CBI and now from the better regulations consultative committee that, although the PAYE regulations are in secondary legislation, they should be looked at and considered. That would be outside the remit of the tax law rewrite committee, but it is considered to be desperately needed. As the Minister responsible for that, I am currently considering how we can take that piece of work forward to achieve the aims that the right hon. Gentleman outlined.
<P>
We have a four-year programme of research with companies to look at tax compliance and how we can make it better. Closer working is being initiated and developed between the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise to ensure that the systems fit together and do not contradict each other. In all those areas, we are doing the work that the new clause recommends. The new clause would merely add to that process another set of reports. I must tell my hon. Friends, who have been so patient throughout the Committee's proceedings, that the new clause is unnecessary and I ask the right hon. Gentleman, having put his argument on the record, to save our blushes, ask leave to withdraw the amendment and live to fight another day on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): May I say, on behalf of the Opposition, that I am grateful for the Minister's response? We know that she has seen the ICA report—a copy is in front of her—and that it mentions many of the matters that she raised, but it reaches a slightly different conclusion from the Minister's.
<P>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells said, the report took the IR35 example to pieces. However, under the heading ``Why Parliament fails taxpayers'' on page 7 it states that only seven amendments were accepted to the Finance Bill 1999. It continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If such a detailed scrutiny can result in a mere seven changes in more than 100 hours of debate, there is clearly something wrong. Indeed most people looking at the minor nature of the amendments that were made would conclude that the Parliamentary process was almost a complete waste of time. The conclusion must be either that the Parliamentary draftsmen are so good that they produce a perfect product every time or that tax legislation is not made by Parliament at all; it is made by the Treasury ministers and rubber-stamped by Parliament.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have to say, as this Bill goes through Parliament, that there is a ring of truth in that.
<P>
Under the heading, ``Where has the system gone wrong?'' the report states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of reasons why the system has broken down. The main one is a vast increase in the volume of parliamentary business and in particular the vast increase in the size of Finance Bills.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This Finance Bill is the classic culprit. The report continues with other suggestions and agrees with the Minister on delegated legislation, particularly the two-Bill solution.
<P>
The report mentions the Finance Bill Committee. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Another problem is the sheer size of the Committee. There were 40 members on the 1999 Finance Bill Committee—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I suspect that there are more on this Committee—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>including the two Chairmen. Outside Parliament few would dream of trying to improve the wording of a legal agreement or other document in such a large committee. It is unworkable.
<P>
A further problem is the propensity of Governments in recent years to keep adding to the Finance Bill as it progresses through the Parliamentary progress.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The criticisms made are not the Government's fault, but a problem with the system, with how Parliament scrutinises tax legislation, which is getting more and more complicated. I have found it difficult to get to the heart of several aspects of the Bill, but with the help of many I got there.
<P>
I put down a marker that I should like the Procedure Committee to have another look at the problem. Mr. Cook, you referred to the Procedure Committee when I raised a point of order about the integration of tax and benefits and I am grateful to you for that.
<P>
There is a fundamental problem, which must be solved. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

<P>

<B>Question proposed, That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</B><P>
<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This is an appropriate point in our proceedings to thank you, Mr. Cook and Dr. Clark for the excellent way in which you facilitated our debates. You allowed debates to flow—to put it tactfully—so that substantive points of principle could be discussed. It would be remiss to conclude our proceedings without putting on record our great thanks to you and Dr. Clark for your skilled guidance through the Bill.
<P>
I also take the opportunity to thank the Hansard transcribers and other staff, who have made sense of our discussions and responded to the comments that have repeatedly been made about the importance of being able to study our proceedings by making a good record of them.
<P>
I thank the police officers who have guarded us and opened and locked the doors in time, and the Officers of the House. The Clerks, along with you, Mr. Cook, and Dr. Clark, have done a splendid job in making sure that we discussed and voted on the right things at the right time. I thank my officials, who were ever present.
<P>
I thank my hon. Friends for their patience, support, encouragement and agreement—very well received, thank you. I also thank the right hon. Member for Wells and his colleagues for the way in which they pressed Ministers and ensured a wide debate. For most of the time, our proceedings were conducted in good humour, but sharply when necessary. I thank the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and his colleagues—those occasionally present or always present—for their help. I would like to thank my hon. Friends the Financial Secretary and Economic Secretary for their assistance and, last but not least, the Government and Opposition Whips for ensuring that we considered the Bill in reasonable time.
<P>
Finally, I thank the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs. I thought that the suit that he wore this morning was an indication of his expected liberation from the Committee. I hope that he does not use the fact that he does not have to serve on the Committee every Tuesday and Thursday as a reason to smoke more cigarettes—it is bad for his health.
<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<H4><center>[DR. MICHAEL CLARK in the chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Dr. Clark, I thank you and Mr. Cook for the impartial and skilful way in which you conducted our proceedings. You blended strictness with tolerance, for which we are grateful. Parliamentary procedures would break down without what the Clerks do, often behind the scenes, so we are grateful to them. We are also grateful to Hansard, who manage to transpose our ramblings into something that, if not literature, can at least by read by another audience. I also thank the doorkeepers and policemen, who make us aware of Divisions; the phrase ``Division in Committee Room 10'' is one of the great cries of London, and is certainly audible to everyone in the Committee Corridor.
<P>
We leave the Bill in slightly better shape than we found it. We did not manage to win any Divisions, but we did win some arguments. I thank the Paymaster General and her colleagues for the way in which they entered into debate and answered some of our questions. When they did not, it was either because our questions were unanswerable or because something is being left for a later stage of the Bill's proceedings. I would like to end on a buoyant and optimistic note, in the belief that parliamentary democracy is alive and well in Committee Room 10.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Rather than making the final act of the Committee seem like something from the Oscars, I shall associate my hon. Friends and myself with the thanks given by the Paymaster General and the right hon. Member for Wells. I thank the Ministers for their work and the way in which they have answered the debates. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) and, for their occasional appearances, my hon. Friends the Members for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell). They assisted me outside the Committee in scrutinising the Bill in great detail.
<P>
We are especially thankful to you, Dr. Clark, and to your colleague Mr. Cook for the way in which you he chaired the Committee. I look forward to your hospitality in due course. I especially look forward to the Report stage of the Bill. Although the Bill has been improved slightly, we want to make many amendments on Report. We also know that the Government want to make several changes, for which we wait in anticipation. Without wanting to stray on to such controversial subjects at this happy hour, I shall thank all members of the Committee for their patience with my colleagues and me during our proceedings.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> While my co-Chairman Mr. Cook retrieves his jacket, I shall take the opportunity to say a word or two. It has been a pleasure to be co-Chairman of the Committee, which has been good natured. I congratulate all hon. Members on that. I have done my best to turn up well on time; on one or two occasions, I ran up the stairs and arrived a little too punctually, and was concerned in case my heart palpitations should be interpreted by the Paymaster General as being a result of my close proximity to her. I also remember a rather impertinent question, if I may put it that way, asked by Mr. Letwin on company taxation. Bold as brass, he asked whether I lay awake at night thinking of group relief.
<P>
I am disappointed that Mr. Pond did not speak. Had he done so, he could have gone on as long and as wide of the mark as he wanted, and I would not have called him to order. You wonder why? On his first day in Parliament in 1997, he gave me a jump start in the car park when my battery was flat. I have not yet repaid that debt, but I look forward to doing so at some time, possibly in Committee.
<P>
It has been a pleasure to see my area Whip serving on the Committee, and an even greater pleasure to drop him a note from time to time asking him to explain his absence from Divisions. There have occasionally been long debates and, although I have attempted to concentrate so far as possible, I have played a little game. The Government Whip has a double Christian name, and I have tried to see how many Members of Parliament I can string around it. My efforts have gone only as far as Gareth Thomas, Thomas Graham, Graham Allen, Alun Michael, Michael Jack and Jack Cunningham. There is a small prize from the Chair for anyone who can make a longer sequence.
<P>
It has been a privilege to chair the Committee, which has been good-natured. I congratulate all members of the Committee, particularly the Front Benchers, on the way in which they have dealt with such complex matters. It has been impressive to see the Government team in action. I have also been impressed by the ability of Opposition Front Benchers to understand the complexities of the Bill, challenge the detail and put the Government under pressure, and by the way in which the Government have responded.
<P>
Those remarks also apply to the Back Benches, particularly those of the Opposition. I do not mean to be discriminatory, but the very nature of Bills is that Opposition Back Benchers play more of a role than Government Back Benchers. Those on the Government Back Benches will understand what I mean by that. Many on the Government Back Benches have also played an important part in the Committee.
<P>
I conclude by handing back to my co-Chairman, who I think has retrieved his jacket.
<H4><center>[Mr. Frank Cook in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I have retrieved my jacket. In no way is it a turncoat. I shall reserve my remarks, which I hope will be mildly amusing, for a later occasion, not too much later. I thought that I had escaped my greatest fear until these past few minutes. In accepting the responsibilities of lead chairman on the Finance Bill, I thought that we might have the experience that I have had with other Bills. That experience can be typified by the aphorism that the Catalan people apply to their national sport, which they describe as, ``Un punto aquí, un punto allá, y en medio muchísimo toro.'' For the benefit of those who do not speak Spanish, that means, ``A point here, a point there and in between an awful lot of bull.''
<P>
I must echo the tributes that have already been paid. The Hansard writers have had a particularly difficult job with some of the mumblings that have gone on from time to time. As much as I tried to improve that, I am sure that they experienced difficulty, as I did at times.
<P>
I would like to thank my co-umpire, Dr. Clark, for the obliging way in which he has tolerated my more idiosyncratic requests. [Laughter.] That has nothing to do with palpitations. More especially, I thank the third umpire, without whom both of us would have been gravely at risk. Our Clerk is extraordinarily diligent and conscientious. She is also very perceptive. Woe betide anyone who falls asleep, as I did once. I do not think that anyone noticed—at least I hope not.
<P>
I thank the staff of the House, the police and the doorkeepers. The doorkeepers have been particularly good to members of the Committee, as they have kept them well supplied with copious quantities of sparkling water. I do not want to be in any way blasphemous, but we are hoping to turn that water into wine in the next few minutes.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Bill, as amended, to be reported.
