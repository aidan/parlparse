                  </strong> Welcome back to the Chair, Mr Hood. Looking around
the room, it seems like only yesterday, but we have been away for a
week. I am sure that everyone has had a marvellous time. I place on
record my best wishes to the hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell,
who—unlike the rest of us, who have obviously been sweating hard
over the clauses before us—used the week away productively by
getting married. I wish him well, certainly on behalf of the
Opposition.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000032">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">We tabled the
amendment because, whatever the issues around the changes to controlled
foreign companies, it is important to make a full assessment of the
impact of developing tax issues in developing countries before we
approve clauses 47 and 48 and the appropriate schedules. Clause 47
deals with the way profits made by foreign companies and multinationals
are treated in the UK for tax purposes. It deals with the treatment of
profits made by subsidiary companies, which are companies within a
wider group of companies that make up a multinational structure. Those
are known as controlled foreign
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000033">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
the past, multinationals based in the UK have had to pay corporation
tax not only on profits that they have made in the UK, but on profits
they have made through subsidiaries and branches abroad. The system 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 414<a class="bkMark" name="Column414">&#160;</a>
                  </div>gave credit for any overseas tax in working out the corporation tax
liability, but taxation occurred either when the profits were sent back
to the UK or, where the company was in a low-tax territory, by deeming
the profits to have arisen in the UK. The CFC rules have stopped
companies moving their profits out of the UK to avoid tax, but they
have also provided a disincentive to base in the UK. Multinationals
have threatened to move their headquarters abroad and some have done
so. I will touch on that again
shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000034">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In
government, the Labour party was committed to moving towards a more
territorial regime—a regime where profits made in the UK are
taxed in the UK but profits made in other countries are not. We
consulted extensively on how the rules could be changed to provide more
certainty for business to ensure that the UK remained an attractive
place for multinational companies to be based, but also to ensure that
the UK tax base was not eroded by profits being moved offshore. The
general direction of policy was set in this area when we were in
government, and the Minister can be assured that we generally support
the direction of travel, but we have some concerns, which is why I
tabled the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000035">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
am concerned that the Government have not fully thought through the
detailed consequences of their changes, particularly the impacts on
developing countries. It is not just for me to say that: sometimes I
reflect my opinion and sometimes I reflect the opinion of organisations
outside the House, which I share and which I feel need to be developed.
The Minister will know that ActionAid—a British charity founded
in 1972 and working in 50 countries —has
raised similar concerns to those in amendments 100 and 101,
and it is important that he addresses
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000036">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">ActionAid
has a range of issues it wishes to see developed further, and the
Minister will be aware of the detail. It calls on the Government to do
what we have proposed in the amendment: consult developing countries on
the proposed changes and consider the impact of the reforms on
them—for example, by looking with other Departments at capacity
building on corporate taxation, and further extending activity begun by
the Labour Government on support in the G20 for country-by-country
financial reporting. We could then see where multinational companies
were paying tax, and how much. If there were any tax avoidance, tax
efficiency or, as some would say, tax dodging—however we want to
phrase it—it would be highlighted so that multinational
companies were accountable for the taxation that they need to pay as
their contribution to
society.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000037">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> ActionAid is a worthy organisation willing to look
at the issues in detail and take positive action itself. It moved its
headquarters from the UK to South Africa in 2003 to help to support
developing countries. It is trying to shine a light on concerns over
ensuring that multinational companies pay a fair share of tax in the
appropriate country, and do not use the ability to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 415<a class="bkMark" name="Column415">&#160;</a>
                  </div>move business around the world to avoid taxation—a practice
particularly disadvantageous to developing countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000039">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A particular
problem is that CFC rules act as a brake on tax avoidance by UK
companies, no matter who would lose out from the avoidance. The
proposed reforms will release the brake where the tax being avoided is
that of a country other than the UK. ActionAid has raised issues about
a number of countries and, as the Minister will be aware, recently
produced a document on the company SABMiller, which shifted profits out
of developing countries through royalty payments to the Netherlands,
management fees to Switzerland, procurement via Mauritius and interest
payments to Mauritius, so easing its tax burden to the disadvantage of
the countries where it was based. It is feared that that will become
easier and more common.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000040">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The key point
is that, although richer countries such as the UK might have the
legislative and administrative capacity to cope, the reforms could lead
to an intensification of tax avoidance by UK companies in developing
countries. ActionAid has estimated that as much as £4 billion in
tax in developing countries could be avoided as a result of the
proposals before the Committee. I do not know whether that figure is
correct; I do know that the Treasury has looked at it, because it
received freedom of information requests on the issue. We need an
assessment from the Minister of whether that figure is
accurate.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000041">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have some FOI responses to ActionAid’s £4 billion
estimate from officials at the Treasury and the Department for
International Development, who looked at the issue in detail. One
reason why I tabled the amendment is that those responses show that the
Government have not really considered the impact of these measures on
developing countries or on the tax take in those countries. In a trail
of e-mails that I received recently under FOI, on 16 March an official
in Her Majesty’s Treasury, whose name has helpfully been blanked
out—they may even be in the room as we speak—told an
official in
DFID:<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000042">&#160;</a>

               <p class="hs_brev">“The
AA response to the consultation is on the proposals for taxation of

the scope of their response… we strongly disagree with these
numbers

says that the proposal will cost developing countries about £4
billion, and the Treasury says that it believes that that figure is
very crude. If, as the official states in the e-mail, the Treasury has
not done any work on this, will the Minister tell me on what basis he
disagrees with the £4 billion figure from ActionAid? That

                  </strong> It is important that the Minister tell the
Committee what discussions he has had with DFID on those very points.
As my hon. Friend says, it is extremely important for developing
countries to have a strong, effective tax-raising base with a developed
civil service developing and undertaking the type of tax work that we
would expect in a developed country such as the United Kingdom. As she
says, handouts from western countries are one thing, but development of
a strong tax base and delivery of taxation measures are a quite
different
approach.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000053">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the Minister give some indication of the discussions
he has had with DFID over and above the helpful FOIs that I have
recently received. According to those FOIs, DFID is worried about when
the stuff is going to hit the fan, so that it can start thinking about
a plan. That is not saying when the stuff 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 417<a class="bkMark" name="Column417">&#160;</a>
                  </div>is going to hit the fan; it is saying, “So we can start thinking
about a plan.” What is the plan? Is the plan to say that this
does not mean anything? Is the plan to spin out the discussion, or is
it to look at whether the £4 billion is a genuine
figure? The Minister has some answering to do, including on behalf of
his colleagues at
DFID.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000054">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that we look at the issue, because we expected, and the
FOI requests indicate, that a new CFC consultation document would be
published in May 2011. We have been away, but it is now June 2011. I
looked at the Treasury website this morning and no further consultation
document has been forthcoming on the next round of CFC consultations.
The consultation document is TBC—to be confirmed—for
June. It is important that the Minister is open with the Committee
about the next stage of the consideration of CFCs. When is the next
consultation likely to be and how does it fit into the regime that we
have before us? The FOI e-mails before me discuss how the two link
together and what action the Government need to
take.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000055">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The

               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Notwithstanding

               </p>
               <p>Accordingly,
we should consult developing countries more widely. ActionAid itself
says:<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000057">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“The

on developing

               </p>
               <p>ActionAid
also says that the Treasury has not consulted anybody except business.
Well, business is hardly likely to give a full view of the picture of
tax avoidance. The Government need to publish an assessment of the
impact that the proposed changes will have on developing countries,
consult those developing countries and address the points raised by my
hon. Friend the Member for Wirral South on how we look at the issues in
the round to develop a stronger base for taxation in those developing
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000058">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">ActionAid
looked at a simple list of 10 publicly listed companies whose segment
reporting allows for analysis of their financial results in developing
countries. The sample showed pre-tax profits in such countries of
£16 billion in 2009, which is of general interest to
the Committee, and I want to look further at that
issue.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000059">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
combined market capitalisation of the sample of 10 companies was
£345 billion, which led to an estimate of UK listed
companies’ profits in developing countries of £83
billion. Applying an average global corporation tax rate of 25%, the
nominal tax bill for UK companies in 2009 was £21 billion. If
developing countries were to lose one fifth of that amount to tax
avoidance following the CFC rules, the loss would be the said £4
billion. ActionAid looked at African Barrick Gold, Anglo American,
Barclays, G4S, Reckitt Benckiser, SABMiller, Standard Chartered,
Unilever, Vodafone, and Xstrata, and that conclusion of £4
billion was based on those 10
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000060">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It
is important that the Minister examine that issue, and if he does not
respond to me, he should respond to the concerns that have genuinely
been expressed by a third-party non-governmental organisation about the

<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 418<a class="bkMark" name="Column418">&#160;</a>
                  </div>impact of these measures. The Government should monitor the consequences
carefully, because there are concerns that the costs could be higher
than expected. Some tax experts believe that the Government are
underestimating the long-term costs of the changes, and that the
costings do not take sufficient account of the fact that companies will
restructure to take advantage of the new regime.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000061">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government announced that there will be further significant changes to
the CFC rules in the 2012 Finance Bill, which could cost the Exchequer
£210 million, £540 million, £770
million and £840 million over the next four years, from 2012-13.
Those are significant sums at a time when there are, as we know, cuts
across the board elsewhere. That again returns us to a point that has
been made not by me, but by officials in the Minister’s own
Department, when they said that<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000062">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>—perhaps
to the extent of £840 million a year by 2015-16.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000063">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The Minister
needs to tell the Committee what his costings are, and not only for
this year, because we need to know about the future CFC rules. He has
not yet had the courtesy to bring those rules forward for public
consultation, despite the fact that, before the clause came before the
Committee, he said that we would have the consultation document in May.
I admit that our discussions are going slower than they might have
done, but that is no reason for him not to have produced the
consultation document. Even in his March documents, he said that it
would be produced in May. It is now June, so it will happen after we
have considered these measures in the Committee. This is not a simple
one-off package; it is part of a wider series of Government measures.
We need to look at those, and the Minister needs to enable some
discussion and consultation about where we are with regard to current
and future
plans.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000064">&#160;</a>

respect of 2012. We still have no detail on how the situation will look
in the longer term. It is important and integral that the Government
commit to improving transparency, particularly in the taxation of
branches, so that multinationals can be held to account. The changes
have the potential—I say potential, because the Minister can
defend his position if it not the case—to reduce transparency,
but there is still much detail to be pinned down, particularly with
intellectual property. The consultation document, which was expected in
May, has not been produced. I would like to know a definitive date for
when the next consultation document on CFC rules will be produced,

intervention, because it takes us back to our amendment, which simply
asks for further discussion with developing countries before the
assessment comes into play and before a resolution is laid before and
approved by the House. Again, unless I am mistaken—the Minister
will have an opportunity to tell me if I am—the only people who
have been consulted are the businesses themselves. There has been no
discussion with other nations, organisations or volunteer agencies
about the proposal, apart from the Minister’s helpful production
of the clauses in December last year, which led to the response that I
have brought to the Committee today from ActionAid, which indicates
that it is concerned about a £4 billion loss of income to
developing countries as a result of the
proposals.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000071">&#160;</a>

if that figure is wrong, the Minister needs to tell me why and to give
me some detail, rather than, as appears to be the case in the FOI

know whether he thinks that that £4 billion is wrong and whether
he believes that the tax situation will be accordingly disadvantageous
for developing
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000072">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">In
considering this matter, I would welcome the Minister’s comments
on another issue, which relates to the position with the European
Union, which I know is a favoured institution of the Minister and one
that he pays full tribute and honour to at every opportunity. He will
know that in mid-May, either just before or just after the start of the
recess, the EU passed some comment on the imposition of the CFC rules.
I have a quote from a news article written at the time—I also
have the EU statement, which I will find in a moment, somewhere in my
pile of papers—which
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000073">&#160;</a>

need a response from the Minister on the latest second-stage proposal
from the EU. I have found the European Commission document,
“Taxation: Commission requests UK to further amend its treatment

these proposals and what responses he has had to his publication in

The UK owes a historical debt to many countries throughout the world.
Much of the wealth and prosperity that we have shared in this
country—and which has helped us to develop things in this great
city of London, in my home city of Liverpool and elsewhere—has
been made through the exploitation of what are still developing
countries. We have taken physical or economic resources out of those
countries to build up our country. We therefore have a moral duty to
ensure that we do not just help and support developing countries
through economic aid given by DFID and through other Departments, but
that we look at the tax regime and how it helps them to build a strong
tax base which they can use to build up their
infrastructures.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000089">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In responding
to the debate, the Minister needs to give his assessment of the
financial impact of the proposal on developing countries, and whether
he agrees with the ActionAid £4 million figure. He needs to tell
us what consultation on the changes he has had outside
business—with developing countries, with non-governmental
organisations working in developing countries and with international
bodies. He needs to tell us what help and support he will give across
Government to help increase capacity building for corporate taxation in
developing countries. He should also look at helping to develop the

the period when the previous Government were in power and now. During
the previous Government’s time, a number of multinational
businesses redomiciled out of the UK. Since the announcements on this

               <p class="tabbed">Reforming the
CFC rules is a key change, needed to create the most competitive
corporate tax system in the G20 and to encourage more businesses to be
based in the UK. The question of CFC reforms’ impact on
developing countries has been raised during engagement on the CFC
reform proposals with ActionAid and other interested parties, and we
have considered that issue carefully. The UK’s CFC rules are
designed, and always have been, to protect the UK’s tax take
from the artificial diversion of profits overseas. Similarly, other
countries have CFC rules that are designed to protect their local tax
bases.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000098">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
changes to the taxation of foreign branches in clause 48 include rules
that ensure that profits to be exempt must be properly attributable to
branches, and result from genuine economic activity in the relevant
jurisdiction. That will prevent profits artificially held in other
jurisdictions, including the UK and developing countries, becoming
exempt. Therefore, the changes to the taxation of foreign branches will

to helping developing countries to reduce tax avoidance and protect
their own tax base. Our corporate tax system is not the best way to
help those countries; it is designed to protect the UK’s taxing

interim assessment shows, because he is asking us to commit the House
of Commons to supporting clause 47 and, shortly, clause 48, which
impact on CFCs. If we are to believe ActionAid—why should I not
believe an NGO such as ActionAid?—which has worked on this, the
clauses could cost developing countries £4 billion. If that is
true, it is a considerable amount of money for those
countries.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000130">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have no reason to disbelieve ActionAid, but I was willing to give the
Minister the benefit of the doubt and let him say to me that
ActionAid’s figure is wrong, that he has done a proper
assessment and that the figure is £2 billion or £1
billion, or even that there is no impact at all. However, he has not
yet been able to put any definitive figure on the impact on developing
countries. I remind the Committee of the only thing that we are asking
for in amendment
100:<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000131">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="hs_brev">“Notwithstanding
the provisions of paragraph 14 of Schedule 12, the Schedule
will not come into force until a full impact assessment on developing
countries’ tax revenue has been laid before and approved by the
House of
Commons.”<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000402">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">ActionAid
has given just one example. In Ghana, which is not one of the
world’s richest
countries,<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000133">&#160;</a>

               </p>
               <p>I
do not know what the impact of the clause will be on Ghana. Can the
Minister tell me today what impact it will have on Ghana’s
developing tax base? If he cannot, why is he refusing to accept
amendment 100 and why is he not allowing us a full impact assessment of
the effect on the tax revenue of developing countries? I do not want to
vote for something that could impact on one seventh of the tax revenue
of the state of Ghana, which is one of the poorest countries in the
world.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000134">&#160;</a>

many developing countries, according to ActionAid—if I am to
believe what it says, this is a correct figure—do not receive
even 15% of their national wealth in tax from corporate businesses,
because they do not have the capacity or the organisation to do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000136">&#160;</a>

the Minister’s responses to my interventions demonstrated a lack
of understanding of how we could find out the answers to some of those
questions? In the case of Ghana, which my right hon. Friend mentioned,
we could ask the Royal African Society, experts at DFID or experts at
Chatham House. There is a range of people who might have the answer to
that question, but the Minister did not seem inclined to ask
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000138">&#160;</a>

indication and some figures, which I quoted to him and which he has not
contradicted, on what the cost will be in the United Kingdom, but he
cannot give an indication of what it will be in developing countries. I
have the help and support of ActionAid to raise these issues, and I
have one researcher; the Minister has the whole of the Treasury. When I
was a Minister, if I wanted to know something I would ask officials,
who would go away and produce information. If I pressed them hard
enough, they would produce a report on such matters for

since 16 March. I remind the Committee that no work has been done on
this, as the HMT official told the DFID official on 16 March in the
e-mails that I quoted. I am sorry to say that it seems as though no

a commitment to place a copy in the Library of the House. Let us be
fair to him and say that he should do so by 30 June, which would give
him time to consider the matter, include a few more blanks like the
ones in the e-mail chain and delete appropriate individual names. We
could have an assessment of what that £4 billion really is. I
shall support the measures, but I am not willing to do so until we know

that means for Ghana and other developing countries, and we do not know
what it means for those whom ActionAid seeks to support. For those
reasons, unless he gives me further comfort, I do not feel minded to
withdraw the amendment. I am ever the optimist, however, and am hopeful
that when I sit down, the Minister will stand up and agree that the

                  </strong>
                  <strong> </strong>Clause 47 and schedule
12 introduce improvements to the CFC rules, which
will make those rules easier to operate and more competitive, where
possible, ahead of full reform in 2012. The existing CFC rules protect
the Exchequer from the artificial diversion of UK profits to overseas
low-tax jurisdictions, but those rules could be modernised better to
reflect the way that businesses operate in a globalised economy, while
ensuring that adequate protection for the UK tax base is retained. As a
result, CFC reform is a key part of the corporation tax changes that we
set out in the corporate tax reform document, which was published in
November 2010. The changes in clause 47 are the first step towards a
CFC regime that helps to achieve our aim of having the most competitive
corporate tax system in the G20 and providing the right conditions for
business investment and growth. That will be achieved by adopting a
more territorial approach that refocuses CFC protection on artificially
diverted UK profits and gives groups greater freedom to manage overseas
operations.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000183">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause introduces three new exemptions. The first provides more
certainty for business by removing certain intra-group trading
activities from a potential CFC charge—intra-group service
companies, for example—where a risk is not posed to the UK tax
base. The second exempts CFCs that derive their profits from foreign
intellectual property, where, similarly, a risk is not posed to the UK
tax base. Those two exemptions provide certainty to UK multinationals
that such commercial overseas operations, which could be caught be the
current rules, will be exempt ahead of full CFC reform in
2012.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000184">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third exemption provides an exempt period of up to three years for
overseas subsidiaries that, as a consequence of a reorganisation or
change to UK ownership, come within the scope of the CFC regime. That
will provide a group with appropriate time to reorganise its overseas
affairs, so that it complies with UK CFC rules. The  aim is to
make the UK a more attractive location for headquartered companies, and
for the UK investment that can arise as a result of that, as well as
assisting UK businesses that undertake overseas
acquisitions.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000185">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
third exemption is subject to amendments that correct a technical
defect that was included in the original draft legislation, but which
has only recently been identified. The defect concerns the conditions
that a foreign subsidiary must meet if it is to qualify for the
exemption. As drafted, the requirements relating to control of the
subsidiary are more tightly drawn than intended, and they could prevent
such subsidiaries from benefiting from the exemption in circumstances
where they should be free to do so. The amendments address those
unwanted restrictions and ensure that the exemption will work as
intended.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000186">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
further change made by clause 47 provides an alternative to the
exemption for CFCs with low profit levels. The threshold for the new de
minimis exemption is £200,000, which is four times the threshold
of the existing test. To reduce the compliance burden, the measure of
profits is based on the CFC’s accounts, rather than on its
taxable profits. Finally, the transitional rules for exempting certain
types of holding company have been extended by one year. Those final
two improvements aim to ease the compliance burden of the existing
rules. The changes take effect for accounting periods beginning on or
after 1 January 2011, apart from the extension of the transitional
holding company rules, which is deemed always to have had
effect.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000187">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">This
measure has been subject to an open and transparent consultation on
both the general principles and the detailed clauses. Following an
initial announcement in June 2010, we published detailed proposals on
29 November 2010 as part of the corporate tax reform document. Draft
legislation was published on 9 December 2010 for consultation.
Representative bodies, companies and firms of professional advisers
provided more than 20 responses to the draft legislation. The Bill
published on 31 March included a number of changes reflecting those
responses. Those changes include relaxing several of the conditions for
the intra-group trading and intellectual property exemptions to ensure
that they achieve their proposed
objectives.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000188">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 48 and schedule 13 provide an opt-in
exemption from corporation tax for the profits of foreign branches of
UK companies. Where an election is made, a UK company with a foreign
branch will now only be subject to corporation tax on its UK profits.
That change will contribute to the competitiveness of the UK tax system
by ensuring that the UK remains a location in which businesses want to
locate and

Government aim to create the most competitive corporate tax regime in
the G20. We are sending out a signal that Britain is open for business.
The corporate tax road map published in November set out the key
changes that will ensure that the UK’s corporate tax regime
becomes an asset. We have already discussed the keystone
measure—the cuts in corporation tax—that will support a
private sector recovery that generates growth, creates jobs and
contributes to the public
finances.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000205">&#160;</a>

               </h3>
               <p class="tabbed">We have just
looked at another part of the package, the interim changes to the
UK’s outdated CFC rules. The reform of foreign branch taxation
will further improve competitiveness by taking a more territorial
approach to income earned abroad and by more closely aligning the tax
treatment of foreign branches and 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 433<a class="bkMark" name="Column433">&#160;</a>
                  </div>subsidiaries. That will allow companies to make commercial decisions on
the structure of their overseas operations without
significant distortions caused by the tax treatment. For too long,
businesses have been leaving the UK due to concerns about tax
competitiveness. We want to attract them back, and this measure will
help us do
so.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000206">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Moving
to the detail of the clause, the changes will allow companies the
option to elect for exemption from corporation tax on the profits of
their foreign branches. That election will be made at company level and
will be irrevocable. The opt-in exemption will apply to foreign branch
profits including chargeable gains and investment income. Exempt
profits will be defined by reference to the UK’s tax treaty with
the branch territory. For branches in territories where there is no
treaty, the measure of the exempt profit will be determined by the OECD
model treaty. The Government will not extend the exemption to
non-treaty territories for branches of small companies because the risk
of tax loss through diversion of personal income is too high. That is
consistent with the tax treatment of foreign
subsidiaries.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000207">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Mr
Hood, it is good to see you in the Chair, although I can assure you
that the hon. Member for Edinburgh South did a splendid job. As the
Committee knows, the Government are committed to tackling all forms of
tax evasion and avoidance. The clause includes anti-avoidance
protection to prevent artificial movement of taxable profits from the
UK into an exempt branch. That will provide similar protection to the
Exchequer as that achieved by the CFC rules in respect of foreign
subsidiaries, and will mean that only genuine economic activities
carried on overseas will be exempt from UK corporation
tax.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000208">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
provisions will also offer protection to the Exchequer where branch
loss relief has been claimed, but is not matched by branch profits in
the six years prior to any election. Any company entering this
exemption with outstanding loss relief will still be taxed on the
profits of their branches until this balance is recouped. New losses
made after the election will be cancelled, and will not be eligible for
relief in the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000209">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Based
on current corporate structures, the proposal could benefit around 150
companies, primarily those owned by large UK multinational groups, plus
a small number of companies owned by non-UK multinational groups that
operate foreign branches out of the UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000210">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The measure
has been subject to consultation on both the policy design and draft
legislation. We received more than 50 responses from representative
bodies, affected companies and members of the public. In designing the
new regime we have reflected consultation responses to ensure that it
meets the needs of all affected sectors. Some respondents raised some
issues on the transitional and anti-avoidance provisions. Those have
now been addressed, ensuring the regime provides certainty to business
and protection to the Exchequer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000211">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have chosen
to maintain the policy objectives of greater consistency of tax
treatment of branches and subsidiaries, and of moving towards a more
territorial tax system, and have decided not to offer any form of loss
relief within exemption.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000212">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Those
companies for whom loss relief is important can still benefit from the
relief by choosing to remain within the current regime. In the coming
year we will 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 434<a class="bkMark" name="Column434">&#160;</a>
                  </div>ensure that the changes to the CFC regime work for all business
models—both branches and subsidiaries. We
will monitor the interaction between branch exemption and regulatory
changes for the insurance industry. Since the publication of the draft
clauses we have worked with the life insurance sector to ensure that
branch exemption is available to
them.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000213">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government are tabling six amendments in three groups to ensure that
the legislation functions as intended and to provide certainty to
business and protection to the Exchequer.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000214">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendment 123
applies to the anti-diversion rule, which will prevent any branch
profits that have been artificially diverted from the UK from becoming
exempt. It is designed to be broadly consistent with the CFC rules. The
amendment makes it clear that chargeable gains are not within the scope
of the anti-diversion rule, consistent with the CFC rules on which it
is based. Amending the rules will prevent any loss of tax, while
providing business with
clarity.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000215">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amendments
124 and 128 will ensure that the transitional rules apply to
transferred businesses in the same way as any other business that moves
into exemption for the first time. The transitional rule protects the
Exchequer where loss relief has previously been given to a branch and
would not otherwise be clawed back—by taxing subsequent
profits—once branch profits become exempt. Branch exemption is
an optional regime and the election is made on a company-by-company
basis. That gives groups of companies flexibility in their use of
exemption, but means that we need to ensure that the transitional rule
cannot be side-stepped by intra-group transfers of business.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000216">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As drafted,
the clause does not give the right result in two significant
circumstances. First, where the transferor of the business is not UK
resident there would be an inappropriate application of the rule to
losses for which no corporation tax relief was ever given. That would
act as a disincentive to a company looking to invest in the UK by
moving its branch headquarters here. It runs counter to the policy aim
of creating competitive conditions for businesses wanting to invest in
the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000217">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
the rule will not be fully effective where the transfer of business is
made to another group company, which is exempt before the transfer
takes place. As currently drafted, this would enable companies to
side-step the transitional rules through transfers of business to
companies already in
exemption.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000218">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Let
me turn now to the final group of amendments. There are rules in
existing legislation for chargeable gains and for intangible fixed
assets that deal with intra-group transfers of assets. Those rules
ensure that no tax charge arises on any gain realised in an intra-group
transfer. Instead, any charge is deferred until such time as the asset
is disposed of from the group.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000219">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is
necessary for the branch exemption legislation to set aside such rules,
otherwise a gain made exempt under branch exemption would re-emerge as
a taxable gain when the asset is eventually sold outside the group. To
prevent that, there are rules in schedule 13 to ensure that the
exemption of a gain and a cancellation of a loss arising on a branch
asset are made permanent within the group of
companies.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000220">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Amending
the rules in relation to intra-group transfers and replacement of
business assets will ensure that they have the intended effects,
providing certainty for business 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 435<a class="bkMark" name="Column435">&#160;</a>
                  </div>and preventing risk of tax loss. These amendments ensure that the
legislation works as intended, providing certainty for businesses and
protection to the Exchequer, and I urge the Committee to accept them.
This measure will ensure that the UK remains a competitive location for
businesses and it more closely aligns the tax treatment of branches and
subsidiaries. I therefore propose that this clause and schedule stands
part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000221">&#160;</a>

                     </span>
                  </strong> I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation
of clause 48 and schedule 13. Let me give notice that I intend to press
amendment 101 to schedule 13 to a Division when the
opportunity arises. I want to ensure that we have the same principle
that we have just debated apply to clause 48 as well, but I will not go
over old ground for the sake of the debate here today.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000222">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I have a
couple of points on clause 48. The Minister has helpfully explained
that branch exemption and distribution exemption, as introduced in
2009, effectively mean that profits earned through foreign operations
of UK resident companies will not generally be taxed in the UK except
by reason of the controlled foreign company rules or other rules
intended to prevent the artificial diversion of profits from the
UK.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000223">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
legitimate area of concern is that because both subsidiaries and
branches of companies are eligible for exemptions there could be a
significant loss of transparency, which the Minister has touched on.
None the less, I would welcome his further assurances that branches
that do not have the same reporting requirements in many countries that
subsidiaries have will not result in a reduction of transparency of
taxation measures.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000224">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I am
concerned that the difference between a branch and a subsidiary is
clear. There are countries where that difference is palpable. I want
the Minister to tell me whether he and his officials have considered
that difference, whether he has any concerns about the reduction in
transparency that those changes will bring, particularly with regard to
the treatment of branches, and whether he will give us an assurance
that he will continue to press in the G20 for greater transparency so
that multinational companies can be held to account for their actions.
I will be grateful to the Minister if he  can give me a
response. If he cannot, I will push amendment 101 to a
Division.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000225">&#160;</a>

hon. Gentleman for his support of what we are trying to do in clause 48
and schedule 13. He is right to make the point that the regime for
subsidiaries was introduced by the previous Government, and the clause
and schedule ensure greater consistency between subsidiaries and
branches. We believe that is the right thing to do because it will help
to create a level playing field across different business operating
models and in some respects tax considerations should not drive the
choice of business model—subsidiaries versus
branches.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000226">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">A UK-resident
company must prepare accounts showing worldwide profits, including all
branches. So there will still be that level of transparency. It will
not be affected by clause 48 and schedule 13. The right hon. Gentleman
touched on the broader issue of greater transparency within the tax
system and I have made the point in

industries. We support greater transparency in that area specifically,
but also more generally we look favourably on steps to ensure that the
opportunities for avoidance that may have existed historically can be
reduced. We think that the measures contained here are proportionate,
appropriate and a step in the right direction. We want to move towards
a more territorial regime in which we tax the profits that arise within
the UK but do not try to tax profits that arise elsewhere. That is the
direction that we are pursuing in the clause. I hope that it will have

grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising those questions. Let
me first say a little about clause 49. It makes changes to introduce a
new tax framework for investment trusts, including the removal of rules
that have imposed unnecessary restrictions on the commercial activities
of investment trusts in the UK. The changes introduce a new, modernised
framework that provides increased certainty for investors and reduced
costs to businesses. It is worth bearing it in mind that the rules have
remained unchanged since 1965, so they are perhaps overdue for reform
and modernisation given the change in the investment landscape over the
past 46 years. The changes have been greeted with support from
the investment trust community, which welcomes the proposals that we
have set
out.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000276">&#160;</a>

the negative procedure, under which hon. Members will be required to
pray against those motions to enable a debate to take place. I assure

that under subsection (4) subsequent regulations would use the negative
procedure. As I said earlier, we will publish the final guidelines in

                  <strong> </strong>I want to discuss the clause because it
raises interesting issues on which it is important that the Minister
responds. It relates to taxable benefits on company cars and, with
effect from 6 April 2013, modifies the current appropriate percentage
bands and carbon dioxide emission thresholds by revising the relevant
threshold down to 95g of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kilometre from the current
100
grams.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000294">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
background to the clause is relatively straightforward in that the
appropriate percentage of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> emissions multiplied by the
list price of a car, adjusted for any taxable adjusted accessories,
provides the level of chargeable benefit for company car tax for
employees and the level of class 1A national insurance contributions
for employers. From 6 April 2012, the graduated table of company car
tax bands will provide for a 0% band for zero-emission cars, which is
welcome, a 5% band for ultra-low emission cars, which means emissions
of 1 to 75 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kilometre, and a new 10% band
for other low-emission cars, but with a 1% increase for each rise in
emissions of 5 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kilometre above 100 grams of
CO<p class="Sub">2</p> to a maximum of 35%.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000295">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The clause
changes the 10% band for low-emission cars to 76 to 95 grams of
CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kilometre from 6 April 2013. The rule
under which there is a 1% increase in the appropriate
percentage for each rise in emissions of 5 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per
kilometre above 100 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p> to a maximum of
35% will apply instead to each rise in emissions of 5 grams of
CO<p class="Sub">2</p> per kilometre above 95 grams of CO<p class="Sub">2</p>.
Long-winded and complex as it is, that means that there will be an
impact on nearly all company car drivers from April
2013.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000296">&#160;</a>

would welcome the Minister’s confirmation that this is in effect
a tax rise for all those who drive a company car that is anything other
than ultra-green in its CO<p class="Sub">2</p> emissions. I will not urge my
hon. Friends to vote against the proposals, but I recall that before
the election, the Labour Government were accused on a number of
occasions of introducing “stealth taxes”—I think
that was the phrase, as my hon. Friends may recall

occasion disturbed by Divisions. I came to the House from the Home
Office, which is more than eight minutes’ walk away, to vote.
That is not a particularly contentious point. Ministers in the current

rings,  to go from a Government office to the House of Commons
to vote. That is a side issue in today’s

business nor anyone else’s what car I drive now. If he wants to

cars. My car is paid for from my salary as a Member of Parliament,
which is the only income that I, unlike some other Members, receive.
That is a matter for me and my bank. The clause is about company cars.
Will the Minister and the hon. Gentleman tell me that the clause raises
the cost of company cars, is a stealth tax and has a green purpose,
which we support, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Sefton

say to the Minister, so that she can reflect on these matters, that the
measure, while it will increase costs for motorists and company car
users and while it will raise money for the Treasury, is specifically
designed to be a green measure and, therefore, to help to reduce the
environmental impact of larger vehicles. I ask the Minister again what
assessment she has made of the environmental or behaviour-changing
effects of the proposals? Does she have a target to get company car
drivers, and therefore fleet buyers, to reduce the litre size of the
engines of the cars purchased? At the moment, she has indicated that
the measure will, on average, impact on the two-litre motorist. Has she
done any modelling in the Treasury of the potential impact on the size
of cars bought by fleet buyers? We need an assessment of whether the
change in taxation will change the behaviour of those who currently
have company cars and who will hold them for the next three, four or
more years. Has the Minister made any assessment of the number of
people who will be affected by the change based on not only their
future behaviour but their previous behaviour? That is

                  </strong> Mr Hood, it is a pleasure to see you in the
Chair today. Clause 51 makes changes to company car tax rates that will
take effect from 2013. The shadow Minister calls it a stealth tax, but
I hardly think that a tax that will be introduced in two years can be
described in such a way. In fact, company car tax provides for the
benefit-in-kind charges under income tax and employer’s national
insurance contributions that apply to company cars. As I said, these
rates were announced at least two years in advance precisely to give
business some certainty about the level of tax involved in the
provision of a company car. That broadly mirrors the previous
Government’s approach in giving advance notice of company car
tax regime changes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000323">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As we have
heard, the typical lifespan of company cars is around four years, so
less than half of current cars will be affected. The right hon. Member
for Delyn asked about the number of cars that will be affected. About
30 million cars are driven around the UK and about 1.1 million of those
are company cars. We assess that less than half of current company cars
will be affected by the
measure.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000324">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
the right hon. Member for Delyn pointed out, the company car tax regime
was reformed in 2002, and is now based on CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub">
</p>emissions. As we explained, that has had the effect of
encouraging the uptake and development of more fuel-efficient cars in
company fleets and has resulted in average new car emissions being
reduced by around 30g/km by 2010. The changes made by the clause are in
response to the continuing and rapid advances in vehicle technology.
For example, industry data show that for the average brand new company
car, the average CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub"> </p>emission level fell from
166.6 g/km in 2006 to 153.4 g/km in 2009. That is a reduction
of 2.7% per annum, which I am sure all hon. Members welcome. To help to
encourage businesses and drivers of company cars to drive the most
environmentally-friendly cars, the clause sets out key changes to apply
in
2013-14.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000325">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">From
6 April 2013, the appropriate percentages for all vehicles with
CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub"> </p>emissions between 95g/km and 219g/km will be
increased by 1 percentage point. Effectively, that will result in a
freeze in rates for cars emitting under 95g of CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub">
</p>per kilometre. Committee members will know that it is an EU
target that all new cars will emit only 95g or less by 2020. So to
achieve this overall measure, the relevant CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub">
</p>thresholds in the graduated table of company car tax bands will
be moved down by 5g per kilometre. Zero CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub">
</p>-emitting cars retain the appropriate percentage of 0%, and the
5% rate will also remain for ultra-low carbon cars emitting
between 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 446<a class="bkMark" name="Column446">&#160;</a>
                  </div>1g and 75g of CO<p class="Sub">2</p>
                  <p class="Sub"> </p>per kilometre. The right hon.
Member for Delyn referred to the importance of the
company car fleet, which feeds into the second-hand car market, so
encouraging the uptake of cleaner company cars will also have
beneficial effects on the second-hand car fleet in due
course.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000326">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It is not
easy to estimate how much extra company car drivers will pay, because
that will depend on the list price, the CO<p class="Sub">2</p> emissions, and
the employee’s income tax rate in 2013, but an illustrative
example is that a Ford Focus driver paying the basic rate of income tax
could see an increase of around
£34.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000327">&#160;</a>

company car drivers who will bear most of the tax increase will be
those with the biggest and most CO<p class="Sub">2</p>-emitting cars.
Ultimately, we must strike a balance between ensuring that the company
car tax regime keeps up with changing technology, and that the tax
regime has the same impact on people who are lucky enough to have a
company car—most people with a job in this country do not have a
car as part of that job—and encourages them to pick an

                  </strong> I want a short debate on the principles of clause
52 and the accompanying schedule 14, and some of the comments that have
been made on them. They make three changes to the special rules for the
tax treatment of income from the commercial letting of furnished
holiday accommodation. They extend the rules, restrict tax relief for
losses, and tighten qualifying
criteria.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000335">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
first change extends the special rules to the
letting of property outside the UK but in the European economic area.
The second change removes income tax relief for losses against general
income and terminal losses, and removes corporation tax relief for
losses 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 447<a class="bkMark" name="Column447">&#160;</a>
                  </div>against total profits. The third change extends the length of the
periods for which the accommodation must be available to be let, and is
actually let if it is to qualify as holiday accommodation. The first
and second changes take effect from the 2011-12 income tax year, and
for corporation tax beginning on or after 1 April 2011. The third
change takes effect for income tax from 2012-13 and for corporation tax
on or after 1 April
2011.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000336">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Minister will know that those proposals caused some discussion prior to
the election when they were proposed by the then Labour Government, and
that some changes have accordingly been made. I should like some
clarity from the Minister on a number of areas that are still a cause
for
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000337">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
we know, clause 52 covers the changes on how aspects of income and
gains from furnished holiday lettings will be taxed. A property letting
qualifies as a furnished holiday letting if it passes a series of tests
outlined in the legislation, such as the number of days it is let out
for and the time it is available to
let.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000338">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
have had a number of fair representations from the Chartered Institute
of Taxation relating to the available-for-let test. The current
proposal is to increase the test from 140 days to 200 days a year,
which could create some difficulties for some businesses that operate
furnished holiday lettings—in particular, where planning or
other conditions attached to a property restrict the periods during
which a property can be
occupied.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000339">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
CIOT makes the strong point that the let test increase from 70 to 105
days will be problematic in some parts of the United Kingdom. My hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh South and the hon. Member for East
Antrim—if he was here—will be interested in this issue
because the length of the days in the far north of the country means
that the tourist season in both Scotland and Northern Ireland is very
short, so dealing with that higher let-out day count from 70 to 105
days will be
difficult.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000340">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">I
could have tabled an amendment that covered those particular issues,
but I thought that it would be better to test out the Minister in our
clause stand part discussions. Can he assure me that he has considered
the issue in detail and that he is satisfied that the let test from 70
to 105 days will not adversely affect those distant parts of the United
Kingdom, such as Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the tourist
season is particularly short? Do the Government intend to keep the
qualifying period under review in the light of the effect that these
changes might have on some of the more remote tourist areas in the
United
Kingdom?<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000341">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
old test of 70 days was roughly equal to the UK holiday letting season,
and the 105 days might be more difficult to achieve. The new rules will
also extend to countries in the EEA. What assessment has the Treasury
made of the specific cost to the Exchequer of extending the plans to
countries outside the UK? These points are worthy of a response from
the Minister because they have been raised before and are
still a matter of some
concern.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000342">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">There
have also been discussions on the uncertainty among taxpayers on the
distinction between a trading business and a rental business such as a
furnished holiday letting. I would welcome some
clarity from  the Minister on the boundary between
self-catering accommodation, bed-and-breakfast and budget hotels,
because it is difficult to determine.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000343">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">What comment
does the Minister have on the representations that have been made by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales that the
distinction based on whether a furnished holiday letting owner lives on
site and therefore is in occupation is based on established case law?
Such an interpretation is not widely applied. The Minister needs to
address this lack of clarity over the distinction and the lack of
guidance from
HMRC.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000344">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">One
of the issues that the CIOT has put to me about this particular clause
is that there should be, as part of the review of small business
taxation, some clarification of the boundary between those who operate
trading businesses and rental businesses to provide greater certainty
for taxpayers. It has also asked how and when the impact of these
changes will be felt. In particular, it is referring to the economic
impact on the recovery. Is the Minister likely to review this policy at
any time? Will he look at this on an annual basis? Is this now set in
stone for the period of the clause? What assessment would he make of
the fragile potential tourist industry and the impact of these
changes?<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000345">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">The
definition of furnished holiday letting is based on the number of
letting days and it could be argued that that is a blunt instrument
because the number of letting days varies in different parts of the
United Kingdom. Is there any assessment of having a different letting
day period for different areas? I know that is difficult but the
Minister will be aware that Northern Ireland, the north of Scotland,
west Wales, west Cornwall and the Scilly Isles have different lengths
of tourist season from other parts of the UK where there are furnished
holiday
lets.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000346">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 52 makes changes to the furnished holiday
lettings regime in a way that is fair to UK businesses. It supports the
Government’s objective of maintaining a competitive and stable
tax system that is compliant with European law. To that end, current
legislation on furnished holiday lettings will be amended to ensure
that the tax treatment of those with furnished holiday letting
properties within the European economic area is the same as the tax
treatment of those with furnished holiday lettings properties within
the UK; to support the role of the tourism industry in the UK economy
and the employment and enterprise it provides; and to ensure that the
tax rules for furnished holiday lettings are appropriately targeted,
affordable and provide value for
money.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000348">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
furnished holiday lettings rules allowed beneficial tax treatment to UK
property businesses, but not to those in the EU. That may not have been
compatible with EU law, so the previous Government announced in 2009
that they would abolish the regime after a temporary extension to the
EEA. It is worth putting this debate in some kind of context, because
the plans that we inherited would have abolished the furnished holiday
lettings treatment for all businesses, regardless
of days of availability of letting. As part of the wash-up before the
election, we negotiated the removal of the clause
abolishing the regime. To have pressed ahead 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 449<a class="bkMark" name="Column449">&#160;</a>
                  </div>would have had an adverse effect on UK businesses and the UK tourism
industry. Instead, we committed in the coalition agreement and the June
Budget to finding a path that would retain the rules, consulting the
industry to ensure that the solution was workable, fair and fiscally
responsible.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000349">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The changes
made by schedule 14 will affect around 65,000 businesses, most of which
are run by individuals. The existing furnished holiday lettings
legislation applies to properties that are used to provide commercial
furnished holiday lettings. Income from such lettings is technically
property income—the old schedule A for those who remember these
things. But the income qualifies for certain specified tax treatments
for trades: enhanced capital allowances, sideways loss relief, certain
capital gains reliefs and pensionable relevant UK earnings. To qualify
for that tax treatment, the business must be carried on commercially,
and with a view to a profit, and pass certain other tests. Two of the
tests concern periods of availability to let at 140 days and actual
lettings of 70 days per year.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000350">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">To ensure
that the extension of the relief to the EEA is affordable, changes to
the legislation are being made to target the tax allowances at
businesses run on a truly commercial basis. Such commercial businesses
support the UK tourism industry and the economy. Accordingly, we have
retained the reliefs related to capital allowances, capital gains and
pension advantages as these are most beneficial to commercial
businesses. However, the provision for sideways loss relief has been
removed. In addition, to reflect the modern extended holiday season,
the period for which a property is required to be available is
increased to 210 days and that for which it is actually let to 105
days.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000351">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">As
part of our consultation during the autumn, the Government acknowledged
the possible obligation to extend the regime to EEA properties.
Accordingly, the consultation proposed to change the qualifying
conditions and limit some of the tax advantages to offset the
additional cost to the Exchequer of the extension. At the same time
properties let as commercial businesses would continue to benefit from
favourable
treatment.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000352">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">A
number of comments were made during the consultation and we tried,
wherever possible, to accommodate them. First, some respondents were
concerned that the increase in the thresholds for qualifying days would
be difficult to meet. The original proposal was changed to allow a
period of up to two years when the need to meet the actually let
threshold could be waived, providing there was a genuine intention to
let. Additionally, the Government have decided to delay the
introduction of the threshold change by a year to help businesses adapt
to the new requirements. Secondly, some respondents were concerned that
the new thresholds would have a negative impact on more remote letting,
especially in Scotland—a point raised by the right hon.
Gentleman.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000353">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">It may be
more difficult for certain outlying areas to meet the tests every year,
but the new period of grace should go a long way to help those
businesses meet the tests. We do not believe that we can introduce
differential thresholds. That would raise state aid difficulties. The
new thresholds were those that we were advised by  the main
interest group would reflect a level attainable 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 450<a class="bkMark" name="Column450">&#160;</a>
                  </div>by properly commercial businesses. We have consulted
extensively, as I said, but received no proposals on geographical or
seasonal definitions, which would allow thresholds to be varied in a
way that meets policy objectives and legal
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000354">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
Government recognise that remote locations face particular challenges.
They also have particular attractions. The Government encourage people
in remote locations to find innovative ways of exploiting their
advantages and overcoming their obstacles so as to meet new occupancy
thresholds. The period of grace is designed to help businesses that
fail to meet the occupancy threshold for up to two years. Therefore, a
business needs to meet the thresholds for only one year, not three. The
introduction of the increased thresholds has been delayed by a year to
allow businesses to adapt their letting strategies. Those should be
particularly helpful to regions where the new rules may be more
challenging.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000355">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">In response
to the consultation, some respondents regretted the removal of sideways
loss relief, especially in the early years, but the package should be
viewed as a whole. Although loss relief is restricted, beneficial
capital allowances and capital gains treatments have been
retained.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000356">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
right hon. Member for Delyn asked how much it cost to extend the
revised rules to the EEA. Extending the regime to EEA states and
reversing the repeal of the furnished holiday lettings rules is
estimated to cost the Exchequer £20 million in 2011-12. However,
the changes made by the Bill will rapidly reduce the costs going
forward, as the restrictions to loss relief and the increase in the
thresholds feed through. It is anticipated that there will be decreased
yield from chargeable gains in the longer term, but insufficient
information is held to produce a robust estimate of that
decrease.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000357">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman asked about the distinction between furnished holiday
lettings and, for example, bed and breakfasts and hotels and so on. The
distinction depends on whether the business is a trade or property
business. Furnished holiday lettings are actually property rental
businesses that are treated as trades for certain tax purposes. The
activities performed by the proprietor do not amount to a trade.
However, if the proprietor provides significant services—for
example, meals—the business may be a trade, in which case it
would enjoy all the trade tax benefits. The status of the business will
depend on the individual facts of the case.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000358">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The right
hon. Gentleman asked whether there is an intention to review the issue.
There is no intention for a formal review but, as he will be aware, all
taxes are reviewed from time to time. We do not have any intention at
this point of reopening this particular area. We believe that the
retention of the furnished holiday lettings regime has been widely
appreciated by the tourism industry. The changes to rules will provide
for EU-compliant legislation in a targeted and cost-effective way. We
have a good compromise, which protects revenue but maintains the
furnished holiday lettings regime that the previous Government sought
to remove. We believe that it serves a valuable purpose and we are
pleased to have been able to continue in this targeted way.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000359">&#160;</a>

                  </strong> Clause 53 introduces legislation to ensure that the
existing tax rules that rely on the accounting treatment of lease
transactions continue to operate as they currently do. Much of the
corporation tax and income tax code for lease transactions is based on
accounting definitions and the resulting entries in accounts prepared
in accordance with either UK generally accepted accounting practice or
international accounting
standards.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000366">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Fundamental
changes to lease accounting are expected in international accounting
standards during 2011. The changes proposed will remove the distinction
between finance leases and operating leases, amend or remove other
currently defined terms and alter the way that amounts are quantified
for accounts
purposes.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000367">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">UK
generally accepted accounting practice may also introduce similar
fundamental changes to lease accounting as early as 2013. If the
proposals go ahead as planned, the current tax rules will not work as
originally intended and, in some situations, will not work at
all.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000368">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause 53
will require businesses that account for lease transactions to treat
them, for tax purposes, as if the proposed changes to lease accounting
had not taken place. The clause will apply to any business, whether as
lessee or lessor or both, that accounts for lease transactions using a
lease accounting standard that is newly issued or changed on or after 1
January 2011. The clause is not intended to alter the current tax
treatment of leases in any way, and as such is expected to be revenue
neutral.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000369">&#160;</a>

               <p class="tabbed">Amendments 185
and 186 ensure that the clause operates correctly in all cases. The
draft legislation was published for consultation in December 2010. No
comments were received during the consultation period. As such, the
legislation was unaltered when the Finance Bill  was published
in March. However, it has recently been brought to our attention that
in certain limited circumstances, when a business chooses to change
from one standard to the other, it would be required to ignore the move
for all tax purposes, not just for purposes related to the taxation of
leases. That would create not only an administrative burden for the
business but also potential avoidance opportunities, as profits might
be deferred or removed entirely from the tax net. To prevent this
unintended consequence, the amendments will ensure that the generally
accepted accounting practice that a business uses for calculating
taxable profits is the same as that used in the accounts for all
matters except for leasing transactions. The proposed amendment also
simplifies the
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000370">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">Clause
53 is an interim measure. When the dust has settled and we have some
certainty regarding the accounting changes, we will review the
appropriate way forward for leasing taxation in the light of the new
rules. The review will focus on providing stability and certainty for
the future, and, of course, any consultation would be carried out under
the new tax policy-making
framework.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000371">&#160;</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tabbed">The
clause will require tax profits and losses for lease transactions to be
calculated as they are currently, irrespective of any changes made to
the way the lease transactions are accounted for. This will provide
some clarity to businesses involved in those transactions in the
interim period before the new accounting standards are introduced. I
therefore commend the clause and I urge the Committee to accept the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="11060730000372">&#160;</a>
