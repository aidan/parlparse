Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): I beg to

move amendment No. 398, in clause 86, page 66, line 21, leave out from

&#145;authority&#146; to end of line

24.</div><a name="0605125000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is good to

welcome you back to the Chair,Mr. Chope. The clause provides

that a magistrates court will be able to take into account

non-attendance at a reintegration interview when imposing a penalty

order. It also permits regulations to restrict the power to seek a

parenting order where the school that a child attends is not in the

area or when the child does not reside in the area. The amendment would

remove the restriction on seeking a parenting order where the child

does not reside in the area of the local authority. If a child is at a

school in a local authority area, the fact that that child resides

outside that area should be irrelevant to the local authority&#146;s

decision.</div><a name="0605125000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that

the power to restrict the actions of the authority with respect to

pupils outside its area is not used in the draft Education (Parenting

Contracts and Parenting Orders) (England) Regulations. I hope that the

Minister can accept the

amendment.</div><a name="0605125000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000298"></a>The

Minister for Schools (Jim Knight):</b> It is a pleasure to

serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Chope.</div>

<a name="0605125000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">New section 22A of the

Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, which the clause inserts, contains a

number of regulatory powers that, as we have heard, are intended

primarily to avoid duplication in the use of parenting contracts and

orders and to ensure that relevant bodies liaise with one another

before using the measures. Our intention is that the school or

authority in which the child is currently educated should normally take

the lead in using the measures, unless the pupil has been permanently

excluded from a school outside the authority in which they live, in

which case the home authority or the receiving school should normally

take the lead.</div><a name="0605125000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

exception to those arrangements, which is addressed by the amendment,

is where the schools or local authorities have entered into local

agreements to the contrary. Such agreements could, for example, be

between schools working in partnership or between 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column873" />Column number: 874</div>neighbouring authorities. The indicative regulations to which the hon.

Gentleman referred demonstrated those

intentions.</div><a name="0605125000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I

understand, the hon. Gentleman seeks to remove an aspect of the

Government&#146;s proposed regulation-making power, which we believe

would prevent us from making comprehensive regulations and lead to a

lack of clarity for schools and local authorities about which body

ought to take the lead in the various circumstances that I have

described. The amendment would make those cross-border collaborations

much more difficult to achieve. The regulation-making powers are

necessary to provide clarity about how an arrangement agreed between,

for example, the education authorities in Dorset county council and

Poole borough council would work. I am sure that we all agree that such

collaboration can be useful for children where there is a lot of

movement across borders, as there is in the constituency of the hon.

Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke), for

example.</div> <a name="0605125000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

the hon. Gentleman understands our intent, can agree with it and will

for exclusions longer than 15 days they are expected to ask the local

education authority for

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000301"></a>Jim

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000323"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The clause relates to the duty of the local

authority in respect of excluded pupils. The authority must make

full-time arrangements for children excluded from schools and pupil

referral units who have not been accepted by another school, and for

pupils excluded for a fixed period from pupil referral units. That must

be done by the prescribed day. It is helpful of the Government to have

distributed the draft regulations so that we can look at them in

connection with the relevant clause.</div>

<a name="0605125000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulation 4 of the draft

Education (Provision of Full Time Education for Excluded Pupils)

(England) Regulations defines the relevant day as the sixth day of a

fixed period exclusion, in the case of pupil referral units, and the

sixth day of a permanent exclusion. It also states that where the pupil

was temporarily excluded immediately before the permanent exclusion

while the behaviour giving rise to the exclusion was being

investigated, the duty begins on the sixth day of the temporary

exclusion&#151;so it is not necessary to start again once the

permanent exclusion begins.</div>

<a name="0605125000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present there is no statutory

time limit on providing that education. All local authorities are

currently committed to providing education for 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column875" />Column number: 876</div>permanently excluded pupils from the 16th school day following an

exclusion. The regulatory impact assessment states on page 292 at

paragraph

19.7:</div><a name="0605125000250"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A PSA

target was introduced in 1999 that by September 2002 all local

authorities in England would be providing suitable full time education

for their permanently excluded pupils from the sixteenth day following

the head teacher&#146;s decision to exclude the pupil. However, this

target proved extremely difficult to achieve. At the beginning of 2002

it became clear that a substantial number of local authorities would

not meet this critical target despite additional funding. A consultancy

firm was engaged to work directly with local authorities and CEOs were

asked personally to sign an undertaking to meet it. Although all

authorities achieved the target by the specified date they have had

difficulties sustaining it and at no time have all 150 local

authorities met this

commitment.&#148;</div><a name="0605125000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph

19.8 states:</div><a name="0605125000251"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As

far as we are aware, all but two local authorities are currently

meeting this commitment although as one authority meets the commitment

another is found not to

be.&#148;</div><a name="0605125000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">Given the

difficulties that local authorities have had in meeting the 16-day

target, even with extra funding, how confident is the Minister that

simply making the matter statutory, albeit with a little more funding,

will enable local authorities to meet the six-day

target?</div><a name="0605125000072"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605125000324"></a><b class="B">Annette

Brooke</b> (Mid-Dorset and North Poole) (LD): I shall make

some brief comments on clause 88&#151;clause 87 flashed past me

before I could jump up to speak. I want to put it firmly on the record

that we are very supportive of this provision. It is vital to provide

full-time education for excluded pupils. Again, we are talking about a

slippery slope: once someone is out of education, they never get back.

I believe that the hon. Gentleman was right to ask about the details,

and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s

answer.</div><a name="0605125000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605125000325"></a><b class="B">Mr.

David Chaytor</b> (Bury, North) (Lab): One factor that may

have caused the difficulties in reaching the target is the reluctance

of some schools to accept pupils who have been excluded from other

schools. Although the clause places a welcome new duty on local

education authorities, it does not specify how they are expected to

fulfil it. I want to mention the role of the protocol for hard-to-place

pupils, which some local authorities have already implemented, while

others are working on it. It is a crucial part of the range of measures

that a local authority can use to fulfil the duty in the

clause.</div><a name="0605125000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Will my hon.

Friend the Minister say something about the Government&#146;s view on

the protocols, and if he cannot do so now, will he write to the

Committee? I am sure that all members of the Committee recognise that

there is increasing concern about the differential distribution of

hard-to-place pupils in schools. Some schools display active resistance

towards accepting such pupils. The only way to resolve that is by

sensible peer group discussion between head teachers and the local

authority. The local authority&#146;s role is crucial, but so is a

firm steer from the

Government.</div><a name="0605125000075"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000326"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It is useful to have had a clause stand part

debate, which has not always been a feature of these proceedings,

because this is an important move forward to set a much more ambitious

requirement&#151;not just a target&#151;for local authorities in

respect of their duty to continue the education of excluded 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column876" />Column number: 877</div>pupils. I welcome what hon. Members&#146; said in welcoming the shift

from 16 to six days. As the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole

said, it is very important to ensure that we can keep the education of

excluded pupils going so that they do not end up becoming permanently

excluded from education as a

whole.</div><a name="0605125000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the question

from the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), all

but two local authorities are meeting the 16-day target, as he said. At

no time have all authorities met the target, but all have met it at

some time, if people know what I mean. I am confident that local

authorities will meet the new requirement of six days. We are making

&#163;16 million of funding available to local authorities to help

them to meet the requirement. We will circulate information on good

practice in achieving it and we will certainly monitor carefully the

vulnerable in respect of their education, can be properly

served.</div><a name="0605125000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605125000327"></a><b class="B">Mr.

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The

Minister is right: these are vulnerable children. According to his

description of the performance of local authorities so far, the

position is both variable and fragile, in that authorities are moving

in and out of where they ought to be. I suspect that that is because

the pressures on them depend on the numbers of excluded children at any

one time. My experience of the issue goes back to the time when I was a

member of an LEA, and frankly the position historically has not been

particularly good. What measures will the Minister put in place to

ensure that the House is able to know what the position is? Will he

report back regularly on the progress that has been made against the

new statutory

requirements?</div><a name="0605125000265"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000328"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The hon. Gentleman says that authorities move in

and out. Clearly, authorities on the margins are moving in and out, but

I am not persuaded that the majority are moving in and out. Clearly for

the majority it will be less challenging than for those who are on the

margins moving in and out, and we might have to look at how we allocate

that &#163;16 million of funding accordingly to assist those that are

struggling to fulfil their obligations.</div>

<a name="0605125000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">In respect of reporting to the

House, I am sure that that is a subject about which hon. Members of all

parties will remain concerned and will want to continue to scrutinise

Government on. I will seek to assist that scrutiny as and when it comes

about, and I am sure that hon. Members will ensure that the House hears

from us regularly about how we are doing in this area.</div>

<a name="0605125000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the important point made by

my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor), the Government

are strongly encouraging all schools to agree a local hard-to-place

pupil protocol to share hard-to-place pupils. That includes any group

of pupils that schools may have difficulty placing who

seek 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column877" />Column number: 878</div>admission outside the normal admission round, including excluded pupils.

Over half of schools have agreed such a protocol, and we expect all

schools to do so by September 2007, which is also the time by which we

expect all secondary schools to be working in local partnerships to

improve behaviour and tackle persistent truancy. We are seeking to

co-ordinate those aims and achieve them by September 2007 at the

latest. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend and that the

Committee will agree that clause 88 should stand part of the

Bill.</div> <a name="0605125000081"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question put

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000329"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 399, in clause 89, page

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000330"></a>The

Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss

amendment No. 400, in clause 89, page 68, line 17, leave out

&#145;request&#146; and insert

&#145;require&#146;.</div><a name="0605125000085"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000331"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The clause gives the Secretary of State the power to

make reintegration interviews mandatory. The interviews are conducted

with the parents of excluded children prior to their readmission to the

school. Guidance currently only recommends that schools offer

reintegration interviews to parents following an exclusion&#151;they

do not have to do it. Often parents do not have to attend and do not

attend, although failure to attend such an interview can be taken into

account when considering an application for a parenting order, which we

discussed on clause

86.</div><a name="0605125000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Steer report

recommended this measure in clause 89, and the White Paper recommended

that a requirement for parents to attend reintegration interviews be

put into legislation. We totally agree with that. The regulatory impact

assessment says that legislation is required to make interviews

mandatory. Schools that fail to carry them out may be directed to do so

by the Secretary of State.</div>

<a name="0605125000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments would enable head

teachers to require parents to attend an interview, as opposed to

requiring them to request that they do so. We feel that the clause as

currently worded is the wrong way round and may not impose a duty on

parents to attend these interviews, merely requiring the head teacher

to ask them to attend. We feel that to require the head teacher to hold

an interview yet not require the parent to attend is to reverse

responsibilities. If anyone has discretion over the reintegration

interview, it should be the head teacher and not the

parents.</div>

<a name="0605125000088"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000332"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> We strongly support the principles here. This is

important. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman and I see his

point, but we need a balance, and it is important to work

co-operatively and try to make progress in the best possible way,

perhaps achieving a little more before resorting to the parental order.

It is a difficult balance, and I can see the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column878" />Column number: 879</div>argument, but I want to listen to the Minister, because working with the

parent until the crunch point is reached will probably achieve more in

these

circumstances</div><a name="0605125000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000333"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We have heard a good explanation of what the

amendment is designed to achieve, but I believe that it would undermine

the actions that we are taking to implement the recommendation of the

practitioners group on school behaviour and discipline, that schools

should be required to offer parents reintegration interviews. As we

have heard, the amendment would make that a matter for the head

teacher&#146;s discretion rather than a

requirement.</div><a name="0605125000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

intention is that the interviews be mandatory, with schools being

required to offer them and parents being expected to attend them, and

that the parent or carer be held accountable for not attending. That is

what Steer recommended, and we endorsed it in the White Paper. I

recognise that many schools already offer parents reintegration

interviews and that it is accepted good practice. That is why we want

to ensure that all schools offer

them.</div><a name="0605125000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 400

is unnecessary. It states that parents should be required to attend an

integration interview. If we were to do that, there would need to be a

commensurate penalty for non-attendance, such as a fixed penalty notice

fine, because failure to attend would be a breach of the law. We have

already considered that possibility, but decided that it would be

excessive and inappropriate. Furthermore, a requirement to be in a

particular place at a particular time would risk violating article 5,

the liberty section, of the European convention on human

rights.</div><a name="0605125000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

provisions in the Bill, however, that allow for a legal consequence

should the parent fail to attend, to which the hon. Member for Bognor

Regis and Littlehampton referred. Clause 86(2) states that the failure

of a parent to attend a reintegration interview may be taken into

account by magistrates when deciding whether to make a parenting order.

In view of that, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the

amendment, and that the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole is

satisfied with my explanation and will support the

clause.</div><a name="0605125000093"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000334"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that response to the amendments. I

think that parents should be held accountable, and that the way in

which to achieve that would be to make the interviews mandatory. Rather

than imposing a criminal penalty, such an interview could be a

condition of re-entry for the

child.</div><a name="0605125000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall have to

see how the provision works in practice, and whether we find that

parents do not attend the interviews. If the reality is that they do

attend, there will not be a problem to address. We shall monitor the

position, but in view of the Minister&#146;s confidence that there is

not a problem with not requiring parents to attend reintegration

interviews, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="0605125000095"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

restricts traditional civil liberties and we should not simply let it

and (2) require the parent of a child excluded from school to ensure

that the child is not in any public place in the first five days of

their exclusion. Subsection (7) defines &#147;public place&#148; as

virtually anywhere other than the child&#146;s own home or,

presumably, garden. I suppose that most people would find that

sensible. After all, presumably we do not want an excluded child to

think that they are on holiday&#151;exclusion must be some sort of

punishment. Most people might think that if a child has been excluded,

it is no bad thing if he is kept at home, and that that should be a

deterrent or punishment tied up with the exclusion. Otherwise, the

child might view it as an opportunity to go to the cinema or wander the

streets.</div><a name="0605125000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">I imagine that

most people would be quite happy with that sentiment, but then we move

on to the middle part of clause 90. This is a probing amendment, but it

raises the serious issue of what is effectively an extension of the

criminal law. The subsections that I want to leave out may, I believe,

go too far. Obviously, by definition, the excluded pupil is difficult,

if not downright impossible, and will probably take no notice of any

penalty suffered by his parents, so long as he does not suffer

himself.</div> <a name="0605125000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">The measure

Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): We must

excluded from our schools are bullies who continue to bully children

even though they have been excluded from school, so it is important

that we let the clause stand. What does the hon. Gentleman think of

that?</div><a name="0605125000105"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000337"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> That is right&#151;we all know that&#151;but

the hon. Lady&#146;s point is not so much a question to me as a

debating point that she could make in her own time. We all know that

many excluded children are absolutely impossible and make life hell for

their parents and other kids, and we all know that the parents of many

excluded children are irresponsible, but for all that, this is the

House of Commons, and the point of this place is to protect

people&#146;s civil liberties. 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column880" />Column number: 881</div>Before we rush into making law, let us just think it through and have a

little debate on

it.</div><a name="0605125000106"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605125000338"></a><b class="B">Mrs.

Nadine Dorries</b> (Mid-Bedfordshire) (Con): I would like to

the state for the record that not all excluded children have

behavioural problems. Many of them&#151;the figures are

huge&#151;have special educational needs. If their needs had been

addressed sufficiently, they might not have been excluded in the first

place.</div><a name="0605125000107"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000339"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Of course, that is a point. We cannot generalise

and say that all excluded children, or their parents, are utterly

irresponsible. There are many reasons why children might be

excluded.</div> <a name="0605125000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even if the

parent is responsible and tries to keep the child in, he could easily

escape from home. Those things happen. To fine such parents&#151;we

are talking about an offence for which there will be fines, rather than

a rap over the knuckles or being summoned to see the head

teacher&#151;when the excluded child escapes from home and plays in

the park or loiters in the street could make matters worse. After all,

will an impossible child change his behaviour just because mum has been

fined? Do we really believe that? Often, in such cases, mum is in

severe personal difficulties: that might be the reason why the child

has behavioural problems and has been excluded in the first place. The

child probably will not change his behaviour because mum has been

fined, but fining mum might put her into even more difficulties, and so

the vicious circle continues.</div>

<a name="0605125000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">A more subtle approach might be

needed, but I do not have a solution. I suppose that putting the child

into some kind of sin bin would be considered to be politically

incorrect nowadays and would be opposed by the Children&#146;s

Commissioner, so we apparently are not going to go down that route, we

are just going to make ourselves all feel better by creating another

offence. We know that there is a real problem in society. How many

criminal justice Bills have we had in the past 10 or 15 years? How many

more offences have we created? Does anybody actually believe that

putting another offence on the statute book will make a great deal of

difference?</div> <a name="0605125000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have

doubts about the concept of house arrest. I do not like it; it does not

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000340"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am listening very carefully to my hon. Friend. I

gave the clause a great deal of thought when we were considering

whether to table amendments to it. I do not see how, in terms of

liberty, the situation differs in any way from the offence of truancy.

Parents are committing an offence if they do not send their 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column881" />Column number: 882</div>child to school. How is this different? The only reason a specific

offence is needed in this instance is that we are dealing with pupils

who are excluded from school and who are, by definition, not committing

an offence by not being at school. I cannot see the difference in

constitutional terms.</div>

<a name="0605125000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000341"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> There may be a slight difference. A parent

still&#151;thank God&#151;has the right to educate their child at

home, if he or she wishes to do so, but there is, rightly, an offence

of truancy. There is general public acceptance that a parent has a duty

to get his or her child to school. We are debating an extension of

that&#151;the creation of a new offence. The child has been excluded

and has been put under what is, in effect, house arrest, and the

parent&#151;in many cases a parent who is in severe personal

difficulties&#151;is now to be fined if the child escapes from home.

Any parent here will know that it is not always easy to keep a child

in. Homes are not prisons. We should think this through before we rush

to put it on the statute book. Are parents going to lock the doors to

keep the child in? Presumably if a parent goes out shopping and his

child wanders out into the street, that parent will be committing an

offence. The proposed measure is an interesting extension to the

criminal law, is it

not?</div><a name="0605125000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000342"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I pick up on my hon. Friend&#146;s point about

creating personal difficulties for the parents. I have constituents who

are in enormous personal difficulties because they cannot send their

children to school, because their children are being bullied at school

by the type of children that the clause deals

with.</div>

<a name="0605125000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000343"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am not defending bullies. It is a very good idea

not to allow a child who is excluded to roam the streets. All that I am

saying is that the clause&#151;it will be agreed to; I will probably

not even press the amendment to a vote&#151;is another extension of

the criminal law, and it is incumbent on us to ask the Minister what he

means by it. There is no point in putting it on the statute book unless

he is prepared to enforce it. We all know what is going on in the Home

Office. So many duties are imposed on the Home Office, the police and

everybody else that it is increasingly difficult to enforce the

legislation that we already have. Perhaps the best thing that this

Parliament or any future Parliament could do would be to pass no

legislation at all for the next five years, but simply ensure that what

we have on the statute book is enforced.</div>

<a name="0605125000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">To convince us that he can

enforce the measure, the Minister will probably say that the police and

local authorities will be able to take the circumstances into account

and consider whether there has been an honest attempt by the parent to

keep the child at home. Let us hear what he has to say. However, I, as

one who was brought up to be a traditional Tory, believe that our duty

here in the House of Commons is to protect civil liberties. We live in

a liberal democracy and I do not believe that we are here just to make

ourselves feel good. The reason why there are such problems in society

is not that there are too few laws or too few offences, but that

society is dysfunctional in many ways. Many people think that society

gives them rights but not responsibilities or duties. We all know that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column882" />Column number: 883</div>those problems are far greater than anything that we can solve in this

room today.</div>

<a name="0605125000117"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000344"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> For the second time in a few days my hon. Friend

and I disagree. The dysfunctionality that he describes is not a feature

of people having too little liberty; it is a consequence of their

having too much. What society needs&#151;and children doubly

so&#151;is order, security and discipline and, as he said, a sense of

responsibility. The Government recognise that, and it seems to be what

they are encouraging.</div>

<a name="0605125000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000345"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> Well, if we disagree, we disagree. Of course, we

all want children to be well behaved, and have ordered lives and caring

parents. We all want parents to take their child to school in the

morning as my mother, and your mother, Mr. Chope, used to do, and

preferably to pick them up in the afternoon. We were brought up in

loving families; when we came home mum was already there with the tea.

But that is the dream world, not the real world that people in many

parts of the country live in today. An attempt to impose our will in

the way proposed raises serious questions about enforceability, which

we should at least debate before we accept the

clause.</div><a name="0605125000119"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0605125000346"></a><b class="B">Sarah

Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I have great sympathy with the

sentiments voiced by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and I

share his anxieties about the clause, although I completely understand

its intentions. I wholly agree that if a child has done something so

serious that the consequences are exclusion from school, it is

important to involve the parents, who should know the reasons for the

exclusion and take responsibility for their child. However, in many

cases the breakdown in the child&#146;s behaviour will be the result

of problems at home.</div><a name="0605125000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">My

concern centres on the definition of reasonable justification, and I

hope that the Minister will reply to my questions on the matter. The

clause states that an offence will have occurred unless there is

&#147;reasonable justification&#148; for the parent being unable to

keep the child away from a public place, but it is not clear to me

exactly what that means. For example, will it cover a single parent who

is paid by the hour and is unable to take five days off work to look

after the child? What would be the consequences for the child&#146;s

welfare if there were a substantial drop in income? Is the proposal

actually realistic?</div>

<a name="0605125000121"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000347"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I have had constituency cases of parents who cannot

send their children to school because of bullying. They face all the

problems that the hon. Lady highlighted. We need to tackle those

problems first before we start worrying about the parents of children

who cause problems at school.</div>

<a name="0605125000122"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000348"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very trite point. I

was just as irritated when he intervened on his hon. Friend the Member

for Gainsborough. No one is questioning the need to tackle bullying or

bad behaviour in schools. We are asking whether the proposal is

enforceable and practical and what will be the consequences of applying

the offence to vulnerable 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column883" />Column number: 884</div>families. I am not questioning the need to take serious action, and the

hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention was unjustified.</div>

<a name="0605125000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">My concerns are about what would

qualify as reasonable justification. Are we talking about severe

financial penalties on a family that is already on a low income? What

about a child who is already so out of control that the parent is

unable to keep that child at home? Let us suppose that the child in

question is a physically strong teenager. Parents in my constituency

have come to see me to express huge concern about their

children&#146;s behaviour: they have been physically threatened,

perhaps even with a knife or a gun, because the children are on drugs

and they have been stealing from the parents. What are the consequences

for such parents if they are unable to keep their child at home? There

are parents in such circumstances.</div>

<a name="0605125000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I am sympathetic to the

Government&#146;s intentions, I am extremely worried about the

practical implications of the clause. I will need considerable

reassurance from the Minister if I am to support the

clause.</div><a name="0605125000125"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000349"></a>Ms

Smith:</b> I apologise for the lack of clarity in my

intervention. I support the clause, but, like the hon. Member for

Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I challenge the notion that it offers a

legal power that is any different from that which applies to the

responsibilities of parents whose children are truanting. It is the

same concept; it offers the same legal penalty for, in effect, the same

offence.</div> <a name="0605125000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The argument

advanced by the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather), that the

parents of children who are excluded may not be able to take time off

work to look after their children when they are excluded from school,

does not stand the test. If we are saying that parents cannot be held

responsible because they have to work, we throw into doubt the entire

power of exclusion. We as an authority&#151;as a

Government&#151;and schools would be putting children at risk if we

accepted that parents need not take responsibility for their children

by making appropriate arrangements if they are excluded. That would be

legally challengeable.</div>

<a name="0605125000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this modern era of education,

and certainly since 1997 and the advent of the Labour Government, many

measures have been put in place that should minimise the number of

exclusions. The hon. Member for Gainsborough mentioned sin bins. The

proper term is learning support units and they were introduced in 1997

the under excellence in cities programme as part of a range of measures

for learning mentors for the gifted and talented. Pupil referral units,

mentioned in the Bill, are used both pre-exclusion and post-exclusion

to cater for children who have difficulties in school. We also have the

hospital and home education service. With the advent of

children&#146;s services, we surely have the best chance for a

generation to ensure that the whole package of measures introduced

since 1997 works to minimise exclusion.</div>

<a name="0605125000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">The fact remains, however, that

some children continue to pose a problem to their school and to the

other children there. My husband is 6 ft 4 in tall, and he was

challenged with a knife in a school playground two years ago by an

excluded child. The playground 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column884" />Column number: 885</div>was being opened in front of a number of councillors and council

officials. That child was able to come into the playground and

challenge my husband; the child had no fear whatever. My husband was

later challenged by another excluded pupil who was bullying his own

daughter. We must think of those children before we vote against the

clause.</div>

<a name="0605125000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000350"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> I fully sympathise with the hon. Lady. For

children who have been excluded for malicious or violent behaviour, the

clause is justifiable. However, two thirds of children excluded from

school have special needs. As I said yesterday, 27 per cent. of

autistic children are excluded from mainstream schools: today, 27 per

cent. of autistic children are not attending school. The parents of

such children have an incredibly difficult job. I am loath to mention

the mother of the autistic child who recently committed suicide, but

had the boy been excluded? What sort of difficulties was the mother

battling against? Would she have been subject to the provisions of the

clause?</div> <a name="0605125000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

will probably say that we have spoken previously about introducing

behaviour management policies. However, Sir Alan Steer told journalists

this morning that he was specifically asked not to include special

needs children in his report&#151;a report that informs the

Bill&#146;s provisions on excluded pupils. I would be interested to

hear the Minister&#146;s point of view, because we are introducing a

policy that will affect a huge number of parents. The parents of

children with special needs are already battling against the

odds&#151;they probably have to fight every day for their children to

receive appropriate education. How should the parent of a child with

emotional and behavioural difficulties restrain that child in the home

and stop it moving to a public place?</div>

<a name="0605125000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are dealing with an

incredible number of problems. We are talking not only about children

who behave badly, who bully, or who enter school playgrounds with

knives. We are talking about children who have deep problems. Some of

those problems are associated with language and speech difficulties.

Some of the children will not understand that what they are doing is

wrong.</div> <a name="0605125000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister

has been incredibly generous and compassionate in his attitude towards

special needs children. I am heartened by the fact that he seems to

understand the problem, and I will be very interested to hear his

response.</div>

<a name="0605125000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000351"></a>Mr.

Chaytor:</b> I come to this important debate from a slightly

different point of view. The issue of excluded children was considered

in some detail by the Education and Skills Committee when we considered

the proposals in the White Paper. The Committee said that there would

be serious practical difficulties in implementing those proposals.

Perhaps the greatest argument that could be made in favour of clause 90

is that the practical difficulties of implementation would be so great

as to discourage schools from excluding so many

pupils.</div><a name="0605125000267"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.45

am</div><a name="0605125000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge

the dilemma that will face the parents of a child who is out of

control&#151;who has over time 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column885" />Column number: 886</div>behaved in ways that are completely beyond the capacity of trained,

experienced school professionals to control&#151;if they are forced

at short notice or immediately to keep that child under house arrest

for a fixed period of time. That is difficult. I also acknowledge the

comments by the hon. Member for Brent, East about the impact on

parents&#151;particularly single parents&#151;who work all the

hours God sends for the minimum wage. How can they reasonably be

expected to get out of work? What are the consequences for their future

employment prospects if they have to drop everything at short notice to

take responsibility for keeping their child at home for that five-day

period? The definition of &#147;reasonable justification&#148; in

subsection (3) is important. Would a parent be able to claim reasonable

justification for not complying because they simply cannot get out of

work, or they fear the consequences for their future employment if they

leave work on that day?</div>

<a name="0605125000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">I specifically want to draw

attention to the definition of the five-day period. In subsection (6),

it is quite clear that if a child is excluded in the morning, the

afternoon is the starting-point of that period. A child could be

excluded at 11.55 am with that day&#146;s afternoon session being

counted as the first half-day of the five-day period. That seems to

make it even harder reasonably to expect the parent to take

responsibility for that child at 1pm if the exclusion was at that time.

The position is further complicated by clause 91, which requires head

teachers to issue a notice to parents specifying the terms of the

exclusion. Perhaps I have misread or misunderstood that completely but

I do not understand how, if a child can be excluded in the morning with

the five-day period beginning that afternoon, the head teacher can,

during a lunch time period and without knowing where the parent is,

issue a notice to the parent informing them of the start of that

period. The practical difficulties of implementation seem to make that

requirement almost unworkable.</div>

<a name="0605125000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge the comments made

by the hon. Member for Gainsborough on the legal implications and the

temptation that we in government frequently face&#151;the temptation

to pass new laws and assume that that solves the problem, without

trying to get to the root of it or considering the detailed

implications of those new laws&#151;I am particularly concerned about

the detail of how the measure would be implemented given the definition

of the five-day period and requirement to issue the

notice.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000352"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Perhaps we should be grateful to the hon. Member

for Gainsborough for stimulating this useful debate. I detect that the

hon. Gentleman may not be speaking for his party, given the

interventions from his Front-Bench colleagues. It might be interesting

if he were, given that he wants no laws to be passed for five years.

Perhaps that makes sense, since we are familiar with the notion that

there are no policies. However, I note that the hon. Gentleman was not

speaking from the Front Bench so I will not labour the point.</div>

<a name="0605125000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 90&#151;as we have

heard&#151;creates a new duty for parents to ensure that their child

is not present in a public place during school hours during the first

five days of exclusion. The amendment would mean that 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column886" />Column number: 887</div>while the parent had that duty, there would be no consequence for them

if they failed in it. The hon. Gentleman has explained that he is not

sure whether he is precisely right, but he wanted to air the debate and

that has been done.</div>

<a name="0605125000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause does not state that

the child must be at home. It does not impose house arrest, or state

that the excluded pupil should be locked up at home. Indeed, there

might be some difficulty in terms of false imprisonment, for example,

if that were to be done. The Government simply want to ensure that the

child is safe and properly supervised, and is not in a public place

causing a problem.</div> <a name="0605125000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

stress that the clause applies only to normal school hours, and, as the

hon. Member for Brent, East and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury,

North have discussed, it allows a defence of reasonable justification.

The hon. Lady is right to focus on that phrase, because it is critical

to making the measure workable. It is fair to ask what would constitute

reasonable justification. We recognise that in some circumstances it

may be necessary for a child to be out in a public place on a day when

they are excluded. They might, for example, have a pre-arranged medical

appointment or there might be a medical emergency needing immediate

attention. Similarly, there might be a pressing need for the parent to

seek medical help, and they might think it inappropriate to leave the

child at home unattended and be unable to make alternative

arrangements.</div> <a name="0605125000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">More to

the point, as was mentioned by the hon. Lady and my hon.

Friend&#151;whose comments I always have to take seriously, in the

light of his knowledge and experience&#151;the older and larger the

child and the more difficult it is physically to compel him to remain

at home, the more likely it is that the parent will be able to claim a

defence of reasonable justification. The courts will have to interpret

that, but if it is unreasonable to expect a parent&#151;perhaps a

frail parent&#151;to restrain a large, strong and burly child, who,

as the hon. Lady described, might be armed or under the influence of

drugs, that may well be a reasonable justification that the court would

bear in

mind.</div><a name="0605125000142"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000353"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Will the Minister consider issuing some

guidelines before Report stage? We support the principle of getting

parental involvement after a child is excluded, but we are concerned

about the vagueness of the term, and the considerable distress that

might be caused to a family for the long period that might be needed to

take the matter through the courts, when there might be a perfectly

reasonable justification for the child&#146;s being in a public

place.</div><a name="0605125000143"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000354"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am certainly willing to look at the draft

guidance that we have published and to reflect on our debate in that

respect. Perhaps all members of the Committee would like to examine the

guidance. If they think that there is a problem with it, I hope that

they will feel free to contact me and let me

know.</div>

<a name="0605125000144"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000355"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Bowing to the pressure from my hon. Friend the

Member for Gainsborough and the hon. Member for Brent, East, the

Minister has just told the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column887" />Column number: 888</div>Committee that reasonable justification might include the inability to

deal with any child who displayed extreme disruptive tendencies, if

they were strong and big and so on. That description might be applied

to any child&#151;certainly any boy&#151;over the age of 12 of the

type likely to be excluded for exactly those reasons. Is that not an

all-embracing justification that will make the law almost impossible to

enforce?</div><a name="0605125000145"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000356"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> No, I do not think so. The courts will have to

make a judgment about whether a parent has taken reasonable steps,

given their and the child&#146;s circumstances. There may be

circumstances in which dealing with the matter will be genuinely

difficult for the parent. The courts and the guidance will have to be

sensitive to that. I hope that all members of the Committee will

consider the matter on that basis.</div>

<a name="0605125000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The report of the practitioners

group on school behaviour and discipline, chaired by Sir Alan Steer,

made several recommendations designed to make exclusion from school a

more effective sanction. The group believed that it was important that

excluded pupils should not waste time wandering the streets and making

a public nuisance of themselves. Its view, which we share, is that in a

democratic society parents must take responsibility for their children.

The Steer group recommended that parents should be responsible for

ensuring that their child is properly supervised during the first five

days of exclusion and that the child attends appropriate provision from

the sixth day. As we have heard, we are changing the law to bring it to

the sixth day.</div> <a name="0605125000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

listened to the points made by the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire

(Mrs. Dorries), which we largely discussed yesterday. I said then that

the Steer report stated that further, more detailed work was needed to

consider issues involving SEN pupils, and that is certainly something

that I want to pursue.</div>

<a name="0605125000148"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000357"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I have a question about the extremely difficult

cases where the parent cannot control the child, for whatever reason.

Does the Minister envisage any particular support, such as a hotline,

being made available? To take us back to yesterday&#146;s debate, how

will he ensure that a multidisciplinary approach is taken and that

social services are fully involved? I would like to see more of that in

guidance, as well.</div>

<a name="0605125000149"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000358"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> That is certainly something that I can consider.

The Government, through the respect agenda, are seeking to bring

together the various elements of Departments, local government and so

on in order to tackle some of the serious problems that are causing a

nuisance and worse to our constituents. We acknowledge that some of the

children in question are very vulnerable and we have heard that some

have specific needs that need to be addressed. That can only be done in

the round and I am certainly happy to look closely at how we engage

with all agencies to try to minimise the effects of such

problems.</div>

<a name="0605125000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000359"></a>Mrs.

Dorries:</b> Will the Minister clarify whether Alan

Steer&#146;s further report on children with special educational

needs will be ready by Third Reading? 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column888" />Column number: 889</div>Given that two thirds of excluded children have special needs, the Steer

report has only considered one third of the children who are excluded.

Sir Alan was asked expressly not to look at children with special

educational needs, as was confirmed this morning. Why has he produced a

report on only a third of excluded

children?</div><a name="0605125000151"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000360"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> As I said, we discussed this at some length

yesterday. Perhaps at this early stage in my ministerial position I am

guilty of having exhausted my knowledge and thoughts with what I said

to the hon. Lady yesterday. She has certainly been successful in

persistently and consistently raising such points and causing me to

want to reflect on them. I promise her that I will do

that.</div>

<a name="0605125000152"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000361"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole

makes a powerful point about the mechanisms that might be put in place

to allow co-ordination between different agencies and support for

parents in such circumstances. Is the Minister prepared to consider

addressing those specific points in guidance? The &#147;Every Child

Matters&#148; agenda, with the subsequent structural changes in local

authorities, will help, but it seems to me that, particularly in

relation to this part of the Bill, guidance would be helpful for all

concerned.</div>

<a name="0605125000153"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000362"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> As I have said, we have published the draft

guidance. I shall reread the report of the debate and ensure that when

I agree the final guidance, the comments that have been made and

reasonable points that have been raised are properly dealt

with.</div> <a name="0605125000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend

the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith) effectively outlined

the measures that we were taking to minimise exclusions and the way in

which we have sought to address the

problem.</div>

<a name="0605125000155"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000363"></a>Mr.

Hayes</b> <i class="I">indicated assent.</i></div>

<a name="0605125000156"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000364"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I see the hon. Member for South Holland and The

Deepings nodding; he acknowledges that some progress has been made in

that area.</div> <a name="0605125000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">Parents

must take their responsibilities seriously. We have made it clear that

we expect parents to take responsibility for excluded pupils in the

first five days of their exclusion by ensuring that they are doing

school work and not wondering the streets. Under current arrangements,

parents might have to take time off work to attend to their excluded

children in the initial stages of exclusion. That was a point of

concern raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury,

North.</div><a name="0605125000268"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10

am</div><a name="0605125000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are not

requiring parents to take time off work. They will have to ensure only

that adequate supervision is in place, and that could be provided by

another relative or responsible adult. Where a child is excluded from

school, the parent can rely on the right to time off work for

dependants to deal with the situation when it first arises and to put

care 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column889" />Column number: 890</div>arrangements in place. That is the advice that we have received, and I

hope that that is

helpful.</div><a name="0605125000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that

that arrangement might involve a loss of income for some parents, which

is a real issue given the concentration of exclusions in areas and

families suffering from deprivation. However, in the context of

reasonable justification, it will be incumbent on those involved to

assess whether an individual has made every reasonable effort to find

alternative arrangements for the supervision of their children. Again,

we should all reflect on that, and the courts will have to do so in

time.</div> <a name="0605125000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I

have said enough in responding to this useful debate to encourage the

hon. Member for Gainsborough to withdraw the

amendment.</div>

<a name="0605125000161"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000365"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I am grateful that the Minister will bring out

draft guidance. He is between a rock and a hard place on this issue,

because some of these kids are physically difficult to control.

However, if people have a blanket excuse that their son is over 12 and,

by definition, quite strong, they will not comply with the clause and

there could be very few prosecutions indeed.

</div><a name="0605125000162"></a><div class="hs_Para">None the less, the

Minister has given a characteristically good summing-up. We have had a

good debate and have aired the difficulties of enforceability and

reasonable justification, which are important. I might table a

parliamentary question in a year&#146;s time to see how many people

have been prosecuted under the clause, and I suspect that very few will

have been, for all the reasons we have discussed. However, we shall

see.</div><a name="0605125000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that,

there is one area of consensus, and we all agree that we want to

promote parental responsibility. Some of us are worried&#151;we have

said so already, and there is no point labouring the issue&#151;about

how the criminal law can be made to work in this difficult social

area.</div>

<a name="0605125000164"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000366"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> Of course every exclusion is a little tragedy for a

family, and the people we are discussing are often vulnerable&#151;I

am particularly concerned about special needs children and the volume

of exclusions among young black people&#151;but the law must have

force in this respect if we are to encourage the responsibility that my

hon. Friend seeks. I hope he will come round to my view that people

want certainty and security, not ever more unbridled

liberty.</div>

<a name="0605125000165"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000367"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> I believe that more liberty engenders more

responsibility, which is why I am a Liberal Democrat on this issue, as

well as a traditional Conservative&#151;if that is possible, and I

think it is. My hon. Friend and I have so many things in common, but we

differ slightly on these issues, which is something we shall have to

live with.</div><a name="0605125000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I am

grateful that the Minister is thinking not simply about house arrest,

but about other ways of proceeding. We have had a good debate, and I

beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000370"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> The clause provides authorised officers with the

power to give penalty notices where a parent fails to ensure that their

excluded child is not in a public place, and it follows on very much

from the debate that we have just had. Under the definition in

subsection (7), an authorised officer means a constable, as one would

expect, but also</div>

<a name="0605125000254"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;an officer of a local

education authority...who is authorised by the authority to give

penalty notices, or an authorised staff

member&#148;.</div><a name="0605125000173"></a><div class="hs_Para">An authorised

staff member is then defined as</div>

<a name="0605125000255"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a head teacher of a relevant

school in England&#148;</div><a name="0605125000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">but, in

parenthesis,</div> <a name="0605125000256"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;other than

member of the staff of a relevant school in England (other than a pupil

referral unit) who is authorised by the head teacher of the school to

give penalty notices&#148;.</div><a name="0605125000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment is probing as we want to find out why subsection (7) excludes

the head teachers and staff members at pupil referral units from

issuing notices. I do not understand why that should be the case. When

I first read the clause, I thought that it was because pupil referral

units could not exclude pupils. However, later in the Bill, there is

mention of what happens when pupils are excluded from a pupil referral

unit, so obviously that is not the reason. I am very interested to know

why those staff members are

excluded.</div><a name="0605125000177"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000371"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The amendment would allow the teacher in charge to

be automatically designated as a person who may issue a penalty notice,

rather than his having to be designated as such by the relevant local

authority, because a reference to a head teacher is taken as being a

reference to the teacher in charge of a pupil referral unit under

schedule 1 of the Education Act

1996.</div><a name="0605125000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The teacher in

charge will also be able to authorise other members of the PRU to give

penalty notices. That offers advantages. It means that authorities will

not have to put in place designation processes, and teachers in charge

of PRUs will have the same powers as head teachers of maintained

schools when it comes to issuing penalty notices to a person guilty of

an offence under clause 93. Furthermore, it will ensure that penalty

notices issued under these provisions are treated consistently with

those issued under section 23 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000375"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Flushed with success, I live with high expectations.

Subsection (6) of section 444A of the 1996 Act

states:</div><a name="0605125000258"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sums

received by a local education authority under this section may be used

by the authority for the purposes of any of its functions which may be

specified in regulations&#148;.</div>

<a name="0605125000187"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill amends that by stating that funds

that are not spent by the local education authority must be paid to the

Secretary of State. That is all to do with the proceeds of the penalty

notices that we have been discussing. I am not sure how much money

there will be if my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough is

right.</div>

<a name="0605125000188"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

404 would leave out &#147;may&#148; and insert

&#147;must&#148;. &#147;May&#148; is usually used to imply

thatthe requirement is optional. The draft Education Penalty

Notices (England) Regulations 2007 state, at regulation

22:</div><a name="0605125000259"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Any sums

received by local education authorities by way of penalties must be

applied in meeting the costs of issuing and enforcing notices, or the

cost of prosecuting recipients who do not

pay.&#148;</div><a name="0605125000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">So,

&#147;may&#148; is not used in the draft regulations. Contrary to

the Bill, the regulations do not appear to require local authorities to

pay the money to the Secretary of State if it is not used in that

manner.</div><a name="0605125000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">Can the

Minister confirm that there will be a requirement for any surplus to be

handed over to the Exchequer regardless of what the regulations say? I

am concerned that we should avoid the perverse incentives that arise

when bodies that levy fines benefit from their proceeds. I strongly

believe that, regardless of the issue, whether it concerns education or

parking, the proceeds of any fine levied by a body other than the

courts should not go to that body. That is why we end up with traffic

wardens trawling quiet residential streets at8.31 am to pile

on parking fines&#151;not to clear roads to allow traffic to flow

freely, but to raise revenue for local authorities. The decision to

allow local authorities to keep that revenue created all those perverse

incentives.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000376"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I do not want to disagree with my hon. Friend,

having already disagreed with my hon. Friend the Member for

Gainsborough, but surely there is an argument that the money raised in

fines in a particular area should be spent in a relatively similar

area. If money is simply absorbed by the Government, it will be spread

all over the place. Is there not an argument for

hypothecation?</div><a name="0605125000192"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000377"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> There is, but it is not one that I accept. There is

an adage of common law that goes back centuries: the body that levies

the fine should not benefit from the proceeds of that fine. Since I

have been in the House, I have tried to make that point at every

relevant opportunity because it is a terribly important principle of

law and governance. This happens too often, and it will happen under

the

Bill.</div><a name="0605125000193"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000378"></a>Sarah

way?</div><a name="0605125000194"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000379"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I give way to the hon. Lady with trepidation for

fear of the trite comments I might

receive.</div><a name="0605125000195"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000380"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> Actually, I was going to make a trite but

sympathetic comment on the division between the two Conservative

Front-Bench spokesmen, on the basis that I agree with the hon. Member

for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, and my colleague the hon. Member

for Mid-Dorset and North Poole agrees with the hon. Member for South

Holland and The

Deepings.</div><a name="0605125000196"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000381"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> Now I feel guilty about my ungracious acceptance of

the hon. Lady&#146;s intervention. I do not think that we need apply

collective responsibility to our debates on these important and

interesting issues of principle.</div>

<a name="0605125000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have said enough on the point.

I am not convinced that people are likely to trawl the streets and

other public places looking for excluded pupils to raise millions of

pounds for local authorities or schools, but I make the general point

that it is important to separate those who benefit from fines from the

bodies that levy

them.</div><a name="0605125000198"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000382"></a>Annette

Brooke:</b> I accept the point about traffic wardens trawling

for fines, but perhaps this matter is rather different. Does the hon.

Gentleman agree that if the local authorities kept the money it could

be well invested in behaviour strategies in schools, into which we need

to put a lot more money and

support?</div><a name="0605125000199"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000383"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I am grateful for that intervention, but I would

prefer the regulations to have incorporated the provision that any

surplus after the costs of issuing penalty notices and mounting

prosecutions had been defrayed should be returned to the Exchequer. I

hope to receive that reassurance from the

Minister.</div><a name="0605125000200"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000384"></a>Mr.

Leigh:</b> We should be grateful to my hon. Friend for

initiating this debate, because it takes us on an interesting

philosophical quest. The last debate was a sort of moral maze, and this

one also raises practical points.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column893" />Column number: 894</div><a name="0605125000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is difficult to understand how

my hon. Friends the Members for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and for

South Holland and The Deepings, who share collective responsibility on

the Front Bench, could reach slightly different, nuanced opinions on

this, but that is the joy of opposition: it does not really matter what

we say as we are not going to implement any of our views&#151;at

least not for another two or three years&#151;so we can say what we

like. Perhaps I, too, should have a different, nuanced opinion, just to

create a tripartite structure in the Conservative

party.</div><a name="0605125000269"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

am</div><a name="0605125000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The trouble is

that we constantly say that we want local authorities to be given more

powers and we want to allow them to raise more money locally&#151;we

are all, in theory, in favour of that concept&#151;yet we introduce

legislation that makes it more difficult for money raised locally

through fines or other means to stay in the locality. We have to face

that dilemma.</div><a name="0605125000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

said that, on balance I am with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor

Regis and Littlehampton. I veer towards his view slightly, if only

because he may be a more important person in the parliamentary party

than my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings, so I

want to curry favour with him at this time. Although I agree that this

provision will not raise a great deal of money and we need not worry

about it, the public are worried, particularly in respect of matters

such as parking fines, that local authorities may be a tiny bit too

assiduous on occasion. That may be because they feel that money raised

from the long-suffering public will stay with local government. My hon.

Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raises a serious

and important point: those who impose fines, unless they are the

central criminal authorities, should not benefit from imposing them.

This has been a useful debate and I hope that the Minister makes a good

response so that we can find a way

forward.</div><a name="0605125000204"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000385"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It is tempting for all Government Members to leave

the Room so that you, Mr. Chope, can exercise your casting vote on what

the Conservative policy should be, but I shall explain the purpose of

the clause. It enables the Secretary of State to specify in regulations

the purposes for which sums received by local authorities from paid

penalty notices can be used and&#151;I think this is the reassurance

the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wants&#151;it

provides for any sums not used for those purposes to be returned to the

Treasury. That is our clear policy. It is a technical matter and I

could say many technical things about it, but I hope that I have given

the hon. Gentleman, clearly and succinctly, the reassurance that he

wants and that he will withdraw the amendment so that we can deal with

the remaining amendments in the time

left.</div><a name="0605125000205"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000387"></a>Mr.

Gibb:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second

time.</div><a name="0605125000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">My right hon.

Friend the Leader of the Opposition has supported this proposal for

some time and he recently reaffirmed his support when launching the

Conservative party&#146;s charter for inner-city schools. The new

clause is designed to improve behaviour in schools by giving them the

power to make the signing of the parental declaration of the

home-school agreement a condition of admittance. It would also remove

the prohibition on sanctioning pupils whose parents fail to sign the

contract.</div><a name="0605125000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Home-school

agreements were introduced as part of the School Standards and

Framework Act 1998 and each maintained school and academy is expected

to adopt a home-school agreement, setting out the aims and values of

the school, the responsibilities of the school and of the parent, and

the expectations of the conduct of pupils at the school. The parent is

asked to sign the parental declaration, which indicates that they

acknowledge and accept their responsibilities and the expectations of

their child&#146;s

conduct.</div><a name="0605125000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is,

however, no requirement that parents sign the parental declaration, and

governing bodies are expressly forbidden to use home-school agreements

as part of their admissions process, or to sanction pupils whose

parents fail to sign them. As such, home-school agreements lack any

weight, and public opinion is that many of them are not worth the paper

they are printed on. Only when a child has been engaging in serious

misbehaviour is a more drastic option, such as a parenting contract, a

parenting order or exclusion,

considered.</div><a name="0605125000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our

position is clear. As the Leader of the Opposition said in a speech in

Leeds on 4 April, if parents and children do not sign up to a code of

behaviour and stick to it, they cannot attend. That is clear. We

believe that schools should be able to make acceptance of the

home-school agreement or contract a condition of admittance to a

school. If parents want their child admitted to a school they should be

willing actively to subscribe to that school&#146;s value and ethos.

I do not believe that any parents will refuse to sign the agreements,

but by making it a condition it gives that contract added bite. Parents

will then not regard it as not worth the paper it is printed

on.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column895" />Column number: 896</div><a name="0605125000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our amendment does not remove any

of the existing safeguards on the contents of home-school agreements in

the legislation. Subsection (2) of section 111

states:</div><a name="0605125000260"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;If the

Secretary of State by order so provides, the governing body of a school

to which subsection (1) of that section applies shall ensure that any

form of words&#151;</div>

<a name="0605125000261"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) specified in the order,

or</div> <a name="0605125000262"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) having such

effect as is so specified,</div><a name="0605125000263"></a><div class="hs_brev">is not

used in the home-school agreement or (as the case may be), in a

parental declaration&#148;.</div>

<a name="0605125000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no possibility therefore,

provided that the guidance is properly drafted, that schools will be

able to use the power to exclude pupils for the purposes of social

exclusion. I hope that that will satisfy the hon. Member for Bury,

North that this is not the purpose of this new clause; it is not there

to try and enable schools to manipulate their intake so that they can

achieve better results in the raw figure league tables, it is there to

try to improve behaviour in schools. Behaviour in our schools is a

concern that teachers, head teachers and parents raise continuously. We

have to tackle it and sometimes we have to take draconian measures to

ensure that we have good behaviour in our

schools.</div><a name="0605125000217"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000388"></a>Sarah

Teather:</b> I made most of my arguments when we debated this

point regarding admissions. I will not repeat all of them here again,

especially as we are short of time, but I will place it on the record

that we disagree with the Conservatives on this matter. We think that

home-school contracts can be an extremely useful tool for working with

parents, but we do not think it appropriate to use them in orders as an

admissions policy because we fear, regardless of what the hon. Member

for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, that that would be used to

exclude difficult students and families and it would be entirely

contrary both to the spirit and the letter of the code, of which we

spoke in favour in a previous debate. I will finish now so that we can

hear from the

Minister.</div><a name="0605125000218"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000389"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Home-school agreements are specifically prohibited

from being linked to the school admissions process by section 111 of

the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. This amendment seeks to

invalidate that. I agree largely with what the hon. Member for Brent,

East has just said. It is not a contract in the legal sense and

although schools may and probably should encourage parents to sign the

agreement, parents are not required to do so. Whether a child obtains a

place at a school should not be determined by the willingness of their

parents to sign an agreement, although they can be invited to sign one

after their child has been admitted to the school.</div>

<a name="0605125000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Bognor Regis

and Littlehampton said that he did not believe that any parent would

refuse to sign. I disagree. There may be circumstances in which parents

refuse to sign, which could create some difficult circumstances in

respect of the authority&#146;s requirement to educate the

child.</div>

<a name="0605125000220"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000390"></a>Mr.

Hayes:</b> I make the same intervention on the Minister that I

was going to make on the hon. Member for Brent, East. It seems that as

a matter of justice, if people know where they stand at the beginning

of their 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column896" />Column number: 897</div>child&#146;s career in a school, things are better for all concerned.

If we deal with the matter when something has gone wrong, people might

claim that they were not clear about what was expected of them. That is

what we are interested in: clarity and

fairness.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0605125000391"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I agree that there should be that clarity, which

we discussed in respect of discipline and behaviour earlier, but my

concern is that a child should not be refused because of a

parent&#146;s unwillingness. There may be issues other than a refusal

to sign&#151;they may not have the language or literary skills to

understand the agreements. In respect of parents with other languages
