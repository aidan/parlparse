<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000337"></a>The
Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ian Pearson):</b> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, for
this last sitting.</div>
<a name="10011486000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was saying
this morning that although I have great sympathy with the sentiments
behind new clause 3 and with what my hon. Friend the Member for
Edmonton (Mr. Love) seeks to achieve, I do not believe that
it would be right to include it in the Bill. If the provision were
accepted, the Financial Services Authority would be obliged to take
action in the circumstances described in the new clause with a view to
achieving as comprehensive a solution as was &#147;reasonable and
practicable&#148;, regardless of the effect on market confidence or
financial stability.</div>
<a name="10011486000022"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard
before&#151;I said it again briefly this morning&#151;that in some
circumstances action that benefits consumers in a particular case might
be detrimental to financial stability, which of course could be
prejudicial to the interests of consumers more generally. That
underlines the interplay between the FSA&#146;s objectives. As I said
on amendment 41, we do not want to impose too rigid an approach on the
FSA. What is needed is a sensible and carefully calibrated approach to
taking decisions.</div>
<a name="10011486000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are
other practical reasons why I recommend that the Committee resist the
new clause, although I agree that my hon. Friend has done a service to
the Committee by raising this important matter. By removing the
FSA&#146;s discretion to act, the new clause may constrain the
authority in its ability to achieve informal or voluntary solutions
without taking enforcement action. That could be difficult. On a
practical level, the wording of the new clause could result in the FSA
being required to take some form of action in every case, or at least
to go through the process of considering what action would be
reasonable and practicable&#151;including in relatively minor cases
that do not justify such an intensive use of resources.</div>
<a name="10011486000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is not
clear that the new clause would improve on the present position, under
which the FSA can act if it considers that such action is appropriate
and proportionate. The FSA does not have unlimited resources, and it
must be allowed the discretion to prioritise cases and not to act when
it seems that the costs may exceed the benefits. In its annual report,
the FSA has to say what actions it has taken to achieve its objectives,
which means that it can be held to account for its use of that
discretion.</div>
<a name="10011486000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand
that there has been some frustration that the FSA appears not to have
responded to complaints or evidence submitted to it. My hon. Friend
will be aware that the FSA requires companies to handle complaints
within eight weeks; if dissatisfied, consumers can complain to the
Financial Ombudsman Service. The FOS can raise issues with the FSA as
appropriate. The FSA can also use individual complaints as a pointer to
the possibility of wider problems.</div>
<a name="10011486000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">I accept that
in some cases there may be no way of telling whether appropriate action
has been taken in response to a complaint, another issue that was
raised by my hon. Friend. There are obvious reasons for that. I shall
rehearse some of them. It may be down to fairness, especially before
final decisions have been taken against firms, partly because sections
348 and 349 of the Financial 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column439" />Column number: 439</div>Services and Markets Act 2000 restrict the FSA&#146;s ability to
disclose confidential information relating to the firms that it
regulates. Importantly, it reduces the risk of jeopardising further FSA
action, as section 391 of the 2000 Act constrains the FSA from
disclosing whether it has issued a warning or decision notice against a
person who is the subject of an enforcement action.</div>
<a name="10011486000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We discussed
some of these issues at length before Christmas, although I realise
that my hon. Friend continues to be concerned about such matters. We
would all like consumer problems to be addressed as quickly as
possible, but the FSA is bound by strict standards of evidence and
impartiality. It must investigate hearsay evidence thoroughly, and it
will always look for the most proportionate response to a problem,
which may involve negotiating voluntary action by firms or issuing
guidance. Any rules it makes must be subject to consultation and
cost-benefit analysis. Earlier in the debate we heard that there must
be adequate checks and balances against arbitrary decisions by the FSA.
Imposing deadlines in the way my hon. Friend suggests is not the right
way forward.</div>
<a name="10011486000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">We want the
FSA to be as open as is reasonably possible, but there are good reasons
for being careful about disclosure. They would include the legal and
fairness issues that I have mentioned, but there are also practical
issues. Firms are more likely to provide sensitive information if they
believe that the regulator will deal with it in confidence. Concerns
that information provided to the FSA could end up in the public domain
are likely to change how individual firms behave.</div>
<a name="10011486000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend raised the issue of super-complaints and the proposal for a
super-complaints regime. As he said, such a regime applies to the
Office of Fair Trading and is contained in the Enterprise Act 2002.
However, the OFT does not benefit from a statutory consumer panel,
unlike the FSA which is required to consult the financial services
consumer panel. I realise that is not identical to designating consumer
bodies in the way proposed, but it does give the consumer a powerful
voice at the heart of the FSA.</div>
<a name="10011486000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">As my hon.
Friend knows, we are already giving the FSA tough new powers, and we
have debated clause 26, which will require firms to establish consumer
redress schemes. The FSA can exercise that power when it appears that
there might have been a widespread legal or regulatory breach by firms,
which has caused consumers loss. New powers are being introduced in the
Bill, and I know that my hon. Friend and others will welcome
them.</div>
<a name="10011486000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">The FSA and
the OFT will soon publish a discussion paper on the action they are
taking to ensure that consumers receive swift and effective redress.
That will include a discussion of the way that the regulators and the
Financial Ombudsman Service work together, the roles and
responsibilities of other stakeholders, and how to identify and close
down early emerging issues that might affect large numbers of
consumers.</div>
<a name="10011486000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">The proposals
in the Bill on consumer protection that we have already debated take
the game forward significantly. Clearly, there are continuing live
issues, which can be considered as part of the discussion paper. I hope
that what I said this morning and what I have just said will reassure
my hon. Friend that his concerns are not only recognised, but being
addressed with substance, and that he will feel able to withdraw the
new clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column440" />Column number: 440</div><a name="10011486000033"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000338"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Love</b> (Edmonton) (Lab/Co-op): It is always a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and I
apologise to you, and perhaps more importantly to the Minister for
arriving a few seconds late. I hope I did not miss any of my hon.
Friend&#146;s contribution.</div>
<a name="10011486000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">Naturally, I
am disappointed that the Minister does not see more merit in the new
clause, but I am not surprised that he does not offer it uncritical
support. I am somewhat optimistic because in his contribution he
recognised some of the concerns about how orientated the FSA is to
consumer concerns, and some of the lapses in its promptness and
transparency when dealing with such issues.</div>
<a name="10011486000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall
return to that point, because it bears on the debate that we have just
had, but perhaps I could pick up one or two of the comments made during
the debate. I apologise to the Committee because my opening
contribution on the new clause included a somewhat rhetorical flourish
to suggest that the FSA should become a consumer champion. That may
have been going just a little too far, because I recognise the concerns
expressed by the Minister about the need to balance the differing
objectives of the FSA. That is at the core of how we carry the contents
of the new clause forward. If hon. Members will bear with me, I shall
return to
that.</div><a name="10011486000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to comment on two issues that were raised. Both were about greater
accountability. One of the outstanding issues is the accountability of
the FSA to the public and consumers. A number of contributions
mentioned the need for greater transparency, and the new clause
reflects that. It also reflects the need for prompt action. I hope that
the Minister will take those issues away with
him.</div><a name="10011486000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
was a little less convinced by the Minister&#146;s concern about
bringing rigidity into the way in which the issues are dealt with. That
certainly was not the intention behind the new clause. If that is one
of the concerns, I hope that consideration can be given to making the
measure more flexible so that it really does respond to the
issues raised by many consumer groups and
organisations.</div><a name="10011486000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have to return to what I think was at the centre of the
Minister&#146;s concern about the new clause. He said that, if
accepted, it would rank consumer protection above the other objectives
of the Financial Services Authority. I accept that is an issue and that
the new clause may go a little too far in pushing the
boundaries&#151;perhaps naturally enough, considering that is where
there are major concerns in relation to the FSA. When putting the new
clause together, it certainly was not my intention to skew the balance
too much in favour of the consumer, as I recognise that there are other
important objectives for the FSA, but I accept that it is a
concern.</div><a name="10011486000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is enough concern among consumers in the financial services
marketplace, and it has been somewhat heightened by the turbulence that
we are experiencing in financial services markets; the recession is
bringing out a number of issues that will become very important in
relation to consumer redress. I therefore hope that we will not lose
the measure, but I accept the Minister&#146;s plea that we may have
gone too far. On that basis and on the basis that we will not forget
about the consumer issues that are reflected in the new clause, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
clause.</div><a name="10011486000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000339"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10011486000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am not sure whether there is such a thing as a probing new clause, but
this is an attempt to probe an issue that will be of increasing
importance. New clause 4 is designed to address inequality
and unfairness in financial services. It is particularly timely, as
inequality and unfairness are more prevalent currently, what with the
turbulence that we are going through following the credit crunch and
the recession that we are
suffering.</div><a name="10011486000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 would introduce a new duty to tackle systemic problems of
socio-economic disadvantage. I would like to pray in aid a debate that
I heard this morning on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, featuring
the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The debate
was primarily about 10 years of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act
2000, but the thrust of what the Secretary of State was saying was
that, with the economic difficulties that we are facing, we will come
to deal more with inequality, because that will be at the centre of our
concerns. That is very much at the centre of the concerns expressed
through new clause
4.</div><a name="10011486000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason why I suggested that this might be a probing new clause is that
it draws on the work done in the Equality Bill, which is currently
before Parliament. On Second Reading, it was illustrated just how
important such a clause can be in an Act, with a number of examples
being given of how such a clause might operate to protect those who
suffer inequality and unfairness. If we take the example of
disadvantaged communities, where smoking is much more prevalent than it
is across the community at large, it could be argued that
smoking-cessation programmes would be particularly appropriate, to
address the significant health inequalities resulting from the high
incidence of smoking in those
areas.</div><a name="10011486000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such
clauses could deal with educational disadvantage. Many people in
communities, including my constituency, feel that they do not get
treated equally with regard to access to the best schools in the local
education authority area. Often the problem is down to their lack of
knowledge and information on how to go about the application process.
One of the ways that we could reflect the provisions in such a new
clause would be by ensuring that that information and support was given
to the most disadvantaged&#151;to those families suffering from
educational inequality&#151;in order to give them an equal
opportunity.</div><a name="10011486000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not really have rural areas in my constituency, just a few small
parks, but there are areas across the country where there are low
car-ownership levels and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column442" />Column number: 442</div>where the public transport system is rudimentary to
say the least; sometimes it is non-existent. Local authorities or
central Government might want to subsidise the provision of a bus or
other types of transport services in order to move the balance. The
arguments for addressing such socio-economic difficulties are many and
strong.</div><a name="10011486000048"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000340"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Colin Breed</b> (South-East Cornwall) (LD): I listened
carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said and it contained a great deal
of sense. For instance, the closure of a bank branch in a relatively
remote rural setting, or in a suburb of a larger city, could cause real
socio-economic difficulty, financial exclusion and so on. Might the FSA
have powers, if not to veto the closure, then at least to require the
bank to make a good case for seeking to remove that
facility?</div><a name="10011486000049"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000341"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Perhaps the hon. Gentleman ought to have declared an
interest, as a former bank manager, in raising that issue. He gave a
good example, because there is a strong argument to be made when it can
be shown that the alternative ways in which we can access services
provided by a bank branch&#151;through the telephone, the internet
and other mechanisms&#151;are not available to the community that the
branch serves.</div>
<a name="10011486000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">Through the
new clause, we are trying to draw out the kind of situations in which
it would be appropriate to take such concerns into account before a
decision was made. I do not think that anyone is suggesting that we
should be able to veto an organisation&#146;s decision to close a
branch, but we could inform that decision, so as to make sure that the
widest possible worries were taken into
consideration.</div><a name="10011486000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issues that I have dealt with so far relate to the Equality Bill, a
measure that introduces the same socio-economic duty as is suggested in
new clause 4. However, that duty applies only to central and local
government, and does not go any further. I tabled the probing new
clause because it sets out an attempt to extend that duty to the
Financial Services Authority. There is also a strong argument for
extending it to all economic regulators. I believe that the subject has
come up in debate; no doubt it will feature in the Committee stage
discussions on the Equality Bill in the Lords. I was somewhat surprised
that the FSA and other economic regulators were not included, because
they would have a much greater, more direct impact on the inequality
and unfairness suffered by many people in the
marketplace.</div><a name="10011486000052"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000342"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Mark Hoban</b> (Fareham) (Con): I am trying to follow the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument. Will he give us some examples of what the
FSA might do in pursuit of such an objective? I can understand the
allocation of, say, resources for financial education to more deprived
areas; that is already envisaged in the way in which the consumer
financial education body will implement the Moneymadeclear service.
However, I am not sure where his proposal is heading and what he means
by outcomes in the context of the financial services
sector.</div><a name="10011486000053"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000343"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> The hon. Gentleman must have been reading my mind,
as I was about to focus on that. Earlier, I focused on a wider range of
services not particularly related to the FSA in order to set the
backdrop&#151;to explain why I tabled new clause 4 and why it is
important that the socio-economic duty be extended
to economic regulators. I think that that would bring a number of
benefits. I shall now focus on the FSA, as requested.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column443" />Column number: 443</div><a name="10011486000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause will encourage the FSA to use its existing powers to focus
on areas of concern to vulnerable consumers. For example, the FSA has
the power to look at markets, but it often does so without considering
how those markets impact on different parts of the marketplace,
particularly vulnerable consumers. In the FSA&#146;s investigations
into markets, much greater priority should be given to how markets
impact on vulnerable and poorer sectors.</div>
<a name="10011486000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality
is that the FSA&#146;s primary objective is consumer protection,
which is often seen through the narrower lens of competition. The new
duty would widen the lens so that there was an impact on the most
vulnerable consumers, who lack consumer power and who are often
marginalised. They are not helped by the FSA&#146;s exclusive focus
on competition. I am anxious for the Minister to consider that in his
response on the new clause, because of the issue of how disadvantaged
consumers experience the
marketplace.</div><a name="10011486000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, we all have stories of being bombarded with offers of loans
and of being subject to various other kinds of blandishments from the
financial services market, yet we know that there are many
disadvantaged consumers who do not get those offers. They find it
difficult to access credit and are forced into loans at very high rates
of interest, or are forced into the illegal credit market. It is
important that the FSA considers not only the more general competition
issues in that sort of marketplace but the specific needs of
disadvantaged consumers. That will happen only if we engage with new
clause 4 and give the Financial Services Authority that socio-economic
duty.</div><a name="10011486000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 4 will also address the shortcomings in the Financial Services
Authority&#146;s conduct of business regulations. It is criticised
for not placing enough emphasis on the relative disadvantage faced by
vulnerable consumers. Sub-prime mortgages, for example, are mainly
taken out by middle and lower-income consumer groups; very bad
practices have emerged in that particular sector of the mortgage
market. Take, for example, the right to buy: many people exercising
that right have been sold mortgages that they simply cannot afford in
the longer term. That has not been experienced particularly
in the rest of the marketplace, but it is a feature among the
disadvantaged groups. New clause 4 would have led the Financial
Services Authority to act sooner and would have prevented many
consumers from experiencing events that were to their severe
detriment.</div>
<a name="10011486000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">I conclude by
suggesting that we need a combination of the Equality Bill&#146;s
provisions for central and local government and a socio-economic duty
on economic regulators such as the FSA. Working together, they could
have a significant impact on the experience of many disadvantaged and
vulnerable consumers in the marketplace and in the provision of public
services. As I say, new clause 4 does for parts of the private sector
what the Equality Bill will introduce for public sector
bodies.</div>
<a name="10011486000059"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000344"></a><b class="B">John
Howell</b> (Henley) (Con): The hon. Gentleman has mentioned
the Equality Bill on a number of occasions. I sat on the Equality Bill
Committee, and I remember the discussion about the socio-economic duty.
The difficulty is that that Bill deals with discrimination. The
unhelpful nature of the socio-economic duty blurred the distinction
between discrimination and disadvantage, with the result that it
tackled neither. The disadvantage element was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column444" />Column number: 444</div>handled in many other ways by many other different
pieces of Government legislation. Blurring the two led to feelings of
confusion in the Committee on whether the duty would achieve
anything.</div>
<a name="10011486000308"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="10011486000060"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000345"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I accept that there are dangers. Indeed, the
discussion on this morning&#146;s &#147;Today&#148; programme
touched on a number of cases where discrimination is still very much a
factor. Because of the economic circumstances, disadvantage is now
coming to the fore.</div>
<a name="10011486000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause may go part of the way to addressing the disadvantage element,
but we should not lose our concern about discrimination. Indeed, there
are many groups that would ensure that we do not lose it.
Discrimination still exists for women in equal opportunities, and for
ethnic minority communities. It is often the case that people who are
discriminated against are also to be found among disadvantaged and
vulnerable consumer groups, so it is not always easy to tell whether it
is discrimination or disadvantage that is acting against them. It will
often be a combination of both.</div>
<a name="10011486000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point is
valid, but I want to ensure that economic regulators&#151;in this
instance, the Financial Services Authority&#151;have a duty to ensure
that disadvantage is taken into account in their consideration of the
reviews or actions that they are likely to take to support
consumers.</div><a name="10011486000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that by using both the Equality Bill and, if it is accepted,
new clause 4, we can begin to address some of the more severe
disadvantages that many vulnerable consumers face in the marketplace. I
therefore commend it to the Committee.</div>
<a name="10011486000064"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000346"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I thank my hon. Friend for what he calls a
probing new clause. Of course, the Government do not disagree with the
spirit in which it has been proposed. The Government believe that
tackling socio-economic inequality is of great importance. Over the
past 12 years, we have demonstrated our commitment to
creating a fair society with fair chances for everyone. We are proud of
our record on reducing inequality, and we are putting further measures
in place to deal with it.</div>
<a name="10011486000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend will be aware that a 2008 report by the OECD showed that income
inequality and poverty fell faster in the United Kingdom than in any
other OECD country between 2000 and 2005. For the first time since the
1980s, the UK poverty level is well below the OECD average. In short,
the Government are, and always have been, a champion of greater
equality. However, although we fully support the spirit of the clause,
it is not necessary or appropriate, and I doubt whether it would in
practice have the effect that my hon. Friend intends.</div>
<a name="10011486000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shall give
my reasons for reaching those conclusions. First, the services provided
by the entities that the FSA regulates are, in many cases, essential to
people's lives, and lack of fair access to them may well influence
socio-economic outcomes. The Government believe that the best way for
the FSA to contribute to tackling these issues is by focusing on its
day job as a specialist financial services regulator. Overarching
social issues are matters for the Government, and
we are dealing with that. We are addressing socio-economic equality in
financial services in other ways, too: we have a financial inclusion
strategy to ensure that everyone has access to appropriate financial
services.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column445" />Column number: 445</div><a name="10011486000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">To support
that strategy, the banks have made a commitment that basic bank
accounts will become universally available, which will reduce the
number of adults not having access to a bank account, and to take
action to support the growth and development of third-sector lenders. I
applaud the work of credit unions and community development financial
associations in the UK, and their valuable contribution to helping
people in vulnerable circumstances.</div>
<a name="10011486000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend uses the term,</div>
<a name="10011486000289"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;decisions of a
strategic nature&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011486000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under the new clause,
the FSA would be required to address that through its detailed
day-to-day regulation of banks. However, imposing a duty on the FSA is
not the same as imposing a duty on the firms that it regulates.
Extending the duty to the FSA would be effective only if we also
extended statutory responsibility for tackling socio-economic
inequality to private sector companies such as banks, investment firms,
insurance companies and so on. That would hugely expand the nature of
the duty, and we are not minded to go down that route. To improve
financial inclusion, for example, we have not legislated for specific
outcomes or responsibilities, but sought to take a collaborative
approach to working with the financial services industry. We believe
that that is bearing fruit, as shown by the recent announcement that
the banks have met our shared goal of halving the number of people
living in households without access to a bank
account.</div><a name="10011486000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
addition to the points I have just made, I do not believe that reducing
inequality, or pursuing other socio-economic outcomes, is an
appropriate objective for the FSA or any other specialist regulator. My
hon. Friend mentioned the discussions taking place on the Equality
Bill. The Government&#146;s view is that regulators should not be
subject to that duty, which is why they were intentionally left out of
that Bill. The Committee might be aware that the Government resisted an
amendment similar to the new clause during the House&#146;s
consideration of the Equality Bill for the reasons that I have
outlined.</div>
<a name="10011486000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not
believe it to be appropriate for a non-elected regulator with extensive
rule-making and other compulsive powers to be given a mandate to pursue
core questions of social policy, however much we might agree that such
issues need to be tackled. The discretion to make rules that promote
socio-economic equality should remain with democratically elected
Governments, and I believe strongly that it is up to us to take
decisions in those areas. I hope that my hon. Friend will be persuaded
that his probing new clause is unnecessary, and that it would not be
right to impose such a duty on the FSA. I also hope that he understands
and supports&#151;as I am sure he does&#151;the Government&#146;s
commitment to promoting greater social equality in this country. I
therefore hope that he feels able to withdraw his new
clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000347"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I am not surprised by the Minister&#146;s
response. As I understand, a similar response was given during
discussion on the Equality Bill. Although I accept the argument that it
is primarily for elected bodies rather than non-elected regulators to
implement such a duty, it is somewhat surprising and less than
consistent to introduce it to local government, for example, where
regulators such as local trading standards officers will have such a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column446" />Column number: 446</div>duty imposed on them, but national regulators will
not. It is a somewhat inconsistent argument, but I will let that
stand.</div>
<a name="10011486000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">Not
introducing a new clause of this nature will weaken our ability to
address some of the significant disadvantages that vulnerable consumers
experience. However, we must allow the Equality Bill to be enacted to
see how that develops over a number of years. I hope that the Minister
responsible will monitor the situation to see whether the terms of the
Equality Bill rise to the needs of the most vulnerable people in our
society. If not, I hope that the Government will come back to this in
the future, because it is critical that we address some of these
points, particularly at this difficult economic time. If we do not, the
inequality and unfairness in our society will play out in a way that is
not to the benefit of major sections of our community. Although I
accept the Minister&#146;s argument and the Government have a good
record in this regard, we need to consider these points very carefully
in the
future.</div><a name="10011486000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
on the basis of the Minister&#146;s contribution to the debate and
the argument that he made about the impact that new clause 4 would have
on the FSA, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000348"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
Time.</div>
<a name="10011486000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
speaking in support of the new clause, I want to refer hon. Members
back to clause 27, which we discussed earlier in our proceedings.
Clause 27 restricted the provision of credit card cheques. I see new
clause 5 as being complementary to clause 27.</div>
<a name="10011486000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of
the provisions within clause 27 are very similar to those that I am
proposing in new clause 5. Clause 27(2)
says:</div><a name="10011486000290"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Credit
card cheques may be provided only to a person who has asked for
them.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
also
says:</div><a name="10011486000291"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
number of cheques provided in respect of a request must not exceed
three (or, if less, the number requested).&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column447" />Column number: 447</div><a name="10011486000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have been talking about consumer protection and perhaps to a certain
extent this is legislation that tries to protect the consumer against
themselves. That may seem a little strange. However, clause 27, which
has passed our scrutiny, seeks to stop the unsolicited distribution of
credit card cheques. Thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of such
cheques are distributed, but only a very small number are ever taken up
and often only by people who are already in rather desperate
circumstances.</div>
<a name="10011486000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I say, new
clause 5 seeks to complement clause 27 by amending the Consumer Credit
Act 1974 in a similar way, to prevent unsolicited increases in credit
card limits. I suspect that we may all have been subjected to such
unsolicited increases at some stage. The first time that someone
realises that the limit on their credit card has been increased may be
the first time that they see the new limit on their credit card
statement; perhaps they have not even been advised that the company has
decided to increase their limit.</div>
<a name="10011486000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unsolicited
increases in credit limits can, on perhaps a relatively small number of
occasions, put off the evil day, as it were, for people who are already
under pressure regarding their credit card and who have not yet
recognised that they have to reorder their financial affairs. Then, out
of the blue, they see their credit card limit increased and bingo, the
pressure is off. They can make additional borrowing on the card and
relieve the immediate problem, thinking&#151;as we all do&#151;that
that will be the last time and that they will now get to grips with
everything. Of course, they are then in an even worse position than
before.</div>
<a name="10011486000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5
has six subsections. Subsection (2)
says:</div><a name="10011486000292"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Credit
limit increases may be provided only to a person who has asked to
receive such an
increase.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is rather similar to clause 27, which says that people have to ask for
their credit card
cheques.</div>

(3) of new clause 5

other words, credit card companies may offer the opportunity to
increase limits to a considerable number of customers. If such an offer
is made to a particular customer, that customer or consumer
specifically has to opt in. A consumer credit firm may offer someone a
limit increase, but must gain specific approval from that person before
providing the increase. Even if they put out a general offer, it cannot
take place until the offer has been clearly taken up by the individual
consumer.</div>

<a name="10011486000296"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a person may

is rather like not wanting to receive all sorts of advertising material
through the post. People should be able to say, &#147;I do not want
to be continually badgered by the credit card company to increase the

please take me off your list for any further
offers.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection

<div class="Column"><a name="Column448" />Column number: 448</div><a name="10011486000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would mean that credit firms were not able indiscriminately to send a
load of unsolicited increase offers without making a proper
investigation of whether individual consumers were able to make their
payments. I accept that, in many respects, it would inhibit the
business of credit companies, which will obviously want to increase
their business. However, the potential to exploit the weaknesses of
some consumers, who may already have over-borrowed, giving them the
opportunity to become even more over-borrowed through the receipt of
unsolicited increases in their credit card limit is something that we
should seriously consider.</div>
<a name="10011486000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000349"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I sense that the hon. Gentleman may be near the end
of his remarks. The approach of credit card companies in offering
increases in limits&#151;it is called &#147;low and
grow&#148;&#151;is to give the customer a low limit, and increase
it over time as the customer demonstrates the ability to handle that
level of credit. Banning unsolicited increases will mean either that
fewer credit cards are issued, or that credit cards issued to new
customers do not have a low limit; people will be offered a higher
limit. That may not be the optimal outcome. What impact does he believe
the new clause will have on those starting
offers?</div>
<a name="10011486000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000350"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention,
as it raises some interesting points. First, a proper assessment will
need to be made before a decision is made to provide a credit limit.
The credit card company will have to ensure that it takes all necessary
information into account in assessing the customer&#146;s ability to
repay. That is the essential factor. They should take account of
repayments for all borrowings and the usual household bills, and of
disposable income.</div>
<a name="10011486000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">A proper
assessment would have to be made. Deciding whether to pitch it low, and
well within a person&#146;s ability to pay, or at the top of his
ability to pay, would be a policy decision for the credit card company.
It would be entirely up to the company if it wanted to try something
out on a particular individual, on a low-and-grow basis. Whatever the
limit, however, the company would have to demonstrate that the customer
could pay. I see no problem with that. The only problem will be if the
company assessed a limit above the customer&#146;s ability to pay.
That would not be appropriate.</div>
<a name="10011486000095"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000351"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Would the hon. Gentleman be content if someone at
the credit card company said, &#147;I think that this person, based
on my assessment of their credit risk, should have a credit limit of,
say &#163;5,000.&#148; Under the current regime the company might
give that customer a credit limit of only &#163;1,000 and see how the
customer copes before increasing the limit in stages towards
&#163;5,000. Would the hon. Gentleman be happy to go straight to that
&#163;5,000
limit?</div><a name="10011486000096"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000352"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I would only agree if that were requested. What I
would not want to see is the customer being quite happy with a
&#163;1,000 limit, but then being told, &#147;Okay, we&#146;re
going to give you a &#163;5,000 limit because we reckon you can
afford to pay up to &#163;5,000.&#148; The proper relationship
between a customer and the provider is for the customer to seek what he
or she requires. If he or she requires to go to &#163;5,000 straight
away and the assessment and ability to repay can demonstrate that such
a limit would be appropriate, I do not have any qualms. Most of the
time with a &#147;low and grow&#148; limit, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column449" />Column number: 449</div>we are already on the edge of what can be done. The
aim is often to attract business. There is already a credit card
balance with another company and people are trying to attract that
balance, which they often do by offering interest-free periods for
balance transfers and
such.</div><a name="10011486000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to stifle&#151;if that is the right word&#151;the
relationship between the consumer and the credit card company, but I
want to restrain the unsolicited aspects and operations of the credit
card companies. Many people&#151;the vast majority&#151;are quite
capable of saying, &#147;Thank you very much, but I am not going to
use it. I pay off my balance every month anyway, so it does not really
matter whether I have a limit of &#163;2,000, &#163;4,000 or
&#163;10,000.&#148; However, for a significant number of
people&#151;I have already said we should be looking at vulnerable
younger people in particular&#151;the opportunity to creep up the
limit, on an unsolicited basis, is too much of a temptation, and that
does not need to be part of the credit cards&#146;
armoury.</div><a name="10011486000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendment is entirely complementary to clause 27, which was
pretty uncontroversial, at least in Committee. If we are going to
restrain the use of credit card cheques, my amendment has a similar
aspect. That does not in any way stop someone from applying for an
increase in their credit card limit, or the credit card company from
offering a limit increase, but it would have to be based on the
assessment of the customer&#146;s ability to pay and, clearly, on the
consumer accepting that offer themselves and not just being able to
take advantage of it because it was given
unsolicited.</div><a name="10011486000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
I said, the proposal is complementary to clause 27 and, for some
people, a safeguard against their own better judgment. Citizens Advice
and other bodies far too often see people who have taken advantage of
unsolicited increases in their credit card limits and got themselves
into more trouble. Had they been stopped or had it been prevented at a
much earlier stage, their chances of getting themselves back on the
straight and narrow again would be much
easier.</div><a name="10011486000100"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000353"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Andrew Tyrie</b> (Chichester) (Con): I strongly agree with the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s objective in the amendment. His intentions must
be right. We have worked on some such issues together in the Treasury
Committee. I wonder only whether there might be another route, a route
through greater transparency, which we have discussed in Committee to a
degree. Such transparency could be furthered by bolstering competition
in the
sector.</div><a name="10011486000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000354"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I am sure that there could be. Competition in the
sector is pretty fierce, hence the great offers to take balances for
extended periods with no interest. There is quite a demand. If anyone
goes to buy a pair of shoes somewhere, they are often harangued more
about whether they would like to buy them with a store card than about
the shoes
themselves.</div><a name="10011486000102"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000355"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> But is not that competition without full
transparency, and without people fully realising what they are
buying?</div><a name="10011486000103"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000356"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> The hon. Gentleman is right. We have said that
there should be more health warnings&#151;if that is the right
description&#151;on credit card statements, particularly asking
people whether they realise that, if they made the minimum payment and
no other withdrawals, it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column450" />Column number: 450</div>would still take them 10 years to repay the balance. We should make
clearer exactly what the credit card debts entail. Many of us would
like to see an increase in the minimum payment and a greater
explanation of the way in which interest is charged because it differs
between credit companies. Some take it straight away; some take it on
the last balance first basis, but for many people&#151;to protect
them sometimes from themselves&#151;without huge inconvenience to
anyone else, we could ask credit card companies to ensure that they do
not send out unsolicited increases in credit. They can certainly offer
increases, but the offers must be properly accepted by the consumer in
the knowledge of what they are letting themselves in for, and there
must be a proper assessment by the credit card company before any such
offers are
made.</div><a name="10011486000104"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000357"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The Government are concerned about the issue,
which is why we are considering taking action in such areas as part of
the current review of credit card and store card regulation. However,
it would be inappropriate to introduce reform before the review has
been completed. As the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall knows, the
consultation document was published in October and the consultation
period ends next week. We are consulting on a wide-ranging package of
measures, including possible restrictions on unsolicited limit
increases. One of the reasons that the Government introduced the review
of the regulation of credit and store cards was to assess the potential
impact of any changes&#151;legislative or otherwise&#151;to the
current
arrangements.</div><a name="10011486000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
there is evidence that industry practice is balanced against the
interest of consumers, particularly the most vulnerable, the Government
will take strong action, but not before we have examined the responses
to the consultation. We have called on credit card companies and
consumer representatives to submit evidence in support of their
arguments, and we look forward to assessing what they have to
say.</div><a name="10011486000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
was a helpful exchange between the hon. Members for Fareham and for
South-East Cornwall. It showed some of the potential unintended
consequences if we do not get matters right, and why we want to make
sure that we examine the issue thoroughly. During the passage of the
Bill, we have considered the issue of the Government making helpful
nudges and trying to achieve better social outcomes through
choice-editing, setting sensible defaults or, in this case, drafting
legislation on limits. That is something that a Government should be
considering, but we need to do it on the right evidence
base.</div><a name="10011486000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point to bear in mind is that the review is looking at linked issues
that bear on all aspects of store card business, namely, the allocation
of customer payments, the level of minimum payments, to which the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall referred, the re-pricing of outstanding
debt and the need for further information requirements, as well as
unsolicited credit limits. An important aspect is to consider the
linked effect of the various options being considered. To be clear, we
want a consumer-friendly outcome working on the most important issues
for consumers, and introducing legislation now would pre-empt the
outcome of the
review.</div><a name="10011486000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
must point out that the new clause is technically defective. It
contains a number of key expressions that are not defined under the
Bill. Had an amendment been inserted into the Consumer Credit Act 1974,
at least the term &#147;credit limit&#148; would have been clear.
The new 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column451" />Column number: 451</div>clause is also not complete in that it does not
include a consequential amendment to schedule 1, setting out the
sanction in respect of the offence. None the less, the debate has been
helpful. It has highlighted the fact that we are all concerned about
the issue. A review is going on, and the Government will want to take
action if they believe that the balance of interests is against
consumers. With my comments in mind, I hope that the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall will withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="10011486000310"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000358"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I thank the Minister for his comments, from which I
take great heart. I am minded to say that if we are waiting for the
review, why have we got clause 27 in the Bill? It seems to impinge on
that same review.</div>
<a name="10011486000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000359"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The issue of credit card cheques has already been
consulted on. We are consulting on the issue that the hon. Gentleman
raised; that is the
reason.</div><a name="10011486000111"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000360"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That is a very brief explanation. I see the issues
as complementary in many respects. If we merely stop credit card
cheques being issued, we do not really address the fundamental point,
whereas the new clause does seek to address it. I accept that it would
be useful to wait for the review. I hope that the required legislation
will be introduced as swiftly as possible. We might see the back of the
recession in the next year or two, but I suspect that its implications
and effects will last for a long time and will put pressures on
individuals and families. The danger of significantly increasing
personal debt during a perhaps fragile economic recovery means that
there could be serious social problems in the future, so I hope that
when the review is done, new legislation will be introduced. On that
basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new
clause.</div><a name="10011486000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000361"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10011486000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 6 relates to a fairly topical issue, I suppose: bank charges. I
do not know how many cases hon. Members have had of constituents being
extremely unhappy with the bank charges that they have been subjected
to. Of course, we were all enjoined to await the outcome of the Supreme
Court case, and then, to utter disappointment and dismay, the banks won
the day and many consumers and our constituents were extremely angry,
if not
disappointed.</div><a name="10011486000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
result of the Supreme Court&#146;s decision on bank charges has had a
major effect on the public&#146;s opinion of banks and banking, just
as bonuses did. The public feel that the taxpayer has bailed out the
banks, while the banks have been allowed to charge unfair rates for the
work that they have done. In fact, the OFT estimated that in 2006 the
UK banks took &#163;2.6 billion from their customers in unauthorised
overdraft charges. Many people believe that, in many cases, those
charges were disproportionate to the work involved in dealing with
sometimes rather modest overdrafts. What is certain is that there has
been a consumer backlash, with hundreds of thousands of people
reclaiming the money that they were charged. We all know that there was
a large number of cases, which, I suspect, put a particular strain on
the Financial Ombudsman Service, and indeed the county
courts.</div>
<a name="10011486000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000362"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I agree strongly, again, with the direction that
the hon. Gentleman is coming from. May I raise a similar point about
whether consumers know and are clear about the costs that might be
incurred in taking certain actions? Do they even know, for example,
what the real cost is of running a current account&#151;of so-called
free banking, which is a myth? The real cost is the gap between the
amount that they are charged and the prevailing base rate, which is
what the banks get. If consumers could be informed of that information
in some way&#151;there have been proposals of that type&#151;could
we not move to a position where transparency can do most of the heavy
lifting?</div>
<a name="10011486000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">People would
be able to compete on the basis of accurate information about the
relative merits of each account. Is that not exactly what happened in
the insurance industry? We have now moved over to search engines that
can give us detailed information about what we will really be charged
for car or home insurance, for example. Is that not where we need to be
with banks?</div>
<a name="10011486000119"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000363"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I think that that is right. Transparency is a great
help. As many know, I come from a banking background. Bank charges back
in the 1960s and 1970s were anything but transparent. We used to decide
what figure would be appropriate and charge it, and if anybody
complained, we came to an agreement with them, which was not exactly
good either.</div>
<a name="10011486000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Today,
charges can be laid down in great reams of terms and conditions, but
that is no more transparent than anything else. Seemingly every quarter
or every other quarter, I get a new little booklet with new terms and
conditions written in legalese. I just accept it and hope that, having
banked with the same bank for nearly 50 years, I will not get done, but
many people have fallen foul of the terms and conditions and been
charged huge amounts of money for transgressing limits without
realising that doing so would have such an effect.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column453" />Column number: 453</div><a name="10011486000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">As we know,
the banks and the OFT agreed to a test case in the High Court to
determine whether the OFT had the power to decide whether the
banks&#146; terms and conditions were unfair. We were all happy to
wait for the judgment, although it seemed to take an inordinately long
time, because it was felt that that was ultimately the best way
forward. Perhaps it would not have been the same if our provisions on
collective proceedings had been passed.</div>
<a name="10011486000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">The OFT has
the power to assess the fairness of the terms in consumer contracts,
subject to limits laid down in the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulations 1999, statutory instrument 2083, which implemented European
Council directive 93/13/EEC. Regulation 6(2) states
that</div><a name="10011486000298"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
assessment of fairness of a term shall not relate...to the
adequacy of the price or remuneration, as against the goods or services
supplied in
exchange.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
other words, the value for money equation is excluded. The Court of
Appeal held that the exclusion applied only to the core price terms of
the contract, not to ancillary terms such as charges for unauthorised
overdrafts and other bits and pieces. That would have allowed the OFT
to assess the banks&#146; terms and conditions and decide what
constitutes a fair charge for entering into an unauthorised overdraft.
Many of us were not terribly surprised to hear that it might cost the
bank an estimated &#163;2 or &#163;3 to administer an unauthorised
overdraft, but some banks were charging &#163;30 for the
transgression.</div><a name="10011486000124"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="10011486000364"></a><b class="B">Rob
Marris</b> (Wolverhampton, South-West) (Lab): I must say that
I am uneasy about the amendment, as it is widely drawn, but on that
point, the figure of &#163;3 compared to &#163;30 is already
covered in the law of our country. A contract can include a penalty
that is not enforceable at law or a genuine pre-estimate of loss, to
use the technical term, which is enforceable at law. If the banks are
charging &#163;30 for something that costs about &#163;3, the
courts would determine that to be a penalty and not enforceable. That
has been the law for 100 years in this
country.</div>
<a name="10011486000125"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000365"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Although the High Court might have taken a decision
along those lines, we know that that was not the ultimate
interpretation of the current
regulations.</div><a name="10011486000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000366"></a>Rob
Marris:</b> That is precisely the problem. The OFT case was
brought under the unfair contract terms regulations; I am talking about
something completely different: a basic element of contract law in
England and Wales that was not ventilated at all in that court case.
The court case was based on the wrong
issue.</div><a name="10011486000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000367"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That may well be the case, but that does not
exclude the opportunity to change the current unfair terms of trade. We
could then have a belt and braces operation, which may be a way of
mitigating what many consumers feel completely sore about, perhaps
including many of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s constituents. I do not
know the situation in his constituency, but I had more than 50
constituents waiting with bated breath to see what was going to
happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column454" />Column number: 454</div><a name="10011486000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, we
all know that the banks appealed the High Court decision and that the
Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeal&#146;s ruling,
holding that the charges for unauthorised overdrafts fell within the
exclusion. In the Supreme Court judgment, Lord Walker commented
that</div><a name="10011486000299"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Ministers
and Parliament had decided to transpose the directive as it stood,
rather than to confer the higher degree of consumer protection afforded
by the national laws of some other member states and that Parliament
might wish to consider whether to revisit that
decision.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
certainly could consider whether we want to &#147;revisit that
decision&#148;.</div>
<a name="10011486000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether or
not new clause 6 is the most appropriate way to address the situation,
it is certainly one way to address it or to put it back to what the
High Court understood it to be, as opposed to what the Supreme Court
ultimately ruled it was.</div>
<a name="10011486000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand&#151;perhaps the Minister can confirm this&#151;that the
normal route to achieve that change would be via the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills reissuing the unfair terms of contract
regulations, which would perhaps clarify the situation. However, I
understand that that is unlikely at present, as the European Union is
considering a new consumer rights directive that may, in due course,
amend those regulations. Nevertheless, we are concerned that no action
will be taken in the UK until that happens, and there is no certainty
that a new consumer rights directive will come into force, even within
the next five years. Even if it does come into force, it may require
amending.</div>
<a name="10011486000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">I acknowledge
the assistance I have received with new clause 6 from the Consumers
Association, to which I gratefully pay tribute. It was extremely
closely involved in the bank charges case, of course. It has also
assisted in the drafting of new clause 6, which seeks to make changes
to put the situation back to what it was, as the High Court wanted but
the Supreme Court did not.</div>
<a name="10011486000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the great problem is that new clause 6 will not be retrospective, and I
would not suggest that it should be. Nevertheless, there is a
requirement on this House&#151;perhaps especially at this
time&#151;at least to address the situation with bank charges, which
has caused so much concern, hardship, anger and frustration to so many
people, and not just because of their own personal circumstances. Many
people have incurred very significant bank charges, which they have
found difficult to repay. Also, the situation with bank charges has
contributed to the whole psyche of the British public concerning how
they see the British banking system, which is a great shame. The
bankers have brought some criticism on themselves because of the
bonuses and the debacle of our having to bail them out. However, I
thought there might have been some recognition that, even if all the
money could not be paid back, we could still find a more reasonable,
equitable, sensible and transparent way of dealing with bank
charges.</div>
<a name="10011486000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
bank charges case has been deeply damaging to our banking industry as a
whole. I do not know whether the banks themselves recognise that;
perhaps they do not really care. However, it will cause lasting damage.
The relationship between an individual and their bank may not be the
same as that between a patient and a doctor, but there are some
similarities, in the sense that people need that trust, that
recognition and that hoped-for reasonable response from the other
party.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column455" />Column number: 455</div><a name="10011486000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
many people, the banks&#146; use of the appeal system through the
Supreme Court&#151;whereby they avoided paying back charges that, by
any measure, were extortionate in many cases and totally
disproportionate in a great many others&#151;placed shame on the
banks and our banking system. Even if new clause 6 is not accepted, it
at least attempts to put back into the public arena the fact that
Parliament is prepared to revisit and deal with this issue, as we have
been encouraged to do, and to treat it seriously, so that we get
fairness and transparency and restore some of the good name that banks
in general used to have not so very long
ago.</div>
<a name="10011486000311"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div><a name="10011486000136"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000368"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I certainly echo the hon. Gentleman&#146;s comment
about the damage done to our banking industry by this particular
difficulty, but I understand that the banks are on record as suggesting
that a change of the kind outlined in the new clause could mean the end
of free banking&#151;although it is not entirely free&#151;as they
introduce costs in other ways. Is he concerned that reducing the
penalty or administrative charge for overdrafts would simply cause
those costs to emerge in some other part of the banking
industry?</div>
<a name="10011486000137"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000369"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> That has always been a danger. As the hon.
Gentleman knows, I have said in the Treasury Committee that we should
beware of getting what we ask for. We should recognise in creating such
measures that the banks will recoup the revenue that they think they
require in other ways.</div>
<a name="10011486000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">At present,
the system lacks complete transparency, as the hon. Member for
Chichester said. So-called free banking is not transparent, in the
sense that others pay the cost. Some charges peripheral to the basic
terms and conditions are wholly inappropriate, and we need a whole new
regime. Perhaps other aspects coming down the track will make the banks
think again; that could be a danger. However, I believe that
competition, if we ensure that it exists, will sort some of that
out.</div>
<a name="10011486000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">Until now,
the banks have been able to get away with what has not been their
finest hour. A recognition of what has gone on in the past, what
consumers feel and the degree of transparency necessary should make
them respond. However, in case they do not, the new clause is an
opportunity to assure the public that Parliament takes the matter
seriously.</div>
<a name="10011486000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000370"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The new clause is very clever, but it is
extremely sweeping and would extend to contingent charges across the
whole financial services sector. It goes well beyond bank lending,
which the hon. Gentleman discussed, to include savings and investments,
insurance, debit and credit cards, pensions, payment services and other
consumer financial
services.</div><a name="10011486000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government understand the concerns of consumers affected by the Supreme
Court judgment, and I appreciate how the hon. Gentleman has raised the
new clause, but as he will be aware, we have
announced that we will work with the Office of Fair Trading, consumer
groups and the banks to agree a fairer, simpler and more transparent
system of bank charges in future. We have not ruled out further
measures if a voluntary approach does not produce results.</div>
<a name="10011486000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would
expect that if no voluntary approach is successfully implemented, a
Government would want to take action. However, a voluntary solution has
the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column456" />Column number: 456</div>advantage that it can quickly adapt to changes in the market. Any
regulatory solution will need to be carefully thought through. We must
maintain price competition and avoid unintended consequences from firms
deciding to compensate for any revenue reduction by developing new
forms of
charge.</div><a name="10011486000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulations 1999 as a vehicle for any necessary amendments if we chose
to go down the legislative route. I am advised that as it would be a
major step, any such amendment would be likely to require primary
legislation. That is something to be considered. However, we strongly
take the view that a voluntary approach is likely to be more speedy,
and we hope that it will have the impact that we want, so that
consumers get a fair
deal.</div><a name="10011486000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman also spoke of proposed changes under the consumer rights
directive. That may be a suitable vehicle for future reforms, but that
will depend on the progress with that directive. He will be aware that
it has been under discussion in Europe for some time.</div>
<a name="10011486000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the wider
point, with regard to what the new clause proposes for all financial
sectors, I am not convinced that a case has been made. We should not
lightly intervene in commercial decision making in a competitive
market. It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments
that we should rely on competition to make markets fair. It is a
fundamental tenet of this Government&#146;s thinking that we should
intervene only if there is a demonstrable market failure that cannot be
fixed by other means.</div>
<a name="10011486000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new
clause would have far-reaching and possibly unintended consequences. As
well as carefully considering all the options, we would want to ensure
that a full consultation with interested stakeholders took place before
we considered the introduction of price regulation. In effect, the hon.
Gentleman is asking the Government to get involved with price
regulation across the financial services sector in the area in
question. We want to take action in response to the Supreme Court case,
but we seek to do it on a voluntary basis. We have not ruled out taking
legislative action, but we should not have such a wide-ranging power,
as it could have unintended consequences that have not been considered.
With those assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will seek leave
to withdraw the new clause.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000371"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I thank the Minister for those remarks. I entirely
agree that a voluntary arrangement would be swifter and more
satisfactory. However, consider what has gone on in respect of the
appeal, and what has happened since. I have heard nothing from the
banks, individually or collectively, to indicate that they have any
intention of voluntarily giving up billions of pounds of revenue. I
suspect that Parliament would need to make it clear that unless
satisfactory arrangements were reached voluntarily, we would certainly
legislate. That might give them a nudge in the right
direction.</div>
<a name="10011486000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
entirely agree about competition. It is patently obvious from
constituents&#146; letters that remarkably similar charges&#151;all
of them hugely disproportionate to the underlying cost&#151;have been
applied by different banks for the same sorts of facilities. To say
that that was an absolutely competitive situation is misleading; it
clearly was not. The banks were charging what they could get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column457" />Column number: 457</div>away with, because the customer did not have the opportunity of going to
another bank with a lesser charge, and anyway, they would have had all
the inconvenience of changing banks. Whether it was HSBC, NatWest,
Lloyds or the Royal Bank of Scotland, the underlying charges for
unauthorised overdrafts bore a remarkable similarity. The greatest
similarity, however, is that they were hugely disproportionate to the
underlying
cost.</div><a name="10011486000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister said that the new clause is widely drawn and covers all sorts.
Frankly, I do not think that anyone should get away with unfair
charges. I do not care whether a company is an insurance company, a
credit card company or any other company in the financial sector; their
charges should be fair and transparent. I have no problem with the new
clause being wide-ranging. It is to do with unfair charges, and I do
not want to see unfair charges anywhere. However, I accept the point
about consultation. If the Government are seizing the initiative on the
subject by taking the matter to the banks and seeking voluntary
arrangements, perhaps that, together with the threat of appropriate
legislation if the banks do not come forward with something sensible
and transparent, is the way forward.</div>
<a name="10011486000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am happy at
this stage to seek leave to withdraw the new clause. I want to reflect
on what the Minister has said about dealing with the issue, and I
reserve the right to come back to it at a later stage. However, at this
time, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the new clause.</div>

<h4 class="hs_8Clause">New Clause
7</h4><a name="10011486000009"></a><div class="hs_7SmCapsHdg">Removal
of reduction of financial crime as an FSA regulatory
objective</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(1) The Financial

follows.</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">(2) In section 2(2)
(the FSA&#146;s regulatory objectives) omit paragraph (d) (which

Hoban.)</i></div><a name="10011486000151"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Brought
up, and read the First

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000372"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second
time.</div>
<a name="10011486000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 7
is very much a probing measure. I am just trying to tease out from the
Minister what he sees as the FSA&#146;s remit on financial crime and
what the impact has been of giving the FSA this objective&#151;the
reduction of financial crime&#151;in
FSMA.</div><a name="10011486000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the last year or so, a degree of concern has been expressed about how
we tackle financial crime and about the fact that there is a
multiplicity of organisations involved in tackling it. We have the
Serious Fraud Office and the City of London police. There is a
suggestion that adding to this confusion is the FSA&#146;s own role
in dealing with financial crime. I wondered if there is a way of
streamlining the system to make it clearer who is responsible for
dealing with financial crime. That led me to think about the role that
the FSA plays in tackling financial crime and what sort of powers it
has to do so.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column458" />Column number: 458</div><a name="10011486000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a number of occasions during our deliberations on the Bill in this
Committee, we have discussed the FSA&#146;s role in terms of
enforcement. Some people might say that its role is about tackling
financial crime, but I see it in a different way. I think that it is
primarily about trying to enforce its own rules. The FSA&#146;s
enforcement division investigates breaches or potential breaches of the
FSA&#146;s rules; it brings cases against firms, and it comes up with
penalties that could be applied if there was a breach of the rules. Of
course, the FSA also has a role in dealing with criminality, in that it
prosecutes for market abuse. We have seen that relatively recently in a
case involving a former employee of a company called
Evolution.</div>
<a name="10011486000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">My view is
that if we removed the objective for reducing financial crime from
FSMA, it certainly would not stop the FSA from enforcement activity. In
a way, that enforcement activity takes place under the FSA&#146;s
remit on consumer protection and market confidence.</div>
<a name="10011486000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">So, is the
objective of reducing financial crime giving any additionality? Is it
taking the FSA beyond its role? Is it giving the FSA a duty to do
something that it would not otherwise do? I am not clear that that
objective is giving the FSA anything additional to do and therefore it
may serve to confuse, rather than clarify, the FSA.</div>
<a name="10011486000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">The objective
in FSMA defines the FSA&#146;s role in reducing financial crime
as:</div><a name="10011486000300"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reducing
the extent to which it is possible for a business...to be used for
a purpose connected with financial
crime.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means, in practice, that the FSA must consider whether a firm is taking
appropriate measures and has appropriate resources to detect and
prevent financial crime. Clearly, there is always a risk with financial
services businesses of financial crime. That is why we have
money-laundering regulations in place. Some people seek to use
financial services businesses as a route to channel proceeds of crime
and various measures have been taken in recent years to tighten up the
rules to deal with money-laundering.</div>
<a name="10011486000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course,
the Treasury has given the FSA the lead role in tackling financial
crime. Given that the rules on money-laundering can also be related
back to consumer protection and market confidence, I am not sure that
removing the financial crime objective would reduce the FSA&#146;s
scope of activity. I mentioned earlier that taking appropriate measures
and having adequate resources to detect and prevent financial crime is
part of the FSA&#146;s assessment of a firm&#146;s suitability. The
FSA looks at systems and procedures. It certainly would not be
interested in authorising a firm whose systems were open to abuse or
gave rise to the possibility of financial crime. Again, in its work to
examine the individuals employed by firms, if the FSA is interested in
employees&#146; probity, it seems that that would happen even if the
financial crime objective were removed from the FSA.</div>
<a name="10011486000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying
to probe what the objective enables the FSA to do that it would not do
if the duty were not in the Bill. Removing the duty from FSMA might
give greater clarity about who is responsible for tackling financial
crime.</div><a name="10011486000312"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
<a name="10011486000162"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000373"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> The hon. Member for Fareham started by saying
that the new clause was a probing amendment, but went on to sound as
though he really meant it and wanted it to be passed. I will explain to
the Committee why I think that that would not be a good idea.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column459" />Column number: 459</div><a name="10011486000163"></a><div class="hs_Para">Tackling or
preventing all financial crime is not a stand-alone objective for the
FSA or other regulators and supervisors around the world; it interacts
with the FSA&#146;s other objectives of protecting consumers and
market confidence and stability. That can be seen in the precise
wording of section 6 of FSMA which defines the FSA&#146;s objective
as</div><a name="10011486000301"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;reducing
the extent to which it is possible for a business carried on by a
regulated person...to be used for a purpose connected with
financial crime.&#148;</div>
<a name="10011486000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Financial crime
includes any offence involving money laundering, fraud or dishonesty or
market abuse.</div>
<a name="10011486000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,
as the hon. Gentleman knows, the FSA has focused its financial crime
work on three key areas: businesses&#146; systems and controls for
addressing financial crime risk, businesses&#146; management and
personnel and the effectiveness of enforcement and sanctions. It
tackles financial crime such as market abuse and money laundering,
works with others where appropriate on issues such as fraud and
addresses threats posed by unregulated activities such as boiler
rooms.</div><a name="10011486000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government recognise and value the FSA&#146;s important achievements
in shaping domestic efforts and contributing to international policy to
address financial crime. At a global level, we place continued
importance on intensifying efforts to strengthen work on financial
crime, including action against money laundering and terrorist
financing. Those efforts are seen as reinforcing wider initiatives
focusing on prudential regulation and market stability. The April 2009
statement of G7 Finance Ministers and central bank governors stressed
the importance of tackling financial
crime.</div><a name="10011486000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would eliminate the overarching objective. However, the hon.
Gentleman is right to say that that would not prevent the FSA from
doing work on the issue. It would continue to exercise specific
functions to tackle financial crime, such as supervising financial
firms for compliance with money laundering regulations, by virtue of
explicit powers in the regulations. Also, of course, it would still be
charged with consumer protection and prudential regulation, which
includes ensuring that firms protect themselves. Section 354 of FSMA
would remain in force, requiring the FSA to co-operate with the police
and other domestic and international agencies to tackle financial
crime.</div><a name="10011486000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
issue, as the hon. Gentleman said, is whether removing the objective
would serve any purpose. It is the Government&#146;s view that
abolishing that FSA responsibility would cause confusion and
uncertainty, rather than otherwise as he implied. Presumably firms
would still be expected to take the issues seriously and to take steps
to protect themselves and their consumers against financial crime, even
if the objective was removed. I do not think the hon. Gentleman would
expect a different body to assume the functions of ensuring that
authorised firms use their risk controls and other processes to protect
themselves and their customers. There is no obvious replacement for the
FSA in such respects. Someone will need to perform the role, and it
would only lead to a duplication of costs on firms and consumers if
another body had to have responsibility in that
area.</div><a name="10011486000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would also be concerned if we were to take the objective away from the
FSA, in case that implied a downgrading in the importance of financial
crime, which would detract from and undermine our wider efforts to
bolster risk management practices and overall market 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column460" />Column number: 460</div>integrity in general. Therefore, I do not think the
new clause is a good idea. I am happy to put on record some of the
details of how the FSA has focused its work, but its statutory
responsibility is there for a purpose, which is an important one, and I
think it should
remain.</div><a name="10011486000170"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000374"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I am sorry if I sounded too confident in my
arguments earlier. I shall try to adopt a more probing tone of voice in
future, if that helps. Although I may even have persuaded myself as I
was talking&#151;perhaps I should not have suggested the amendment
was probing but have gone straight for the
jugular.</div><a name="10011486000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">During
the course of a brief debate, it was clear to me, as in our other
debates about the FSA&#146;s objectives, that their presence or
absence does not seem to do a great deal to change the fundamental
focus of the FSA. There is always a rationale to be deployed for
maintaining its work in a particular area even if the objective did not
exist. We talked about that in the context of the duty to promote
international co-operation earlier. The Minister said that the FSA
works internationally to tackle financial crime, but when I tried to
broaden the international co-operation objective, to include the
FSA&#146;s other objectives, the Minister said that that was not
necessary. Sometimes the objectives are convenient in an Act, but their
presence or absence does not necessarily vary what the FSA will do.
Even without the objective, as the Minister said, the FSA would
continue to work on money laundering, continue to look at systems and
management and continue to enforce those rules. That casts light on
just how important objectives are in determining regulators&#146;
activity.</div><a name="10011486000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have not persuaded myself that I should press the new clause to a
vote&#151;it is still probing. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="10011486000173"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000375"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I beg to move that the clause be read a Second
time.</div><a name="10011486000176"></a><div class="hs_Para"></div><a name="10011486000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
new clause would add competition to the objectives of the FSA. This
issue is crucial. Competition is what should lie at the heart of an
attempt to regulate an industry&#151;any industry&#151;and it is
deeply regrettable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column461" />Column number: 461</div>that it does not do so in the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000. We must always remember that all
regulation costs money. It raises prices for the consumer. In the end,
the consumer always
pays.</div><a name="10011486000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
present objectives already interact with one another. The clause will
alter the interaction. Two fundamental issues, which I want to discuss
this afternoon, flow from the FSA implementing its objectives. The
first is conduct of business regulation. This is designed to stop the
consumer being ripped off&#151;it is as straightforward as that. An
analogy can be drawn with a can of soup: regulation about a can of soup
is designed to stop people, when buying a can of soup, finding
themselves being poisoned by what is in it. Once the minimum standards
have been met, competition can take place between cans of soup in
supermarkets and elsewhere. That is what the consumer protection
objective is designed to accomplish in a much more complicated area
than the regulation of cans of
soup.</div><a name="10011486000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second area in which such interactions will take place as a consequence
of what I am proposing here is the regulation of systemic risk, an
issue that we discussed earlier&#151;preventing contagion as a
consequence of illiquidity or insolvency. That is the financial
stability objective, which we will now have in the
Bill&#151;mercifully&#151;but none the less 10 years too
late.</div><a name="10011486000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall take each issue in turn, briefly&#151;perhaps not so briefly.
Let us look first at the conduct of business regulation side. As the
Bill is drafted, the consumer must rely for his protection from
ever-rising prices caused by regulation on the principles underlying
the FSA&#146;s objectives, to which the FSA need only &#147;have
regard&#148;. There are a couple of important objectives in section
2(3) of the Act, the last being the principle in paragraph
(g):</div><a name="10011486000302"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
discharging its general functions the Authority must have regard
to...the desirability of facilitating competition between those
who are subject to any form of regulation by the
Authority.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(d), which I might come back to in a moment, is also relevant and says
that the FSA must also have regard
to</div><a name="10011486000303"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
desirability of facilitating innovation in connection with regulated
activities&#148;.</div><a name="10011486000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
reason I dwelt on that for some time is of course because a principle
to which one has to have regard is very different for an institution
and far less powerful than is an objective&#151;central objectives
that are laid out statutorily for the institution to accomplish. That
is why in my view, right from the start, the Financial Services and
Markets Act has been inadequate in that respect. When the Bill was put
on the statute book, that was the view of the overwhelming majority of
practitioners. If you ask them now, they shuffle their feet a little.
Why? Because regulation is the best barrier to entry for competition. A
firm could not wish for better than to have huge amounts of regulation
to stop new entrants into the market.</div>
<a name="10011486000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Regulation,
especially to protect consumers, is inevitably highly complex in such a
field and only firms with big compliance departments can handle it
properly. There are large economies of scale in
regulation. The bigger the volume of deals, the cheaper per deal to
regulate they will be for those firms. That should, in theory, lead to
a drive for consolidation in the industries
providing  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column462" />Column number: 462</div>financial services, to retail customers in
particular, and, hey presto, in practice, if we look about, that is
exactly what we have seen since the Act came into
force.</div><a name="10011486000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Worse
still, the regulator himself has an interest in encouraging the same
consolidation. A small number of large firms is much easier to regulate
and to keep an eye on than a large number of small firms. Regulators do
not like taking risks. The most important risk that regulators take is
being blamed, which is extremely damaging&#151;better more regulation
than blame falling on them. Of course, zero regulatory failure is
completely unachievable. There was little crime in eastern
Europe&#151;except crime by the state&#151;with no crime on the
street and people able to leave their doors open in many countries,
particularly in East Germany. However, the level of regulation to
achieve that was extremely high, with 10 per cent. of the population
being informants for the Stasi. We know that we can eliminate all
regulatory risk and failure but only at a price, a huge price, for our
consumers.</div><a name="10011486000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have seen the effect in action. As a director and chairman of audit in
a publicly quoted company in the financial services industry, I have
seen the effect of regulation threatening to become a barrier to entry.
I have seen how encouragement for rationalisation all too often can
come from the regulator itself, more in its own interest than in that
of the consumers. Far too little attention is paid to the barriers to
entry for small firms that can be created by that consolidation, which,
in turn, is driven by the
regulation.</div><a name="10011486000186"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000376"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> I agree entirely with what the hon. Gentleman says.
Is it not a matter not only of regulation, but of proportionate
regulation? To encourage new entrants in, they ought not to be
sometimes subjected to the sort of regulation that is required for a
highly sophisticated, complex, huge operation. Proportionate regulation
would recognises the relative size and allow entrants in at the bottom
end in a much more reasonable
way.</div><a name="10011486000313"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="10011486000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000377"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I absolutely agree with that but, best of all, is
competition. It will always act as a counterweight to excessive
regulation. Competition should, in principle, provide us with the
optimum level of regulation. If we have no regulation, we will have no
industry to regulate. The size of the industry will be very small.
People do not want to deal in a jungle. They will move into a market
where they can receive some protection. However, too much protection
can have the deleterious effect, as I have described, of killing off
activity. In between lies the optimum level of regulation, normally the
level that provides for the maximum level of legally conducted business
activity. That is not the level at which we will get zero regulatory
risk and we will therefore always have regulatory failure. It is the
pressure that builds up on any regulator to clamp down excessively that
is the great danger in regulation and financial
services.</div><a name="10011486000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000378"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman recognise any limitation on
the role of competition, and an enhanced role for regulation? I take
the example of home credit of which the Office of Fair Trading carried
out a study. It wished to introduce greater
competition into the marketplace, but found it difficult to find market
participants who were willing to enter that market. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column463" />Column number: 463</div>Therefore, there is a continuing role for
regulation&#151;I agree with the hon. Gentleman, at an optimum
level&#151;but we cannot always depend on
competition.</div><a name="10011486000189"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000379"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman that a
level of regulation is required to arrive at an optimum level of
business activity and benefit to the consumer. I hope that I just said
that, but if I did not, I confirm it now. Home credit is a fascinating
case of a market distortion. We have both looked into it. It is
difficult to see an easy method of eliminating it wholly. However, I
will not be drawn down that road into such a specific and detailed
example now, even though it is deeply relevant to the new
clause.</div><a name="10011486000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to make one more general point about the importance of competition
in assisting consumers. I did an economics degree of sorts and, on a
good day&#151;quietly, usually in a Committee Room upstairs where no
one notices&#151;I might even be prepared to admit it. I did at least
learn a lesson of Schumpeter, whose contribution was decisive on the
issue. He showed that the greatest source of competition generally
comes not directly from price, but from the invention of new products
or product improvement that displaces inferior products in the market
on a dynamic and constantly evolving basis. That is as true in services
as it is in goods. It is what he called the process of creative
destruction, and it is what we must maintain in financial services. We
need more of it there, but our central difficulty is that there is a
strong case for saying that that Schumpeterian power of creative
destruction has been compromised in some respects by a distorted
regulatory

Breed:</b> Does the hon. Gentleman consider the introduction
of the innovative product of a 125 per cent. mortgage to be a good way
of providing competition in the
market?</div><a name="10011486000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000381"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. If the
consumer can be brought to understand clearly and transparently what he
is really taking on, we must ultimately let the market decide the level
of activity that will take place in that area. In the case of those
mortgages, we know from survey evidence that people did not know what
they were taking on. They were misinformed. That is the central
weakness in what happened.</div>
<a name="10011486000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
impossible to protect people entirely from mistakes that they
themselves will make. However careful the preparation, there will
always be people who do not take advantage of the information provided
to them to make good decisions, just as there will be people who open a
can of soup, pollute it with salmonella or something before they drink
it, and then blame the producer of the
soup.</div><a name="10011486000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
agree that producing 125 per cent. mortgages was highly irresponsible.
They should have had powerful health warnings on them. There might have
been a case for going further and curbing them&#151;indeed, that is
the road that we have gone down. There might have been a case for doing
so much earlier than we did. However, we cannot live in a world where,
every time a product is produced, we must rely on the FSA to put it
through a detailed vetting system before it can be allowed on to
the market as something that has been duly approved
and sanitised. Such products are not like new pharmaceuticals. The
level of innovation takes place at a much faster
speed.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000382"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Will my hon. Friend give
way?</div>
<a name="10011486000196"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000383"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Yes, at the risk of being
diverted.</div>
<a name="10011486000197"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000384"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I have followed my hon. Friend&#146;s argument.
He talked about the creative destruction that emerges from new products
appearing on the market. It is helpful for a consumer to be able to
judge the characteristics of different products so that they can decide
whether a new, innovative product is better than the old, stale
product. Part of the challenge in financial services is that it can be
difficult for consumers to see through the products and understand
their characteristics. It is often hard to see the consequences of
buying one product compared with another until many years have passed
since the original decision to purchase was made. There are, therefore,
challenges around simply relying on competition to generate the best
deal for consumers.</div>
<a name="10011486000198"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000385"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I agree with every single word of that. The next
paragraph of what I have in front of me alludes to that, as a
qualification to my earlier remarks about the primacy of competition. I
fully endorse what my hon. Friend has just
said.</div><a name="10011486000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">May
I go back to the main theme, which is that we need to put competition
up the scale of importance for the FSA? I referred to the number of
people who have supported, and continue to support, that idea. I said a
moment ago that practitioners liked the idea in theory, until they
realised the benefits of the protection that comes with economies of
scale and the growth of barriers to entry. However, other people who
have looked at the issue have been very clearly in favour of adding
competition as an objective.</div>
<a name="10011486000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Don
Cruickshank, who did the original work at the time of the first Bill,
said:</div><a name="10011486000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Getting
the regulator&#146;s primary statutory duties right is
essential...A competition objective that is weak relative to the
regulator&#146;s other objectives is unlikely to be delivered
effectively&#148;.</div><a name="10011486000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
was supported in all that by the British Bankers Association, the
Association of British Insurers, the National Consumer Council, the
Treasury Committee, the Conservative party, the Liberal party&#151;I
think&#151;and so on. They are the only bodies that I have taken the
trouble to look up recently. A good number of them have carried on
saying that sort of thing, to a greater or lesser degree. In the US,
the Securities and Exchange Commission has a duty to consider whether
any regulation or other action will promote competition, so the United
States has exactly what I am asking for in its statute
book.</div><a name="10011486000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government&#146;s only substantive argument against the proposal over
the years&#151;I expect we will hear a variation of it from the
Minister&#151;is that it could lead the FSA into conflict with other
parts of competition policy, in this case with the OFT. However, as I
have repeatedly said, that need not be the case. My contention is not
that the FSA should take on new powers to supervise competition, but
that in the exercise of its powers it should not damage competition in
the marketplace. The inclusion of a balancing objective, such as that
in new clause 9, would not turn the FSA into
another competition regulator. It would merely mean that, in carrying
out its distinct remit, it should seek to facilitate
competition.</div><a name="10011486000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 9 should arm the OFT a little, not get in its way. One thing
that it certainly cannot do is weaken it. To ensure that, I withdrew
new clause 8&#151;that may 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column465" />Column number: 465</div>have been noticed by Ministers&#151;because I
wanted to add a rider at the end of subsection (4) to make it clear
that my proposed provisions
are</div><a name="10011486000304"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;without
prejudice to the statutory powers of the Office of Fair Trading and the
Competition
Commission.&#148;</div><a name="10011486000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">So
this can only benefit rather than damage the OFT and competition more
widely.</div><a name="10011486000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
fact that other regulators have competition as a central objective
makes its omission from FSMA particularly curious. We now have an
opportunity to put that right. My new clause would have three or four
big effects. First, competition would act as a counterweight to the
inevitable urge to over-regulate. It would be a counter-balancing force
for the FSA to consider in discharging its statutory responsibilities.
There is a provision in the Act for cost-benefit analysis, but it is
well understood and agreed that doing that kind of analysis is
complicated, extremely expensive and give, at best, patchy results. The
analysis is an expensive surrogate for what should be included, namely
the balance between competition and consumer protection, which should
be built into the legislation&#146;s objectives for the benefit of
the
consumer.</div><a name="10011486000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the conduct of business side, when the FSA found that it did not have
competition as an objective 10 years ago, even though it wanted it, it
tried, to its credit, to make the best of it by ensuring that it did
not regulate excessively. I will not go into detail about how it
achieved that, but it did it through a number of interesting
consultation documents during the first half of the last decade. They
were not all perfect, but they largely addressed in an ad hoc way the
issue that I am trying to address directly through new clause
9.</div><a name="10011486000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem for the FSA is that it remains vulnerable to public pressure.
Such pressure on a particular case has a ratchet effect on regulation,
which leads to an erosion of competition and leads eventually to higher
prices, often without any benefit to the consumer. I hope that what I
am proposing will address
that.</div><a name="10011486000314"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3
pm</div><a name="10011486000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second effect, which I want to mention briefly, touching on something
that I mentioned earlier, is that the measure will change the terms of
trade between the OFT and the FSA, just a little. Again, to the credit
of both institutions, they know that they have to work together, and at
the moment they are co-operating extremely well, through early and
direct engagement.</div>
<a name="10011486000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The two
organisations have produced an interesting document on exactly that
subject&#151;a memorandum of understanding. I hope that the Committee
will understand my scepticism about such documents. We have been there
before, have we not, with the MOU on the tripartite committee? Relying
upon what is effectively an informal document is not enough. We should
go further, working out ourselves how they should co-operate. We should
not have to rely on a memorandum of understanding, as it makes us very
dependent on the quality and personal relationships of the people whom
we are appointing at the top of those institutions.</div>
<a name="10011486000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had a
first-rate group of people running the FSA from the beginning. That has
not always been the view of the press, however, nor is it the
prevailing mantra. None the less, I believe that we have been lucky in
those who have been appointed to the FSA. I congratulate the Government
on having made a big effort to get 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column466" />Column number: 466</div>good people to run it. I also congratulate the
Government &#151;I do not often do so&#151;on their appointment of
the current head of the OFT. We have very good people in place, and
they are sensibly working closely together, but we should not be
entirely dependent on that always being the case. We need something
that has some statutory underpinning.</div>
<a name="10011486000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, it
should be borne in mind that the relationship between the FSA and the
OFT already has a statutory basis, so the principle that legislation
should act in this area has been conceded. Section 160 of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the OFT the power to review the FSA
rules for competition purposes. Sections 303 and 304 require the OFT to
give the Treasury advice before bodies such as clearing houses can be
approved by the FSA.</div>
<a name="10011486000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">The OFT has
also been given a specific statutory role to keep an eye on the
competition aspects of access to payment services. So the principle is
conceded; it is only a question of whether we make it a more
broad-based power. New clause 9 would do exactly that. It would give
wider effect to the responsibilities of the FSA in the field of
competition, and it would give the FSA a wider interest in working
closely with the OFT to ensure that it is accomplished.</div>
<a name="10011486000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">I said that
there were three or four effects. The third flows from the first two.
The first was that it would act as a counterweight to the ratchet; the
second was that it would strengthen the relationship with the OFT. The
third effect would be that consumers will benefit. In the long run, I
have no doubt that we would have nudged regulation in the direction of
enabling more competition, better products, and hopefully lower costs
than would otherwise be the case.</div>
<a name="10011486000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must never
forget that in creating these institutions we are creating big,
powerful vested interests. Firms like certainty from the FSA; and, of
course, they dislike competitors. If it could, the FSA would want to
avoid any regulatory failure. There is always the risk that its efforts
in that direction would be at the expense of the consumer. It is only
by exercising considerable restraint that have we not found ourselves
in that position. Under the new clause, there would be a counterweight,
at least, a little more of one than we have had so far.</div>
<a name="10011486000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">They have
been touched upon today, but I shall draw out a little more what the
effects would be in practice. Let us take a lively, specific
case&#151;bank charges, which have been discussed. Until recently,
they have been self-regulated under the banking standards code, but we
all know that that has not worked very well, and we have just heard
from members of the Committee some descriptions of how it has not been
working well. The FSA tells us, and I believe it, that it will now be
more assertive in this area. It has limited power to deal with
complaints, and I hope it will be more responsive to those complaints,
but, of course, most bank charges relate to overdrafts&#151;a form of
consumer credit that is self-regulated under the Consumer Credit Act
2006, rather than
FSMA.</div><a name="10011486000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
new clause would not provide a direct regulatory solution to those
problems of bank charges. That said, the operation of the non-borrowing
aspects of current accounts and complaint handling by banks in relation
to overdrafts is subject to FSA oversight and acquiring the competition
objectives would be a powerful spur to the FSA to work closely with the
Office of Fair Trading to address those problems.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column467" />Column number: 467</div><a name="10011486000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
solution to much of the abuse in relation to bank charges is probably
available, at least in principle. I believe that transparency would do
a lot of the heavy lifting, but so far none of the existing regulators
has been able to force the banks to provide it. As the hon. Member for
South-East Cornwall said a moment ago, those reams of terms and
conditions often make things even more opaque and difficult for
consumers, rather than
simpler.</div><a name="10011486000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
an intervention on the hon. Gentleman, I mentioned a proposal, which I
published some time ago through the Centre for Policy Studies, that
bank charges should be identified on regular statements as the
difference between base rates and the interest being earned by the
consumer on that account, and that that should score as a charge. If
that proposal were implemented, the consumer would see very clearly
that there is no such thing as free banking. The market for short rates
is heavily distorted at the moment and the proposal would not work so
effectively in this extremely unusual climate, but it would most of the
time.</div><a name="10011486000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
have those regulators been unable to provide any real pressure on
transparency? Because so much of what is required in bank regulation
falls between the cracks of various legislation. I am not suggesting
that what I am proposing today will fill every crack, but I do suggest
that a competition objective on the FSA would give it the incentive to
engage directly and thoroughly with the OFT to try to address and solve
the
problem.</div><a name="10011486000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ought to say a little about the other main aspect of the interaction of
the objectives that I discussed at the start of my speech. I said that
there were two main areas: systemic risk and conduct of business
regulation. I have been discussing conduct of business regulation. Now
I want to say a few words about the systemic risk
aspects.</div><a name="10011486000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
central issue since the Government&#146;s HBOS intervention is the
creation and establishment of a powerful precedent whereby the
financial stability objective &#151;it is now in the
Bill&#151;could trump the competition objective, or indeed any of the
other objectives. I should refer for now to the competition principles,
because there will not be a competition objective until the Government
accept my measure, which I am sure they will
eventually.</div><a name="10011486000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
interesting aspect of this is that, when one thinks it through
carefully, one has to agree that, in extreme circumstances, one must
accept that there should be such an override. There must be
circumstances in which the systemic risk is so fundamental that all
other objectives become secondary, but we should not forget, when we
allow that to take place, that the consumer will always pay for any
loss of competition as a result, and he needs to be given protection
from exploitation down the line by others. In the HBOS example,
exploitation can all too easily occur as a consequence of Government
action&#151;indeed, effectively by the Government&#151;albeit,
quite reasonably, during their efforts to address a systemic
problem.</div><a name="10011486000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let
me discuss the HBOS case. HBOS was going bust and the Government were
extremely worried about the implications of its failure for the
financial system as a whole. The Prime Minister sidled up to Sir Victor
Blank and said, &#147;Would you please take HBOS off our
hands?&#148; I was not there but I can confidently assert that that
must have been the sub-text. Secondly, he would have said, &#147;If
you do this, you will be doing a great public 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column468" />Column number: 468</div>service.&#148; Eric Daniels, who gave evidence to the Treasury
Committee earlier this week, effectively confirmed that, when he said
that the deal was partly motivated by public interest, which I find
quite astonishing. I would certainly find that astonishing if I were a
Lloyds shareholder.</div>
<a name="10011486000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
thing that the Prime Minister might have said, but probably hinted,
was, &#147;You can buy it on the cheap and, if it turns out that the
true value is negative&#151;because you have picked up so much in
toxic assets that the positive value of some of the assets is
outweighed by the rubbish that has now ended up on your balance
sheet&#151;don&#146;t worry too much, Sir Victor. We have a
solution. The Government will give you a waiver to the provisions of
competition law, enabling you to acquire disproportionately large
stakes in several markets.&#148; The implication, of course, was that
Lloyds shareholders would have an opportunity to recoup losses by
benefiting from the diminished competition for some of their key
products in several markets. Among those, post the merger, are building
society loans and retail bank accounts. That is exactly where we are
now. Indeed, the merger gives the new bank between 30 and 40 per cent.
of market share in certain areas, which I have absolutely no doubt the
OFT would more than raise an eyebrow
about.</div><a name="10011486000226"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
implications of this deal in the long run for competition in the
financial sector are extremely worrying. The Government have now used
their override, somewhat like the override provided to the Treasury in
the legislation creating the independent Bank of England. Once one has
fired the shot, one has changed things quite a bit. In the case of the
interest rate override, one would have changed things fundamentally and
destroyed the Bank of England&#151;it is a nuclear weapon. In this
case, it may be just short of a nuclear weapon but it is still very
powerful. Whatever the Government&#146;s protestations to the
contrary, the effectiveness of competition policy and the OFT has been,
at least for a time, prejudiced by the HBOS-Lloyds competition
waiver.</div>
<a name="10011486000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">Worse still,
and this worries me a good deal&#151;I do not think it is unique to
Labour Ministers, although it may be the ideology, if there is one
these days; the motivation of Labour Ministers tends to be stronger
than Conservative ones in this field&#151;once Ministers get an
appetite for intervention, they tend to do more.</div>
<a name="10011486000228"></a><div class="hs_Para">Only
yesterday, Lord Mandelson took advantage of a meeting with
institutional investors to meddle with the Kraft-Cadbury merger. What
worries me is that those incidents are no longer isolated. In the
Bradford &amp; Bingley-Santander merger, a statutory instrument was
used to disapply the merger control provisions of the Enterprise Act
2002 altogether. As it turned out, that did not make much difference
because the merger met the EU merger regulations threshold and was
therefore examined by the European
Commission.</div><a name="10011486000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
example is the stipulation by United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd
and the UK Government that any assets that may be sold by Lloyds and
HBOS are not permitted to generate a post-acquisition combined market
share with the purchaser of more than 15 per cent. Of course, the
principle is right that those companies should not have a large market
share, but I thought that that was what merger control policy had been
put on to the statute book to address. That does not seem to be
something that should be addressed, directly or indirectly, by the
Government.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column469" />Column number: 469</div><a name="10011486000315"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div><a name="10011486000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is why a final reason for giving the FSA oversight of competition at
the level of its objectives, which is the effect of new clause 9, is
that it could help the OFT to handle Government intervention in the
field. The OFT would work more closely with the FSA on the issue, and
the effect on the regulatory structure would be such that, if the
Government tried to intervene, they would face not one but two quite
powerful
institutions.</div><a name="10011486000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the better aspects of the Government&#146;s new competition policy
was that they said that they would completely depoliticise the issue. I
would find it very concerning if, as a consequence of this crisis, we
found the reassertion of a form of what used to be called an industrial
policy in the financial services sector by the back
door.</div><a name="10011486000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recognise that the Government will not agree to my new clause
now&#151;I can tell that just by looking at the Minister, who is a
happy man and is smiling amiably at me as I speak&#151;but I ask him
at least to agree to think about it carefully between now and the
debate on Report for this reason: I have talked politics for the last
few paragraphs, and the truth is that, one way or another, the
Conservatives will give greater emphasis to competition when we reform
financial regulation. According to the polls, that will occur in a few
months. Perhaps those polls are wrong, and it may happen in a few
years, but either way, it will definitely happen, and I am confident
that competition will be given greater
emphasis.</div><a name="10011486000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
the Minister is prepared to give some further thought to the
new clause now, to consult the OFT, FSA and others and to return with a
proposal on Report, he will do the right thing not only for the
financial sector, but for the cause of working together and forming a
consensus on such an important
issue.</div><a name="10011486000234"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000386"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> I could not resist taking part, given the closing
paragraphs of the thoughtful speech made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Chichester. He is right to say that competition should play an
increasingly important role in how we deal with the financial services
sector. Competition in the banking sector has reduced during the past
18 months or so. My hon. Friend referred to the acquisition of HBOS by
Lloyds, but overseas banks have left the banking market that had
hitherto operated in the retail or commercial sectors. The number of
building societies that operate in the UK has reduced because of a
series of mergers or takeovers.</div>
<a name="10011486000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reality
is that there is an increased risk that consumers will have a poorer
deal if there are fewer players in the market. We want consumers to
have a better outcome. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the
Committee recognise that regulation in itself is
not sufficient to deliver the best outcome for
consumers. A market can be well regulated, but if
only one product is provided, the chances are that consumers will get a
poorer deal, as a consequence of only one player being in the
market.</div><a name="10011486000236"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to address some challenges in considering the role played by
competition in financial services. I intervened on my hon. Friend and
mentioned the complexity of the products in the financial services
sector. That clearly has a bearing on how transparent choice is for
consumers and whether they can assess which products offer good value
for money.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column470" />Column number: 470</div><a name="10011486000237"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are areas where regulation has enhanced the ability for competition to
take place. I shall give the Committee two examples. There is huge
competition between insurers in the motor insurance market, partly
because consumers can chose reasonably well between different products,
given that the product specification at the heart of motor insurance is
common to all products. When people decide whether to take out a Direct
Line or a Privilege policy, they know that either third party, fire and
theft or comprehensive cover will lie at the heart of the policy that
they buy, and they are therefore better able to exercise
choice.</div><a name="10011486000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
of the challenges in introducing competition into retail financial
services is to ensure that consumers can make an informed choice. Our
white paper on financial regulation suggested ways to increase
competition in the marketplace&#151;for example, by analysing the
data that mortgage companies or banks provide on their charges and
enabling those data to be used in a common framework to assess which is
the best bank account or which is the best market. So we can take steps
to improve
competition.</div><a name="10011486000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">Whether
a market is well regulated has an impact on competition, too. The first
debate that I took part in as a Front-Bench member of our Treasury team
was on equity release products. The market had moved from one that was
relatively lightly regulated to a more tightly regulated one. That
transition in regulation introduced new competitors to the market, so
there was greater innovation in products and more choice for consumers.
The cost to the consumer of those products reduced, because more
household names participated in that marketplace. Those people only
entered the market because they felt that their reputation was not at
risk, as the market was better regulated. So we need to consider some
important dynamics in looking at the role that competition can play in
improving outcomes for
consumers.</div><a name="10011486000240"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000387"></a>Mr.
Love:</b> I agree with quite a lot of the thrust of the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s argument, but parts of the marketplace resist easy
solutions. Look at the banking charges for small businesses: in theory,
there should be competition, yet report on report shows that they get a
pretty raw deal from the banks. We seem unable to deal with
that.</div>
<a name="10011486000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Does the hon.
Gentleman not think that in many ways, he and I are talking a similar
language? I have listened to the contributions made on the new clause,
and although the question of the Lloyds takeover of HBOS was raised, no
one suggested that, in the circumstances, they would have opposed it.
Is it not the case that UK Financial Investments and the Government
have been vocal in suggesting that when the Government divest
themselves of some of the banks and other
organisations taken over during that period, they
will ensure that competition is to the fore in the decisions that are
made?</div><a name="10011486000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000388"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> The hon. Gentleman raises two important questions.
On bank charges and whether small businesses are getting a fair deal,
one challenge is to do with people&#146;s ability to switch provider.
If it is difficult to switch, the product provider has the opportunity
to extract higher charges. I know that the OFT is considering the
challenge of how to make it easier for people to switch providers. We
may change telephone providers every year, and those who supply our
gas, or we might 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column471" />Column number: 471</div>alter our insurance every year to get a better deal,
but people are very resistant to changing the people who hold their
bank accounts.</div>
<a name="10011486000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we can
improve switching, we will ensure a better deal, and there will be more
competition in the marketplace because that would encourage innovation.
A new entrant to the banking market who thinks that people are loth to
change providers will question the merit or value of entering that
market. People tend to enter the market where it is relatively easy to
do so, and where the barriers for entry are low, as in the case of the
mortgage or credit card market. People are prepared to shop around for
those things, but they are not prepared to shop around as much for bank
accounts.</div>
<a name="10011486000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the
restructuring of the banking sector, it amused me to hear the hon.
Gentleman say that we are all talking the same language. When we
suggested last year that the Government should use their stake in RBS,
Lloyds and Northern Rock to facilitate a restructuring of the banking
market to increase competition, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury
criticised our proposals. The only reason why the Government support
the measures now is that the European Commission requires them, as a
condition of state aid rules, to ensure that Lloyds and RBS divest
themselves of part of their activities. Although I
welcome the Government&#146;s conversion, it has not necessarily been
a willing one. Competition has an important role, and there is
interaction to be had with regulation.</div>
<a name="10011486000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Chichester also discussed the role that
competition plays as regards systemic risk. One challenge when it comes
to financial stability is that in order to encourage competition in a
market, it is good to have new entrants. He mentioned the barrier
erected around a heavily regulated market by the fact that any new
entrant must deal with the cost of compliance, but even getting
authorisation to enter the market can act as a barrier. We are rightly
placing great emphasis on financial stability, and that might create a
situation in which the barriers to entry are increased further; we need
to think about that
carefully.</div><a name="10011486000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Edmonton discussed the credit market, which has one
predominant supplier. If the barriers to entry are low, the fact that
there is only one supplier does not necessarily mean that consumers
will get a bad deal, because if there are additional profits to be
creamed off, it is possible to enter the market. However, in the
situation with the Provident, quite a lot of infrastructure will need
to be recreated, so the barriers to entry in that sector are high. We
need to think about them and about the interaction between financial
stability and encouraging innovation and competition.</div>
<a name="10011486000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Chichester was right that putting the objective
in the Bill would create a tension. We have had a debate about where
the financial stability objective appeared in the hierarchy. Did it
have equal rank with the others, or did it have primacy over the
others? We reached a point where each objective balanced against the
others. If we were to make competition an objective for the FSA or a
successor body, that would increase the emphasis on competition in the
balance that determines how the regulator fulfils its duties. That is a
factor if we believe that the objectives are important and affect how
the regulator conducts its
activities.</div><a name="10011486000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had a helpful debate. I am pleased that my hon. Friend tabled the
new clause. It has given the Committee plenty of food for thought and
has clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column472" />Column number: 472</div>identified the importance of competition in
demonstrating consumers&#146; right to get a good deal. We will have
to consider, in the context of FSMA and any subsequent regulatory
reform, how to make sure that competition is given the right standing,
so that we can ensure a better deal for
consumers.</div><a name="10011486000316"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="10011486000249"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000389"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> As is usually the case when he is not playing
party politics, the hon. Member for Chichester made a thoughtful
contribution on new clause 9 and on the idea that maintaining
competition should be a statutory objective for the Financial Services
Authority. I think that the arguments are finely balanced, when it
comes to whether maintaining competition should be a statutory
objective, or whether the FSA should have regard to it.</div>
<a name="10011486000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government believe strongly that competition is important for economic
efficiency in general and in creating efficient and responsive
financial markets. To that extent, I do not think that there is any
difference between any of us. We all accept the importance of
competition. In my judgment, the balance of the argument would fall
slightly in favour of including competition as a statutory objective of
the FSA, but that is not the Government&#146;s current
view.</div>
<a name="10011486000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to explain why the Government believe that new clause 9 should not be
in the Bill. Before I do that, I will comment briefly on the other
points that the hon. Gentleman raised. He talked about the fact that a
small number of large firms are easier to regulate than a large number
of small firms. That might be the case, but it does not prevent the
regulator from performing its current role in an effective way. I do
not think that regulators set out to increase barriers to entry for new
firms, and the hon. Gentleman will be aware of recent developments with
new entrants into financial markets. Although we should always be on
our guard against regulatory creep, or regulators acting too
comfortably, it is the responsibility of other bodies to hold
regulators to account and ensure that they perform their jobs
effectively.</div>
<a name="10011486000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000390"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> Will the Minister give way on a point of
fact?</div>
<a name="10011486000253"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000391"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> I will give way in a moment, but I want to pursue
my line of thinking. It is not necessarily the case that a small number
of large firms is likely to produce a less competitive market than a
large number of small firms. That was hinted at by the hon. Member for
Fareham when he suggested that fewer participants are likely to lessen
people&#146;s chances of having a good deal. It is important in
competition policy to look at the dynamics of
markets, and there can be very competitive markets with a small number
of entrants, or uncompetitive markets with a large number of small
entrants. It is up to competition authorities to address that as part
of their regulatory activity. I happily give way to the hon. Gentleman
on a point of fact.</div>
<a name="10011486000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000392"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I will wait.</div>
<a name="10011486000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000393"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> Let me move on to explain why the Government are
not persuaded that new clause 9 should stand part of the Bill. My
personal view is that if the new clause was allowed, I am not sure that
it would have a major practical effect, for some of the reasons that
the Government have.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column473" />Column number: 473</div><a name="10011486000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
must not forget that competition is intended to benefit the users of
financial services. For the FSA, competition should not be an end in
itself, but rather a means to an end. Although we must strive to get
markets working better, that is because competitive markets deliver
economic efficiency, which benefits society by providing consumers with
better goods and better services at better prices. That is the
important point. In other words, competition policy is usually an
excellent complement to consumer protection regulation. However,
usually is not the same as always. Consequently, if it was the case
that competition might not benefit the consumer for some reason, it
would be wrong to prioritise its maintenance. One example of that is
when an excessive proliferation of essentially similar products
actually reduces the overall efficiency of a market. Who pays for that
inefficiency? Normally the
consumer.</div><a name="10011486000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. Member for Fareham said last week when we were discussing
financial education, choice can be bewildering. If the effect of a
plethora of choices is that the consumer gets so confused that they
make expensive decisions or abandon the idea of taking up a useful
product such as an insurance policy or a savings account, that is not
the outcome that we would seek. Again, that raises interesting
questions out of which some behavioural economists have made careers.
That is something that we need to take account of as part of our
practical policy
making.</div><a name="10011486000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
does not mean that the Government are uninterested in competition in
financial services&#151;far from it. The FSA should definitely
continue to minimise any adverse effects of its actions on competition,
and it should remain mindful of the general desirability of
facilitating competition. Those are its duties under section
2(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, and they should
remain in place, in addition to the FSA&#146;s main objectives. The
nature of the duty to be imposed on the FSA was considered carefully
when the Act was introduced, as the hon. Member for Chichester knows,
and placing such duties in the &#147;have regard to&#148; list
under section 2(3) was the correct result, in the Government&#146;s
opinion.</div><a name="10011486000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government have a further argument against the new clause, namely that
it is not necessary. As members of the Committee are no doubt aware, as
mentioned in the text of the new clause, the UK has two separate
competition authorities: the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition
Commission. The competition regime is world-class and it is
independently ranked as one of the top three globally. As for financial
services specifically, the OFT already has a duty
to keep the FSA&#146;s regulations and practices under review on
competition grounds, and may involve the Competition Commission. That
can be found under sections 159 and 160 of
FSMA.</div><a name="10011486000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore,
to ensure that the FSA is fully involved in competition issues, it and
the OFT are engaged in continuing dialogue. As the hon. Gentleman
noted, last month they announced plans to strengthen co-operation on
competition issues through the signing of a memorandum of
understanding. It has also been agreed that the FSA&#146;s annual
report will in future incorporate a section on competition in the
sector, in which it will set out relevant actions that it has taken.
For those reasons, the Government believe that there is no need to
extend the specific objective to the FSA.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column474" />Column number: 474</div><a name="10011486000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the Government&#146;s view, the new clause would not be of benefit,
given other parts of the existing statutory framework. I am sure that
the hon. Member for Chichester agrees that the aim of competition is to
gain better outcomes for consumers; it is not about having competition
for competition&#146;s sake. A strong competition regime is in place,
which is applicable to financial services. I hope that I have outlined
in sufficient detail the Government&#146;s view of the work that is
already in progress to strengthen further competition in UK financial
services, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="10011486000262"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000394"></a>Mr.
Tyrie:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, which,
to say the least, was extremely frank and interesting. I am
disappointed he thinks that I play party political games. I am not
generally noted as one of the worst offenders, but in response to his
admonishment, I shall try harder to do better in
future.</div><a name="10011486000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
wish to refer to three things outlined by the hon. Gentleman, the first
of which was fascinating and extremely refreshing in that he
distinguished between his view and that of the Government. That is
healthy. I was impressed by it. It is rare, and without going into a
lengthy digression, that is because the media seize on any distinction
of that type immediately to conclude that there are great divisions in
the Government, as a result of which we often have the absurd position
when, one minute, everyone believes one thing, and the following minute
they all seem to believe something quite different&#151;rather like
ears twitching on a herd of deer. That is regrettable. It has occurred
in the post-war period of British politics. It is relatively new and
dates from the &#146;60s and &#146;70s. It is perfectly possible to
have the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility without the identity of
expression of view in between
times.</div><a name="10011486000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second point is that I was particularly pleased that the Minister
personally favours inclusion of competition as an objective of the FSA.
He joins what we could fairly safely call the majority party on that
issue over the past decade, and I am glad to have him on the
team.</div>
<a name="10011486000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
major point that the Minister made, which I think was also very fair,
was that he did not think that new clause 9 would make a great deal of
difference. I do not know whether that is true, but the fact that he
has given his personal view tells us that the measure is unlikely to do
damage. Indeed, he did not allege that it would, even when he was
expressing the Government&#146;s view.</div>
<a name="10011486000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">My only
regret is that the Minister did not pick up on the point that I made
that we will have further change in this area anyway. I do not know if
that change will come in a few months or in a few
years, but it will definitely come. The Conservatives have worked very
hard on this Bill and on the Act over the years. A great deal of work
has been done by my party colleagues in the past decade to try to be as
consensual as possible in this field. Indeed, that point was made about
the original Bill, on which we laboured in this Committee Room or just
next door for nearly two years.</div>
<a name="10011486000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I very much
hope that as the Minister thinks this matter through, he will perhaps
send back a message to say that we need to start doing some work on it
internally, even if I cannot persuade him to come back on Report,
because sooner or later this change will happen. In the meantime, I beg
to ask leave to withdraw the
motion.</div><a name="10011486000268"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Clause,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000396"></a>Ian
Pearson:</b> On a point of order, Mr. Gale. I want
to take this opportunity to thank you, Mr. Gale, and
Mr. Benton for the very efficient way that you have chaired
these proceedings, which has ensured that we have got this Bill through
in the time allocated for it.</div>
<a name="10011486000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want
to thank the usual channels, in this case my hon. Friend the Member for
Leeds, East and the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East for
their co-operation.</div>
<a name="10011486000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
clerks, who have worked extremely hard on the Bill, and the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, who I hope have made some good sense of my
mangled English during the course of these events. I also thank the
Doorkeepers and the police for the work that they have done.</div>
<a name="10011486000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also want
to thank very much indeed my team, who have provided a level of
scrutiny of the Bill and who have supported it. I believe that the Bill
is a significant addition to legislation in an important sector and is
to be greatly welcomed.</div>
<a name="10011486000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen for their contributions. I must say
that it is a slight shame that we have not had the opportunity to hear
the words of wisdom of the hon. Member for Twickenham, but the hon.
Member for South-East Cornwall was a very capable deputy and played a
full part in these proceedings, as did the hon. Member for Fareham, who
was characteristically thoughtful and extremely thorough. I also felt
that he was extremely even-handed in the way that he put
representations to me from both industry and consumer groups, while
appearing, on occasion, to agree with both sides.</div>
<a name="10011486000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lastly, I
thank my Bill team, who have been terrific throughout our
deliberations. Without them, I would not have sounded nearly as
sensible as hopefully I have done on occasions during the passage of
the Bill. They have put in a lot of hours to ensure that we have got
the Bill right.</div>
<a name="10011486000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
listened carefully to all the points made during the debate. I have not
felt able to support Opposition amendments, but I have in certain areas
indicated that I will consider further the points that were made. If
appropriate, we will come back to them on Report. With that,
Mr. Gale, thank you again for your efficient chairing of
proceedings.</div><a name="10011486000317"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.45
pm</div>
<a name="10011486000278"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000397"></a>Mr.
Hoban:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Gale. I would like to echo the Minister&#146;s thanks to you and your
co-chairman. On the Opposition Benches, we owe a debt of gratitude to
the Clerks. We are not supported by a team of parliamentary
draughtsman, so we accept their help in tweaking amendments to ensure
that we get the wording right. I am very grateful for their patience in
dealing with such matters.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column476" />Column number: 476</div><a name="10011486000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank the
<i class="I">Hansard</i> reporters, the Doorkeepers and the police, as well as
all those who contributed to the oral and written evidence sessions and
who made representations to us
all.</div><a name="10011486000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am rather flattered by what the Minister said. I agreed with both sides
on certain issues, so I am clearly developing the ability to speak with
confidence about whatever I have to say. Nothing I say now sounds in
any way probing, so that is good. That might be a skill I will need in
future.</div><a name="10011486000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am grateful to the members of the Committee who participated in the
oral sessions and the scrutiny stage. One of the strengths of the
Committee, as in other Committees on which the Minister and I have
served, has been the experience of Back Benchers that has been brought
to bear. My hon. Friend the Member for Chichester has the experience of
debating not only FSMA but on the Treasury Committee. The hon. Members
for Edmonton, for South Derbyshire and for South-East Cornwall have
contributed their expertise. They are not the only people on the
Committee who have helped to illuminate our
proceedings.</div><a name="10011486000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have had consensus and sharp disagreements, but throughout the process
the Committee has been a good-natured one and certainly one that I have
enjoyed participating
in.</div><a name="10011486000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000398"></a>Mr.
Breed:</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Gale. I add my thanks to all those who have helped in this interesting
debate. The Bill will be part of a suite of legislation that will be
ongoing well beyond the end of this Parliament and on into the next.
Those who will be charged with that responsibility will have to tackle
some of the issues that we have tried to tackle, because they will come
back. The fundamental issues are more difficult to tackle with the
state of play at the moment in financial services and in the economy
generally, but some important issues have been teased out on
amendments.</div>
<a name="10011486000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">My personal
sadness is that this is my last Bill. As many hon. Members know, I
shall be standing down after about 13 years. It has been an enjoyable
last Bill. To all those who are going to carry on in the job, I wish
them jolly good luck.</div>
<a name="10011486000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="10011486000399"></a>The
Chairman:</b> I have listened intently to what the three hon.
Gentlemen have said, and I am happy to say that none of that is in any
way a point of order for the Chair. However, as we are out of order, I
add my thanks and those of Mr. Benton to the Officers of the
House, the Clerks, without whom we simply could not do our job. I am
grateful to the Committee for its tolerance of the temperature in the
various rooms that we have been in, and also for the manner in which it
has battled its way through inclement conditions to complete the Bill.
That, by the way, is a comment on the weather and not the contents of
the
Bill.</div><a name="10011486000286"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Bill,
