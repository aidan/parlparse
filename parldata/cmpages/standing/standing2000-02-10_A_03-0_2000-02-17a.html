<H5>10 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce </B>(South Dorset): On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. Has the Minister asked to intervene in our proceedings? We are discussing a number of things to do with what is now the Office of Telecommunications and its powers. Yesterday, the Chancellor made a statement—or it was leaked—about how he intended to proceed with BT. I wondered whether the Minister had some information for us that would enable members of the Committee to keep up with the new Government policy on this matter.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> That is not a point of order for me, but I am sure that the Minister has heard what the hon. Gentleman said.
<P>

<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority</center></H4>
<P>
Amendment proposed [15 February]: No. 29, in page 152, line 5, after the word `two', to insert the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`and no more than five.'.—(Mr. Gibb.)<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing amendment No. 13, in page 152, line 6, after `State', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`who shall be executive directors.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): Amendment No. 13 is designed to ensure, on the one hand, that the authority does not have an extremely dominant chairman, with the other two or more members being essentially rubber stamps, or, on the other hand, that we do not finish up with a body that suffers from inertia.
<P>
If the Government intend to have a single chairman, that is not much of a change from the present position. To tack on a few non-executive directors with an advisory role does not necessarily add much to the authority's impact and effectiveness. Even if a few non-executives with expertise and experience turn up part time, they will not necessarily be able to offer the commitment and the availability that ensure that the authority is genuine, plural and effective. Full-time executive directors would offer such commitment and could provide a balance to a chairman who was too powerful or too idiosyncratic.
<P>
We have seen cases in the past where the character, skills and impact of a chairman of a regulatory body have brought a distinct flavour to its operation. That may be the Government's intention, in which case we do not need to bother with the other people appointed, but if the authority is to have a coherent, balanced and well-rounded policy, the other directors appointed in accordance with the schedule must have the clout, the time and the authority to play their part effectively.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to amendment No. 13, which is simple and straightforward, to ensure that executive directors work with the chairman in the authority.
<P>
<B> The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I take this opportunity to welcome you to the Committee, Mrs. Roe. We were commenting the other day that both Mr. Hood and you are noted for your interest in gardening and horticulture. We shall endeavour to get through the Bill as quickly as possible so that you do not miss the planting season.
<P>
I want to correct some of the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) when he opened the debate on these amendments on Tuesday. The first relates to his comparison of Ofgem's forecast expenditure of £64.5 million for 2000-01 with the combined spend by Offer and Ofgem of £29.8 million three years ago. He said that the regulator, Callum McCarthy, attributed that increase to redundancy payments to Offer staff who were unwilling to move from Birmingham to Ofgem's headquarters in London.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is doing a huge disservice—doubtless unwittingly—to Callum McCarthy. When he appeared before the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on 25 January, Callum McCarthy explained that there were two significant one-off projects that had contributed to the increase in Ofgem's forecast expenditure for the next financial year. Certainly, the first was the merger of Offer and Ofgas, but the second, and more significant project, was work on the new electricity trading arrangements—the creature that we shall describe as NETA. Ofgem's forecast expenditure on that project alone is £13.2 million, which accounts for a sizeable proportion of the forecast expenditure increase. Most people are aware of why the reformed electricity trading arrangements must be put in place and the benefits that they will bring. We shall be considering that subject in due course, and I do not want to try your patience, Mrs. Roe, by discussing it now.
<P>
The second of the hon. Gentleman's misapprehensions that I should correct relates to the size and composition of the new regulatory authorities. He cited the Government's conclusion that the regulatory authorities should comprise three full-time members, which was set out in their response to the consultation, published in July 1998. However, on 27 July 1999, my ministerial predecessor, my hon. Friend the Minister for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) told Parliament that, in the light of further analysis, and having consulted the regulator and the industry, the Government had decided that Ministers should be able to appoint any number of members to the new regulatory authorities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> I am a little confused as to why we are discussing these issues. We as Committee members are continually written to by people describing themselves as the chairman designate, or some such title, of Ofgem or the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council. Have the Government already decided who will fill these posts, and established them in their offices? Is this debate a waste of time?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We are spending time discussing the matter because of the amendment, which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton tabled. At the moment, no one has been appointed to those authorities. The director general, Callum McCarthy, to whom I have referred, is in post during the transitional period, and the Government intend that he should become chairman of Ofgem. However, the further membership of the authority has yet to be decided, and we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter later on. Both Government and Opposition Members acknowledge the expertise of Callum McCarthy, who was appointed in the normal manner to oversee the transition—a considerable administrative exercise in itself. Members of new regulatory authorities may be full-time or part-time, and executive or non-executive, so that the size and composition of those authorities can meet the requirements of each office and change over time in response to developments.
<P>
On Tuesday, we had a number of discussions on one of the Bill's key advantages. It will provide flexibility over time, taking into account changes in the market and increased competition, which will reduce the need for forceful regulation and allow a lighter touch. That requires flexibility in relation to the expertise and background of those who serve on the new regulatory authority. The amendments would restrict that flexibility in the size and composition of the authority, so we cannot support them.
<P>
Amendment No. 29 would limit the maximum size of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority and the Telecommunications Authority to a chairman and five other members. The optimum number of executive posts in each authority is likely to be such that that would severely restrict the scope for appointing non-executive members. I turn to amendment No. 18.
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): The Minister is alarming me slightly. I felt that I was being generous in suggesting five members, rather than three or four. Given the Minister's dismissal of that number as over-restrictive, what is the maximum number that she would find acceptable? For example, would she accept an amendment on Report that specified 20, 50, or 100?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman misses the point. Because of the need for flexibility, we are not prescriptive in relation to the size of the authority. We shall take the advice of the chairman of Ofgem on its operational responsibilities, including who should be on the executive board and the kinds of functions that they should be fulfilling. The amendment is unhelpful, as was the hon. Gentleman's intervention. However, it is an improvement on amendment No. 13, which would altogether deprive the Secretary of State of the power to appoint non-executive directors. It appears to represent a kind of public relations exercise for regulatory boards.
<P>
When the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) spoke to amendment No 13, he suggested that non-executives are a bit of an irrelevance and do not have the necessary knowledge, commitment or experience. That completely misses the point of the debate that has been going on over the past 10 years about the role of non-executive directors in relation to the overall corporate governance of companies and authorities. Underpinning that debate has been the recognition that non-executives not only provide an important mix of skills, perspective and experience, but serve as a check on the activities of executive directors who may seek to overreach their authority. It would be a retrograde step to take the route suggested in the amendment.
<P>
One of the key changes that is involved in the new regulatory structure is the depersonalisation of the whole concept of regulation, which will provide regulatory certainty through a new kind of authority that is not too dominated by the personality or prejudices of one specific regulator. Using non-executive directors is an important aspect of depersonalising regulatory decision making. It introduces some objectivity, thereby increasing the legitimacy of the regulation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> The Minister has taken my point about the need to depersonalise the role of the regulatory authority. Does she also accept that there is a weakness in having entirely non-executive directors, and that there should be a balance?

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I take the hon. Gentleman's point. If he looks at the Bill he will find that it includes that balance, in that there is to be a mix of executive and non-executive directors. We have to accept the judgment of the chairman of Ofgem and the executive board in choosing non-executive directors who have complementary skills to those that are represented on the executive board, including the experience to be able to do the questioning job that is a critical part of the mix of responsibilities of non-executive directors.
<P>
Working alongside their executive colleagues in a corporate-style regulatory authority, non-executive directors will provide a great many additional skills and a different perspective. We had an interesting discussion recently about fuel poverty. There will be great advantages in having people experienced in dealing with the consequences of fuel poverty giving the benefit of that experience to a corporate regulatory authority.
<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Important technical issues are emerging as the technology in the energy and telecommunications markets changes. It will be valuable to bring in people who operate in those markets in a variety of ways. Non-executive directors will bring a breadth of experience that will be invaluable given the scope of economic activity for which the regulators are responsible.
<P>
There are unlikely to be sufficient executive posts to accommodate the optimum number of members for each authority, in terms of the demand for their skills and perspective. Many highly qualified people who could give of their expertise to a regulatory authority may be unable or unwilling to accept full-time executive posts. Alternatively, their skills may be better suited to strategic matters—they may have a knowledge of strategic issues connected to the industry acquired over a lifetime. They may have reached a stage in their career at which they do not wish to hold a full-time executive post, but it would be a tragedy for an industry as important as this to lose those skills.
<P>
The industry requires the knowledge and experience of people who have an overview not only of the industry but of society. It would be wrong to bar such individuals from playing a part in the new regulatory authorities. The appointing of non-executive directors will give a more corporate flavour to decision making. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove spoke of the danger of the chairman being a dominant personality. I believe that non-executive directors would be a counterbalance to such a chairman, or any other executive or non-executive member of the regulatory authority. Strong, competent non-executive directors will provide that balance. Given the benefits of appointing non-executive directors, it would be wrong to adopt a measure that restricted the scope of the Secretary of State to do so.
<P>
I shall address the claim made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton that the creation of the new regulatory authority would lead to expansionary tendencies on the part of the regulators. The power to appoint members of the new authority and, therefore, to determine its overall size and composition, will rest with the Secretary of State, who is answerable to the House. The chairman of the authority will not decide those matters, although it would be crazy not to consult him or her about appointments to the boards.
<P>
In the light of my remarks, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen will not press the amendments to a vote. If they do so, I shall ask the Committee to resist them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Welcome to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. I am slightly worried by your keenness to start your planting, because our finishing by Easter will depend on the estimated 900 amendments that the Government are rumoured to be considering. So far, they have tabled only 39. I am, therefore, concerned as to whether you will be able to be released by the spring.
<P>
The Minister said that we need not worry about expansionary tendencies of the authority, because the Secretary of State will look after us all and ensure that the poor suffering consumer—the payer of electricity and gas bills—will not be faced with huge extra bills as a result of an expansionary authority. However, the Government's record in keeping control of the bureaucracy and the cost of government is not one of which they can be proud. In just two and a half years, they have increased the cost of government by £1 billion. There is a tendency among Labour Governments, new or old, to be rather profligate with the public purse. It is always fun to spend other people's money on pet projects, and there are signs that that tendency has crept into the Bill. What is the problem with specifying maximums? That would ensure that taxpayers and those who pay gas and electricity bills will not be forced to pay huge additional costs as a result of expanding bureaucracy.
<P>
Will the Minister agree to a maximum? The figure need not be small—she could still give the chairman flexibility. She did not even confirm that the maximum number of authority members would be less than 100. Parliament should have significant powers as a result of concerns about public spending, but it is worrying that the Government want to refuse to allow it to set a maximum number of members of an authority, which will impose costs on bill payers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Chope </B>(Christchurch): Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem could be alleviated if the Government accepted the principle that the running costs of regulatory bodies should be limited? The fact that there are currently no controls on running costs has obliged Conservative Members to propose other controls, such as specifying a maximum number of people who can serve on the board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We shall later consider Opposition amendments that would have such an effect—they would limit annual increases to no more than the retail prices index. We are also trying to add other safeguards. I suspect, unfortunately, that the Government will resist our attempts to keep controls on spending because our experience of them, and of previous Labour Governments, is that they do not care how much public money they spend in order to pursue their objectives.
<P>
 It is not the big rich fat cats who pay most of the taxes in any civilised society; it is always the average person who struggles to make ends meet who has to pay tax bills, levies and the additional costs on electricity and gas bills. The vast silent majority would prefer it if the Government were as thrifty as most households.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brian White </B>(Milton Keynes, North-East): Do I take it that the hon. Gentleman is issuing an apology on behalf of the previous Government for the millions of pounds that they lost through the poll tax, BSE and black Wednesday?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The previous Government made considerable efforts to control public spending, which is extremely difficult. There are many pressures on Governments who seek to keep spending under control—lobby groups and interest groups benefit from such spending. If a Government are dedicated to keeping control of public spending, they might just be able to do so, but if their prime purpose is not the need to keep taxes and public spending under control, costs will inevitably escalate. That is what has happened under this Government. Since they came to office, they have allowed the costs of bureaucracy to escalate by £1 billion a year. Our reasonable amendment would set a maximum number of members of an authority, but the Government are resisting the proposal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> Labour Members are displaying a bit of levity; they appear to believe that this is not a serious matter.
<P>
I am sure that my hon. Friend realises that additional costs that are placed on industries can have devastating effects on those industries. He will have noted that, overnight, BT shareholders lost £2 billion, and that, in effect, the Treasury lost £800 million in capital gains tax because of its attempts to place additional burdens and costs on industry.
<P>
<B> Mr. Gibb:</B> Indeed; such activities have other consequences. First, they reduce the level of investment in those industries because the price of a company's paper indicates the cost of capital and how much it can invest. Any increase in the cost of capital to utilities will be passed to the consumer. Secondly, they can keep out potential entrants to the market, which will lead to less competition. Competition, more than any other factor, drives down the prices that consumers must pay for their utilities services. An expansionary authority could have a damaging effect on the consumer. I cannot detect any understanding of that philosophical point in the Government. They need to understand the importance of keeping control of authorities, and not allowing them to become expansionary and costly.
<P>
In responding to the debate, the Minister questioned my concern about the answer given to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) in the Select Committee that Ofgem costs are estimated to be £64.5 million in 2000–01, compared with an average annual cost of £29.8 million. The Minister replied that £13 million of that figure related to NETA. That still leaves millions of pounds of extra spending by Ofgem in 2000–01, to pay for moving offices from Birmingham, for example. The Minister's dismissal of that concern shows again that the Government have no understanding of the expansionary nature of the state sector. There is no incentive to keep costs under control, no possibility of bankruptcy, and customers cannot walk away if they feel that the price is too high. There is only one authority, and people are required to pay licence fees. It is therefore necessary to build in safeguards. It distresses me that the Government will not take those points on board.
<P>
The Minister also referred to a written answer in July, in which the Government changed their mind about the proposals in the Green Paper. I was aware of that written answer, but my point was that the Government's original intention was to limit the number of authority members to three, whereas the Bill has no matching number. That indicates that the Government have made a deliberate policy decision not to seek to limit numbers on the authority. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that such a limit is imposed. We are considering one of the most important aspects of the Bill. It is necessary to limit the costs and expenses that the new authority arrangements will impose on industry, and, therefore, on the consumer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chope:</B> Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister whether she will split Ofgem expenditure between special items such as NETA and on-going running costs? My understanding is that the running costs of the single organisation will be as great, if not greater, than those of the two previous organisations. That is counterintuitive—normally, one would expect the amalgamation of two bodies to produce a saving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. One would expect there to be synergies in the merger of two authorities. In this case, it seems that the synergies will result in Ofgem employing a higher number of staff than the total employed by the two previous authorities—Offer and Ofgas. I shall ask the Minister whether the £64.5 million figure could be split between special items—such as NETA and moving to London—and Ofgem's on-going annual costs in future years, in order that we may compare the £29.8 million average annual costs of the combined authorities previously.
<P>
The escalating costs of regulation will be passed to the utilities, which will inevitably pass them to the consumer. The regulatory impact assessment and the Green Paper say that the costs of regulation and the consumer councils will be borne by the consumer. On behalf of consumers, will the Minister try to build in safeguards, so that they will not be forced to pay vast extra sums in their utility bills? More entrants to the market are necessary to ensure that competition continues, as it has since privatisation, to force down prices and costs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> Our discussion may be more interesting than I thought. We have had a wide-ranging debate.
<P>
The purpose of amendment No. 13 is to avoid the possibility of what the Minister described as the idiosyncratic behaviour of a single person regulator. I was pleased that the Minister acknowledged that that potential difficulty should be overcome. That is the purpose of our amendment.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I want to correct the Minister on one point. My view is not that the skills and experience of non-executive directors would be insufficient, but simply that they may not have the time or the commitment to capture an errant chairman. There is a difference between the view that we are advocating and that espoused by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. We believe that a strong and effective regulatory system is necessary. In particular, we want issues of social and environmental concern to be firmly within the regulatory ambit, and we want a regulator who is equipped to deal with that and who does not, in the Minister's words, take an idiosyncratic view of how those regulatory functions should be implemented.
<P>
It is important to ensure that, alongside the chairman, there are powerful and effective co-directors on the board of the authority. I understand the Minister's argument that a wholly executive authority might exclude some people who have the necessary skills and experience but cannot make a full-time commitment, but I want her to acknowledge that there must be a proper balance on the authority between those two categories of people.
<P>
I am concerned about the way in which people may be appointed. It is one thing to strike a balance between executive and non-executive directors, but the Minister came close to saying that some people may need to consider the strategic way ahead and the words ``pensioned-off' flashed into my mind. There is a risk—it has occurred previously—that people with the necessary skills and experience of the industry but not necessarily of the broader regulatory issues may be appointed because they are essentially being pensioned-off I am sure that the Minister will say that the range of people will be diverse, but paragraph 1(2) of the schedule states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall consult the chairman before appointing any other member.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is good, and such consultation should take place, but there is a risk of the authority becoming a self-perpetuating, self-appointing elite.
<P>
I shall not press the amendment, but I have some underlying concerns. I appreciate that the Government are alert to the issues that I am raising, which will arise time and again in our amendments. We must have a regulator who is effective not just in commercial and consumer affairs, but in social welfare and environmental regulation. That requires a broad-based, full-time, active authority drawing on people with the skills, clout and time to deliver those objectives.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I want to respond to the hon. Member for Hazel Grove first. All appointments will be made according to the appointment procedures. I take his point about the old boy network applying more than it should have done in the past and that some corporate boards have looked like the Costa Geriatrica. The Government have tried to encourage the concept of public service among a wider range of people—I referred specifically to fuel poverty—and that is important in this context. Our desire to achieve a balance between executive and non-executive directors is implied in everything that we have done. There is no point in having a dominant executive board and perhaps one or two non-executives who are there to keep them out of the way of the traffic or to give them something to do on a wet Thursday afternoon. The Government's concept is much wider than that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked about cost to the consumer. The further that we go in the Bill, the more that I am convinced that the Opposition do not want reform of regulation, as we conceive it, putting the consumer at the heart of the regulatory system. They are still wedded to the previous concept of regulation, where the fat cat is king. The regulatory changes will cost each consumer 20p a year. That is probably more than my constituents spend in stamps writing to me about the inadequacies of the present regulatory system.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman says that there will be no control over running costs. He misses the point. The regulatory authority will be a Government Department and will have to present its estimates to Parliament for scrutiny, so it will have to operate transparently.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Will my right hon. Friend go further? She may have had—as I have—a briefing from the Utility Buyers Forum, which points out that the new meter arrangements will save business and commerce an estimated £500 million this year, and that a similar figure will flow to domestic customers shortly afterwards. Surely the Opposition were negligent when they had responsibility for these matters, because they did not implement a framework to bring about such savings for consumers—both business and domestic.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> As always, my hon. Friend makes an important and powerful point, which exposes the Opposition's inadequacies.
<P>
For the reasons that I have given, I urge the Committee to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Again we have heard the Government's complete misunderstanding of the issue. The Minister says that running costs will be kept under control because they will be looked at by the Secretary of State, but all the Secretaries of State of this Government, and, indeed, a majority of 179 Labour Members of Parliament, have not resulted in proper scrutiny and costs being kept under control. The evidence is in the fact that costs of running government have increased by £1 billion since the Government came to office. The Government's resistance to the Opposition's reasonable amendments, which seek to apply a maximum to the number of staff and members of the authority and to its expenditure, shows that they have no determination to keep the costs under control.
<P>
The hon. Member for Plymouth, South (Mrs. Gilroy) referred to the savings from the meter arrangements and said how disgraceful it was that they had not been implemented by the previous Government. As we have already said, we support the new electricity trading arrangements, provided that they result in a proper market. When the electricity industry was privatised in 1989 there were very few players, and the pool arrangements were the only possible ones. It was the Conservative Government who broke up the industry and made it competitive and, as a result, brought down the price of electricity to consumers by more than 30 per cent. in real terms in that period. Had the Labour party had its way in 1989, when the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Prime Minister led for the Opposition on the Committee considering the Electricity Bill, those savings would not have been passed on to the consumer. Therefore, it is hypocritical of the Government to present the Bill as pro-consumer, when over the past 10 years the Labour party has done its level best to prevent the consumer enjoying savings in electricity prices from which we have all benefited.
<P>
In view of the Government's resistance to our reasonable amendment, we shall press it to a vote.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Amendments Nos. 34 and 35 would ensure that appointments to the authority are referred in advance to the Select Committee on Trade and Industry. That would apply not only to the members of the authority, but to the chairman.
<P>
I am quietly confident that the Government will accept the amendment, because it is similar to some that were tabled by Labour Members in opposition during the Committees that considered the Bills that were enacted as the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989. The amendment to the Electricity Bill stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The Secretary of State shall make the appointment of the Director''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, the director of Offer—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultation with the Select Committee on Energy and the consumers committees, who shall be given the opportunity to interview and question the appointee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). The amendment that was tabled to the Gas Bill proposed that the director general of Ofgas should be appointed
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``after consultation with the Energy Committee of the House of Commons''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It was moved by Peter Hardy, who was then the hon. Member for Wentworth.
<P>
Given that the Labour party was wedded to such measures then, why should the Labour Government not accept them today? In fact, consultation is more important in this case, because the regulatory authorities are to be given significantly more powers under the Bill than the director general was given previously.
<P>
I may be wrong about the Government accepting the amendment. They have recently run into enormous trouble with the Trade and Industry Committee, which is doing a good job. Its Chairman, the hon. Member for Ochil (Mr. O'Neill), is exposing the Government's appalling behaviour in attempting to lie to the public about spending that has taken place. I shall back up that allegation by quoting from yesterday's edition of The Times, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Stephen Byers, the Trade Secretary, was reprimanded by the all-party Trade and Industry Select Committee yesterday over his attempt to manipulate news announcements and restate policy.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The article continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``There is also growing concern in some government circles at the DTI's performance, particularly over its policies on the euro and competition.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Mr. O'Neill (Labour, Ochil) said that the DTI's press department must take account of the workings of Parliament, to which it is accountable.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It then states that members of the Committee—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``challenged Mr. Byers over an announcement of an enterprise grant—a facility that has been developed from the Regional Selective Assistance programme. He denied that it was simply a restatement of existing government policy; instead, it was a `refocusing'. Mr. O'Neill said: `For refocus you really mean not new money.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Select Committee is doing a splendid job in exposing that kind of behaviour. It is dishonourable for politicians to try blatantly to mislead the public about how taxpayers' money is being spent. The Committee has already published a report stating that the Department of Trade and Industry has a regrettable habit of dressing up announcements with potentially misleading figures. In view of how powerful the Committee has become in scrutinising the Government's activities, it would be highly advisable and desirable for the appointments to be made after consulting it about the kinds of people who will be appointed.
<P>
The regulator's role as set out in the Bill is far more intrusive and policy-oriented than before. Under clause 46, for example, he or she will have the power to make statutory instruments—in other words, to legislate in a way that cannot be subject to a negative resolution of the House. The Government talk endlessly in press releases and documents relating to the Bill about the transparency and accountability of the proposed new regulatory regimes. In a press release of 21 January 2000, when the Bill was published, the Secretary of State said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is now 15 years since the first utility, British Telecom, was privatised. It is time to modernise utility regulation and provide a more consistent, transparent and accountable regulatory framework. This will be good for customers and good for the utilities.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
There we have it. The Government wax lyrical about how they want a more accountable system of regulation, so would, make perfect sense for them to consult the Trade and Industry Committee before those key members of the regulatory authority are appointed. A similar process now takes place with the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, in which people submit themselves to scrutiny by the Treasury Committee prior to appointment. If the Minister will not accept the amendment, will she instead give a commitment to refer all appointments to these authorities to the Trade and Industry Committee voluntarily?
<P>
On that point I shall finish, although I could spend a lot longer quoting from a great many documents—for example, the responses to the consultation document and the Green Paper—in which the Government talk about wanting to improve the accountability of the regulatory regime. The best way to achieve that would be to require members of the authority to subject themselves to the scrutiny of the Trade and Industry Committee. I understand that the Government are having a difficult time with the Select Committee, which is doing a thorough job, and that it is for that reason that the Government have decided not to accept the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> This is perhaps an occasion on which a gap may be opening up on this side of the Committee. That will no doubt delight Labour Members.
<P>
Three of the amendments deal with bringing the Trade and Industry Committee into the appointment process. We have no difficulty with that, but we are disappointed that the Conservatives have not seen fit to say that other aspects of the regulatory authority are also important. Where are the references to the Environmental Audit Committee and the Social Security Committee?
<P>
If the House is to be directly involved in the appointment of these people, all aspects of the regulatory authority should be exposed and the specialist areas of the House should be brought to bear on that process. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce), who will no doubt speak at great length on the matter soon, asks why we have not tabled an amendment to that effect. We believe that the Bill contains the right approach—that is, a requirement for the Secretary of State to consult the chairman before appointing other members.
<P>
I hope that those three Committees, and other groups in the House, will make representations, stage debates in the House, bring pressure to bear on the Secretary of State, and perhaps even pass legislation requiring the Secretary of State to take these matters seriously. Perhaps, during our deliberations in Committee, provisions may be inserted into the Bill requiring the regulator to do the same. There is nothing wrong with the amendments as such, but they form just one leg of what should be a three-legged stool. That stool will fall over in its present form.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> In effect, the amendments introduce the idea that Parliament should scrutinise the appointment of the chairman, and offer alternative ways in which that could be done. I believe that idea to be correct, and I am somewhat surprised at the aggressive stance that our Liberal Democrat colleagues have taken in respect of there being insufficient parliamentary scrutiny. If they believe that by adding Select Committees we would get more sympathy from the Government, they are trusting individuals. However, were the Government minded to go in that direction, we would be only too pleased for Parliament to have greater opportunity to scrutinise appointments.
<P>
Amendment No. 73 would require that the Commissioner for Public Appointments be consulted. I did not want to confuse Committee members by requiring that both he and the Trade and Industry Committee be consulted, although it is true that I would like both to be consulted.
<P>
The reason for consulting the commissioner is threefold. In a previous debate, the Government refused to accept an amendment requiring people to declare interests, particularly political affiliations and donations made to political parties, whether secretly or publicly. It would be useful for the, commissioner to be involved because the forms that must be filled in to apply for public appointments require that such interests be disclosed.
<P>
That route is not necessarily a public one. The Minister seemed to feel that such a measure would involve breaking confidences. Those who have donated money to a blind trust may want to keep the matter quiet and may not want to influence the Prime Minister. Of course, the Prime Minister does not know who donated the money that enabled him to get elected and eventually hold that office. Under the amendment, such information would be available to the Secretary of State when consulting the commissioner and would remain fairly confidential.
<P>
The second reason why the commissioner should be consulted relates to the Minister's comments on widening the range of applicants. When Ministers say that they would love to have lots of additional applications for public appointments and encourage hon. Members of all political parties to find people with ability, we do just that. I have written local press releases to that end, and people who I know are members of political parties other than my own have expressed their interest. I have ensured that application forms are sent out and that people are on the register.
<P>
I am sorry to report that there has not been a flood of appointments, but the people are out there—people with relevant experience who have retired early or have reached a point in their career when more time can be spent on public appointments—and they are known to Ministers. As with an employment agency—I used to run one—the more people are in one's bank of data, the easier it is to match those with relevant experience, disabilities, political backgrounds or industrial backgrounds. It would be a good idea to have the commissioner involved at every stage of the process.
<P>
The remaining issue concerns civil service suggestions. The BBC produced a wonderful documentary called ``Yes Minister'', which explained how the civil service appoints its placemen. We often discuss the Prime Minister's cronies, but civil servants are much cleverer than us politicians—when a Minister is thinking about an important appointment, he may be told about three or four candidates, only one of whom has remotely sufficient ability to be considered for the job.
<P>
Civil servants cleverly ensure that the person who gets the job is not someone who will challenge the civil service structure. We all know that Ministers end up being moved because of what civil servants want. Candidates usually appear on a limited list. I have been present in a Minister's office with a Secretary of State who had received a list from the civil service. When no civil servants were present, the Secretary of State turned to colleagues and made some choice remarks about the way in which the list has been presented. ``Yes Minister'' showed how candidates can be advanced.
<P>
We need a Commissioner for Public Appointments—I am glad that that position exists—and there must be openness and width of application. We should also ensure that adverts appear regularly. That would ensure that other people can apply for positions. Ministers should not get a limited list because civil servants want to ensure that only civil service-friendly people will appointed. We would have a better system if the Commissioner for Public Appointments was included in the loop and if we made it an absolute that the relevant Minister had to talk to the commissioner.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton argued strongly for parliamentary scrutiny. We need a system in which appointments are considered by a Select Committee perhaps the Trade and Industry Committee—or another Committee of the House. That system would ensure that Parliament had confidence in the people who are appointed to regulate one of the utilities.

<P>

<B>Ms Linda Perham </B>(Ilford, North): I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Roe. As you know, we share a connection—for nine years, you were my representative on that bastion of London democracy, the Greater London council.
<P>
I am interested that the hon. Member for South Dorset thinks that ``Yes, Minister'' was a documentary. I think that he will find that it was supposed to be fiction.
<P>
I am a member of the Select Committee on Trade and Industry, and I am glad that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton praised it. We are all power hungry in this place, but I appreciate his comment that that Committee is doing its job. It has a Labour majority, but it is an all-party Committee and we are entitled to scrutinise and to question the Government.
<P>
How would consultation with that Committee, or with another Select Committee, work? Are there precedents for consulting Select Committees, regardless of whether Government authorities are involved? Would people's CVs be given to all 11 members of the Trade and Industry Committee and would a couple of names be put forward? How would the process work in practice? I believe that I understand what Opposition Members are seeking in this regard, but the mechanism could be difficult. I am sure that the Minister will take on board my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> We have had an illuminating insight into how the previous Government operated in relation to public bodies. We are having quite an enjoyable morning in that regard.
<P>
I am interested that the hon. Member for South Dorset advertises in his constituency for people who might be interested in a public appointment. I encourage my constituents to do the same. The best way to ensure that more people apply for public appointments is to be more complimentary about public service. Those who give their time to public service usually end up being rubbished right, left and centre. That is a bigger inhibitor to public service than anything else.
<P>
I have extreme difficulty with the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. If his proposal is such a great idea, why was it not introduced by the previous Government? He points to previous debates in the 1980s, long before he or I were Members of Parliament. That would have been the opportunity for previous Governments to accept such amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister seems to think that Opposition Members are not able to learn from her. When she was in opposition, she proposed amendments such as this, and won the general election. As we are trying to defeat the Government, we are trying to pick up on some of their good ideas. I am shocked that, just because she is in government, she wants to rubbish that idea.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am flattered to know that I am responsible for winning the general election. I shall have to make sure that the Prime Minister knows about that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would reflect that the Labour party also managed to lose—spectacularly, I would say—a couple of elections. One of the reasons why the Government's majority seems to go up weekly is that we apply common sense to our measures. The amendment completely lacks common sense. For example it would require the Trade and Industry Committee to be consulted on all appointments. What happens if there is a disagreement between the Trade and Industry Committee and the Secretary of State? Are Opposition Members suggesting that we should move to the American system of confirmatory hearings?
<P>
Holders of public offices are liable to be called before the Public Accounts Committee. Anybody who has been before that Committee, or watched it, knows that it is not exactly auntie's tea party on a Sunday afternoon. It is a rigorous experience, which anyone who has a public appointment of such quality has to undergo.
<P>
The amendment would also weaken the power of the Trade and Industry Committee as an effective scrutineer of the regulatory process, as it would have been implicated in the appointment of those who serve in the regulatory authority. How could a Select Committee therefore be dispassionate in criticising the activities of a regulatory authority? The amendment lacks common sense, and I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton complained about the fact that the regulatory authority has the power to make statutory instruments. He seems to overlook the fact that the current regulator has the power to make regulations in relation to standards of performance. The Government whom he supported did not see any cause to get rid of that.
<P>
I shall move on to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for South Dorset, which deal with a different point. Despite the illuminating introduction to the activities of the previous Government in making public appointments, which I am sure that the Committee will reflect on, he shares the Government's view that appointment procedures must be completely open and above board. That is what lies behind the advertising of appointments and the Nolan recommendations. Those of us who were Members of Parliament at the time know why the Nolan committee was necessary Standards had to be set down in relation to appointments and the behaviour of those in public life. It would be difficult to suggest a system that reduced the opportunity for proper scrutiny of those who offer themselves for public appointment.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is legitimately seeking to ensure openness and transparency in public appointments. In doing so, however, he would introduce a new system of appointments procedures that would establish a precedent and render consultation with the commissioner on individual appointments difficult.
<P>
<B>Mr. Christopher Fraser </B>(Mid-Dorset and North Poole): Would the Minister use the same principle for appointments to the House of Lords?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman knows that proposals for the reform of the House of Lords are before both Houses and in the public domain. We are here to discuss the regulatory arrangements for gas and electricity. If the hon. Gentleman had turned up on the first day of the Standing Committee, instead of wandering in from the Corridor, he would know what the Committee was about.
<P>
The amendments reduce the impact of the arrangements that are being put in place to ensure that the members have a wide spread of experience and expertise. To return to my earlier point, if these ideas are so good, the Conservative party had 18 years in which to implement them. It did not do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Opposition did have 18 years, during which time they did propose these institutions, so I am astonished that the Labour party, now that it is in office, has not accepted the proposals. I am astonished that they were not in the Bill.
<P>
The Minister said that the Trade and Industry Committee would somehow be implicated in the regulator's activities if it were to be involved in the appointment, but that is precisely what happens with the members of the Monetary Policy Committee. All the members of that committee appear before the Treasury Committee before or shortly after their appointment and answer detailed questions about their views and their experience. The Treasury Committee will subsequently take evidence on the Monetary Policy Committee's performance and see how it is performing vis-à-vis the economy. It does not feel implicated by having had quasi-confirmatory hearings of the appointments to that Committee. It is a completely spurious argument.
<P>
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Ms Perham) asked what the mechanism would be. On the Treasury Committee the CVs are circulated. I have the CVs of all the members of the Monetary Policy Committee on my bookshelf, because at that time I was a member of the Treasury Committee. They are circulated to the Committee and can be used as a basis for questioning those members. Therefore, it could work quite simply. The mechanism is not cumbersome and would not tarnish the Trade and Industry Committee's future work in scrutinising the authority's activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chope:</B> To reinforce my hon. Friend's point, even the fact that members of the Trade and Industry Committee represent the same party in Parliament as the Government did not stop them laying into the Secretary of State at the last meeting.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The chairman of that Committee, the hon. Member for Ochil, was very critical of the dissemination of false information by the Secretary of State, even though he is from the same party. I have great faith that the Select Committee will be able to scrutinise the authority's activities effectively, although it has taken evidence on the appointments.
<P>
I am particularly astonished by the Minister's response to the amendment, because the Government's response document, under the heading ``The accountability of Regulators to Parliament'' on page 29, says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The response to the Green Paper indicates strong support for ensuring that regulators are held effectively to account—to Parliament, to the consumer and more widely.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What better way is there to hold the regulators to account than by questioning them in the Select Committee before or shortly after their appointment? Indeed, proposal 7.11 in the document says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The appointment of Select committees is a matter for Parliament. However, the Government's view is that the current Parliamentary arrangements have allowed for effective scrutiny of utility regulation. Parliament might take further steps to ensure effective co-ordination between the existing committees when they address utilities issues.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What are the further measures that the Minister has in mind? Surely an effective further measure would be for the Trade and Industry Committee to question those who are about to be appointed to the authority?
<P>
I should be grateful if the Minister would respond to that point before we finish the debate. What did she mean in proposal 7.11 by
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``further steps to ensure effective co-ordination between the existing committees when they address utilities issues''?<P>

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I shall respond briefly, because we have had a fair run round the houses on this amendment. There are procedures before the House to ensure that there is co-ordination between Committees. The utility regulator can be summoned before any Committee, including the Public Accounts Committee. That should allay the anxiety of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. His amendment is mischievous and would add nothing to the Bill, so I recommend that the Committee resists it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We have had a wide-ranging debate with disappointing responses from the Minister that expose the Government's humbug about wanting more effective parliamentary scrutiny. They are full of words, but there is no delivery, as with so much from this Government. In view of the time spent on it and the Opposition's keenness to make good progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 152, line 15, leave out if `five' and insert `three'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 77, in page 152, line 15, leave out `five' and insert `four'.
<P>
No. 79, in page 152, line 15, leave out `five' and insert `two'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> One amendment in this group was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker) and me and two were tabled by a Conservative Member. On this occasion we seem to be exploring the same point. The amendments would reduce the maximum period of office from five years to three years under our amendment, and to two years or four years under the Conservative amendments. My purpose was to explore the period of office that is appropriate for the chairman and other members of the board to serve to secure a period of effectiveness and then a turnover of appointees.
<P>
Reference was made earlier this morning to the size of the authority but the Minister did not respond specifically. The appropriate period of office is linked to the number of people and the rate of turnover. We want to ensure continuity of office-holding and the retention of experience and knowledge without fossilisation.
<P>
The Minister was good enough when responding to a previous debate to say that she, too, was anxious to avoid placepeople and a parking lot version of the regulatory authority. We are exploring how to balance the conflicting demands of introducing fresh blood and retaining skill and experience in an era of rapidly changing technology and social policy and, at the same time, ensuring that the authority retains its experience, vision and direction over a long period. We need a long-term, not a short-term perspective, but it is necessary to remain abreast of technology and developments in international and national markets and use the experience and skills of those who have worked in the industry and elsewhere.
<P>
The purpose of our probing amendment is to debate the issues, to hear the Minister's response and to establish it clearly in her mind and in the drafting that those objectives will be maintained.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Bruce:</B> I tabled three amendments and the hon. Member for Hazel Grove has not noticed that my name also appears on his amendment. My amendments simply suggest a range of years—two, three and four—instead of five. The Clerks realised that a similar amendment had already been tabled, and rightly added my name to those of the Liberal Democrats. It is interesting to note that the Liberal Democrats occasionally get something right.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Stunell:</B> First, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for failing to notice that he had arrived at the same sensible conclusion. As is so often the case, Liberal Democrat Members have taken the middle way.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> A number of people claim allegiance to the middle way, or the third way, but we shall stick to our last.
<P>
During an earlier debate, the Minister was scathing about our suggestion that a sunset clause should apply after a five-year term, and said that it would be nonsensical for the Bill to stipulate a fixed period, but the schedule states that a limit of five years should be placed on any one appointment, and paragraph 3(3) states that a chairman or a member can be reappointed. There is no decision day after five years, after which someone cannot have the job again. On each occasion on which someone is appointed, it should be determined how long the appointment is to be for.
<P>
The five-year appointment is definitely too long. That is because the Secretary of State at the end of this Parliament—when the appointment will be made—will, in effect, be able not only to decide who will be the chairman and the members of the authority for the Parliament in which he holds office, but to stop any changes between that Parliament and the next but one. I hope that the Hansard reporters can sort that out for me. It has been a long day. If the period were to be reduced to four years, it would be fairly certain—assuming a change of Government from Labour to Conservative to Labour, and ignoring the ridiculous idea that there could be a Liberal Government—that a Secretary of State could have his people in place for the whole of the next Parliament, which would be of a different political persuasion, and develop a different set of criteria as to what he wants the authority to do.
<P>
It would be sensible at least to reduce the period to four years and, for other reasons, I should prefer a much shorter period. I am sure that you, Mrs. Roe, as an experienced Member of Parliament, know what happens when the chairmen of health authorities reach the end of their appointed period. They suddenly start ringing up Members of Parliament to invite them to do this and that, consulting people, announcing what they plan to do, and generally rushing around. One wonders why, when they have simply been sitting there for five years, they are suddenly terribly active. Of course, the answer is that they are about to be reappointed, or want to be reappointed. If people are given a five-year absolute guarantee and can be removed only because of incapacity or misbehaviour, not incompetence, they have a fairly comfortable existence. They can think, ``I'm here now; I've got my salary for the next five years; when I want to get reappointed perhaps I'll start to do a bit more.''
<P>
<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): Would the hon. Gentleman like the maximum length of a Parliament to be reduced from five to four years for the same reason?
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> As the hon. Gentleman knows, Members of Parliament, partly because of our postbags and immediate access to the newspapers, start fighting the next election from the day on which the previous one was held. We are always active. That is especially true if one has a majority of 77, as I have, or is a Liberal Democrat; they always have to live with small majorities.
<P>
Chairmen and members of authorities such as health authorities, GEMA or the Telecommunications Authority tend to be fairly anonymous to the public. The media leave them alone until a row breaks out over prices or someone's salary going up. They are not under the kind of scrutiny that we are.
<P>
A shorter period—perhaps we could split the difference and settle on three years—would let appointees know that they had sufficient time to do the job without instantly being replaced, but would encourage them to be active during those three years to ensure that they were reappointed for another three years. Setting such a maximum term, which could be followed by a reappointment—a person could continue to be reappointed for 30 years, if necessary—would give the Secretary of State the opportunity to decide on each occasion whether he was getting value for money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is my hon. Friend aware that, while the Gas Bill was being discussed in Committee in 1986, the Labour party tabled an amendment to the same effect as the one that my hon. Friend has tabled? Mr. Peter Hardy, the former Member for Wentworth, tabled an amendment proposing to leave out ``five'' and insert ``two''. He then did the same as my hon. Friend in putting in a number of options, and tabled a further amendment to leave out ``five'' and insert ``three''. He justified this by saying:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``If there are to be huge salaries, the public interest should be safeguarded by having a shorter period of office.''—[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 16 January 1986; c. 97.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> That is yet another reason, and it was well put by an experienced and well-established Labour Member of Parliament coming to the end of his parliamentary career. We should all take note of his words.
<P>
The Government should choose one of the amendments. We have saved them the cost of drafting time by offering them three options, and I am sure that, with a nod and a wink, we might get full unanimity in the Committee in choosing the option favoured by the Minister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I start by clearing up a point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove. He asked why the words ``not exceeding'' five years had been used. Schedule 1 sets a maximum period of five years. The words ``not exceeding'' permit the Government to appoint members for different periods. It will be especially important at the beginning to have continuity, rather than reappointing the authority in chunks of five years. There is no magic to the concept of five years. We have chosen that period to strike a balance between an appointment so short that the member barely has time to get used to his or her responsibilities, and one so long as to risk a degree of regulatory stagnation.
<P>
There is also the question of arm's-length regulation. We must ensure that the regulators are truly independent from the Government. A very short maximum term of appointment would result in a reliance on multi-reappointments, which would detract from the independence of the individual. Given the need to strike that balance between short and long appointments, I believe that five years is the right period. It is also the maximum period for an appointment for regulators under existing legislation, and there has been no clamour for change in respect of those rules.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bruce:</B> The Minister already has some chairmen designate. What indication have the Government given as to what period would appear in their contracts of appointment, if it were not the maximum period allowed in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am not aware that the Government have given any confirmation as to how long the appointments of chairs designate will be. I shall check that and come back to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
There are three executive and five non-executive members of the non-statutory board of Ofgem. That seems to be working well, and people seem comfortable with the idea of five-year appointments.
