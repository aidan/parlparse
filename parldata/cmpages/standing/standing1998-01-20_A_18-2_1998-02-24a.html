On resuming 
<H4><center>Clause 93</center></H4>
<H4><center>Permitted selection: aptitude for particular subjects</center></H4>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Members of the Committee will not need me to remind them that we had an exhaustive debate this morning on selection. The amendments that the Committee is about to debate relate to the narrow definitions of aptitude and ability. I shall resist the ingenuity of members of the Committee to broaden the debate further than that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 377, in page 68, line 30, leave out "aptitude" and insert "ability".
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 378, in page 68, leave out lines 34 and 35.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendments were trailed during our earlier deliberations, not least by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston in her intervention before dinner. The purpose behind them is to probe the distinction that the Government want to draw between partial selection based on ability, which is the subject of clause 91, and partial selection based on aptitude, which is the subject of clause 93.
<P>
The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Bath believe that such a distinction is difficult to draw, and I agree with them. Clause 93 is not about the aptitude or the ability of a child for a particular subject. We could just about draw a distinction between general ability and ability in a particular subject, but clause 93 is not about that because it refers to aptitude for one or more prescribed subjects. We want to know whether it is possible to draw a distinction between general ability and aptitude for a range of subjects.
<P>
In seeking to draw such a distinction, the first and obvious port of call was the dictionary to establish whether a refinement of meaning had hitherto escaped me and whether it could help me to understand the difference between the concept of aptitude and the concept of ability. The Oxford English Dictionary" was not much help, because one definition of aptitude was "natural ability".
<P>
Clause 91 deals with ability and clause 93 deals with aptitude. There is supposed to be an important conceptual difference between the two words, but, given that one word is defined in the dictionary as the other, that poses a certain difficulty. In response to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk, I have to say that I am not sure that the meaning of the clause will be changed much if we add to it the word "natural", so that it reads:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"for admission to the school by reference to their natural aptitude for one or more prescribed subjects".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I do not want to labour the point unduly, but, in normal usage, every member of the Committee, regardless of his or her political views except in this context will use the words "aptitude" and "ability" as words with virtually, if not exactly, the same meaning. We are discussing general ability and aptitude for a range of subjects. I do not understand the distinction that the Government are drawing between the two concepts. I am once again indebted to the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston, because she said earlier that she was looking forward to the Minister defining the two words to describe a conceptual difference, which the dictionary has hitherto failed to find. She also said that she was clear that there were no reliable measures of aptitude or, presumably therefore, of ability.
<P>
<B>Ms Beverley Hughes:</B> Could I clarify matters for the Committee? The right hon. Gentleman was raising the point about tests for aptitude and wrongly rehearsed a statement that I made in response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Bath. What I said just before the break was that I was not personally aware of the current state of innovation in testing for aptitude, but that I knew a man who was and who would reveal all.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I think that the hon. Lady was also looking forward as is the rest of the Committee to hearing the Minister explain not merely how we could develop reliable tests of aptitude but the difference between aptitude and ability.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Having, over lunch, obtained the permission of the Whip to speak for longer apparently we have an extension of half an hour would the right hon. Gentleman be happy to fly with someone who had an aptitude for flying or with someone who had the ability to fly an aeroplane?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My case is that the two words have exactly the same meaning. The hon. Gentleman has asked me a question about which I have some experience, as he may know, because I was for a while a licensed pilot. In order to fly an aeroplane, I had to demonstrate neither ability nor aptitude, but the capacity to fly the plane in a safe way. Natural ability was not enough; that is a different concept. I had to pass a test to demonstrate that I could do that [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. There is a certain amount of post-prandial murmuring. The speaker has the right to be heard.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale. Neither selection by aptitude nor selection by ability have anything to do with the test of competence, which is the right way to describe a flying test and, indeed, a driving test, which is a rather less refined version of the same thing.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> The Royal Air Force spent a great deal of money trying to determine aptitude. It had trouble doing so because there was still a failure rate among those that they accepted. The test to be given training was not one of trying to fly the aeroplane there were a whole set of co-ordination tests, which were thought to relate to future performance. They were a test of aptitude. Before people flew aeroplanes and could take somebody up with them, they had to prove that they had the ability to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The hon. Gentleman asked me whether I would take to the air with someone who had either an ability or an aptitude to fly. The answer is no; I would take to the air only with someone with proven competence in flying an aeroplane, which is a totally different concept.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raises the question of the nature of tests to prove whether there is natural ability or aptitude. It is not my case there are no tests that can assess general ability or general aptitude that is the case of the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston. We can test for general ability and for aptitude to develop particular skills.
<P>
The clauses will write into law a right for an admissions authority to select a number of children entering an individual on the basis of ability, in clause 91, and of aptitude, in clause 93. I do not understand what is the difference in concept between the two words; nor does the author of the "Oxford English Dictionary", because he defines the one by using the other. I believe that the Government have drawn a distinction of convenience in order to try to leave open the door to the principle of partial selection of the cohort of recruits into schools that fall as volunteers into the category defined in clause 93.
<P>
I do not object to the principle of partial selection. The debate on that has continued all day and I have made my views clear. However, it is irritating when hon. Members argue that there is a conceptual difference between selection on ability and selection on aptitude for one or more subjects. I can just about accept aptitude for one subject as a basis for making a distinction, but we are discussing aptitude for a range of subjects. I look forward to the Minister's distillation of the distinction between aptitude and ability, which has eluded the authors of the dictionary.
<P>
I also hope that the Minister will tackle the 10 per cent. bar, to which clause 93(1)(b) refers. If it is right to allow schools to develop a selection-based admissions policy, which assesses aptitude for a range of subjects, why does the Bill limit the proportion of selective admissions to 10 per cent.? The Minister will argue, correctly, that that is nothing new, and that the principle is contained in legislation that the previous Government passed. The amendment that I tabled to clause 91 proposed a more flexible interpretation of the sort of admissions policy that the Minister believes to be desirable.
<P>
Clause 93 provides for a different admissions policy from that which we discussed previously. Until now, Ministers have said, when under pressure, that they oppose the admissions policies of grammar schools. However, Ministers cannot argue that they oppose the basis for selection for which clause 93 provides, because it would allow any school that constitutes an admissions authority not only foundation schools, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough implied earlier, but all foundation and voluntary-aided schools to develop a selective admissions policy. Such a policy is more selective than any existing policy. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of the difference between the form of selection in the clause and other forms of selection of which the Government disapprove. The Government believe that the former is desirable, but not so desirable that the proportion of selective admissions can exceed 10 per cent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The Government's approach to schools that can demonstrate a specialism has been consistent. We allow them to give priority to 10 per cent. of pupils who can demonstrate a relevant aptitude. The White Paper, which was published last summer, says that we will ensure that schools with a specialism will be able to give priority to children who demonstrate the relevant aptitude, as long as that is not misused to select on the basis of general academic ability.
<P>
We believe that a clear distinction can be made between aptitude and general ability. The right hon. Member for Charnwood claims that it is a distinction of convenience that we use to hide our desire to retain selection by ability. He implied that such a distinction had never been made before, and that the previous Government, in which he was a Cabinet Minister, did not make that distinction in legislation.
<P>
Let us look at what the previous Government did, starting with circular 6/93 on admissions, which stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Authorities can introduce up to 10 per cent. selection on the basis of ability or aptitude."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The clear implication is that the Government could see a distinction between ability and aptitude.
<P>
Perhaps even more relevant is the Education Act 1996, which was introduced when the right hon. Member for Charnwood was a member of the Cabinet. Section 7(a) requires the parents of every compulsory school age child to cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable to his age, his ability and his aptitude. A clear distinction is made there by the Government of which the right hon. Gentleman was a member; these are not dictionary definitions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I look forward to this anthology of the legislative provisions of the previous Government, but if the Minister wants to develop the argument that the previous Government imported into legislation a difference between ability and aptitude and sought to apply different selection policies on the basis of that difference he will have to do a great deal better than he has done so far. The two quotations simply referred to ability and aptitude as a selection of different concepts without, as he avers, suggesting that there is a difference between them. Nothing that he read out suggested that there was a difference between them. They could equally well be read as being a list of concepts with similar meanings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I was using them to show that the right hon. Gentleman said that we had introduced this distinction as a matter of convenience. I was drawing to the Committee's attention the fact that the Government of which he was a member made this distinction on several occasions. I can understand why he does not have intimate knowledge of circular 6/93 as he was not an Education Minister at the time, but it deals with admissions and relates to selection. It says there can be up to 10 per cent. selection on ability or aptitude. There is a clear distinction between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> What is the distinction?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The distinction is one that the Conservative Government felt it necessary to make in circular 6/93. We are making a similar distinction here: I will come on to say what it is. The right hon. Gentleman said that we had hoisted this flag of convenience because there was no real distinction. My point is that a distinction has rightly been made between aptitude and ability, not because of a dictionary definition but for legal reasons.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister keeps saying that the quotations establish a difference of principle. They establish no such thing. They simply establish the wisdom of the parliamentary draftsmen in protecting the legislation of the previous Government against casuistry of the kind to which this Bill descends. The Bill makes the difference of concept between ability and aptitude the basis of two different legislative provisions. The quotations he read out list the two words together, implying clearly from the context that if they do not mean exactly the same thing they have meanings that are so close that there was no desire to draw a distinction. That is the key point. The previous Government did not, on the basis of the quotes he has used so far, draw any distinction. This Government are seeking to draw a wide distinction between the two concepts.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not want to labour the point but the right hon. Gentleman must look at section 7(a) of the 1996 Act. [Interruption.] I wish that I had brought a copy along. The right hon. Gentleman clearly needs to refresh his memory of what he supported when he was a member of the Cabinet. It places a legal requirement on the parents of all children of compulsory school age to ensure that their children receive an efficient full-time education that is suitable to their "age, ability and aptitude". A clear distinction is made and a legal requirement is placed on parents.
<P>
If ability and aptitude are two distinct concepts, what is the distinction between them? I shall answer that and then go on to say how aptitude can be assessed. Before I do so, however, I refer to the point made by the right hon. Gentleman about clause 93(1), which refers to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"one or more prescribed subjects".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will concede that, particularly in music, art or drama, a child may have an aptitude for more than one subject. We would not want to bar such children from the provisions of the clause, which is why children with an aptitude for drama as well as in music are covered by the provisions of clause 91. Children may have an aptitude for more than one subject, and we do not want them to be denied opportunity. That is why they are covered in clause 91.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am listening carefully, and I am genuinely looking forward to hearing that distinction.
<P>
The Minister's argument does not hold much water. No distinction is suggested in the Bill. If the Bill did not allow for more than one subject, there is no suggestion that it would prevent selection by aptitude on the basis of a single subject. It would prevent the selection of children who had high levels of aptitude for more than one subject. The effect of the provision for more than one subject is to allow a school to declare itself a specialist school, for instance, in maths and English, and to conduct a selection process on the basis of its declared specialisms. That is a long way from what the Minister is saying.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is, but our legal advice is that if the Bill mentioned a child's aptitude for only one subject it would create difficulties if the child could demonstrate an aptitude for more than one subject. It could become an exercise in semantics. I can say only that that is the advice that we received from parliamentary draftsmen.
<P>
The practical effect may not be that different, but it may be a belt and braces approach if there is a dispute. Given the right hon. Gentleman's expertise and experience, he knows full well that every effort is made when drafting Bills to ensure that they are watertight. If that means making a detailed explanation of exactly what will be covered, that is what parliamentary counsel will do.
<P>
I know that hon. Members have been waiting with eager anticipation for most of the day to hear of the distinction between ability and aptitude. I do not want to delay the Committee any longer. I shall go at dictation speed, so that hon. Members can take a note of the two definitions. The best definition was given in the instructions to counsel in drafting the clause. The definition is relevant to the piloting of a plane. Ability is what a child has already achieved. Aptitude is the natural talent and interest that a child has in a specific subject in other words, the potential to develop a skill or talent.
<P>
That is the distinction in the Bill. I am pleased to put that on record. With ability, we are talking of where a child is already. With aptitude, we are talking of a child's scope for development in the future an innate talent in a particular area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I have waited all day for that definition. Would the Minister say that aptitude and ability are more closely linked to social class than anything else?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That says an awful lot about the perception of some people. I do not accept that. Provided a proper assessment is made, I believe that young people can demonstrate a talent in a particular area and a scope to develop that talent. I shall give a good example of a college on Tyneside that is allowed to band on the basis of ability, where the principal can identify an aptitude in technology. His approach helps youngsters who come from some of the most deprived inner-city parts of Tyneside to demonstrate an interest in technology.
<P>
A rather more detailed distinction between ability and aptitude is made in a research paper published by the Department for Education and Employment. The [Mr. Byers]
right hon. Member for Charnwood may say that we are biased in quoting from our own documents, but this one was published by the Government of which he was a member, and it shows how aptitude tests apply to technology. The report, published in 1996, clearly makes the distinction that can and should be made between ability and aptitude. It states that it is important to make the distinction between general ability and aptitude. Ability may be an all-embracing factor which suggests whether a candidate will be able successfully to undertake a course of study. In contrast the notion of aptitude is much narrower. It can be regarded as a smaller set of attributes which predicts a specific outcome. In part, the measure of aptitude is an assessment of a pupil's capacity to be trained or developed. That takes us back to the point made earlier about aptitude being a matter of talent and interest and their development, whereas ability is something a child has already attained.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> I take it from the Minister's two definitions of aptitude, as capacity and potential, that he is directly disagreeing with the earlier comment by the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston, who said that aptitude was not based on potential but was completely different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I would never disagree with my hon. Friend. I think that she was expressing the same concept in a slightly different way. I shall now move on quickly to give examples of how aptitude might be assessed.
<P>
The instances that I cite are being practised by schools that assess on the basis of aptitude. In technology, a mechanical reasoning test is used to ascertain whether a child understands mechanical concepts and can reason with them. The candidate is asked to perform practical tasks, or is engaged in discussion about something that he or she has made or intends to make. In the arts, an audition may be appropriate for someone who has the potential to sing. Opportunities can also be given to demonstrate sporting potential.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Does not what the Minister has just said amount to a statement that there are assessment procedures that assess pupils' ability to do the things that he described? For the procedures to be measures of aptitude there must be clear evidence of correlation between the ability to do those things and a subsequent higher ability. The correlation between ability to perform tasks and subsequent increased ability is meant to demonstrate aptitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I do not agree. I want to give the example of Emmanuel college, Gateshead. It is a very good city technology college and its principal, John Byrne, used to be head teacher of a high school in my constituency. He was an excellent head teacher and is an excellent principal of the CTC. The CTC is allowed to band on the basis of ability, but as it is a technology establishment it conducts an assessment of aptitude which can be tested simply. John Byrne and a couple of other teachers give individual children a model that is battery driven and works on wheels, cogs and levers and the children are asked to talk about it. It is as simple as that. That test can establish, across the range of abilities, whether a child has an aptitude for technology.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster</b><i> indicated dissent.</i><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Moss:</B> The hon. Member for Bath shakes his head, but I would rather rely on the expertise and experience of a seasoned principal such as John Byrne than on the hon. Gentleman's views. That principal has demonstrated the success of the test, which has ensured that children from all social backgrounds on Tyneside benefit from that college's education.
<P>
<H5>9 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am sorry but that will not do; the Minister must develop his argument more powerfully. He tells the Committee that a specific selection procedure allows a pupil to look at and comment on a model. I can well understand how that might distinguish pupil A from pupil B in terms of their ability to comment on the model in ways that are either acceptable or unacceptable to the examiner.
<P>
Subsequently, I presume that the successful pupil will enter the technology college and do reasonably well in technology. However, the Minister has not demonstrated that there is any correlation between the child's answers about the model and subsequent success in the CTC. Indeed, such success may be the simple result of the child attending the CTC and working well at technology studies. One would expect a degree of success. If the Minister is not interested in my views, I hope that he has consulted his senior adviser, Mr. Michael Barber, who has done some research on this subject.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman confuses a number of issues. I made it clear a few minutes ago that aptitude is about potential. It will not be fulfilled in every youngster. I therefore do not follow the right hon. Gentleman's argument about correlation. We have never said that there is a correlation between the two, only that by assessment it is possible to show whether a child has an aptitude for a subject. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough and the hon. Member for Bath are confusing ability, which shows achievement 
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> The Minister misunderstands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> No I do not. I repeat what I said 10 or 15 minutes ago that ability demonstrates what a child has already achieved. There is therefore likely to be correlation with success in that case. Aptitude, however, demonstrates potential and it will not be fulfilled in every case. I am not arguing that there is a correlation. I contend, rather, that, at the point of assessment, a genuine distinction can be made between ability and aptitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> There is now a conceptual barrier between us, which I shall try to deal with. The Minister has described a test that is carried out in a particular school, and it is obvious that he thinks that it is a good one. However, I wish to understand how information about different pupil responses to that test can provide a realiable guide to which students will automatically do better in technology. How does he know? What is the research connection between them? Such correlation must be demonstrated to confirm that the test that he is describing will identify potential or, as the Minister wants to term it, aptitude.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The hon. Gentleman is trying to make me comment on something that I did not say. The record will show that I have never said that a child who demonstrates an aptitude will automatically achieve success. The clause draws what we believe is a valid distinction between aptitude and ability. It will be left to the professionalism of those carrying out the assessment in individual schools to make that distinction. We are conscious that there might be disputes about the provision and that people might use it as a back-door form of selection on the basis of ability. That is why a mechanism will be provided the right hon. Member for Charnwood got this slightly wrong that can be used to challenge foundation schools and voluntary-aided schools that declare themselves to be schools with a specialism and start giving priority to 10 per cent. of children on the basis of aptitude. If someone believes that the provision is being used inappropriately, another admissions authority can refer the matter to the adjudicator. That will be provided for in the code of practice that we shall introduce in regard to clause 76.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> Where is the statutory basis for that?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It will be in the code of practice on admissions, which will provide that a school that declares that it has a specialism, but is operating a form of assessment on aptitude that is inappropriately based on ability, can be referred to the adjudicator.
<P>
<B>Mrs. May:</B> In response to the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood, the Minister said that the arrangements would apply to foundation or voluntary-aided schools schools that are themselves the admissions authority. Would he confirm that under clause 79, community or voluntary-controlled school governing bodies can also be admissions authorities and that the arrangements would therefore apply to them?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> That is right, provided that the school and the LEA agree that the school is an admissions authority. Such a school would then fall within the same regime as voluntary-aided and foundation schools we use those categories of school as shorthand because they are automatically their own admissions authority.
<P>
On the cap of 10 per cent. of children assessed on aptitude, it is always difficult to know where to judge the level. We had some interesting debates about where it should be drawn and it was eventually decided that a figure of 10 per cent. would be appropriate. That seemed to create the right balance because it would be enough to offer diversity, but not too large to change the school's character. As always, there will be arguments for and against that figure, but 10 per cent. is the level that the Government recommend in the Bill so it must be right.
<P>
I hope that I have addressed the issues that have been raised. Clearly, I shall never satisfy certain hon. Members; I have to accept that burden, which I shall bear for many days. Nevertheless, I believe that a clear distinction can be drawn between aptitude and ability. I believe that the provisions in the clause will enable us to offer diversity within a modern comprehensive system. For those reasons, I commend the unamended clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> As the Minister was concluding his remarks, I think that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said "Oh, heavens". That will be the reaction of anyone who takes an interest in this subject. The Minister's argument beggars belief. First, he invited us to accept a definition of ability that, he said, focuses the concept exclusively on the proven attainment of the child. According to the Minister, a test of ability is not a test of the child's prospects, it is purely a test of attainment. That is nonsense.
<P>
The Minister has often been described at least until this evening as someone in line for promotion.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> On ability or aptitude?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> On tonight's performance, I suspect that it is neither. In general, the Minister is described as able. That is not a reflection of his limited attainment to date. It is a reflection of the view of specialists about his prospects. When the Minister is defined as an able man, it is not because he is thought to have delivered a great deal in the past, it is because he is seen to hold promise for the future at least in the eyes of some observers.
<P>
The Minister has tried to define ability purely in the context of attainment. That definition would suit my purposes far better than it suits the Minister. However, it clearly does not reflect the general understanding of the meaning of the word.
<P>
The Minister then referred to aptitude as a narrower concept than ability. He saw it as a forward-looking concept, as opposed to ability, which he seeks to persuade us is a backward-looking concept. The problem with the argument that aptitude is a narrower concept is that the dictionary does not seem to recognise that emphasis. However, even if we accepted the Minister's proposition that aptitude is a narrower concept, there are still two fatal flaws in his argument.
<P>
The first is that the clause, as drafted, allows aptitude in a broad range of subjects, not in a single, narrow subject. In response to that point, the Minister said that that definition was necessary for drafting purposes. That might or might not be true, but it does not alter the fact that the clause allows the assessment of aptitude not just in music and drama, or in comparatively closely related subjects, but across a number of subjects that may be unrelated. It might be true that a definition of aptitude is that it is narrow although that is not confirmed by the dictionary. The Minister might be able to persuade us of that definition. However, I do not need to win the argument about that definition because the clause blows a hole through it, by making it clear that aptitude can be measured in a range of subjects. The definition of aptitude is not narrow for that purpose.
<P>
The second argument against the distinction between aptitude and ability, about which the Government are trying to persuade us, is that if aptitude is measured in one narrow subject, and certainly in a range of subjects, the result is a proxy for ability. That is the view of all the observers to whom I have spoken on the subject. [Mr. Dorrell]
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough has far more practical experience of such matters than I have. The view of professional teachers is that measurement in one or two specific subjects produces a reasonable assessment of ability.
<P>
The argument is not a semantic one about aptitude and ability, it is about the inconsistency of the political position in which the Government find themselves. Clause 91 sets up a regime for partial selection it is a generally hostile environment for existing arrangements for partial selection and clause 93 provides a different form of partial selection. In truth, it amounts to pretty much the same thing, but in theory, the Minister is trying to persuade us by his casuistry that it is a different concept. It is an open door to the further development of the concept of partial selection.
<P>
<H5>9.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Given the whole argument as it has developed in the Committee today, it will not surprise hon. Members when I say that the Minister should show his true colours and say clearly that clause 93 represents a clear view of his way forward for the future of education. I only regret the fact that in the internal arguments that came extremely close to the surface in the Minister's remarks, he was clearly worsted on the 10 per cent. quota. I regret that and look forward to being a member of a future Committee when he has won the argument, as we can then increase that proportion.
<P>
In arguing for clause 93, the Minister is looking for a way out of the bind that the Government have created for themselves in clause 91. For that reason, I am rather optimistic about the future of education under clause 93. I congratulate the Minister on arguing for it to be included in the Bill; I only regret that he did not argue a bit more. We shall certainly support clause 93, but we shall want to come back on Report to the issues of aptitude and ability. The Minister will have then had the chance to reflect on some of his arguments. On the basis that it is a subject that will interest a wide range of outside interests and hon. Members on both sides of the House perhaps especially those on the Government Benches I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I shall be brief, as I understand that my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough hopes to catch your eye, Mr. Gale. I have three genuine questions to ask the Minister. First, if a school has to specialise in certain subjects, what criteria will be used to show that the school has those specialisms? Secondly, I am not clear about whether it is the Government's intention that the schools which select by ability will, in addition, be able further to select by aptitude. Thirdly, what does part III mean?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I am having a quick look at the hon. Gentleman's third question, but without an explanation of his problem it is rather difficult to answer. On his question about specialism, we will be laying down in regulations the criteria that will be applied. Schools that already partially select will not be allowed to use the provisions contained in this measure to add to the selection that they already undertake.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Is the Minister saying that a school that currently selects, say, 10 per cent. by ability, will not be able to use clause 93 for additional selection on aptitude? Will he tell the Committee where in the Bill it says that a school that has existing selection by ability cannot add to it selection by aptitude?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> If a school bands on the basis of ability it will be able to use the provisions in clause 93. Under the code of practice, we will ensure that a school that selects 10 per cent. of its pupils on ability will not be able to use clause 93 to add to its selection. It will not be able to select 10 per cent. on aptitude in addition to the 10 per cent. that it may have selected for ability. The code of practice will clarify that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> Which code of practice?
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> The code on admissions, which we shall put before the House and publish in about January next year.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> A school cannot offer 10 different specialisms at 10 per cent. each and become fully selective.
<P>
We have looked forward all day to a clear definition of the difference between ability and aptitude. At 22 minutes past 9 o'clock, we have failed to get it. In fact, the Minister has demonstrated clearly that he cannot tell the difference between them. The definition from the Oxford English dictionary given by the right hon. Member for Charnwood is as clear now as it was at the outset. Nothing has changed.
<P>
The Minister has failed to outline any test of aptitude. We were told that in the revelation from his hon. Friends on the Back Benches we would hear about all the tests of aptitude that were well known and contested throughout the world 
<P>

</P>
<P>
Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.
<P>
<H5>9.35 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
On resuming 
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I shall be brief, as we want to get away before the early hours of the morning. Before the Division in the House, I was saying that the Minister had failed to outline the difference between ability and aptitude. He failed in particular to describe tests for aptitude, which he promised the Committee he would put before us so that we could examine the empirical evidence, which showed that the tests were valid.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I fear that the hon. Gentleman is being unfair to the Minister, who outlined in detail the mechanical toy used in the tests.
<P>
<B>Mr. Willis:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning the mechanical toy, which was a sad attempt at an aptitude test for technology. If the head had told 100 students to run round the school naked, the first 10 would have got into the group and would have done just as well. The Minister said that although aptitude was linked with potential, there was no correlation between the potential of the students who took the superb technical test at the school in Newcastle and the outcome for those students. If that is so, what is the point in having a test? That is the basis of our argument.
<P>
The Minster gave sport as an example. I am not putting any of my office allowance on the England football team going to France this summer and winning the World Cup, partly because it would be illegal to do so, but also because I would not risk a penny of my own money on something so foolhardy.
<P>
I am making a serious point. About 10 or 12 years ago, in an attempt to improve the quality of English football, a decision was taken to take the very best youngsters who had an aptitude for soccer away from home and put them into a hothouse academy near Loughborough so that they would become the most superb footballers that the country had ever seen. Few of them achieved club standard, let alone international level. I rest my case. There is no such thing as an aptitude test for soccer potential nor is there one, as the Minister tried to describe, for technology. No such thing exists.
<P>
Ability in music, dance, drama or any other subject depends more on quality teachers or models, good facilities and good parental support than on aptitude. That is what makes youngsters develop and achieve their true potential. I asked the Minister earlier whether ability was not more to do with social class than anything else. The reality is that that is so. The 10 per cent. who are accepted because of their so-called aptitude for any subject are from higher social classes the upper social class, where it exists. That is the reality, because youngsters from those social classes have computers at home and all the other equipment needed to develop technological, sporting, dance or musical skills. The previous Government took musical instruments away from children in schools, so only the middle and upper classes can afford to pay for many of those activities. For those reasons, we do not support the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I shall ask the Committee to vote for the clause, but my speech will not be a rant like the one that we have just heard. I hope that the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough will read the Official Report to find out exactly what I said. It was the hon. Member for Bath who talked about an automatic link between aptitude and attainment; I have never said that there is an automatic link between the two.
<P>
The Government believe that there can be a legitimate test for aptitude to identify talent and potential which might flourish and blossom if the child is exposed to particular types of education. I believe that that is the case, but clearly, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough disagrees.
<P>
I also believe that social class does not have to be the determining factor. I am confident that if the tests are carried out sympathetically, taking into account some of the issues raised, there will be an opportunity to identify aptitude among all youngsters, whatever their social background. I say that because I know that individual schools that achieve precisely that.
<P>
Clause 93 is significant and provides us with a new way to look at comprehensive education. It begins to provide diversity in those schools that can offer a specialism. We have a mechanism the admissions code of practice by which to ensure that the provision will not be abused by schools that want to use it to introduce selection on the basis of ability.
<P>
I know that I will not convince the hon. Members for Bath and for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the Government's intention on clause 93. I accept that, but not with a heavy heart as I believe clause 93 is absolutely appropriate. It is forward looking, whereas much of what Liberal Democrate Members have said tonight has been backward looking. They have failed to recognise that the comprehensive system can be improved and modernised. Clause 93 will allow us to do precisely that, which is why I urge the Committee to allow it to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Clause 95</center></H4>
<H4><center>Designation of grammar schools</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 384, in page 69, line 24, leave out from "year" to end of line 25 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that school shall be designated a grammar school for the purposes of this chapter".</font></ul>
<P>
This is a fairly simple amendment, and members of the Committee will be relieved to hear that I shall not speak to it for long. I hope to take that as a precedent in moving the many other amendments that I have tabled.
<P>
The amendment would reassure grammar schools on one small point by removing an unnecessary power of [Mr. Brady]
discretion for the Secretary of State. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<ul><font size=-1>"Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that a maintained school had selective admission arrangements at the beginning of the 1997-98 school year, he may by order designate the school as a grammar school for the purposes of this Chapter."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If my amendment were accepted, the Secretary of State would designate the school as a grammar school.
<P>
When the school is a grammar school, the amendment would ensure that it is designated as a grammar school for the purposes of the Bill. Unless the Under-Secretary can demonstrate legitimate circumstances in which the Secretary of State would not wish to designate as a grammar school a school that is a grammar school and which has satisfied him that it is a grammar school, I see no reason why the Government would have difficulty in accepting the amendment.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said about the amendment. If it were accepted, it would remove the power of the Secretary of State to designate by order grammar schools. When designation takes place by order, the grammar schools are named to which a ballot may apply if sufficient people triggered it. It is important that those schools are named, so that people know which ones may be subject to a ballot if sufficient signatures are collected.
<P>
We shall come later to new clause 6, which would give grammar schools the right to change their admission arrangements prior to the ballot in certain circumstances. However, under the Bill they are grammar schools. If they had changed their admission arrangements by the time the order was made, they would not need to be named because they would have changed their arrangements.
<P>
The order gives the Secretary of State power to name the schools that are covered in the Bill. I give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that it would be my right hon. Friend's intention to designate by name all those grammar schools that fulfil the criteria. I hope that he will accept those assurances and not create a situation in which people would be in the dark about which schools, by name, were covered by the Bill.

<P>
Government amendment No. 358.
<P>
Government new clause 6 Proposals by governing body of grammar school to end selective admission arrangements.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The amendments fall into three groups. Amendment No. 352 would widen the range of schools that the Secretary of State could designate as grammar schools and introduces the word "substantially". A school has come to our attention which is, to all intents and purposes, a traditional grammar school; no one who lives in the community would think that it was anything else. It selects by reference to high ability, but each year it has 20 places for children with musical ability. I did not use the word "aptitude". I am sure that you, Mr. Gale, would forbid me from examining further whether I should have referred to children with ability or aptitude in music. That school would be expected to be included in the group, but, because of the tight way in which we have defined grammar schools in the Bill, it would be excluded. We shall not come across many more examples of that, but we want to have the power to designate those schools as grammar schools.
<P>
New clause 6 will allow the governing bodies of grammar schools to publish statutory proposals to remove selective admission arrangements. Although that is unlikely to happen, we did not want to prevent schools from voluntarily removing selection before a ballot was triggered. It would not be in the power of a local authority to propose such changes in the admission arrangements. It would be up to the governing body to do that. If, during the period when the new proposals were published because they would have to be published under a change of character a ballot was triggered by a petition of 20 per cent. of the designated electorate, the ballot would take precedence. That would be right because it would represent an expression on the part of the wider community that they would sooner have a ballot than have admission arrangements changed in another way.
<P>
If it is in order, I will also comment on the amendments to which the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West will no doubt speak in a moment. They would allow any maintained secondary school to have ballots about any change to their admission arrangements. I am in danger of repeating arguments made in earlier debates, and I do not want to do that. We have made it clear in our manifesto, in the White Paper and in Committee that we would designate a ballot to deal with existing grammar schools. It has never been our intention to allow a ballot in other schools; that argument has been well made today. I therefore urge the Committee to accept the Government amendments and to reject the other amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall briefly take the Committee through the amendments tabled in my name. Amendment No. 385 deals with the same issue as that raised by the Government; I am delighted that they have tabled their own amendment, which would have a similar effect.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary said, the remaining amendments are entirely consistent with the principles expounded earlier by Conservative Members, especially when speaking to amendment No. 374 and to new clause 8. They take a slightly different approach from that of new clause 8; they would have the effect of allowing schools which are not designated as grammar schools to participate on equal terms in the balloting arrangements proposed by the Government. They would allow the same choice, the same consultation and the same local decision-making process to operate for those schools. They would remove the one-way ratchet effect, which is an attempt to squeeze out remaining grammar schools, and give the Bill a more open-minded approach to the principles of selection by aptitude or ability whichever it may be.
<P>
As the Under-Secretary said, those matters were widely debated earlier, and I do not want to detain the Committee by reiterating the arguments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do not want to detain the Committee either; I agree with the amendments of hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West for the reasons that we debated earlier. I do not expect that they will be pressed to a Division. For the reasons that I see out earlier, my hon. Friend is to be congratulated for tabling those amendments, because he is right.
<P>
When we reach the question whether clause 95 should stand part of the Bill, I shall seek to catch your eye to speak briefly, Mr. Gale, because it should not. Given that the chances are strong that the clause will stand part of the Bill, I do not have any problem with Government amendment No. 352; I agree with what the Under-Secretary said about it. I also agree with what she said about the Government new clause. In the context of the Government's proposals, I can understand why they want to import the principle that the governing body can initiate a change; that is consistent with everything that we have said. In the unlikely set of circumstances described by the Under-Secretary, the terms of new clause 6 should apply. So without enthusiasm, I agree with what the Under-Secretary said about new clause 6; that should not prejudice what I shall say if I catch your eye, Mr. Gale, on the question whether the clause stand part of the Bill; I would prefer that the whole package was not in the Bill.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
No. 354, in page 69, line 33, leave out "the procedure" and insert "procedures". [Ms Estelle Morris.]
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> As has already been said, the Committee has had several opportunities to pre-empt the core debates on clauses 95, 96 and 97, which set out the Government's package for the future of grammar schools. I shall not repeat every argument that has been presented today.
<P>
I want to speak about clause 95, because I shall encourage my hon. Friends to vote against clauses 95, 96 and 97, which effect the Government's election promise to legislate for a machinery that would allow the abolition of grammar schools. The clauses make clear the Government's hope and belief that that process should be allowed to develop under local initiatives.
<P>
First, I shall deal with the argument that the proposals were included in the Labour party's election manifesto. I accept that the Government have an election mandate for the narrow policy on grammar schools. However, I do not believe that the education community, and certainly the rest of the community, understood the fine points of the Government's selection policy, which we discussed for most of the day. However, I accept that there was an argument about the future of grammar schools during the election campaign.
<P>
The doctrine of the election mandate does not absolve those who are elected on it of the responsibility to argue their case when they try to effect their policy. An election mandate does not require those who were defeated at the election to support a policy that they opposed in the run-up to the election, and continue to oppose on principle.
<P>
I do not believe that the Government's approach to grammar schools is right or that it is reconcilable with the broader sweep of their selection policy. We have explored the reasons for that at considerable length, if not in considerable detail, today. The Government remain prisoners of long-standing political instinct. Grammar schools elicit an almost Pavlovian response from the Labour Benches. We have witnessed that several times today. The moment the word "selection" is mentioned, Labour Members launch into the grammar school debate.
<P>
The reactions that we witnessed today reminded me of the response to the Deputy Prime Minister's announcement of the failure of London and Continental Railways Ltd. The Labour Benches gave a whoop of delight. At last something that they could cheer had happened. The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) said that he had not expected such cause for celebration so early in the new Government's term of office. Today, when we reached the grammar school debate, there was a collective release of pressure from the Labour Benches. At last, Labour Members knew where they were, without new Labour, old Labour confusions.
<P>
They were against grammar schools. It was clear from the faces of Labour Members that they believed that they knew the argument, and that the Front Bench spokesman, whose attitudes to selection are not entirely shared on the Back Benches, would not require them to qualify deeply felt instincts.
<P>
In his response, the Minister suggested that I was seeking to reopen arguments of years ago. I stress that I[Mr. Dorrell]
believe that this issue should not be resolved by a single national decision that is meant to deliver a single national formula. That is why, ever since I took up my brief, I have consistently argued that the matter should be resolved locally. The choice should be made locally, and it should be an open choice. That will allow those communities who wish it to develop a selective system rather than the qualified selective system made possible by clauses 91 to 93.
<P>
<H5>10 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
If a community wants to adopt the grammar school model, it should not be prevented from doing so on principle. The Government are wrong to put in place such a series of provisions. The Under-Secretary and Minister have not disguised the fact that they do not like grammar schools; nor have they disguised the fact that the purpose of the clauses is not to take grammar schools head on but to make it easy for those who wish to see them abolished. The Under-Secretary and the Minister are wrong to take that view, which is why I invite my hon. Friends to vote against clause 95 and, when we come to them, clauses 96 and 97.

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I hope that the Committee will vote for clause 95 to stand part of the Bill, because it is essential to the mechanism that the Government have set in train to allow local people to determine whether grammar schools should continue.
<P>
I listened carefully to what the right hon. Member for Charnwood said about our election mandate. To an extent, I agree that ideas need to be developed. Of course, it is the Opposition's responsibility to put their point of view to the Government and wider public, and we do not wish to deny them that opportunity, but it would be perverse if we were to propose a mechanism to create more grammar schools when our manifesto was clear that we did not want the grammar school system to expand. That would be beyond belief. Such action would lead to mistrust between the Government and the people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The Under-Secretary is arguing against any form of devolved decision making. Anything that the Government do now to devolve decision making would open the possibility of the devolved power being exercised contrary to Labour's election manifesto.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, it would not. Clause 95 is about the designation of grammar schools. We made it quite clear that we did not want to see new grammar schools, but we want to give parents locally the opportunity to decide whether existing grammar schools should continue. The intention was clearly stated in our manifesto.
<P>
Clause 95 and the succeeding clauses contain the mechanism to carry out the pledge that we made to the British people on 1 May. It is important that we do that. It is therefore crucial that the Secretary of State has the power to designate grammar schools as defined in clause 95. It should therefore stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that we have discussed many of the issues considerably this morning, so I should be grateful if hon. Members would stick strictly to the matters relating to the individual amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 389, in page 70, line 16, leave out "at their request" and insert "at the request of at least 20 per cent. of parents of children at the school in question".
<P>
The amendment relates to the outline balloting arrangements that were recently made available to members of the Committee. It would ensure that the parents eligible to trigger a ballot would be those who have children at the school in question. As Ministers are aware, several approaches can be taken in regard to the balloting arrangements; they have been considering the various circumstances that might be involved. Before reading the Government's outline proposals, I was concerned that we may end up with a balloting procedure that paid insufficient heed to the interests of parents who are most [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I know that it is late, but if hon. Members wish to hold private conversations, would they please do so in the Corridor?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<P>
I was referring to parents who are most closely interested in the school's affairs. Reading the outline proposals for balloting arrangements only increased my concern; certainly in my own area, an LEA-wide ballot would be involved, which would mean that parents who live outside Altrincham and who have no interest in its schools would be given a vote on the future of those schools. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston, I can see no logic or sense in parents in Stretford voting in regard to Altrincham schools, which their children do not attend.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will tell me that I am misreading the outline proposals, but it seems clear from those that I was given that LEAs that have selective education across the whole area would have an LEA-wide ballot. Ministers seem to be shifting in their seats as though they are about to correct me; I hope that that is so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> This may show a lack of geographical knowledge of the north-west of England, but parents whose children attend schools in the hon. Gentleman's area but who are resident outside it will still have a vote in the LEA-wide ballot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I thank the Minister for that, but that does not answer my point. The borough of Trafford the borough that I know best is an LEA area, but there is no serious interchange of pupils between Stretford and Altrincham. It therefore seems unreasonable and nonsensical for the future of the grammar schools in Altrincham to be decided as much by parents in Stretford, who have no interest in them, as by parents in Altrincham.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It is the same LEA.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Yes, it is the same LEA, but the catchment areas of the schools are totally different. It therefore seems illogical to give parents who do not engage with particular schools who do not live in the catchment area and whose children do not and never will attend those schools a say in their future. I am therefore very concerned about the outline proposals.
<P>
When pressed last week for the release of the proposals, the Minister said that they could not be given sooner to members of the Committee because the Government were engaged in detailed consultation with hon. Members of all parties about local circumstances. I am therefore concerned that the points that I raised in the first sitting of our Committee have not been addressed in the outline proposals. The issue of whether it is appropriate to have an LEA-wide ballot rather than one that relates directly to the schools in question, as my amendment would provide, has not been addressed nor has my question about what would happen in an LEA area where some grammar schools are grant maintained and therefore cannot be balloted at the same time as other grammar schools in the area.
<P>
The borough of Trafford has grammar schools that are grant maintained and others that are not, not least because Stretford grammar school, which voted for GM status, was not allowed to adopt that status when the new Government came into office. Given that, the outlines again make no provision for the circumstances in which ballots could be conducted in the non-GM grammar schools sooner than in the GM grammar schools. There could be two LEA-wide ballots which would intensify the difficulty which I have outlined of parents with no contact or interest in particular schools being able to vote.
<P>
The final point about the outlines, which is particularly important to the two Roman Catholic grammar schools in my constituency, is that there does not appear to be any provision in the balloting arrangements for a different constituency to be recognised in terms of those who use such denominational grammar schools. That is another serious flaw which would be corrected by my amendment in tying the decision to parents of children at the school. Roman Catholic grammar schools in my constituency could find not only that parents from other parts of the borough were voting on their future but that their future was being decided by people who were not Roman Catholics and would not be likely to avail themselves of Roman Catholic grammar school places. Again that seems to be a serious omission.
<P>
I hope that the outline of the Government's thinking is merely an interim statement and that something more concrete and appropriate will come forward. My amendment would give some guarantees to schools and to parents who are concerned that decisions about their school might be made by parents who have no interest in it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> My hon. Friend's amendments focus on the nature of the ballots that are envisaged by the Government's procedures. The Government said that there would be provisions of this nature in their election manifesto: we are now getting to the nitty gritty and what it means to people running schools in my hon. Friend's constituency and grammar schools all around the country.
<P>
I was with the head of a grammar school in Dorset last week who asked me how he was supposed to plan the future of his school when he is subject to a ballot, to be conducted among an as yet unknown electorate about his future admissions policy. His is also a grant-maintained school and so has all the uncertainties associated with the change of status from grant-maintained to a foundation school. Two major upheaval processes, one certain, the other potential, are hanging over him as he tries to plan the future of his school.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment seeks at least to narrow one of the elements of uncertainty that faces all heads and governors and professional staff working in grammar schools today. He has proposed that the definition of the relevant group of parents for the purposes of these ballots should be defined as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the parents of the children at the school".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I agree with him.
<P>
My hon. Friend's argument made very clear the very unsatisfactory nature of the whole area LEA ballot that is proposed under paragraph 14 of the draft guidance that the Minister finally got around to circulating to the Committee. He envisaged ballots taking place where the whole LEA is currently selective and the only kind of ballot envisaged is a ballot for the whole LEA area. Yet as my hon. Friend rightly points out, within a large LEA there can be a number of different communities. That applies to LEAs that currently have selective grammar schools in some parts of their area and non-selective schools in others. Dorset had all possible systems of selection co-existing with each other. The idea that the matter has to be decided as a single LEA question is wrong in principle, wrong in practice as my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West explained and unnecessary in view of the current provision of schools around the country.
<P>
The Government's proposals for the conduct of ballots cause even more trouble when we move on from whole LEAs to areas in which some schools are selective and some are not. The school in Dorset is a precise example. Its head teacher is not in as strong a position as those in my hon. Friend's constituency. At least they know what the electorate is however undesirable or irrational, for the reasons identified by my hon. Friend. I hope that we can persuade the Government to change their view, but at least we know how those schools will be affected by the Government's proposals. That cannot be said for selective schools in an LEA that has a mixed system of admissions.
<P>
Let us examine paragraph 17 of the Minister's guidance. It states that parents taking part in a ballot
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"would be those whose children attend `feeder schools'".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It also says that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the Department is considering options for identifying those schools where there is an established pattern for pupils to move on to the grammar school."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the sort of first principle proposition that the Minister no doubt gave to his officials when he took office. Clearly his officials have not got very far in converting that principle into a workable system.
<P>
All the important questions remain unanswered. What is an established pattern? How many children does a primary school have to send to a grammar school to qualify as an established feeder school? What is the nature of the relationship, and for how many years must the pattern have been established? Do all parents of the established feeder school have a vote, even those who may live on the other side of the feeder school where there is no history of parents sending their children to the grammar school? If an electorate is to be defined in order to allow the system to operate, those questions must be answered.
<P>
Ministers have confidently asserted that they will produce a balloting system based on feeder schools, but they have not said how that vague aspiration will be turned into something concrete, definite and certain. If an electorate is to decide on issues affecting schools that offer a key service to a local community, an essential prerequisite is certainty.
<P>
A feeder primary may be a contested school. There may be a grey area because it has not been established whether the school has a right to vote under clause 17, or whether the electorate at a primary school constitutes the majority one way or the other. Balloting without any certainty about who is entitled to vote is to transgress the most basic precondition for securing an acceptable result.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> A further example of confusion is the bizarre situation whereby parents of children at a feeder school outside the particular LEA area will be able to vote in a ballot even though they live outside it. Yet those very same parents will not be able to vote in a ballot regarding the whole LEA. Why should this be?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> They will.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The Minister says, "They will". I am not sure that that is specified in writing. The hon. Member for Bath has raised an important point. Will the Minister tell us whether the relevant parents would have a vote in the context of a whole LEA ballot and a feeder school with an established pattern whatever that turns out to mean of sending children to grammar school within the LEA? The more important point that I want to establish is when we will be told how we determine who will be given the vote. The document before us does not tell us that. Until we are given certainty about who gets the vote, we will not have the most basic building block needed to establish ballots whose result will be accepted.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Despite the fact that the amendment is fairly narrow, discussion has ranged quite widely. Any points that I do not deal with will be picked up by my hon. Friend in debate on the next group of amendments. I hope that hon. Members will be patient about that.
<P>
Our intention in deciding on ballot arrangements was always to involve as many as possible of the parents who would be affected by the decision. That is why the net has been thrown wide, for both whole-LEA ballots and ballots of schools or groups of schools. Perhaps one of the disagreements between the two sides of the Committee stems from a lack of understanding among Conservative Members that the admissions policies of one school can affect other schools in the area.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, I wish to make headway, and then I will give way. The interconnection of admissions arrangements is crucial.
<P>
The area represented by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West is, I understand, a wholly selective local authority area. Selection pervades the admission arrangements of every school there, and that affects every child of 11 and every parent seeking admission to secondary school for such a child. It must be right for a decision about the future of the admissions arrangements to be taken in the whole LEA. Each school's admission arrangements to some extent depend on and determine those of the others. Something that would create even greater uncertainty for the grammar school head teacher cited by the hon. Gentleman would be the prospect of ballots being held by each school in the LEA I do not know how many that would involve over a period of time. Each could produce a different result. It would be necessary to pick up the pieces after that process of 30 or 40 ballots, held at different times, and try to arrive at coherent admissions arrangements. We take the view that where there is no disagreement and the entire LEA area selects in the admissions process, it would be right, and in the interests of such a head teacher as the hon. Gentleman described, to hold one ballot. The matter could be sorted out then and, whatever the result, the authority and the schools would be able to move on, either to maintain existing arrangements in the event of a vote against changing admissions procedures, or to begin to establish a system of non-selective secondary education.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I follow the Minister's logic that in a selective admissions system the admissions arrangements of one school affect those of another. My difficulty arises over the suggestion that the selective admissions system in one area of an LEA affects that of an entirely different area. I assure the hon. Lady that in my area there would be no significant effect on the schools admissions system in the north of the borough of Trafford if there were changes in the admissions system in the south, and vice versa. There is virtually no interchange or crossover in those areas; they are distinct communities. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston, who is a neighbour of mine, is laughing, but it is true that there is no interchange between the north and south of the borough of Trafford. Similarly, if there were changes in the admissions arrangements in Stretford or Urmston grammar schools, that would have no direct effect on the provision of school places in Altrincham, for example.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> The fact remains that whether the hon. Gentleman likes it or not and it seems not we are talking about part of the same local education authority area, and the LEA makes decisions on behalf of the schools within that area. What he is describing is almost apartheid in Trafford between the constituency represented by him and the one represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston.
<P>
It is sad that parents do not take the opportunity to express parental preference and choice. One of the great advantages of being within a local authority area is that there are several schools within that area to choose from. That happens in my constituency, which is a far larger local authority area than the one that the hon. Gentleman represents. Regardless of whether he feels that his local authority is, in effect, divided into two sections, it is still one local authority.
<P>
All schools select by ability at 11 and the decision of one will affect the others. We have dealt sensitively with that issue. A ballot takes place, giving parents the right to say whether grammar schools and selective education should continue in a way that will minimally disrupt the education of the children currently in the system.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Charnwood referred to the areas where it is not clear that the vast majority of children are admitted by selection at age 11. That is more difficult to define, but the same principles governed what we did. Birmingham, for example, has eight grammar schools out of many hundreds of schools. We did not want to draw the electorate so widely that parents were given a vote when it was difficult to justify their having an interest in the future of the few grammar schools, especially if there was no pattern of children from that area attending a grammar school or of parents putting their children in for the selection examination. In those areas, children tend to opt for the 11-plus, whereas in Trafford, it becomes a blanket requirement to have the 11-plus.
<P>
We tried to include parents who had a legitimate interest in the future admissions arrangements of a school. We wanted the electorate to include schools that were thought to be feeder schools. The right hon. Gentleman is right that we have to define feeder schools, and we shall do that. We shall consider, too, comments that have been made about what might constitute a feeder school. Parents who, through time and by practice, have shown that they have an expectation that their child can go to a grammar school in an area that is not selective, will be able to vote to determine the future of that school. I accept that we have not defined that yet, but it is possible to define it and we shall do so. The head teacher to whom the right hon. Gentleman referred will know who his electorate is.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful to the Under-Secretary but, with respect, that is not good enough. She set out again the principle that she and her hon. Friends asked their officials to turn into a policy. Anyone who has been a Minister for any length of time will be familiar with the phenomenon of having an idea that seems good on the surface but when considered in detail and how it will work in practice, must be amended because it is unworkable. The Government have had that idea since the day they took office and have asked officials how to put it into practice. After nine months' work, surely the Minister can offer the Committee something more than she might have said on 3 May 1997. so far she has said nothing that she could not have said nine months ago. What does she mean by a school with an established pattern as a feeder school to a grammar school? What kind of relationship is she talking about?
<P>
<H5>10.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is being uncharacteristically ungenerous in saying that we have not given the Committee enough detail. My hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards made available for Committee members a note that goes into great detail about the ballot arrangements. We are answering questions that right hon. and hon. Members have asked in debates on previous clauses. We are providing information, not only about the principles but about the detail. We have given definitions of two sorts of ballots. We have given details about the trigger mechanism for petitions and about the conduct of the ballot.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, I want to finish these points and then I will give way to the hon. Member for Bath.
<P>
We have given details about expenses. A vast amount of detail has been provided. The right hon. Member for Charnwood has picked out one matter, from a lengthy document, to which we have said that we will give further consideration.
<P>
Let me draw some boundaries. It is not important that the right hon. Member for Charnwood knows how a feeder school is defined, but it is important that the people who have to act on the provisions of the Bill know what a feeder school is. I can assure him that the definition will be made clear to those people.
<P>
There will be parameters. A school that has no tradition of sending children to a grammar school would clearly not be designated a feeder school. A school that sends half its children to a grammar school year after year will be designated as a feeder school. Between those two extreme examples, we have to make a decision about what a feeder school would be. We are not hiding, or running away from that decision. We shall make it. However, we are still listening to advice about the definition of such a school.
[Ms Morris]
<P>
We could have decided although we did not that anyone within the LEA would have had a vote, even if only a few of its schools were selective. That decision has been made and hon. Members should acknowledge it. I repeat that we want to ensure that in defining the electorate for schools where there is no whole-area ballot, it is those parents who have a legitimate interest in the outcome of the ballot who will be included in the register. I will not repeat that again because you might be cross, Mr. Gale.

<P>

<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I suggest to the Minister that there may not necessarily be agreement between a parent who has a legitimate interest as she describes it and a parent whose child attends a school that is an established pattern feeder school. Under open enrolment which will continue under the Bill and as a result of the Greenwich judgment, a number of parents would have a legitimate interest in wanting their child to attend a particular selective school, but the child might not attend a current feeder school.
<P>
Will the Minister reply to the question that I asked through the right hon. Member for Charnwood and explain the distinction between the feeder school arrangements for a whole-LEA ballot and for individual school LEA ballots? If she reads the document produced by her hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards, she will see that there are two categories for whole-LEA ballots. In the first category, the school is in the LEA, but the parent lives outside. In the second, the school is outside the LEA, but the parent lives inside. In the case of the single school ballot, the school might be outside the LEA and the parent might live outside the LEA. Why should such parents be denied the opportunity to vote in the whole-LEA ballot?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> We have to draw a boundary for the electorate at some point. We have provided for two different types of ballot and, by definition, the whole-LEA area ballot should give people the vote. That makes sense. We accepted that there would be parents who did not live in an LEA's area but had a child who attended a school there. We saw those people as having a vested interest in the future of that school and wanted to give them the vote. Essentially, the whole-area ballot is the expression of people living in an LEA about its future admissions arrangements. That is what led to us to make the decision.
<P>
The locations of some schools that are not part of whole-LEA area ballots but are among a small number of selective schools are often on the boundaries of local authorities, and take in from across LEA boundaries. Birmingham grammar schools take in from outside the Birmingham boundary. Given that our premise there was to designate feeder schools, it did not make sense not to designate a feeder school that happened to lie outside the LEA's boundaries. The hon. Member for Bath was right to say that every parent from a school outside a local authority that might be a feeder school will not have a say in a whole-LEA area ballot. I tend to think, but cannot prove, that cross-border traffic is more likely to happen in an LEA area that has a few selective schools than in a wholly selective LEA area.
<P>
The amendment seeks to make a change that would enable a ballot to be triggered by only 20 per cent. of parents at a given school. I hoped that I had made it clear that the Government think that the issue is more serious than that because it will affect not only a given school and the parents of children there at the time but because there will be a wider impact. Therefore I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I am deeply saddened to hear the Minister's comments, as I was to read the outline that the Minister for School Standards distributed to members of the Committee. I do not believe that she has answered adequately the questions about grammar schools not in wholly selective areas that my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood asked. Nor has she tackled in any way my questions, notably those about the positon of grant maintained grammar schools or religious grammar schools, and whether denominational grammar schools should be treated as a separate electorate.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> That is an important point, and I do not wish to mislead anyone. The ballot would not be about a school's religious ethos but about its method of selecting, or otherwise, children at age 11. I should not want anyone to think that ballots were about changing the religious character of schools.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Absolutely not, but if the purpose of the Minister's Bill, and the outline ballot arrangements, is to give power to parents who have to use her words a legitimate interest in the future of their school, it is essential that she understands that, in the case of Roman Catholic schools in my constituency, that interest is confined to Roman Catholic parents. The logic of her argument is that they should be a separate electorate for denominational schools. That point needs to be dealt with, but probably has not been in either the outline or her comments.
<P>
The wider question of how balloting arrangements should work in an area that is wholly selective in its admissions policies is more profound. The same difficulty was mentioned on earlier clauses in relation to class sizes. There lies the discrepancy between, on the one hand, what the Labour party said last year, and what parents might, on the other hand, legitimately be expected to understand from it. With class sizes, we argued that they would expect that their local school would have classes of fewer than 30 pupils. Here we have had exactly the same difficulty. When parents in my constituency were reassured by the Labour party last year during the election campaign that local parents would decide the future of those schools, they did not imagine that parents in Stretford or Urmston would vote on the future of their schools in Altrincham or Sale. That is a betrayal of trust, which will not be acceptable to my constituents and others, many of whom were conned into voting for the Labour party on the assurance that the local parents would take the decision. Under the proposal on balloting arrangements, local parents will not take that decision, nor does that proposal confine decisions on the future grammar schools to parents who have a legitimate interest. The amendment, together with amendment No. 392, would begin that process, and I urge hon. Members to support it.

Amendment No. 393, in page 71, leave out lines 17 and 18.
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 356 and 357.
<P>
Before I call the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, I should say that hon. Members will have noticed that I have allowed a fair degree of leeway in the debate on amendment No. 389. Because clause 96 is of great interest, it seemed appropriate to allow a wide-ranging debate. The Committee has had that wide-ranging debate, so I would be grateful if hon. Members would speak to the amendment in question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I shall confine myself tightly to the amendment. Amendment No. 392 goes hand in hand with amendment No. 389, which would have limited the group needed to trigger the ballot to 20 per cent. of the parents with children at the school. Amendment No. 392 would restrict the electorate in such a ballot to parents with children currently at the school and parents whose children have been offered a place at the school. The principle is clear those parents who have a legitimate and direct interest in the future of the school will be included.
<P>
Amendment No. 393 is a probing amendment. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on exactly what is meant by the phrase:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any prescribed class of persons under the age of 19".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We seem to be guessing incorrectly where the major debate will be, and we apologise for that.
<P>
I shall ask the Committee to resist amendments Nos. 392 and 393, but to accept three Government amendments, which deal with whole local authority area ballots. The Government believe that those parents with children not of statutory school age should be allowed to participate in the ballot held within an LEA, but that was not the original proposal in the Bill. The Government amendments will allow such parents to register with the ballot administration company; they will then be on the list of those who will have the opportunity to take part in the ballot if one is called.
<P>
It is worth explaining that those people will not be part of the group that will constitute the 20 per cent. for petition purposes, because we will not know who has registered until the petition is arranged and we know that a ballot is required. I know that that is rather complicated, but in practice it is the only way round the problem.
<P>
We think it appropriate in whole-area ballots, which are about the method of organisation of schools within the local authority, to allow those people to express a view. These three amendments will allow them to do precisely that. There has been debate about whole local education authority ballots; we believe them to be appropriate.
<P>
<H5>10.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I have spent a lot of time during the past few months talking to hon. Members of all parties about the appropriate balance of the detailed balloting methods. The hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West, who appears to be opposed to whole education authority ballots, should talk to Conservative Members of Parliament representing Buckinghamshire. There are five or six of them, so they probably form the biggest county grouping in the Conservative party at present. When I met them, they were strongly of the view that we should have a whole local education authority ballot, because Buckinghamshire was selective.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman should talk to his colleagues, because many proposals contained in the notes have been urged on me by his right hon. and hon. Friends; he should reflect on that fact. Some of the ideas proposed from the Conservative Benches tonight fly in the face of representations made by other Conservative Members.

<B>Mr. Brady:</B> My understanding was that the outcome of the consultation that the Minister tells us that he has been undertaking during the past weeks and months would take account of a variety of circumstances. I am entirely happy for there to be local LEA-wide ballots in areas in which that is appropriate; I am saying that in my area it manifestly is not appropriate. I had hoped for some flexibility in the Government's approach in the outline proposals, which would recognise local circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I must explain to the hon. Gentleman that consultation does not mean getting one's own way; it means listening to the arguments and taking them on balance. He will be aware that there are conflicting views in Trafford. We need a balanced system that is seen to be fair, transparent and open; that is the only way in which people will accept the outcome. When people in Trafford see what is proposed, they will acknowledge that that is the best way forward.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raises concerns about denominational schools. The Church authorities have not expressed any view against the Government's proposals.
[Mr. Byers]
<P>
On the question of which schools will be feeder schools, that will be announced and head teachers will know. We are at present consulting grammar schools about which schools would be appropriate as feeder schools. Some grammar schools would be appropriate as feeder schools. Some grammar schools list individual schools in their admissions policy; as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said, some of them have a tradition of taking pupils from particular schools. We are consulting the grammar schools to get it right. I make no apology for that; I would rather do that than give the Committee chapter and verse tonight about the formula that we will impose concerning feeder schools. Doing it that way provides a far better chance that at the end of the exercise, grammar schools will recognise that they have had a genuine input and will be prepared to accept the detailed procedures when we finally propose them.
<P>
The two amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West are an attempt to disrupt the well-organised and thoughtful details that are before the Committee. I therefore ask the Committee to resist them. At the appropriate time, I will formally move Government amendments Nos. 355, 356 and 357.

<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 379, in page 71, line 36, leave out from "within" to end and insert "ten years".
<P>
I hope that we can discuss the amendment briefly. It relates to subsection (8), which states that the Minister can specify in regulations the period in which a vote in favour of selection in one of the ballots determines the issue. When I tabled the amendment, I had not received the note from the Department and I did not know the Government's intentions, although I had heard suggestions of a five-year period of safety for a selective system after the result of a ballot supporting the status quo.
<P>
The amendment poses two questions: first, and more important, is why the Government believe that they need flexibility to change the period by regulation. If they believe that five years is sufficient that is not my view, for reasons that I shall explain in a moment why is that not in the Bill? Why do the Government believe that the Secretary of State should have the power to change the period if the Government have already made up their mind about the proper length of time?
<P>
Secondly, the more fundamental question is whether five years is the right period. I think that it is too short, because in many cases let us leave aside the matter of ballots of the whole authority the electorate will be composed largely of the parents of children at feeder schools. If the parents of a seven, eight or nine-year-old vote in a ballot for the selective system at a school where their child will be educated from age 11 to 18, it will be 10 years from the point when the parents participate in the ballot to the time when their child leaves school. If we allow that result to be determined only for a period of five years, on the feeder-school principle, parents who voted for a selective system when their child is admitted to primary school at four or five determine the issue for five years under the provisions of the previous amendment they may have voted at any time from the moment of birth until the child is eight. They may find, in spite of having voted for a selective school, that the selective system for which they voted when the child was four or five is not available when the child reaches the age of 11.
<P>
Although five years is the instinctive period for the determination of the result of a ballot Members of the House feel comfortable with that periiod when we ask the question posed, although not answered, by subsection (8), we must consider as a separate issue for how long the ballot should determine the result of the question. I think that five years is too short, given the life at school of an individual child, the impact that can have on family life and the uncertainty which, as we know from our experience, a five-year term creates towards the end of the term.
<P>
This is a relatively short period of certainty. It is a good thing for Governments of whatever political complexion that their period of security in office should be relatively short: it is not a good thing for head teachers of schools. I invite the Minister to address the issue of how long that period of security should be and, secondly, why she is not prepared to have whatever period is determined I hope it is 10 years written into the Bill.
<P>
<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> I shall try to be brief. We will have to agree to differ at the end of the debate. I can do no more than assure the hon. Gentleman that it was not for any sinister motive or a wish to change it to one year immediately the law has been passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> When it has been passed.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Yes, when it has been passed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> We are confident.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> Yes, and we can count. The advantage of putting it in regulations might be that if, on reflection in years to come, another period might seem more appropriate, the change could be made in regulations rather than primary legislation which would be much easier. As I am not going to accept his amendment the hon. Gentleman might therefore prefer to leave it in regulations.
<P>
I hear what the hon. Gentleman says about five years and 10 years. An argument can be made about that. Our judgment was that five years meant that a cohort of children had gone from one stage of their schooling to another and that it was reasonable to look at the issue again. Without wishing to cause another argument at this point, he required a school to consider GM status every single year, whether or not it had shown any interest in that the previous year. We are not doing that, but we are saying that five years is a reasonable period of grace as he described it. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that there are no sinister motives in leaving it out of primary legislation at present and that our judgment is that five years is the appropriate period.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I welcome the Minister's assurance that there are no sinister motives behind this. In view of the lateness of the hour, I will regard the case as having been made. I look forward to the opportunity when a Conservative Government can use the power that she vests in the Secretary of State to give greater security to grammar schools. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
No. 395, in page 72, line 3, leave out "and".
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Amendment No. 383 reflected our concerns prior to receiving the Minister of State's document about LEAs supervising the process of the ballot or counting the votes. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale, West also wishes to speak to these amendments, two of which are tabled in his name. I take it from page 4 of the document that I received at 10.50 this morning from the Minister of State that my concerns outlined in the amendment are unjustified.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Paragraph 19 makes it clear that that is the case. I apologise for the fact that the hon. Lady did not get her copy until 10.50. It was mailed on Friday to hon. Members. Because the House was not sitting the procedures of the House did not allow it to be walked round and put on the Letterboard. That is probably an issue that should be taken up with the House authorities. I ensured that her right hon. Friend and the hon. Member for Bath were telephoned on Monday morning to make sure that they had copies. Hon. Members rang my private office when they had not received copies by late yesterday afternoon. I apologise again to the hon. Lady.

</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> The purpose of amendment No. 395 is to tidy up after amendment No. 394, which would make the balance of power in the Bill and the attendant regulations fairer.
<P>
Governing bodies will be able to initiate the end of selective admission arrangements in grammar schools. The amendment would empower them to campaign to retain the character of a grammar school. It would bind the conduct and outcome of ballots to those who are most closely involved and interested in the future of the school. A governing body represents parents and staff and, therefore, has a close interest in the running of a school. It has views on the way in which the school can best serve the interests of children and the community. It should be able to play an active role in persuading parents about the best way in which to maintain its functions. We are considering people who know the ethos and character of a school, the enthusiasm it generates in children and the way in which the quality of education is maintained and raised. Sadly the electorate who will vote in the ballots for which the Bill provides may include people who have no knowledge of the school and no interest in it.
<P>
It is vital that the governing body, which is closely bound up with the affairs and future of the school, should be able to promote the case for the school's future to the wider electorate.
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> I reassure the hon. Member for Altrincham and Sale, West that no one will be prevented from campaigning. People should be able to present their views to parents and members of the electorate. The Bill prevents them from using public money to do that. Local authorities cannot use public money to campaign. Therefore, it is right for that restriction to apply to schools and governing bodies.
<P>
Any member of a governing body, or head teacher, can produce a leaflet, campaign or set up a body called "Friends of Selection in Altrincham Grammar School". However, they cannot use public money to fund their campaigning activities.
<P>
We are guardians of the public purse, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that we have created a level playing field. The Conservative party made allegations about GM ballots. We have taken action to ensure that no one will be able to misuse public funds for campaigning.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> Will the Minister clarify whether a governing body could campaign corporately, provided that it did not use public money?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> No, but nothing prevents several individuals who act together from campaigning. The governing body as a legal entity would not be able to campaign.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> The Minister claimed that the Government had created a level playing field. Evidence shows that trade unions played an active role in campaigning in GM ballots.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jamieson:</B> Trade unions?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> Yet again, the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) comments on a subject from a sedentary position. He was at the heart of trade union campaigns against GM schools, but we have been round that track several times.
<P>
Does the Minister acknowledge the difference between the resources of a trade union that campaigns politically against a proposal, and those of individual parents or governors? How does that difference square with the Minister's claims for a level playing field?
<P>
<B>Ms Morris:</B> We want to ensure that public money is not misused. We cannot control people's use of their own income. We cannot control what trade unions or any other organisations, or friends of selective education do with the funds that they raise. It would be nonsense for us to legislate in that way. Our responsibility is to ensure that public money is not misused in the conduct of a ballot.
<P>
Individuals may raise money and campaign on whatever side of the argument they choose. We live in a democracy where parents and electors will listen to the arguments for both sides. We should encourage people to campaign and to put forward information.
<P>
Allegations over GM ballots were often made by both sides. It is not important whether they were right or wrong, but they were one of the most damaging aspects of the GM movement. We will provide a code of conduct that sets out good practice for all parties during ballots. People will be expected to adhere to that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Browning:</B> I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 382, in page 72, line 7, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(10A) The Secretary of State may make (or arrange for the making of) payments in respect of any expenses incurred by the governing body of a school in complying with any obligations which may be imposed upon it by regulations made under subsection (3)(e)(i) or (ii).
<P>
Payments under this subsection may be made on such terms as the Secretary of State may determine.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If a ballot is to be held, certain costs will fall on grammar schools; for example, the preparation of electoral rolls and parental lists. The Government believe that it would be inappropriate for the schools to carry those costs. The amendment allows the Government to pay schools the costs which will be modest of preparing ballots.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 380, in page 72, line 9, at end insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(12) No regulations issued under this section shall come into effect until they have been endorsed by a resolution passed by both Houses of Parliament.".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Committee has been sitting for a long time today. The Government now have an opportunity to accept an amendment that will cause them no difficulty of principle on policy grounds. The amendment simply safeguards the position of the House of Commons.
<P>
The argument for positive resolution is an old one, and I have heard it more often than I have made it indeed, I have occasionally agreed to it. The amendment would provide parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations for the governance of grammar school ballots, by making those regulations subject to positive resolution in both Houses of Parliament. It is hard to think of a better example of an area in which the regulation-making power of the Secretary of State should be subject to such scrutiny.
<P>
The Government seek an important power: that of determining, by regulation, the terms under which ballots should be held. I have not tried to develop the argument that that is wrong in principle. I accept that the Bill cannot include all the details about the terms of the ballot. We have discussed one or two key elements.
<P>
<B>Dr. George Turner:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give the Committee some examples, from his wide knowledge and experience of presenting Bills, of precedents that he has set in such matters?
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I cannot immediately recall any, but as the Minister implies there have been numerous occasions on which I have rejected suggestions that there should be positive resolution. However, the case for it is always made by business managers, who are worried about the cluttering-up of parliamentary time.
<P>
<B>Dr. Turner:</B> Give one example.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> There are numerous examples in legislation of the requirement for positive resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> During my six brief years in the House, I have served on I think eight education Bills. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that on each occasion, there was at least one proposal from the Labour party, when it was in opposition, relating to the inclusion of positive resolution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I am grateful for that reassurance, which I am sure is true. The argument that governs Ministers comes up time and again: parliamentary time is terribly precious, and business managers do not want it taken up on the Floor of the House. They argue that matters should be dealt with on negative resolution, and that the Government can determine whether the resolution is debated.
<P>
The issue is whether there should be certainty if that is right and Government business managers ultimately determine whether a prayer is debated on the Floor of the House. The question is whether Parliament should have the assurance, the certainty, that the provisions for the conduct of a ballot to determine the future of grammar schools should be subject to a hearing in Parliament before they come into force.
<P>
If the amendment is rejected, the only parliamentary scrutiny provided under our system is negative prayer, which may or may not be debated. All that I seek is the Government's agreement that before the provisions come into force, one and a half hours should be provided in the House of Commons to allow the questions that the Government have said they cannot yet answer to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>
A Government who, as the hon. Member for Bath reminded us, not only made those arguments in opposition, but are in danger of being seen to take Parliament for granted, now have an opportunity to demonstrate the use of the positive resolution procedure, allowing an hour and a half of parliamentary debate before the regulations come into force. It is hard to imagine a better example of conditions under which that procedure should be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I support the amendment for three reasons. First, it is important that Parliament scrutinise such matters. My second and third reasons are more important and specific. Secondly, the matter is of vital significance to many hon. Members who cannot sit on the Committee. It has been sufficiently difficult for members of the Committee to gain an insight into the Government's thinking, vague and rather muddled as it remains. Hon. Members who do not sit on the Committee have had no opportunity to explore the Government's thinking.
<P>
Thirdly, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood pointed out, the outline of the Government's thinking that we have been given leaves so many questions open that it is hardly a basis on which to proceed for discussion. When a document is as vague as this, with so many critical questions still open, it is entirely appropriate that the Government, who have admitted that they still have considerable further work to do on the arrangements, should be prepared to present that document to the House when they have completed their deliberations, whether it be after another nine months or longer.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Byers:</B> As the hon. Member for Bath correctly pointed out, we are now embarked on a well-worn route. In the eight education Bills that he has had the pleasure of considering, this proposal was made on many occasions by the Opposition and was rejected by the Government, as indeed it will be rejected by the Government this evening. However, it is worth explaining why; the reasons are clear. The occasions when education legislation issues are agreed on affirmative resolution are few and far between. I asked officials to perform a trawl through all education legislation to discover on what occasions that occurred. There have been only three.
<P>
I believe that the right hon. Member for Charnwood served in the Whips Office at some stage, as I did, and therefore knows that such matters are arranged through the usual channels. The negative resolution procedure, under which the House scrutinises the regulations, as we recommend in the Bill, may be prayed against by the Opposition, and if they feel sufficiently strongly about it, an agreement is made through the usual channels that it will be dealt with on the Floor of the House. A deal is done. It is in the gift of the Opposition: if they want to debate the matter on the Floor of the House, they pray against the resolution and treat it as a priority issue, and a debate is arranged. That is the House's procedure. If this is a matter of priority for the Opposition, they can do precisely that.
<P>
<H5>11.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that those Committee members who have grammar schools and selective systems in their constituencies feel strongly, but there are 165 grammar schools in just 31 local education authorities. The bulk of our education system in this country is not based on selection. We spent most of today debating a matter that affects less than one third of all LEAs, and it would be inappropriate for the House to discuss a matter that affects only a minority of LEAs. However, if the Opposition want to use their allotted time in that way, they are perfectly entitled to do so, and the usual channels will ensure that they get that opportunity.
<P>
For those reasons it is appropriate to maintain the Bill's procedure and to resist the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I regret the fact that the Government have taken that line. I have not previously moved an amendment to make such a provision because there are other safeguards elsewhere in the Bill. I do not believe that the clause's safeguards are sufficient. However, in view of the lateness of the hour and in order to make progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we have our stand part debate, I must inform the Committee that Opposition Members have said that they will vote against the clause. I shall therefore allow a stand part debate, but the matter has been discussed in detail and I shall deprecate excessive repetition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Don Foster:</B> I shall be brief. I want to place on the record my party's strong opposition to the clause's procedures for the local determination of the future of grammar schools. I made it clear on Second Reading and on other occasions that local determination of grammar schools' future is appropriate, but that the Government's bureaucratic and cumbersome procedure for doing so is inappropriate. A decision should be taken by the duly elected representatives of local people in LEAs after wide consultation. I tried to make that point when I spoke to amendments Nos. 34 and 35, and nothing that I have heard today has convinced me to change my view that the Government's procedure is bureaucratic and complicated. We shall vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I want to make it clear that I shall invite my hon. Friends to vote against the clause for the reason that I gave during our debate on clause 95 that the Government have not made the case for the bias against grammar schools that they will introduce into the system. Their package will be extremely undesirable in [Mr. Dorrell]
local circumstances. The clause's provisions do not come anywhere near answering the key questions.
<P>
The Under-Secretary sought to represent the question of who would vote in the ballots as being one detail among the many details in the Minister's paper. I acknowledge that it contains details but I do not acknowlege that the central questions have been answered. The system will contain a bias against grammar schools, which is undesirable. I therefore invite my hon. Friends to vote against the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Obviously, I urge Committee members to support the clause. It deals with the procedures for the ballot and it states who is entitled to take part in it. The Government have bent over backwards to ensure that the system that establishes who will take part in the ballots is fair. We have listened to people and we have consulted, although that does not mean that we agree with every representation that we have received. We want to introduce a procedure that will have broad support and in which people will have confidence. I accept the right hon. Gentleman's point that not all the details have been worked out: in some areas we have only an outline of how we want to move forward. It is misleading and mischievous, however, to say that on 3 May we gave an outline to officials on feeder primaries and that no progress has been made. There are three categories clarifying what we mean by feeder schools, some of which I have thought the right hon. Gentleman would welcome.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> I do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> Some difficult political decisions arise from the second of those categories; we have made those decisions, but we have not worked out the formula for determining schools that offer a traditional route into grammar schools. We are consulting and talking to the schools that will be affected, and we intend to get the formula right. The House shall have an opportunity if Opposition Members pray against these regulations to debate the regulations in detail at a later date. Consultation will take place to ensure that people regard the regulations and procedures as fair and to ensure that they strike the right balance between those who are strongly in favour of retaining the grammar school system and those who are passionately against it. We have to hold the ring and be impartial, and we have sought to do that in the details that are before the Committee. I ask the Committee to support the clause, as amended.

<P>
The amendment the last one in a rather long day provides the Minister with the opportunity to give expression to the principle he espoused in his last remarks. I did not seek to respond to him in the last clause stand part debate, but he did allow these words to drop from his lips the Government are impartial on the question of grammar schools. It has become absolutely clear not only that his hon. Friends sitting behind him are not impartial on that question, but that the Government as he has said in answers to other debates are not impartial.
<P>
<B>Mr. Byers:</B> It might be the lateness of the hour although I believe that I managed to get my vote counted the right way but I was trying to say that we are impartial in terms of the procedures that we are drawing up. We have made it clear which is why we have put a block on their extension that we do not in principle support the extension of grammar schools. We hope, however, that the procedures are impartial and fair.
<P>
<B>Mr. Dorrell:</B> The amendment deals with the nature of the rules for the ballot and therefore the nature of the procedure. It would require a ballot to have an absolute majority of those entitled to vote to abolish the selective system. What matters is the way in which non-voters are assumed to exercise their influence. How will the influence of the non-voting population of relevant parents, to use the jargon of the Government's scheme, work?
<P>
If people do not vote against the status quo, the burden of proof should be on those people who want to change it. In order to change a status quo system that works, it is not unreasonable, against the background of the principle of balloting in which a change has to be supported by a defined group within a ballot to require a ballot to produce an absolute majority of those who are directly affected, either as part of a whole area ballot or of a ballot of feeder schools.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will address how non-voters are assumed to cast their influence. The amendment would leave them neutral and would require a majority to deliver change.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brady:</B> I endorse my right hon. Friend's points. Stability is an important issue for schools. It is appropriate that we add a weight to make it more likely that stability is maintained. Schools should be able to plan on the basis of existing arrangements unless and until there is a clear and demonstrable majority in the local community for change.

<B>Ms Estelle Morris:</B> We do not wish to accept the amendment. I think that without the 20 per cent. trigger, Opposition Members would have had a fair argument, but the Bill proposes a petition of 20 per cent., which is quite a lot, to trigger a ballot. That 20 per cent. is an expression of concern of interest and intent by parents in an area. As that is the first stage of a ballot, it is appropriate for us not to ask for an absolute majority in its second stage.
