Question again proposed, That the amendment be made.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are debating amendment No. 149, in page 21, line 43, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(5A) For the purposes of subsection (3), a disclosure of information shall not contravene any of the data protection principles or section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 merely because it identifies an individual, or relates to an identifiable individual, who is—

<P>
(b) a public contractor, or
<P>
(c) a representative of an organisation,
<P>
acting in that capacity.
<P>
(5B) Subsection (5A) does not apply to information relating to the health, salary or disciplinary record of an individual.
<P>
(5C) In this section—
<P>
``public official'' means a Minister of the Crown, a Crown Servant or an employee or office-holder of a public authority or of an administration in the United Kingdom (within the meaning of section 26(2)), or an individual who is appointed by any of the above to any body;
<P>
``public contractor'' means an individual providing services under contract to a public authority or an individual employed by or providing services under contract to a public contractor in relation to such a contract;
<P>
``representative of an organisation'' means an individual who is communicating with a public authority on behalf of an organisation.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. John Greenway </B>(Ryedale): It may be for the convenience of the Committee, given the peremptory way in which the comments of the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Fisher) were brought to an end at the close of our previous sitting, if I speak briefly to the amendments.
<P>
As I understand matters, the hon. Gentleman's chief concern is to ensure that the Bill is compatible with the Data Protection Act 1998 and that it should create no difficulty for the Data Protection Registrar and her staff, nor for the many organisations that will be asked for information that will be within the purview of data protection provisions rather than the Bill. Clause 38 exempts personal information about the data subject, which is effectively available through the Data Protection Act 1998.
<P>
A difficulty arises with respect to subsection (3). I have given the matter some thought over the weekend and I perceive a problem concerning section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998. That provision concerns the right to prevent the processing of personal data that is likely to cause damage or distress, and it was debated at length in Standing Committee. As I understand the matter, service of a section 10 notice might block any freedom of information disclosure. Would the individual concerned then have any opportunity to challenge the notice? Such persons would be intending to exercise what they would believe to be their right, under the Bill, to obtain information. However, they would not necessarily realise that under clause 38(3) the matter would be dealt with as a question of data protection, rather than freedom of information. The use of section 10 could prevent them from obtaining information to which they understood they were entitled.
<P>
Should that be the end of the matter; or will the Information Commissioner have the opportunity to review the public authority's decision to accept the blocking mechanism under section 10 of the Data Protection Act? Will clause 50 apply in those circumstances, so that applicants will be able to ask the Information Commissioner to review
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether, in any specified respect, a request for information made by the complainant to a public authority has been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of Part I''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
that is, whether they have not been given information to which they were entitled? Will the Minister explain whether the commissioner could review the matter under clause 50 to ascertain whether the blocking mechanism of section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 had been correctly used.
<P>
As clause 38 is in part II, does clause 50 apply to part II? It may apply to part II, given that the use of discretion under clause 13, which excludes clause 38(1), is in part I and the Minister's view is that the commissioner has the general power under clause 50 to review the exercise of discretion under clause 13.
<P>
I may be wrong, but my impression is that the amendment is trying to ascertain whether the use of section 10 of the Data Protection Act to block release may be challenged, allowing an applicant the right of appeal or redress. If so, in what way might it be challenged? As far as I can tell, it can be challenged only if the applicant asks the commissioner to review the decision to block release using the power provided in clause 50, which limits the commissioner to reviewing whether matters have been dealt with in accordance with the requirements of part I. As clause 13, which provides for the discretion, is in part I, clause 50 must be relevant to any decision involving the powers under clause 38.
<P>
The issue is complicated, so I may have erred in my analysis of what the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central is trying to achieve. As I understand it, the purpose of his amendment is to ascertain whether information that, under the Bill, is expected to be released may not be available because of the powers and provisions of the 1998 Act. That is of concern to the Committee, and it would be right for us to ask the Government how the Bill addresses our concerns or whether it needs amendment. I hope that what I have said has been helpful to the Committee and to the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central. In his response, he might tell me whether my understanding has been correct.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, I should say that I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and he seemed to be make a stand part contribution and to speak to amendment No. 150. I was generous in allowing that—I understand that it is difficult to discuss one aspect of the clause without touching on interlocking features. However, I ask the hon. Gentleman to note that observation when making further contributions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Fisher </B>(Stoke-on-Trent, Central): I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ryedale for trying to assist the Committee by teasing out the arguments. I sympathise with many of his comments, although much of what he said concerned amendment No. 150, which deals with appeals against section 10 of the 1998 Act, and we shall come to that later.
<P>
I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman's tentativeness—he knows much more about the Data Protection Act than most members of the Committee. The area is horrendously complicated and the tortuous length of amendments Nos. 148, 149 and 150 shows that there is no concise, elegant and easy means of addressing the problem. As the hon. Gentleman says, the nub of the matter is the distinction, or possibly the confusion, between the treatment of personal data that is about a public official who is acting in an official capacity and public data about that public official who is acting in a personal capacity. It is vital that we make that distinction, but the Bill does not appear to do so.
<P>
The interaction of clauses creates a cat's cradle. I hope that that will be helpful when people are familiar with the law and the commissioner and others who have to enforce it come to grips with it, but I am not sure which strand of the cat's cradle I am following or how they work together. If the distinction is not in the Bill, there is a risk that data about an official's official life and actions, to which the Bill is designed to give greater access, will be inadvertently and wrongly withheld. The Data Protection Act has a simpler task and a simpler solution: it protects all information. But that is not helpful for freedom of information, and the interaction of clauses reveals the difficulties.
<P>
There are ways to get around the problem. First, we could draft the Bill differently. The amendment suggests a tentative solution. Secondly, we could focus on what constitutes an invasion of personal privacy, but we would have to be specific about what we are and are not exempting. Thirdly, we could consider using the statutory public interest test that is part of the code.
<P>
There is another problem, however, which must have taxed the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials. A reasonable reading of the European Union's data protection directive shows that it is at odds with what we are trying to achieve. That was the Government's view when their amendment to clause 13(1) removed the public interest test from personal data. I am sympathetic towards their predicament and, although I am not completely familiar with the data protection directive, we need to bear it in mind.
<P>
Nevertheless, the problem remains that clause 38(1) exempts all personal information if it contravenes specific principles in the Data Protection Act, which are set out later in the clause. This is where we encounter tricky thickets of legislation. The Data Protection Act lists eight principles and it takes seven or eight closely argued pages to set them out. In addition, as the hon. Member for Ryedale said, the Data Protection Act has section 10. I shall not go into the eight principles, but any one of them reveals the problem.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It might help the Committee if I give a concrete example. I referred earlier to the case of one of my constituents who has had difficulty obtaining information relating to an incident in which she believes that she was sexually assaulted by a male nurse. She says that the incident has wrecked her life, and, for three years, she has been pursuing the information that the health authority managed to uncover. That was a traumatic, life-changing event, and my constituent feels that things would be easier if only she could get hold of the information. The information is obviously about the male nurse, but there were also one or two witnesses to the event. My constituent would probably, although not necessarily, be happy about the case being publicised because she is so desperate to get to the truth, although not everyone would be happy to have their name associated with a sexual assault, however injured they felt.
<P>
There are many other people whose witness and information has a bearing on the incident, and one hopes that that information would be on the health authority's file—information from other staff, who were in or around the corridor, or who were not in the corridor when they should have been, and members of administrative staff who investigated the matter. However, because that is all personal information, there might be real difficulties in getting to the bottom of the matter. It seems to me that my constituent is on a perfectly reasonable and affecting quest. She feels that her life has been destroyed, but depending on how the Data Protection Act relates to the Bill, she might be completely thwarted. That is not the Bill's intention. The purpose of the Bill, as outlined by the Secretary of State on Second Reading, is precisely to empower such people. Apart from the democratic importance of Government information, the Bill will be most effective in giving people control over their own lives in a way that they have never had before. In that, the Bill deals with an important problem, but in the case of my constituent there is a danger that the quest for information could be thwarted.
<P>
Leaving that example aside, the Data Protection Act requires that, in addition to meeting the general tests of fairness and lawfulness, at least one of the specific conditions in schedule 2 of the Act must be met. One of those is that the individual must consent to the disclosure, and if he or she does not, the disclosure must be shown to be necessary for at least one of a series of purposes. The other condition is to comply with any legal obligation on the authority. Here we move into tricky areas. Is the requirement to comply with the Freedom of Information Bill itself such an obligation? The Bill does not require the disclosure of information which breaches a principle, but this principle permits disclosures which are required by law. That forms a neat paradox, which turns in on itself.
<P>
That is the first of the data protection principles, and there are seven more to go. The second principle—I will not go through all seven—says,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
How does that leave people such as journalists? If information, including personal information, is collected to monitor the good working of a public body, and a journalist wants such information in a matter of public interest, but that is not the purpose for which the information was collected, will the journalist be thwarted by the relationship between the two measures? In order to decide whether the information is exempt, the authority will have to discover why the applicant wants the information and then assess the applicant's—in this case, the journalist's—intended use of the information and decide whether it is compatible with the purpose of the measure. These are difficult matters, but it is important to consider journalism in this respect and I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.
<P>
The Data Protection Registrar expressed her anxiety in her evidence to the Select Committee. She said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is the Registrar's view that in practice very little information is likely to be disclosable under these provisions . . . is a matter for Ministers and Parliament whether very limited disclosure of personal information on third parties is consistent with the objectives of Freedom of Information''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
She continued:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``The draft Bill treats all third party requests for access to personal information in the same way. It makes no distinction between what is public and what is private. Yet it would be possible to make this distinction between an official's public activities, i.e. between personal information relating to an official in the course of his duties, and his private life, i.e. that relating to him as a private individual. Drawing this distinction would permit different approaches towards disclosure of information about officials, depending on whether the information related to public activities which might be disclosable, or to private life which should usually receive the same protection afforded to individuals not in the public service. This would extend the quantity of personal information potentially available to third parties.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I regret that my earlier remarks on the amendment were not as elegant and precise as those of the Data Protection Registrar. There is a potential solution and, ironically, given that many of the problems are caused by the European Union data protection directive, it is possible that the EU may provide it. The Minister argued that the EU directive binds the Government's hands and that he is not free to adopt an approach that distinguishes between personal data on private individuals in their public capacity. However, the registrar maintained that recital 72 of the directive, inserted in response to the Swedish Government's concerns that it might undermine their own pre-reformation legislation, provides the legal basis for such a distinction. Recital 72 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Whereas this Directive allows the principle of public access to official documents to be taken into account when implementing the principles set out in this Directive''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that I have not tested your patience Mr. O'Hara, but it is difficult to set out these matters. We are attempting to highlight a distinction. The Parliamentary Secretary, like the hon. Member for Ryedale, may have been thinking about the matter over the weekend. The directive, the Data Protection Act, and the Bill are difficult matters, and if the Parliamentary Secretary wants to respond at a later stage or in writing, I should welcome it, because we all need to digest the proposals. If his reply is as complex as the issue demands, we will need something in writing.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. David Lock):</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central for tabling the amendment because it raises an important issue about the inter-relationship between the data protection principles and freedom of information.
<P>
The effect of amendment Nos. 148 and 149 taken together would be that the exemptions for personal information relating to a third party in clause 38 would no longer apply in relation to certain classes of people if the only grounds for such exemption were that any disclosure would identify an individual or related to an identifiable individual. It would deem that such disclosures are not contrary to data protection principles or to section 10 of the Data Protection Act. The classes of people covered by the amendment are public officials, public contractors and any individual who is communicating with a public authority on behalf of an organisation, described as a representative of an organisation. The terms ``public official'' and ``public contractor'' are defined to include any individual appointed by a public official to any body and any individual employed by or providing services under a contract to a public contractor in relation to such a contract.
<P>
I recognise the concerns that have given rise to this amendment, which echoes a concern raised by Elizabeth France in her evidence to the House of Commons Scrutiny Committee during consultation on the draft Bill published last year. She said then that she was concerned about what she saw as constraints within the Bill which could limit the effectiveness with which access would be made available to personal information as it related to individuals acting in their public capacities.
<P>
I explain that concern by referring to my hon. Friend's example of an unfortunate incident in which a constituent was allegedly sexually assaulted by a nurse in the course of his or her duties. Rightly, that individual seeks disclosure of the information. To what extent could the employee seek to block the disclosure of that information on data protection grounds and thereby stop the freedom of information principles applying to give that disclosure? We are alive to the issue, but I am not sure that the amendment, which was no doubt carefully drafted with that in mind, would deal with the problem, for two reasons. First, new subsection (5A) restricts the exemption to acts of public officials acting in an official capacity. It is arguable that, if a nurse sexually assaulted a patient on the ward, the nurse was not acting in an official capacity, but directly contrary to what he or she was supposed to be doing as a nurse. Therefore, it may not fall within the terms of the amendment.
<P>
Secondly, subsection (5B) rightly refers to the need to hold confidential issues relating to an individual's disciplinary record. Clearly, the vast majority of disciplinary records of individual employees are personal and should not be disclosed. However, if a complaint was lodged and a health authority investigated the conduct of a nurse in such circumstances, such information would be relevant to a disciplinary inquiry. Therefore, even within the terms of the amendment, unfortunately, such information would not be disclosed, although I can understand why my hon. Friend's constituent would want it to be disclosed. The nub of the problem is the difficulty of definition.
<P>
We are anxious about third party requests for access to personal information. At present, the Bill treats all requests for information in the same way; it makes no distinction between information that relates to an official's public activities and that which relates to his activities as a private individual. The amendment seeks to draw that distinction.
<P>
The law relating to the processing of personal information is laid down in the Data Protection Act. A request that is made to a public authority for personal data relating to a third party will be considered by reference to the principles set out in the Act, as my hon. Friend has said. They are contained in schedule 1 of the Act. As the hon. Member for Ryedale noted, the Act gives effect in the United Kingdom to the EC directive on data protection.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government believe that the amendment contains a problem in that respect. The distinction between public and private personal data, which the amendments seek to establish, is not explicitly recognised in the directive. Accordingly, if the Government accepted the amendment, the United Kingdom would risk finding itself in breach of EU obligations. It would not be sensible to base legislation on anything other than a firm understanding that it is consistent with our international obligations. To do so would be to invite an unwelcome challenge in the courts.
<P>
In respect of the example that I discussed with my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, it is unclear whether his amendment would cure the problem that he highlighted. He rightly asked whether recital 72 of the European directive on data protection provided flexibility, and he was right to say that it provides for some flexibility on the distinction between public and private information. The Government believe that it informs the interpretation of the principles and that it cannot be reduced to a simple formula such as that proposed by the amendment. Its effect on the interpretation of basic data protection principles may differ according to whether such protection concerns public officials or a private person.
<P>
During pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill, the Government gave a commitment to consult with Mrs. France on that point. We discussed possible resolutions for the concerns expressed by her and others about the divide between personal and private activities. We have consulted, and we continue to believe that it would be inappropriate to write into the primary legislation a requirement whose legality would be doubtful to say the least, bearing in mind all of the circumstances in which it would apply under the Act. However, taking into account my hon. Friend's observations on recital 72, we agree with Mrs. France that there may be some room to interpret the principles of the directive differently from those of the Data Protection Act when dealing with information of the sort addressed by the amendment.
<P>
As the Information Commissioner, Mrs. France may want to consider giving authorities guidance on the considerations that they must take into account when responding to applications. We believe that the Bill provides the right way forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I apologise, Mr. O'Hara. You caught me on the hop earlier, and I spoke to amendment No. 150, although, in some respects, what I said relates to the current debate.
<P>
Will the Parliamentary Secretary address another guidance issue? I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central got it quite right. The protection of public officials from release of details of their private life is a clear issue. However, the hon. Gentleman's main concern appeared to be the denial to journalists of genuine information that should be published. Would not the guidance about which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke make it clear that powers relating to section 32 of the Data Protection Act and to the special process dealt with in section 3 override any provisions in the Bill? We debated the matter at length and it was made clear that, for journalistic purposes, section 10 of the Act and concern about the other principles do not apply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lock:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making that point. It shows the advantage of bringing together the data protection and freedom of information regimes under one commissioner to ensure that consistent principles are applied. He asked whether disclosure to a journalist is consistent with data protection principles. As he rightly noted, it is not the case that information that is collected for purposes other than journalism cannot be disclosed for journalistic purposes. However, it is impossible to give a simple, positive answer because it depends on the facts of the case. It is not the purpose of the Bill to expand the categories for which exemption can be claimed under section 10 of the Data Protection Act. A claim that is rightly made under that regime will determine whether an exemption applies. If it does not apply, clause 38 would not entitle the public authority to rely on a claimed section 10 right. I hope that that is clear.
<P>
I have explained our difficulty with the amendment. I recognise that some hon. Members would prefer the changes to be part of a statutory provision, but that would not be right. It would be more flexible for the commissioner to issue guidance because that would more appropriately interpret the changes. She would, however, determine the precise contents. I am pleased that I have been able to clarify this complex matter and I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for his serious and courteous response. I also appreciate his sympathy for the amendments and his recognition that there could be a problem. I am glad that he has consulted Mrs. France. However, I am slightly worried about his reluctance to legislate. I hope that the Government's mind is not closed to considering the matter as the Bill proceeds.
<P>
I accept that, because the issue is so complicated, a fair-minded person who is listening to the Parliamentary Secretary would initially be sympathetic towards leaving the problem to the commissioner to sort out. In his penultimate sentence, he said that the Government's approach would be more flexible. That might be common sense. We have an excellent commissioner, Mrs. France, who understands the relationship between data protection and freedom of information. In operating a regime for a Government who are genuinely keen to address the problems, there will be a great deal of good will and constructive circumstances in which she can be flexible, which will help to ensure that she reaches the right conclusions. But the danger of not legislating is that a new and less experienced commissioner could come into the job when a Government—not this one—are experiencing great public difficulties and Ministers have had to make ex cathedra statements to protect themselves.
<P>
During the 1980s, the noble Lord Tebbit was keen on putting pressure on the BBC by rattling the bones in interviews and saying that the Government were unhappy about the situation. One can imagine a future Minister referring to the Bill as the one that was passed by a misguided Government in 2000, and putting pressure on the commissioner. That is why it is dangerous to leave such a matter up to the commissioner and not to sort it out now, on the basis that it is so complicated that we might make it worse. I have some sympathy with that view, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will continue to struggle with what we all recognise is a difficult problem and, if the wording of the amendment is defective, find an alternative. We have plenty of time, not just in Committee but in the coming weeks as the Bill progresses through Parliament, and I hope that the Minister's mind is not closed. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>

<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Mike O'Brien):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 21, line 17, after `public' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`otherwise than under this Act'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may also take Government amendments Nos. 48 and 49.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49 introduce no new principles into the operation of the exemption for personal information relating to third parties. The policy is that such information should be exempt if its disclosure would contravene the Data Protection Act 1998 or if the person to whom it relates would not have a right to know about it or a right of access to it under that Act. The aim is to ensure that we fully comply with our obligations under the directive and that we clarify the operation of the legislation in the amendments.
<P>
When assessing whether a disclosure would contravene data protection principles, the position must be to disregard the Bill, if we are to avoid an unacceptable loop in the internal logic of the Bill. It would be nonsense for the Freedom of Information Bill to provide that information is exempt if release of the information would contravene the data protection principles and, at the same time, to allow the fact that disclosure is required under the Freedom of Information Bill, unless the information is exempt, to influence consideration of whether disclosure would contravene the data protection principles.
<P>
The Government recognise, however, that clause 38 does not achieve that. Amendments Nos. 47, 48 and 49 are necessary to deliver the required policy. The amendments are minor, but I do not disguise their importance in clarifying the principle. We want to ensure that there is no ambiguity in how the policy operates. Therefore, I invite the Committee to accept the amendments.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I beg to move amendment No 150, in page 21, line 28, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4A) Where information is exempt under subsection (3)(a)(ii) by virtue of a notice given by the authority under section 10(3)(a) of the Data Protection Act 1998, an application for review of that notice may be made to the Commissioner by the person who has made a request under section 1.
<P>
(4B) The Commissioner shall not undertake a review under this section unless he has given the relevant person notice in writing that an application has been made and offered the relevant person an opportunity to make representations to him about the application within such reasonable time as may be set out in the notice.
<P>
(4C) If after reviewing the notice and taking account of any representations made by the relevant person the Commissioner is satisfied that the disclosure of the information in accordance with this Act would not cause substantial damage or substantial distress to the relevant person, or that any such substantial damage or substantial distress would not be unwarranted, the information shall not be exempt by virtue of subsection (3)(a)(ii), and the Commissioner shall inform the authority and the relevant person accordingly.
<P>
(4D) Where information is exempt under subsection (3)(a)(ii) by virtue of an order made by the court under section 10(4) of the Data Protection Act 1998, an application may be made to the court by a person who has made a request under section 1 and, if the court is satisfied that the disclosure of the information in accordance with this Act would not cause substantial damage or substantial distress to the relevant person, or that any such substantial damage or substantial distress would not be unwarranted, the court may vary or revoke the order accordingly.
<P>
(4E) A court shall not make an order under subsection (4) unless it has given the relevant person notice in writing that an application has been made and offered the relevant person an opportunity to make representations to it about the application within such reasonable time as may be set out in the notice.

(4F) In this section, ``the relevant person'' means the person who gave notice under section 10(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998 and any other person mentioned in that notice in respect of whom that notice was given.'.<P>

<P>
Committee Members often describe an amendment as a probing amendment when it is no such thing, but the present case is genuine, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take it in that spirit. It concerns the possibility of a right of appeal against a notice under section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998. As the hon. Member for Ryedale spoke about this issue earlier, I hope that he will be sympathetic to the amendment. It concerns one of the three grounds on which personal information may be withheld under clause 38; that disclosure would contravene section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998. That section allows an individual to serve notice on a data controller, meaning a public body, requiring it not to process—that is, disclose—personal data about himself or herself.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
A section 10 notice can be served if the anticipated disclosure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is likely to cause substantial damage or . . . distress''—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
it is interesting that those words are used in this context, but I shall leave that issue aside—to the applicant or someone else, and that that damage or distress would be unwarranted. A public body that receives such a notice must reply within 21 days to confirm whether it will comply. The applicant can then if necessary apply to the court, which can, if it considers the notice to be justified, order the authority to comply.
<P>
Clause 38 exempts from access under the Freedom of Information Bill any personal information to which a section 10 notice applies. At first sight, it is not clear to me that the freedom of information applicant who thinks that such a notice is unjustified can challenge it. The amendment would provide a right of appeal in two parallel ways, one to a public body and the other to a court. The new subsections (4A) and (4C) that the amendment would add to the clause permit an applicant who has accepted the data subject's section 10 notice to apply to the commissioner for a review. The second procedure would apply when a section 10 notice had been enforced by a court order, in which case the applicant would ask the court for a review.
<P>
Section 10 can be set aside if disclosure is sought for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes. Section 32 of the Data Protection Act 1998 makes it clear that for that to be done the public body controlling the data would have reasonably to believe that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``having regard in particular to the special importance of the public interest in freedom of expression, publication would be in the public interest''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is not clear to me how the provisions interplay, and whether the public interest test in section 32 is available to anyone besides journalists and authors, such as, for instance, Members of Parliament, lawyers or a charitable body that is on a campaign trail and wants to explore an issue. Any of those might have good reason for pursuing the point, despite not being journalists or authors—although many hon. Members would like to think of themselves as authors.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I have just refreshed my memory. I remember considering this aspect of the Data Protection Act 1998 in Standing Committee. Section 32 of the Act is clear. It states ``any person''.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. However, the present case still raises questions. I shall provide another example, because with such difficult topics concrete instances help. The recently retired Director-General of the BBC, Sir John Birt—whom I shall refer to by that title for the purposes of the present example, although I am not sure whether he may now be a noble Lord—had certain problems, when he first took up his position, about his tax position in relation to his salary. If he learned that an applicant was asking the BBC for information—a reasonable request, as he was publicly paid and as he paid tax—he could stop disclosure by serving a section 10 notice, claiming that he would be exposed to damage or distress.
<P>
Another case from the media and arts world is that of Miss Mary Allen, who was Secretary-General of the Arts Council of England. When she left that post to join the Royal Opera house, there was speculation about her financial arrangements with the Arts Council and with the opera house, and between the Royal Opera house and the Arts Council of England. Indeed, she was questioned before the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport on the matter by my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Kaufman).
<P>
Such matters are of genuine public concern, but the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Bill will give both Sir John and Miss Allen the right to block an application, without the applicant having a right to appeal against the ruling under section 10 of the 1998 Act. The Under-Secretary might find my amendment's drafting deficient, but I hope that he recognises the problem and that a right of appeal against section 10 in such instances is necessary. If he cannot accept the amendment, I hope that he will agree that the Government and parliamentary draftsmen should return to the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> As I said earlier, we have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. As he spoke, I began to revisit parts of the Data Protection Act. The Data Protection Registrar and the Information Commissioner will have powers under the Act and the Bill to review decisions.
<P>
I shall ask the Under-Secretary my two earlier questions to the Parliamentary Secretary. If subsection (3)(a)(ii) on the use of section 10 of the Data Protection Act were invoked, preventing the release of information, journalistic special purposes that would override the ruling would give some comfort to those seeking to ensure that information is released, but people who do not want their personal information to be published would not be protected. They should be given the protection of the 1998 Act. There must be a balance between the two cases.
<P>
The key question for the Committee is not so much whether the Data Protection Registrar has adequate powers under the 1998 Act—we debated that in Committee two years ago—but whether there could be a review if section 10 of the 1998 Act was invoked following an application for information under subsection (1). Would clause 50 allow such a review? I suspect that it would because, although it relates only to part I, any factor related to clause 38 would fall under the discretionary powers of clause 13. Therefore, such an application would be caught by the powers given to the commissioner by clause 50. In other words, I am not suggesting merely that the commissioner does not have sufficient powers under the Data Protection Act. The question before the Committee is whether the powers conferred on the commissioner by section 50 will enable her to review and therefore challenge any decision taken to block the release of information because of the invocation by a public authority of powers contained in section 10 of the Act. I hope that that is clear.

<P>

<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We are discussing extremely complex aspects of the Bill. Throughout the Committee's proceedings, I have been concerned to ensure that we create legislation that can be used by the general public. Members of the public who seek to understand the various legislative interactions under discussion, especially between the Data Protection Act and the Bill, may encounter considerable difficulty. We are trying to make the provisions as simple as possible, but the circumstances are unfortunately somewhat complex.
<P>
I shall take the matter as carefully as I can. Amendment No. 150 would introduce a new review process into the current data protection regime. As has been pointed out, it would enable a third party or an applicant for the disclosure of information relating to someone other than himself to request the commissioner or, where appropriate, a court, to review the grounds on which a data subject had requested and obtained a notice under section 10 of the Data Protection Act.
<P>
It is open to a data subject under section 10 to require a data controller—a company or another organisation—to cease or to not begin to produce personal data about a data subject. That applies if a subject considers that the continued processing of such information would or would be likely to cause unwarranted substantial damage or distress to him or to another person. In making such a request, he must be able to show the specific grounds on which he has reached his view.
<P>
Let me emphasise those last points. The data controller is not required to accept a request for cessation of processing if it does not set out the grounds on which the individual concerned believes that he will be caused damage or distress, which must be substantial and unwarranted. These requirements are not simple or easy hurdles. It is not just a matter of issuing a notice on which one can make a claim and stop disclosure. The notice must have a clear substance and the damage must be unwarranted. If it is warranted, the request will become a subject for debate. It would be open to a data controller who did not accept that the grounds had been established to continue processing personal data despite the request. The data subject would then have access to ask the Data Protection Registrar to issue an enforcement order under the 1998 Act or to ask the courts for an order requiring the controller to comply with the request.
<P>
I make no apology for taking time to speak about the Data Protection Act procedure for someone to obtain a notice under section 10 of that Act, which is the core of the process. It is important for hon. Members to recognise that the process is by no means automatic and that it does not operate without proper checks and balances. Furthermore, we should bear in mind that entitlement to request a notice under section 10 does not apply in specific instances that are set out in schedule 2 of the 1998 Act. Entitlement does not apply when the data subject has given his consent to process or when processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the taking of steps at the request of a data subject with a view to entering into a contract. Nor does it apply when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the data controller is subject, other than an obligation imposed by the contract. That provision may mean that the company in question is subject to an obligation to comply. Finally, entitlement does not apply when processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject.
<P>
The amendment would introduce an entirely new procedure. I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central, who described it as a probing amendment. We are, however, reluctant to introduce a procedure such as that which it proposes. Given the breadth of existing controls, the Government are firmly of the view that the proposed review would not be appropriate. I take my hon. Friend's point, and I shall not press my argument any further.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Section 32 of the Data Protection Act provides that disclosure for journalistic, artistic or literary purposes is not subject to section 10 in particular circumstances, as the hon. Member for Ryedale pointed out. By virtue of the clause, such information would therefore not be exempt under the Bill. Section 32 of the Data Protection Act relates only to persons who intend to publish information as journalistic, artistic or literary material and does not apply to individuals who seek information for other purposes.
<P>
Does clause 50 apply the right of complaint when the information is exempt by virtue of clause 38? The answer is yes; the commissioner can assess whether the disclosure in question comes within a notice or order under section 10 of the Data Protection Act. The commissioner will also determine whether a notice or order is in place and whether disclosure falls within its terms. In the example of Sir John Birt, there is no appeal against the granting of a section 10 notice, but such a notice need not be agreed by the public authority in the first place. Courts can be required to rule on such disputes when they arise.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Earlier, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary gave an example in which he implied that the data controller—the public authority—was processing or wanted to process the information and said that the other condition was the consent of the subject. In the example of Sir John Birt and the BBC or of Mary Allen and the Arts Council of England, the public body in question may not want to process the information and the subject may not want to give consent, as in Sir John Birt's case. The applicant will be stymied in such cases even though he has a proper and respectable reason for believing that his actions are in the public interest.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is right, but the BBC may have a legal duty to comply with proper requests for information. It must consider how schedule 2 of the 1998 Act would operate and think about whether it is required to comply with a legal duty. The data subject may not be happy, but the data controller may be subject to a legal obligation covered by the Bill. Such matters are complex, and, given the complaints that have been made, the better approach is for me to consider further the example of Sir John Birt and the request in question.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We could tie ourselves up in knots with this. It would be for Sir John Birt himself to invoke the power contained in section 10 of the Data Protection Act and not for anybody else. He would have to make an application, saying that he did not want the data processed because it would cause him substantial damage or distress. As the Under-Secretary said, the commissioner must be satisfied that that is the case before the request would be granted
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> That is right. Of course, the data controller would have to be satisfied that section 10 applied. In disputes between the data controller and data subject, there would be a right to consider the view of the Information Commissioner on whether that interpretation was correct. The process contains checks and balances. Inserting a new appeal system into a complex area would create more difficulties than it is worth.
<P>
I am conscious that we, as mere fallible legislators, can only attempt to produce legislation that predicts and remedies problems. We do not know whether what my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central highlighted will be a problem. I suspect that periodically we will have to review the operation of the Bill. The difficulty that my hon. Friend described might arise, but I do not think that it will. We must make the Bill as right as possible. Trying to create a way to get around data protection legislation would not be helpful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> I am grateful for the Under-Secretary's response. The intention is not to get around data protection legislation, but to address a problem that arises when legislation conflicts. However, this is a probing amendment. He has made the Government's position clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> Before the hon. Gentleman seeks leave to withdraw his amendment, does he agree that the Under-Secretary's clarification that the exercise of 38(3) can be reviewed under clause 50 is helpful?
<P>
<B>Mr. Fisher:</B> Yes, if that is the case, but the interaction of the different elements needs to be carefully examined. We have done sufficient today to open up the lines of approach and inquiry into possible problems. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> The amendments relate to the exemption of information that is provided in confidence. It is important to emphasise that that is treated exceptionally in the Bill because it is not subject to the public interest test as set out in clause 13(1)(a). What will be the role of common law confidentiality? As that requires serious malpractice, such as crime, fraud, misconduct or danger to the public, I assume that it will not be frequently invoked.
<P>
Amendment No. 153 deals with how long information that is obtained in confidence should remain confidential. The common-sense answer is that it should remain confidential for as long as the person who supplied it wants it to be. But how will the authority know, as a matter of practice, how long the supplier requires confidentiality to be maintained? Confidential information that is considered important when it is supplied could be deemed to be trivial later. If circumstances change, it may be unnecessary to treat the information as confidential. The supplier may have no interest in keeping it confidential—he may even have made it public—but the authority that holds the information would not necessarily know that. The amendment is similar to one that was tabled to clause 25. It would require the authority to ask for a supplier's consent to disclose information. To avoid unnecessary hassle, a request would be limited to once a year.
<P>
Amendment No. 154 would provide that an authority that accepts information in circumstances that are contrary to the guidance issued under the code of practice, which clause 44 stipulates will be delivered by the Secretary of State, would not be treated as having been submitted under the obligation of confidentiality. It would, therefore, not be exempt.
<P>
Amendment No. 157 is designed to require the Secretary of State to have in mind the issue of confidentiality when he issues the code of practice. He would have to identify in what circumstances authorities should not accept information in confidence, a matter on which clause 44 is silent. Such an approach would be advantageous in that the requirements could be established by the Secretary of State. The amendment does not seek to determine those requirements. For example, it might be appropriate to make it clear that consultation documents should not permit information to be supplied in confidence unless disclosure of the information involved would harm the supplier's commercial position or reveal personal information about an individual. In any event, a Secretary of State wishing to take advantage of that approach would want to consult widely before issuing the code. The virtue of doing so would be that, once the terms were set, they would be available and those supplying information would know the circumstances in which confidentiality might, or might not, apply. That could be important to the relationship between the Government and commercial lobbyists, whose dealings could be regulated by such guidelines. It would ensure much greater transparency in a matter that causes concern to many people. I hope that the amendments will commend themselves to the Minister and to the Committee.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): I speak to amendment No. 158, a lonely amendment tabled in my name only. The Bill's explanatory notes state:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Clause 39 exempts, as a class, information obtained by any other person if its disclosure would constitute a breach of confidence actionable by that other person.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have no problem in supporting that aim, however, the amendment clarifies the circumstances in which an authority becomes subject to an obligation of confidentiality. It tries to tackle anxiety that information would be withheld from the public under the Bill because authorities accepted information in confidence when they did not mean to, or should not have done so.
<P>
During an earlier sitting, the Committee agreed, without dissent—indeed, without debate—to clause 36, which exempts information which would be likely to endanger personal safety. However, the Bill covers information as opposed to documents and public authorities could issue information that may be contained within documents without actually revealing information that may put individuals at risk. I am trying to tease out an assurance that there will not be blanket bans on information just because part of the documents have information which we agree must be exempt.
<P>
It is easy to enter an obligation of confidentiality and equally easy for one side to believe that the obligation exists when the other does not. In addition, the law of confidence is complex. The circumstance in which an enforceable obligation arises may not be clear even to the participants themselves. Government Departments and public authorities have long dealt with outside bodies, especially industries which they may have the responsibility of regulating, on an assumption that everything between them will be in confidence. Those habits will be difficult to break; indeed, neither side may feel that they have any incentive or desire to do so. It is important to ensure that the Bill is drafted so as to ensure that when it becomes law, those practices will not continue.
<P>
The amendment would require the public authority, before accepting information, carefully to consider whether it is prepared to accept it in confidence. It requires the authority to express in writing its willingness to accept information on those terms and requires the authority to withhold its consent unless two conditions are met: first that it requires such information in order properly to fulfil its functions and, secondly, that it believes on reasonable grounds that without the information it will not be able to discharge its functions.
<P>
If the information is not required, the authority should in any case be wary about accepting it in confidence. It may find, subsequently, that it is unable to defend its actions should they come in for criticism because of undertakings needlessly and pointlessly given to third parties. There may be complaints that an authority is failing properly to enforce the requirement. The authority may have acted conscientiously but been misled by the regulated person and not be able to acknowledge it.
<P>
I shall give a practical example of a dilemma that the amendment would ensure will not occur in future. It is not the first time that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has been used to highlight difficulties. Several years ago, in the dark days when the forces of conservatism were in the ascendancy, MAFF published findings showing that a high proportion of microwave ovens did not heat food to the required standard, even when used according to the manufacturer's instructions. To widespread disbelief, when MAFF published that information it did not identify which microwaves were not doing the job properly. When worried consumers contacted the Ministry, they were told to check with the manufacturer of their microwave oven to find out whether it was safe. It transpired that the reason why MAFF had taken that action was that the manufacturers had given them free microwave ovens to test on the ground that none of the ovens would be identified when the results were known. The public outcry resulted in a catastrophic episode for MAFF and for the process of open government by which people receive reasonable and accurate information from public bodies. I might call the proposal a microwave amendment.
<P>
We are trying to ensure that there is no such nonsense in the future; information that is clearly in the public interest must not be blocked by the party that gives the information or equipment necessary to get that information.
<P>
I want the Minister to acknowledge the importance of mutuality, that the giver of information should not hold all the cards in terms of deciding when something is in confidence and when it will be made available to the public. That is the principle of the Bill for many members of the Committee and the amendment would ensure that the matter is not subject to further deliberations after the Bill becomes law.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will accept that, if someone volunteers information to a public body in confidence, the authority has the option of saying that it is not prepared to accept that condition. If so, will that apply even when the public authority already has that information? That is important because, in a licence application, the authority will not know that it is getting the information until such time as it actually arrives. In other words, can the authority tell the giver of information, ``We are prepared to accept the information, but not on the confidential basis on which you have submitted it. We also accept that the authority should exercise its discretion whether to accept information on a confidential basis in the light of the presumption of openness that underlies the Bill.'' In other words, the authority should agree to accept information in confidence when one of the other exemptions would apply and there was no countervailing public interest in disclosure, or perhaps when the authority needs the information more than the informant needs to give it.
<P>
The amendment may help authorities to keep themselves out of trouble in future; more to the point it would help the public obtain information that should not have been confidential in the first place. The amendment would ensure that, when the Bill becomes law, large amounts of information will not be taken out of the public domain just because the person who gives the information says that it is confidential. I hope that the Minister will respond to those points.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> We gave considerable time to this area of law because it is an area in which we could run into difficulties if the freedom of information legislation does not apply properly. For example, organisations might try to keep information secret by just putting a ``confidential'' stamp on it and suggesting that it was received in confidence. One of the key protections will be the guidance given by the Information Commissioner to public authorities that they should not be complicit in creating a culture of secrecy by their use of the common law, and that they should receive information only on a confidential basis if that is appropriate and justifiable.
<P>
Let me set out the Government's concerns about the amendments. The Government considered the whole issue of the common law of confidence, which is a complex area, almost exclusively derived from case law. Case law has produced a type of public interest test, although not of the level used in the Bill, and provides a way in which people can pass information to other organisations on a confidential basis, but some of those organisations might pass on the information to public authorities. Therefore, we need to provide some protection for the individual who, quite properly, passes information, on a confidential basis, to another private individual, who may have Justification for passing the information to a public authority. What is the position of the first person involved in that situation, and should that information, which might properly be confidential, suddenly be in the public arena? Once we started to examine that complex area of law, we realised that, if we were to import changes into the common law rules of confidentiality, we would create a very complex piece of legislation. In many ways, freedom of information legislation is already complex enough. Of itself, that is not justification for not venturing into that area, but it is justification for at least being cautious.
<P>
We then considered the importance of the right of confidentiality and concluded that it was an important right—arguably, a balancing right. The Bill is all about balancing rights; the freedom of information balanced against rights of privacy and confidentiality, as well as the desirability of efficiency in government. It would be wrong to overturn the common law rights of confidentiality, which have developed over many years, have the benefit of being understood and are flexible and adaptable. To attempt to overturn the common law rules in the Bill would be too complex and would not be justified. The rules also give individuals and organisations confidence that information that they pass to others will be properly respected. The other option would be unfairly to prejudice public authorities in their ability to enter into negotiations and reach agreements or to tender for services.
<P>
Hon. Members will wish to be aware that the common law of confidence contains a public interest test, so that no duty of confidence arises if it is contrary to the public interest, but I do not claim that that interest test is of as high a standard as the one in the Bill. I make it plain that the Government will not accept amendments that amend the law of confidence.
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 153, for example, would be to preclude an authority from relying on clause 39 in relation to information that was subject to a duty of confidence unless, at the time of the request, the authority had sought the consent of the supplier of the information to disclose that information, and consent had been refused. Such a refusal would continue to hold good for 12 months.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The effect of amendment No. 153 would be that information obtained in confidence from another person or body could not be disclosed under freedom of information legislation for as long as that individual or body chose, but that, depending on the frequency of requests, authorities would be able or be required to ascertain the wishes of that body or supplier every 12 months. In that way, the confidentiality of the information would have to be renewed continually.
<P>
The amendment is unnecessary in so far as it is designed to ensure that information that was once confidential does not remain so for all time. The common law of confidence already provides for that, and the authority may claim that information is confidential only if the circumstances are such that confidentiality subsists. The fact that the circumstances surrounding the information have changed to such an extent that it is no longer confidential will be taken into account by the authorities when applying the common law under the current rules.
<P>
Moreover, the Secretary of State's codes of practice will include guidance to authorities on the appropriateness of consulting those to whom information relates or those who would be affected by its disclosure. That will ensure that the sort of consultations that the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) favours will happen when appropriate—not every 12 months, but whether the information will need to be kept confidential for a long time may be obvious from the nature of the information. Conversely, it may be obvious that the information will be in the public arena via another route within hours or days, in which case the rules relating to confidentiality would no longer apply. In those circumstances, the authority would not be bound by the common law obligations.
<P>
Therefore, the flexibility provided by the common law will cover the circumstances referred to by the right hon. Gentleman. For example, with information that an individual seeks to keep confidential for a prolonged period of time, it will not be necessary constantly to reiterate the need to keep it confidential. I would be concerned about the bureaucratic burden that that would place on public authorities because it would mean that they would have to keep contact with every bit of confidential information and write letters every 12 months to every person who wanted the information to remain confidential.

<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> If the right hon. Gentleman is about to say that that would be necessary only if there was a request for the information—
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> Yes, that was my point.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I accept that that would put some limit on the bureaucracy involved, but we must remember that, in dealing with confidentiality, we may be dealing with only one line in a large document. Some Departments might receive very large numbers of requests, which they would have to monitor and check, and that would produce delays, certainly hitting the 20-day target. Within 20 days, they would have to identify the document and ensure that it was read. Then, if more than a year had elapsed, they would have to write to the individuals who wanted to maintain its confidentiality, wait for a reply and tell the person who wanted the information whether it was available and give the reasons why.
<P>
With the right hon. Gentleman's caveat, the burden might not be so heavy, or not as heavy as I feared. However, it is unnecessary, mainly because common law enables the public authority to make a judgment. I ask him not to press the amendment, not only because it might create such difficulties but, more importantly, because common law already deals with the issue.
<P>
It is not always possible to seek the consent of the private body or individual when considering whether to disclose information that they have supplied. It might not be necessary to seek such consent because it is patently obvious that the information should not be released. Working relations with the private body or individual might be so good that it is possible to know their view and for it to release information without further consultation. It would be bureaucratic to expect the authority to ask for consent that it knew would be given.
<P>
The amendment would require an answer from a private body or individual but, worryingly, does not stipulate a time limit within which it must be given. Consultation might take much longer than 20 days; complying with the amendment might place authorities in breach of obligations under clause 9. Furthermore, the amendment does not provide for the private body or individual failing to respond to the request for consent, and offers no way of enforcing the provision against them.
<P>
If private bodies or individuals decide not to answer, should one conclude that they want the information to remain confidential? One might argue that information should be published unless they have said that it should be confidential, but they may have justifiable reasons for not having responded—they may be incapable of doing so for some reason or we may not have been able to contact them in any prescribed period Therefore, we cannot accept amendment No. 153.
<P>
Amendment No. 154 would exempt information under clause 39 only by virtue of an agreement after the commencement of the Bill if such an agreement were in accordance with the Secretary of State's code of practice under clause 44. Amendment No. 157 provides that the code set out circumstances in which such an agreement might be entered into.
<P>
The amendments would draw a line under duties of confidence arising by agreement made before the commencement of the Bill, and restrict subsequent agreements to circumstances described in the code of practice. They are not desirable because, by restricting the circumstances in which a duty of confidence may arise by agreement to those in the code of practice, they would hamstring public authorities in their negotiations with outside bodies. Their ability to negotiate contracts effectively, reach agreements or tender for services would be undermined. Moreover, such a restriction would result in private bodies and individuals being less likely to pass information to authorities in the first place, because an organisation subject to freedom of information provisions would be more likely to disclose information than a private body. That is exactly the type of effect that the Government want to avoid.
<P>
I should stress to the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that the Government agree that authorities should not enter into agreements unless they are completely justified. That is why the Secretary of State's code of practice will provide guidance on the inclusion of terms on the disclosure of information in public authorities' contracts. The code will advise authorities to ensure as far as possible that, when entering into agreements, information is released in line with the Bill's provisions. That should restrict the circumstances in which they enter into duties of confidence—they should not, as a matter of course, accept that a document will be confidential simply because someone has stamped it so. Confidentiality should not be reached on such a basis. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey), the public authority is quite capable of refusing to accept documents in confidence, and of saying that any documents so given might be subject to the legislation and disclosed.
<P>
The Government do not agree that, as a matter of law, authorities should be so limited. We must give authorities the ability to adapt the code to the circumstances in which they work.
<P>
I can tell the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross that the common law of confidence has a public interest test, so it would be unnecessary to apply clause 13. Information is confidential under common law; having taken into account the public interest as required by common law, we concluded that it should not be subject to the Bill.
<P>
The test differs from the Bill's requirements but, as I have twice noted, it is not higher than them. The test is wide and well established. The court would look at the circumstances and decide whether the confidentiality that would otherwise arise should be negated in the public interest. The court would clearly approach the matter with caution. If the right hon. Gentleman wants detail on the test, I can write to him citing the case law. However, I would like him to be clear that I understand that there is that public interest test, and that I am not equating it directly with the Bill's public interest test.
<P>
The right honourable Gentleman asked whether we should consult on the code of practice in relation to that matter, and we shall consult with the commissioner, as we are required to do.
<P>
Regarding amendment No. 158, I should say that there will be no blanket bans on documents, never mind on groups of documents. As I remarked earlier, a public authority might receive a document stamped confidential and decide not to accept it. It might inform the sender of its decision, and he might say that he wanted only one line to be confidential. The authority might then decide to accept the document on the basis of that line being subject to the laws of confidentiality. We expect the code of practice to prevent public authorities from being complicit in generating a new culture of secrecy opposite to the Bill's intention. Further, we shall ensure that they will not enter an unjustified duty of confidentiality. If they enter such a duty, they should consider their obligation to the individual or organisation to keep confidentiality to the minimum.
<P>
Similar considerations apply to amendment No. 158 as apply to others in the group. It seeks to restrict the circumstances in which a duty of confidence may arise regarding information held by authorities subject to freedom of information rules. It also seeks to draw a line under duties of confidence that arose before the commencement of the Bill, and to restrict the way in which subsequent obligations are entered into.
<P>
First, the amendment would introduce an elaborate procedure whereby individuals or bodies passing information to an authority would have to receive written confirmation that the information would be held in confidence before passing it on. Secondly, it would restrict the circumstances in which such an undertaking could be given to cases in which the authority required the information for its proper working and in which the information would not be supplied without such an undertaking.
<P>
The approach is not workable. First, it requires the authority to form a view about whether to give such confirmation without seeing the information. How is it to determine whether it needs the information for its work without first receiving it? Secondly, there would be a fundamental change to the protection given to third parties without any wider consultation. That would not be right.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, an assumption is made that the person supplying the information has an effective choice whether to do so. In such circumstances, the authority will have no need to confirm that it will hold the information in confidence. It knows that it need make no such concession, as the person concerned has no choice, but has a legal obligation to provide the information and cannot simply require that it be held in confidence. The public authority has a right to the information and will obtain it. The freedom of information laws will apply in the same way as usual.
<P>
The amendment would remove the justifiable protection that the common law of confidence would supply in the relevant cases. Conversely, in other circumstances, it would lead to information being confirmed as held in confidence where otherwise no issue of confidentiality would arise. Since the amendment is based on the assumption that the authority needs the information, private bodies and individuals could see it as an invitation to ask for confirmation that the authority is holding it in confidence, whereas previously they might have made no such request. The result would be more, not fewer, duties of confidence.
<P>
I have considered each amendment in detail—rightly so, given that this is a difficult aspect of the law—and in my view they are intended to place conditions on circumstances in which authorities could rely on clause 39, the exemption relating to confidential information. For the reasons I have given, the Government do not accept them. We agree with the recommendation of the Select Committee on Public Administration that guidance—or, indeed, a code on the practical interpretation of the law of confidence—would be helpful. The Information Commissioner is best able to provide such clear guidance to public authorities, so that they do not bring about a new culture of secrecy, which we all want to avoid.

<P>

<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I begin my response to the Under-Secretary's interesting and careful remarks by pointing out that my three amendments are the second best course. The real requirement is to import a wider public interest test into the category of information that the clause exempts. I was conscious that it was unlikely, at this stage, that that would be accepted, so I attempted a compromise.
<P>
Some of the Under-Secretary's practical objections to what I propose were sustainable; amendment No. 153 does not provide answers to all his questions. However, some of his answers raised almost as many questions, from the point of view of the seeker after information. In particular, his reliance on guidelines, unsupported by legislative authority, to prevent authorities from wrongly entering restrictive agreements that would stop information being made available, offers little in the way of remedy to people who want information if those guidelines are not observed. It is not clear to me that the commissioner would have the right, if the guidelines were wrongly applied or ignored, to override the ruling. I shall study the Under-Secretary's remarks on the subject with some interest.
<P>
The attitude of the Home Office to the issues that we are considering is surprisingly at odds with those of other Departments, which favour greater openness even in contexts where confidentiality issues arise. The hon. Member for Brigg and Goole spoke of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as having particularly offended in this respect in the past, but now at least its approach is altogether more open than that of the Home Office. One has only to think of the Food Standards Agency and the Food Standards Act 1999. Last year, when the Bill was being planned, Parliament enacted provisions of much greater openness, relating to this very issue of confidentiality, than is apparently acceptable to the Home Office. I do not understand that, or why the Under-Secretary has not thought about the language in the Food Standards Act 1999—or perhaps he has, but it is not reflected in the end product.
<P>
The Act allows the Food Standards Agency to publish any information in its possession, whatever its source. As to confidentiality, the power of the agency is restricted, under section 19(4), only by the obligation to consider
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``whether the public interest in the publication of the advice or information in question is outweighed by any considerations of confidentiality attaching to it.''<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is a very much more balanced approach than that in the clause. Difficulty in aligning the common law on confidentiality did not give rise to hesitancy in that instance. The statute has gone further than the common law.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that a more open approach would be appropriate for some agencies or organisations, which should be under an obligation to be more open, and which can afford to be. He will accept that in some spheres there is a need for greater—let us use the word—secrecy. That is particularly true with matters of security. We are creating a broad-based legislative framework for many public authorities. I should hope that some, such as the Food Standards Agency, would adopt a more liberal approach than others that might not be in a position to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> I doubt whether the Bill is taking the process invoked by the Minister a step forward. It is interesting and paradoxical that he raised, without being able to find an answer to the problem that many of us have perceived, when he said that describing a document as confidential in transactions with a public authority could become standard practice, as a way of taking advantage of the exempt information clause. I do not see that the guidelines, lacking any operative effect on which the public could rely, will deal with that. It was their lack of operative effect that prompted me to table amendments Nos. 154 and 157. They seek to give some teeth to the code. I do not claim to have had the last word on their drafting, but their purpose is clear. The Under-Secretary described their subject matter as difficult, and said that he did not want to overrule existing common law procedure. Such overruling would not necessarily be a consequence of widening the categories of public interest beyond those cited in common law cases, which, as I said, are restricted to matters of serious malpractice and evident public harm.
<P>
It should be possible to splice such considerations together in a more modern context and a more modern way. I hope that there will be time during the Bill's passage to find further and better ways of achieving that end. The clause contains a blanket exclusion that applies to a whole category of information, even when the individual who has supplied it has no interests in maintaining its confidentiality. I do not think that the Under-Secretary would deny that, and it should be possible to ensure a proper approach within the mounds of drafting before us.
<P>
I noticed a slight flurry next to the Under-Secretary when I made that remark. Perhaps he was attempting to suggest that if the confidentiality was no longer important to the supplier, that would become clear and the public authority could release the information, notwithstanding its original categorisation. I am trying to ensure that that possibility will at least be tested and that there will not be an instinctive culture of treating documents as confidential tor all time merely because they have been marked as confidential or maintaining such treatment when it is no longer required.
<P>
The Under-Secretary and I have made a number of points, and, with respect, I shall have to study his with care. I am sure that he will consider my remarks.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I should like to make couple of points on whether people will simply stamp documents as confidential. First, I remind the Committee that what is confidential is a question of common law and not merely a matter of whether an item is merely stamped as confidential. Secondly, I should deal with enforcement of the guidance on the code of practice. The commissioner can comment in her report on failure to comply with the code of practice by a public authority, which might create the sort of circumstances to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. She can comment on the organisation in question and name and shame it. Such breach of the guidance could be a matter for judicial review, so the courts could intervene. The protections go further than the right hon. Gentleman seems to believe.
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Maclennan:</B> That was a helpful and useful contribution, which I embrace in the context of my wider hope that we can return to the issues and study them with care. It is not in the Government's interest or in the spirit of the Bill that claims of confidentiality that are either spent or are no longer sustainable block access to information because of bureaucratic practice. I do not think that the category of exemption on the grounds of confidential provision should be easily or automatically entered into or sought for such documents. Many bodies might think that their dialogue with a public authority should automatically be treated, almost ex hypothesi, as confidential because of the climate in which we live and the culture that we have inherited. We are trying to change that culture. I hope that neither the Under-Secretary nor I have reached a final conclusion on that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heath </B>(Somerton and Frome): I beg to move amendment No. 155, in page 22, line 25, leave out subsection (2) and insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) Information is exempt information if it is information—
<P>
(a) which the person from whom it was obtained consistently treats as confidential, and
<P>
(b) the disclosure of which would cause significant financial loss to that person.
<P>
(2A) Information is exempt information if it is information which relates to the financial affairs of the public authority which holds it, and—
<P>
(a) that authority consistently treats it as confidential, and
<P>
(b) its disclosure would cause significant financial loss to the authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We now come to commercial confidence. The Liberal Democrats have some substantial concerns about the drafting of the clause, principally because it is so lacking in definition. The clause also lacks tests to ensure that what is described as a commercial confidence should remain confidential when that status runs contrary to the interests of consumers and the general public. I am indebted to the Consumers Association, which has said that the Government are widely out of kilter with public opinion. It has conducted a survey in which 86 per cent. of the people questioned thought that the public's right to know should outweigh the commercial interests of companies or public authorities. Only 5 per cent. of them disagreed with that view. There is widespread concern that commercial interests should not have a special exemption placing them outside the realm in which the usual rules on disclosure of information apply.
<P>
Exemption of commercial interests is an increasing problem. The number of matters about which consumers have genuine grievances against companies or commercial interests is increasing. Consumers need information if they are to take on what may be substantial vested interests. Although information relating to such interests may be in the hands of a regulator or a public authority, the clause ensures that it may not have to be disclosed as a matter of course.
<P>
There are five principal objections to the clause. First, I should mention the nature of the information dealt with and its source. The Bill covers information derived from any source and contains no sense that detected information is in the ownership of any commercial interest involved. One could ask whether other circumstances might apply, but there are many obvious examples. Public authorities undertaking test regimes or a variety of investigations could discover information about a product or a commercial activity that is prejudicial to commercial interests but which should be released. An authority that wishes to avoid causing embarrassment or damage to a commercial interest with a regional or local significance may be tempted to apply the exemption test. I believe that that approach is incorrect.
<P>
Secondly, the information need not even be confidential; it may have been supplied in confidential terms, but it may also have been supplied to others in a different context. Information that is common knowledge among members of an industry might not be so well known to consumer groups or members of the public. That could be considered exempt.
<P>
Thirdly, the exemption puts the avoidance of commercial prejudice above all other considerations. Companies or authorities that behave badly should be prejudiced. That is a simple argument. I am sure that it is not the Government's intention—it is certainly not in the interests of consumers or the general public—to allow information to remain exempt if it reflects badly on a company. There are many instances in which malpractice is improperly protected by the application of the term commercial confidentiality. I hope that the Bill will prevent that.
<P>
Fourthly, a binding public interest test is absent. It is not hard to imagine circumstances in which the collusion between a public authority and a company invokes the cloak of commercial confidentiality. The test is discretionary and can be used to prevent embarrassment. For example, it could be applied if the disclosure of a commercial business's continuing activity reveals that a regulatory body, which has failed to prevent a harmful situation from arising, is complacent or negligent. Another example is the approval of arms exports. Many hon. Members know that it is sometimes convenient for Ministers and Departments to collude with an arms exporter to avoid publicity on their activities. Indeed the Under-Secretary might refer to relevant material in the Scott report.
<P>
Freedom of information legislation in many other countries includes a public interest test as part of commercial confidentiality exemptions. Irish legislation contains two enforceable public interest tests. The first is a general test in which
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the request''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The second provision requires disclosure where it is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``necessary in order to avoid a serious and imminent danger to the life or health of an individual or to the environment''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That qualifies the general test on commercial confidentiality.
<P>
Finally, the test of prejudice is weak. American freedom of information legislation applies if a disclosure
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is the difference between that and the Government's proposal? First, the clause uses the White Paper's substantial harm test, which we believe is stronger than the prejudice test, although it would be foolish to embark on that debate. Secondly, it applies only when the harm is to a person's competitive position.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> We may cover that when we debate the next amendment, but I cannot resist pointing out to the hon. Gentleman that his wording is the same as that of the code of practice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right. This is not the first time that we have compared the Bill with the code of practice and found that there is a move away from the rigour of the code rather than an improvement on it. I shall support the hon. Gentleman's amendment, when he speaks to it, because it is important to have clear definitions.
<P>
The point about competitive positions is important because it means that where there is a monopoly, near monopoly or oligopoly, there might not be any competitive positions involved, and, therefore, there may be no reason why disclosure should not be made. The requirement is that the harm must be caused to the person who supplied the information. That brings me back to my original point, that there is no test relating to the origin of the information.
<P>
The clause, as drafted, is weaker than provisions in other pieces of British legislation. Many years ago, I had some interest from outside the House in the proceedings under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. That Act contains a provision that companies' pollution data must be entered in public registers, unless to do so would—this is the test:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``prejudice to unreasonable degree the commercial interests of the person concerned.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That use of unreasonableness suggests that, in some cases, some prejudice may be unavoidable or even desirable. It would be interesting to know why the provisions in the Bill are weaker than those contained in the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
<P>
Amendment No. 155 applies only where the person whose commercial interests might be affected is the person who supplies the information. It applies only if the information was confidential to the person and consistently treated as such. In other words, a company that was happy to brief sympathetic journalists, but not happy to share the information with the general public, would not be eligible for exemption. The amendment applies a more rigorous test, that,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``disclosure would cause significant financial loss''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
instead of the considerably vaguer ``prejudice commercial interests''.
<P>
We shall come to a substantive debate on the terms of the definition, which will shed further light on this matter, but, for the moment, let us deal with the basic issues of how the clause will differentiate between that which is genuinely commercially confidential and what the public have in their minds as commercially confidential; between the secret formula of ingredient X, which transforms a product and which should not be put into the hands of competitors and the much wider application for which the clause currently provides, which would allow a whole raft of information to be exempt purely on the grounds that it may not suit a company for the information to be given to the general public.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</B> The Government have always been clear that nothing in the legislation obliges people to keep information secret; clause 76 makes that explicit. Just because a clause enables certain information to be held in confidence, it does not mean that it automatically will be. It is important to emphasise that. The idea that the clause will make public authorities more restrictive than they previously were is nonsense. Indeed, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) did not imply that.
<P>
The Bill is an attempt to strike a balance between the right to know and rights of privacy, confidentiality and efficient government, but that is a difficult balance to strike. Clearly, information given by businesses to public authorities, which may be the Government or other public authorities, may, if it is made public, result in prejudice to the business concerned.
<P>
At The Guardian lecture some months ago I was informed by Stryker Maguire, the American journalist, that 60 per cent. of information coming under the United States freedom of information legislation amounts to the attempt by one company to discover another company's commercial secrets. I inquired about that and it appears to be the case. Companies use freedom of information legislation merely to advance their commercial interests, rather than, as I hope will be the case with us, to enable citizens better to interrogate their public authorities. We need to beware of the possibility of creating a mechanism that will be used merely for commercial purposes. It may sometimes be appropriate to use the regime for that, but we are aiming to improve the citizen's right to know. We should focus on that.
<P>
There is to some extent a conflict between the citizen qua citizen and the citizen as a consumer. I appreciate the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome that information that a consumer might want, to make a judgment in the market, might be commercially confidential, so that its release might damage the commercial advantage of a company. The company might supply the information to a regulator, the state, to enable it to carry out its duties to citizens in general, only if it was treated as commercially confidential. However, that arrangement might mean that the citizen as consumer would not obtain the desired information.
<P>
A problem needs to be faced. It is right for the regulator to have information about the conduct of a company's business, and to hold it confidentially if to release it might damage the business. We should recognise that the company might not provide the information if it would be made public. It is in the interests of the citizen that the regulator's duties can be carried out. The conflict arises because some of the information might be helpful to a consumer, who might want the regulator to provide it to him.
<P>
We have tried to deal with the conflict by means of a prejudice test. Clause 41 is predicated on such a test. The commissioner can test whether the disclosure of the information would cause prejudice, and she can substitute her own view. Clause 13 applies to information that is exempt under clause 41, so that the public interest must be taken into account. The commissioner can issue a recommendation if she disagrees with a decision made by an authority under clause 13.
<P>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was concerned about collusion. The Bill provides for wide powers of investigation by the commissioner and I suspect that it would come to light quickly, because she has investigative powers.
<P>
The amendment would restrict the scope of clause 41(2) to instances in which a person or public authority consistently treated the relevant information as confidential and in which its disclosure would result in significant—whatever that means—financial loss. It is unclear and restrictive. For example, a public authority such as the Department of Trade and Industry may undertake an analysis of a company that wishes to participate in a trade fair. That is not information that was obtained from the company itself, so it does not fall within the first limb of the amendment and its disclosure would not cause financial loss to the authority, so it does not fall within the second limb of the amendment. Yet disclosure of that information could prejudice the commercial interests of the company and, indeed, could cause significant financial loss to it; whatever that means. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome would have to take it into account that the information might be used by a commercial competitor and that its disclosure might substantially damage the person who disclosed the information; but the amendment would not cover such a situation.
<P>
Freedom of information is not about prejudicing the commercial interests of companies or enabling one company to find out another's trade secrets. There is a free flow of information between public authorities and companies which it is in the public interest—the interests of citizens—to maintain, because it enables the state as a regulator to carry out its duties and to receive information which it would not otherwise receive from companies. Therefore, an exemption on the grounds of prejudice to the commercial interests of companies or another person is essential.
<P>
Of course, there will be occasions when the public interest means that information that might prejudice one person's commercial interest should be disclosed, for example, on health and safety grounds. However, clause 13 exists for that purpose and the test proposed in the hon. Gentleman's amendment is not workable. There is already a prejudice test in clause 13, which enables us to strike the proper balance between the interests of the public as consumers and their interests as citizens who want business properly regulated. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> I can understand, to a degree, the Minister's criticism of the precise terms of my amendment in respect of significant loss, but I do not understand why he thinks that the clause as drafted does not provide too wide and too easy a test, first, because it does not define a trade secret and, secondly, because of the simple concept that prejudicing commercial interest can range from the trivial to the extreme. There is no test of the seriousness of any harm, or potential harm, that might be caused to the competitive position of a company. The amendment is not impractical: I adduced examples from other countries' legislation. It is not impractical to have provisions that make it clear that there is a limit to the definition of prejudice, so that the authority which is applying the test has a clear view of exactly the balance to which the Under-Secretary refers.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> The hon. Gentleman will be aware of our previous discussions on the meaning of the words ``prejudice'' and ``harm'', which we concluded were, for substantial purposes, equivalent. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of the way in which ``prejudice'' is broadly construed as being real, actual or of substance. There are several descriptions of the meaning of words that overcome his objection that the word ``prejudice'' in the proposal would be something flimsy or inadequate. The courts will have to interpret it, and I do not want to put too much gloss on the wording in the Bill, but, throughout our proceedings, we have considered the word ``prejudice'' in detail. The courts have a fair amount of guidance on the meaning that we attach to it.

<P>

<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Yes, I accept that once the proposal has reached the court and is before a judge, a proper interpretation will be placed on ``prejudice''. But in drafting a Bill of this kind, we must give the clearest possible indication to the lay person who applies the law what it is intended to mean. In this instance, there are clearly problems about how to define prejudice to a commercial interest. Is the mere fact that the mythical man on the Clapham omnibus is deterred from buying a product, or looks on a product less favourably, prejudice? Is that what the public authority should be applying as its test of whether material is exempt information?
<P>
Earlier, we heard that there is a much stronger test in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The test is whether the commercial interests of a person are affected ``to an unreasonable degree''. When the public interest is involved, the predisposition is to disclosure, except when it is clear that, by so doing, it will cause substantial harm—I use that term again, although the Minister assures us that it is no different from prejudice—to the commercial interests involved. That is not clear in the clause as drafted.
<P>
<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> I do not want to prolong our debate unnecessarily, but the hon. Gentleman used the phrase in response to an intervention from the hon. Member for Ryedale about the code. Of course, the current code of practice does not use the phrase ``substantial harm'', it merely uses the word ``harm''. I quote exemption 13, which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``Information including commercial confidences, trade secrets or intellectual property whose unwarranted disclosure would harm the competitive position of a third party.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We say that, effectively, the words ``harm'' and ``prejudice'' are more or less the same, therefore there is no substantial difference in the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> There was an elision of the words ``competitive position'', which relate to my point. There is no great meeting of minds on the matter and I do not think that I shall persuade the Minister that what I am saying is right, nor will he persuade me. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 22, line 30, at end insert—
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(4) In this section ``trade secret'' means any confidential trade information which if disclosed to a competitor would cause harm to its owner'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I begin by making it clear that the Conservative party supports the need for a commercial interest exemption. The Parliamentary Secretary expresses surprise. I listened to the previous exchange with interest and although I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, that is our view.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heath:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Greenway:</B> The hon. Gentleman may be intervening at 1 o'clock, so I encourage him to wait until later.
<P>
The key matter for us, which should be a key matter for the Committee, is whether the clause as drafted is acceptable, and meets what is required. Before the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome tried to intervene I was about to say that there was an important third-party commercial competency exemption in the code which had an important harm test—
