<H4><center>(Morning)</center></H4>

Bill</a></center></H3>
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before we start, I should explain that the Minister of State, Home Office is replying to a debate in Westminster Hall and will be here as soon as possible. The Committee might also like to know that today is the birthday of the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."].
<H4><center>Schedule 7</center></H4>
<H4><center>Detention</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed [27 January], That this schedule, as amended, be the Seventh schedule to the Bill.
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ken Maginnis </B>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone): Before I begin, I express my sympathy to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) in relation to the injury to his hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones) and the death of his councillor colleague at the weekend. That is a sad reminder that violence is something that we can meet at any time on any day.
<P>
In discussing the schedule, it is appropriate--with the Committee's and your tolerance, Mr. Malins--for me to deal with one of my concerns about the nature of the Bill. Paragraph 29 shows that the Government seek to absolve themselves of responsibility for decisions on extended periods of detention, and to put that responsibility on to the judiciary. Some may consider that to be an advance, but it means that when the police arrest somebody and then decide that they want to detain him beyond the normal period, the matter is passed over to the judiciary. By making the change, the Executive have absolved themselves of direct responsibility. That is the weakness in the Bill as a whole.
<P>
The Bill is far too all-embracing, and I will return to that point. More than that, however, it allows the Executive, who have the primary responsibility for dealing with terrorism within our society, to abdicate--to devolve their responsibility to others. Where the police seek further detention and the judiciary consider the matter, the Executive have distanced themselves from their responsibility. Hence they have created a situation in which what takes place is unlikely to be understood on a case-by-case basis by those with the responsibility.
<P>
To return to my original point, the whole Bill begins to fall down in so far as it is too all-embracing. By trying to meld the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1998 and by adding little bits around the periphery, we have almost lost the objective of anti-terrorism legislation. We have heard examples of how people involved in serious antisocial activity could be prosecuted under anti-terrorism legislation, and that danger becomes most obvious in schedule 7.
<P>
Excuse me, Mr Malins, I do not know whether it is the Room or me, but I find it rather warm.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Mr. Malins, there are times when it is congenial to ask a fellow to give way. When the hon, Gentleman recovers his thoughts, he may return to his point about the Room being rather stifling. Obviously, any decision is a matter for you, although I prefer a warm Room to a cold one. You are in charge of our proceedings, but may I presume to say that if anybody has a strong view, he should say so now.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am always relaxed about hon. Members removing their jackets. If there is a general feeling in the Committee that it is too warm, we may lower the temperature a little. I take hon. Members' nods as assent to the proposition that it is quite warm. Perhaps those in the know can lower the temperature.
<P>
<B>Mr. Maginnis:</B> Thank you, Mr. Malins. I am sorry, but I began to feel quite ill, and I am grateful for that short respite.
<P>
The point that I was trying to make, and I apologise for my hesitancy, was that the Executive have primary responsibility for ensuring that we have legislation to protect society and its institutions from violent organisations and people who want to overthrow them. A Bill to deal with international terrorism should have been introduced separately, Sadly, that did not happen. If we want to ensure that the Government meet their responsibility, they must be involved in every aspect and must not seek to pass on total responsibility to the police and the judiciary through legislation such as the Bill. Government must have hands-on involvement. The Minister will recognise that in Northern Ireland, it has been exceedingly difficult to deal with everything that terrorism involves, particularly the propaganda.
<P>
If the Government are not inextricably involved in the administration of terrorism legislation, they can be separated from the interests of the judiciary and the police.
<P>
That presents us with a problem, in so far as it is a fundamental rule of policing that the members of a constabulary are not involved in politics. That means that, in many respects, they cannot defend themselves when they become the subject of a political campaign. Therefore, we have often seen the police bending with what the Chief Constable or the senior command as a whole deems to be the will, and prejudice, of society at any particular time. It is the Executive's responsibility to defend our police against that, which is possible only when the Executive are inextricably linked to the process, not above or beyond it.
<P>
I am not a lawyer, but I understand that when a law is made and required to be implemented through the courts, what is generally referred to as case law builds up. In that instance, we need legal professional expertise. However, case law does not normally apply in the context of terrorism, Each terrorist organisation adapts to exploit whatever laws are put in place to impede it, so the idea that we will build up case law in connection with detention is not realistic. Each detention or extension of detention must be treated individually. Therefore, responsibility should rest with the Executive and not be passed on to the judiciary.
<P>
I can understand that the Government want to ensure that there is every form of check and balance in such sensitive legislation. However, in an endeavour to achieve those checks and balances, the Bill allows them to evade a responsibility that should lie with the Executive.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes </B>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey): I thank the hon. Gentleman for his words about the incident in Cheltenham on Friday. They are much appreciated. We are grateful for comments and support from colleagues throughout the House. The councillor could have belonged to any of our parties. He was clearly recognised as someone who did his job extremely well. He was killed in the course of doing a job that we would expect many of our colleagues to do with us. We all stand with them. My colleagues and I believe that we have a duty to all those who with us seek elected office.
<P>
There is a postscript, which in a way the hon. Gentleman touched on. I am sure that we all agree that we should not give ourselves advantages that we do not give to others who are in public service. We choose to seek elected office, but many other people are employed as servants of the public and they must be protected as much as we are. I am grateful for thoughts along those lines. No doubt there will be occasions for the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) and his colleagues and the Minister and his colleagues to reflect further on whether we as a Parliament want to do any more than is done at the moment.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We are debating an important schedule. I am glad that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) has now recovered--it was certainly very warm in here when we began. We will all be better for a slightly cooler atmosphere. I have a few questions regarding the schedule as a whole, but before I raise them, I want to say something to the Minister because this is the first opportunity that I have had.
<P>
I was gently chided last week for a throwaway comment in which I suggested, absolutely wrongly, that the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office was junior to his colleague, the Minister of State, Home Office, who is currently in Westminster Hall. It was wrong of me and I apologise publicly to the Minister. He is a member of the Privy Council, which is a privilege that is given to few of us. His hon. Friend would not mind me saying this--indeed, I would have said it even if he had been here.
<P>
Now that I have put myself back in relative favour with the Minister, I shall move on. Schedule 7 raises several major issues. As the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone pointed out, the system that the Government seek to provide moves away from the general detention provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. In his inquiry, Lord Lloyd examined the issue at some length. Perhaps I may summarise his conclusions, which are in chapter 9 of his report, on detention. He recommended that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the police should retain the power to detain terrorist suspects for a maximum of 48 hours in right of arrest. If a further period of detention is required in any case they should seek judicial authorisation to extend the period of detention for up to two days, making four days in all."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
 Effectively, therefore, he came to two conclusions. First, the power to extend should be granted only on judicial authority and secondly, the maximum length of detention should be four days.
<P>
His other recommendations--colleagues will have had a chance to examine his arguments--were, first, that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "applications for extension of detention...should be heard...by the Chief Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
in England and similarly placed judicial authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Secondly, in relation to access to a solicitor--an issue that crops up in this schedule--Lord Lloyd states at paragraph 9.30
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "Once a lasting peace been established, however, the reason for maintaining a different regime in Northern Ireland will fall away. I therefore recommend that the provisions concerning access to solicitors and notification of third parties in Northern Ireland be brought into line with those already applying to terrorist suspects in Great Britain."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He made similar comments about bringing into the same system interviews, tape recording, fingerprinting and samples, namely, that post provisions should apply. His conclusion in paragraph 9.54 was
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Accordingly, I conclude that the new legislation need not prescribe a special regime for supervision of detention of terrorist suspects."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is interesting that the Government's response was to say that they would neither follow Lord Lloyd--they have not--nor justify the reason for the extended period. They conceded the point about judicial review, but did not make out an overwhelming argument for the extension of time point. This is dealt with in paragraphs 8.20 to 8.24 of the consultation paper Cmnd 4178.
<P>
I remind colleagues of the Government's comments in paragraphs 8.21 and 8.22 of their consultation paper:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"While Lord Lloyd acknowledges that there have been occasions on which the police might have found it more difficult to bring charges had they not been able to detain the suspect for longer than 4 days, he suggests that, once there is a lasting peace in Northern Ireland, it ought to be possible to reduce the maximum period for which a suspect could be detained under the new legislation for a total of 4 days--i.e. 2 days on the authority of the police plus two days with judicial authorisation before charge or release. His views may well have been influenced by the fact that the practice has been that extensions in international terrorist cases have not exceeded a total of 4 days. The Government recognises that in international cases detainees have either been released, charged or the decision taken to deport them within the 4-day period."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I pause there. The Government confirm there that the evidence to date is that four days has been the period at which decisions have been made. However, they state that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there can be no guarantee that this period will always be sufficient, particularly given the Government's intention to introduce new arrangements for the granting of extensions of detention, as set out above."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That was a non sequitur. The Government, for a reason not justified anywhere, have said that there can be no guarantee about this period. Of course there cannot be, but there is no evidence that that period has not been sufficient. It seems to me that there is a burden on the Government to argue the case for change, especially as the person whom they asked to produce a report argued that there should not be a change, and justified his argument.
<P>
The Government then make a trite point:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The attendance of a detainee at an oral hearing before a judicial authority will inevitably reduce the time available to the police for making further inquiries and questioning him about the results."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 8.23 then lists the sorts of reasons for extension of detention, which in a way are self-evident. They state that inquiries can be time-consuming, particularly if more than one person has been arrested, and conclude:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Terrorists, moreover, are increasingly trained to resist interrogation and often refuse to answer questions or otherwise co-operate with the police inquiries."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The burden is on the Government to make the case. There have been wide representations in favour of an extension beyond the PACE powers unless there is a very good case to the contrary. If the Government are praying in aid, as they have done, the fact that in terrorist cases so far--not just Northern Ireland cases--the practice has been sufficient, and if there is to be a judicial review power to extend, I hope that Ministers will reconsider the extended power of detention that the schedule provides.
<P>
The Government certainly need to make the case. They must do more than simply say that they may need more time. The argument that, in theory, terrorists are becoming better trained and more able to resist, and are more likely to be able to resist interrogation for four days than for seven days seems to need clear evidence to bear it out. It is self-evident that someone can be trained to resist answering for a certain time. One could argue for 10 days, 12 days or 14 days. There is no magic in a certain number of days. I know of no psychological evidence that people cannot be trained to stay silent for more than a certain amount of time. The Government need to come up with a different argument for the schedule. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone made a linked but different point, about where the authority should reside. I would like to register that point and come back to it later when we debate whether the authority to grant excessive powers should reside with the Secretary of State, a judicial authority, or another authority.
<P>
May I put it to the Government that the right to consult a solicitor should be given to all people in all circumstances? A person who does not have access to a solicitor is more likely to say something than a person who has access to a solicitor, who will advise him to stay silent. But under some clauses in the Bill staying silent will add weight to the guilty side of the scales. It is worrying that we are moving away in legislation from the presumption that everyone is entitled to be silent towards an ability of the courts to draw inferences from people's silence.
<P>
Again, if the Government argue that there should be a different right of access to a solicitor in these provisions, the burden is on them to show more than the simple reason that it may be a disadvantage to talk to a lawyer. By definition, one could argue the case the other way. Here are offences that carry particular penalties because they are defined as terrorist offences. Given the wide definition of terrorism that we debated on clause 1, it could encompass quite a few people. The Government must say much more about how they can justify the extended powers to deprive people of solicitors and where their support comes from, apart from the law enforcement agencies who clearly have an interest.
<P>
My next point is specifically Northern Irish. One of the themes of Lord Lloyd's report is that he would understand certain powers being held until peace is restored in Northern Ireland. He therefore makes the case that a particular regime is not required for the generality of terrorism. It is required only, as in part VII of the Bill, for the conditions in Northern Ireland until peace is achieved. It would be helpful if the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, could confirm that the Government intend that those provisions of the Bill that are not in part VII and do not cover the transitional period, but which contain a derogation from the PACE rules or from other normal rules, will be brought back to the norm when peace is achieved in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Excessive powers that go beyond what Lord Lloyd proposed in other parts of the Bill were intended to be only for a limited period. The problem is that the Bill does not provide for that. It provides that they will become part of the Act and, as I understand it, there is no separate renewable or time-limited provision. It would be possible later to introduce a time limit for some of the provisions, just as part VII has a time limitation.
<P>
My last question is about the places in which people are currently detained in Northern Ireland. My understanding is that the Patten report, the United Nations human rights committee and the independent commissioner for the holding centres, Louis Blom-Cooper, have all recommended that the holding centres currently used for those detained under the PTA in Northern Ireland should be closed immediately. I understand that there has been one decision about one holding centre at Castlereagh. It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that and tell us when it will be closed.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I understand that two other holding centres are currently in operation for holding people under the PTA. I have heard nothing about them. I am not aware that any announcements have been made but I may have missed them. I should be grateful to know first whether there are just two others and whether the Government now accept the recommendation of all those bodies. By the time the legislation becomes an Act will the provisions for the detention of people under emergency powers in Northern Ireland be the same as in the rest of the United Kingdom?
The really important point, and it is a parity point, is that because one of the Govemment's purposes in the Bill is to provide a UK-wide context--although they want to hold on to the carry-over provision under the part VII--after the welcome abolition of exclusion orders on Second Reading, the sort of places where people are detained for alleged terrorist offences should be the same in each of the four countries of the UK. I hope that the Minister can tell us that the other two holding centres will close before the Bill reaches the statute book so that people can be held in similar circumstances wherever they are in the UK. I hope that I have not forgotten anything. It would be helpful to have both the answers on the PACE special measures as well as the other matters raised by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and others on Thursday.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office </B>(Mr. Adam Ingram): First, I apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke). He is involved with other parliamentary business elsewhere. He hopes to appear soon. I hope that he will, not only because it is my birthday and I want to rest, but because we would benefit from his contributions on this part of the Bill. May I also echo the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone about our colleague the hon. Member for Cheltenham who was injured in that attack in which a Liberal councillor lost his life? Those were terrible acts and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey made his point clearly. We must return to the matter, but not in this Committee, as he recognised. We will have to reflect on it more widely.
<P>
We have to refer back to our previous sitting for this debate, because several contributions were made then. We have had an in-depth discussion, not only on the amendments but in this stand part debate. I shall try to deal with the issues in the order in which they were raised, although there is some overlap.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) raised a number of points. His first concerned audio recording. As he noted, audio recording has been a welcome protection in non-terrorist interviews for some time. He also noted that in the past there have been particular concerns about the protection of information in terrorist crimes. That is a pertinent point. Although there is no statutory requirement to do so, terrorist interviews have been taped for several years, and since spring last year the audio taping of terrorist interviews in Northern Ireland has been mandatory. Indeed, in the early days of the present Government, I put through the legislation to facilitate that process. To the credit of the RUC and its Chief Constable, they embarked on that approach.
<P>
Like Lord Lloyd, the Government believe that the advantages of a statutory UK-wide requirement to tape interviews outweigh any disadvantages. We have taken the police's views into account, as it affords protection to them and not only to those suspected of terrorist crimes. The practice helps to show that the police have acted properly at all times in their conduct of interviews. As I said, the practice of audio recording was implemented in advance of its becoming a statutory requirement in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury and others asked about judicial extensions of detention. It is right to examine the issue. I may be the only member of the Committee--though perhaps the right hon. Member for Penrith and the Border (Mr. Maclean) was involved when he served in the Home Office--who has had to decide whether applications for judicial extensions should be granted. I therefore bring some experience to the debate. A robust mechanism is in place to ensure maximum protection for all aspects of the system. There was some criticism, however, and a detailed examination followed into how best to proceed with the provision. That involved much discussion with the judiciary.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey asked about the relationship between the judiciary and the Executive. Those who have examined the matter clearly concluded that it is better to remove the power of decision from a Minister and place responsibility on the judiciary. Having a separation of responsibilities is right. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone suggested that that was running away from responsibility, but I disagree. Ministers have a close working relationship with the whole panoply of the security forces, of which the police are an important part. I speak from a Northern Ireland perspective, but it applies UK-wide. However, we are not judges. Even those Ministers who are legally trained should operate as politicians in a political rather than a legal framework--even though quasi-judicial considerations sometimes have to be brought into play.
<P>
Robust mechanisms are in place to ensure that the Minister is properly advised and has a night to question, to disagree, to say "I am not satisfied" and to request further information. However, political judgments may be brought into play at all times. It is hard for politicians not to operate as politicians. We must be realistic about that. As to the protections within the system, transferring matters to ajudicial process helps everyone--suspects about to be interviewed and those carrying out the interviews. We are not running away, but clarifying and putting precise mechanisms in place. Of course, that brings that aspect of the law into line with ordinary criminal law, which is to be welcomed.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border spoke about a radical intervention in the debate about video recording. I am not sure whether he used the word "radical"--I shall have to check in Hansard. The right hon. Gentleman has a quizzical look on his face; he obviously does not see himself as a radical. However, he spoke about pushing the system into introducing an important aspect in the environment in which interviews are conducted. He admitted that it was difficult to take that to its logical conclusion.
<P>
Clearly, there are arguments--which the right hon. Gentleman rehearsed--for not being comfortable with that position, but provision for video recording in Northern Ireland was made in an amendment to the 1996 EPA and was implemented by the RUC. All evidence points to its being successful. It provides police officers 207 208 with the comfort of knowing that how they conduct interviews is being visually recorded. It must also offer comfort to those who are interviewed.
<P>
Video recording may well be radical, but is certainly successful in relation to Northern Irish matters. Having witnessed it working, I can say that it is a significant step forward.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am sympathetic to the proposition made by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. On Friday, I talked to a senior police officer in Wales who told me that his new police station records and videos everything. Everyone there says that it saves them a lot of time. The police are happy with the arrangement, as are people in the cells and those representing them.
<P>
Is a similar arrangement intended for the whole of the United Kingdom? My reading of the Government's consultation paper suggests that Scotland does not have a recording arrangement. There should be common standards under a single UK-wide measure, otherwise there may be arguments about unfairness between Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Clearly, we want to reflect on matters raised by the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border. There are varying opinions about how such recordings are to be used as evidence. We must find a way of resolving that. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is night about Scotland, where audio recording may be used but does not take place as a matter of course, as it does in England and Wales. It is mandatory, of course, in Northern Ireland.
<P>
Clearly, we must take account of such matters. When a case is proved and a substantial step is made that comforts everyone involved in the process and adds to the quality of decision making, we must ensure that we convince everyone of that. However, I cannot say that there is an automatic progression from the current position to a future one when such an arrangement will take place. We must reflect on that and understand the benefits arising from the systems that are in place. My personal experience is that video recording seems to give comfort to everyone in the system.
<P>
There was resistance from the police to introducing such a measure. That is not a criticism of the police, who always operate carefully to ensure their prime motive of bringing people to justice. That is especially true when they are dealing with terrorists. They must be given space in relation to how they make judgments and deliver the matter. Their experience must be taken into account. However, such recording has been accepted by police in Northern Ireland.
<P>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone criticised the Bill and said that it was too all-embracing. He did not, however, make too much of that argument. We debated that matter when we discussed the purposes of the Bill in relation to clause 1. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point of view. The Bill is a progressive and helpful development in how we deal with the Irish terrorist threat, the international terrorist threat and any potential growth in other domestic terrorist threats. We must have UK-wide legislation, ensure that is as comprehensive as possible and draw primarily from our experience in tackling Irish terrorism. Therefore, I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's criticisms. Perhaps, after reflection, he will come to a different view; if not, I am sure that he will tell me directly, as he always does, that he still does not agree with me.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey raised Lord Lloyd's recommendation on extending detention to no more than four days. We have already had a debate on the specifics of that on the back of an amendment that was tabled by the hon. Gentleman. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office made clear, the Government continue to believe that seven days is needed, but it will be, as now, a rare occurrence. It is a question of balance and flexibility. In one sense it is easier for those from the human rights and civil liberties community and, indeed, for politicians--they are all concerned about such issues--to put the period under question at all times, but I make this plea. The people who have to bring terrorists to justice are the police in the first instance. They must obtain the evidence, bring in people for questioning and build up their information. They believe that the opportunity to extend the period of detention is important, notwithstanding what Lord Lloyd said. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that the Government should prove that terrorists are better trained and becoming more capable of dealing with police interviewing techniques and whatever else, but it is hard for someone who is neither a police officer nor a lawyer to prove that, other than by listening to what the police say about the quality of the people whom they bring in for questioning and the fact that they find it difficult to bring people to justice.
<P>
Off the top of my head--I can provide more precise details--the clear-up rate in Northern Ireland for Republican terrorism is only abourt 20 per cent. Considering the large number of Republican terrorist crimes that have been committed over the past 30 years, that is a very low rate. The clear-up rate for Loyalist-related terrorist crimes--of which there are about half as many as Republican terrorist crimes--is about 40 per cent. The judgment of the police, from their dealings with different groups, is that members of Republican terrorist groups are very intelligent and well trained with a clear sense of purpose. They know every device open to them to protect their interests. Of course, in law anyone who is brought in for questioning has that right.
<P>
I am sure, however, that we would all prefer to hear of a 100 per cent. clear-up rate for both Republican and Loyalist terrorist crimes. The difficulty is with the capacity of individuals within those groups to learn and adapt to the way in which the law operates and the way in which the police operate within its confines. It makes the job of the police very difficult and thus makes it difficult for all of us to be able to say in the Northern Ireland context that peace is there. Even with the substantial progress that has been made, terrorism is still there, in terms of a threat from dissidents or latent threats from other groups. We must take all that into account when making a judgment on how best to approach this issue. It is a question of balance.
<P>
It may be an easy point to make, but if someone was let off the hook because the police could not get an extension beyond the period recommended by Lord Lloyd, we would all lose out, If only one person is brought to justice as a consequence of this extension provision, surely this is a price worth paying. It has to be kept under constant review, and statistics are available to show how often it is invoked. Let us stay with the example of the power being used to bring a terrorist to justice, which we would all welcome.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Just two things. First, if experience in Northern Ireland justifies going further than Lord Lloyd suggests, where does the choice of additional just period--24 hours, for example--come from? Is there any evidence that any particular period is better than any other? Secondly, if the Government are going to keep these exceptional powers under review, would it not be better to do so under a Northern Ireland transitional arrangements type of provision, or to introduce regulations, which could be amended more easily than primary legislation? That might provide the Government with an opportunity to change this part of the Bill without having to introduce new legislation. The Minister may want to provide a considered rather than an immediate reply.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I would rather provide a considered reply. We discussed earlier the means by which the legislation can be reviewed. A new clause has been tabled and I understand that the hon. Gentleman is aware of it. We may return to specific aspects of the review and consider further amendments later. It is more appropriate to deal in depth with the review aspects of the Bill and how to make it flexible and responsive.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also asked about transitional and temporary arrangements, which are dealt with in part VII. We shall reach that stage in the near future. This particular aspect of the Bill is annually renewable and has a life of only five years. If, at the end of that period, there is still a continuing requirement, the Government will have to introduce further primary legislation to take it forward. The views of independent assessors are taken into account and various amendments have already been considered. We debated earlier sections 35 and 50 of the EPA in relation to the wearing of hoods and explosives factories.
<P>
The best judgment of everyone in the process is relevant, including that of those who comment on the legislation, those who have to apply it--primarily the police--the judiciary, others who have to assess its efficacy and Ministers who have to sit in judgment but who also need to show flexibility and take the European convention on human rights into account.
<P>
On the question raised by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey about rights inferior to those enjoyed under the PACE regulations, we can defer rights of access under PACE generally for up to 36 hours. The departure in the Bill is to extend them to 48 hours. That recognises the slow pace at which terrorist interviews go. We need to listen to those who conduct such interviews. Neither I nor any other member of the Committee has direct experience of them, so we have to accept the judgment, albeit under close scrutiny, of those who conduct them--the police, who tell us how difficult it is.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey wondered whether terrorists were becoming cleverer and getting a better understanding of what was going on, or sharper on the ground in their training of their people. The answer is yes. I tried to prove that by referring to the clear-up rates, but it is difficult to do so conclusively without listening to the specialists on the ground who interview terrorist suspects on a one-to-one basis. It is difficult even with the best intelligence. The specialists may know that a person has carried out a particular act, but it may be difficult to take an evidential approach even if they know that someone is guilty of the crimes for which they are being interviewed. Our judgment is therefore based on the best evidence, and, again, it is a question of balance.
<P>
If all this brings to justice someone who has carried out some terrible act, all of us will be grateful. That may not happen, but if it does, tomorrow or the next day, we shall benefit. We have to defeat the terrorist threat through this process, and the best shot in our armoury is the protection of law and defeating these people through the due process of law. Those who have that responsibility on our behalf should be given the best tools to bring such people to justice--within the confines of the human rights aspects, to which obviously we must conform--and we must have the best and most robust judgment of those who examine legislative aspects of the process. We take all those arguments into account when reaching our conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I will be grateful if the Minister can give the Committee an answer to the question about holding centres before he sits down.
<P>
On the issue of access to solicitors, I put two points to the Minister. First, the same argument applies in any form of the legal process. He will no doubt have had experience--I certainly have--of people being arrested for the most serious crimes, but all the questioning in the world or the trial does not get an admission out of them. That does not mean, as with a certain doctor yesterday, that ultimately it is not clear to the jury that they are guilty. The length of time does not necessarily matter; I wonder whether, in securing convictions and a higher clear-up rate, it is not just as important to ensure that people feel able to give evidence. Protecting witnesses and dealing with the accused seem to me to be as central to the criminal justice process in Northern Ireland as anywhere else. If people feel that they can give evidence in safety, convictions are much more likely to result; it is not just a matter of a defendant's evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman's latter point. I will come to the issue of holding centres shortly.
<P>
Our experience in Northern Ireland is that there are many reasons for the difficulties in bringing people to justice that would not necessarily apply elsewhere in the United Kingdom, in the sense that the terrorists would terrorise people who live in their own communities. Who knows? Active terrorist groups tend to intimidate and terrorise their own communities as well--not just those whom they oppose.
<P>
We can put in place many protection systems to give maximum security to those who wish to give evidence; but the experience in Northern Ireland, which is effectively a village, shows that it is hard to move from Belfast to Derry or from Ballycastle to elsewhere in the south and take on a new identity, whatever protection is given. Such people usually have to leave Northern Ireland, although many do not want to do so, because their extended families are there. This experience applies not only to the public but to the whole panoply of the state apparatus. Police and prison officers are intimidated out of their homes. Sometimes a whole family has to be moved lock, stock and barrel within 24 hours. One can imagine the trauma for such families. All these mechanisms are put in place and it is why anonymity is such an important issue when members of the security forces give evidence in terrorist cases that are heard in Northern Ireland. It is not an easy issue to deal with, even with all those assurances and protections in place.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
We can only do our best to encourage everyone to co-operate with the system, but there are distinct difficulties in Northern Ireland that may not apply to terrorist threats in other parts of the UK from international groups or other domestic groups. Who knows how that will evolve and develop? Those protections were put in place because of that experience. They must be critically examined at all times and must always be given due consideration by the wide range of interests that may want to comment on them. Everyone who does so must take into account all the factors and not just come at it from one direction. The wide range of complexities that can apply must be considered.
<P>
On the point about the holding centres, Castlereagh has closed. The future of the other two holding centres referred to in the recently published paper on the normalisation of the security environment in Northern Ireland will be subject to the judgment of the Chief Constable. Knowing that there is a political pressure for them to close, he must judge how best he can operate on the ground to tackle the terrorist threat that is out there. Their closure is envisaged as we move, hopefully, into a more normal environment in Northern Ireland.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am grateful for the Minister's specific answers on the last point. I have registered my concerns about the schedule. I do not propose to force a Division, although I cannot support every element of it. Of course there must be a power of detention; I do not argue about that. The Minister knows our reservations. Rather than forcing Divisions all the time, it is sometimes adequate merely to register the point. There are plenty of opportunities in the remaining months up and down these Corridors to return to these matters.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 7, as amended, agreed to.

Clause 40 ordered to standpart of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 41</center></H4>
<H4><center>Search of persons</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Hunter </B>(Basingstoke): I draw the Minister's attention to subsection (1), which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A constable may stop and search a person whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and ask him to glance half a line forward to clause 42 (2)? Why is clause 41(1) necessary in the light of clause 42(2)? Why is the requirement for a constable to wear a uniform present in clause 42(2) but not in clause 41(1)?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> It is a technical point. I will take advice on whether there is a technical reason for it. Clause 41 allows a police officer to stop and search anyone whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist, whether or not he arrests him under clause 39, to see whether that person has anything that may constitute evidence that he is a terrorist. Clearly, it is sensible for the police to have such a power in relation to people they have arrested. The hon. Gentleman would not argue against that. That power is available under section 32 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 for evidence "relating to an offence". As we have already discussed, the arrest power is not predicated to a link with a specific arrest, so it is consistent that the search power should also not be so linked. The power in the clause when a person has not been arrested parallels the PTA. There is therefore a clear relationship.
<P>
The underlying purpose of the clause is to enable a search to be undertaken of a person we believe is a terrorist in a place and at a time when authorisation is not in force. That search might on occasions be undertaken by an officer who is not in uniform. The power in clause 42(2) exists because clause 42 relates to vehicles and covers those who are going about their normal business. There is a comfort zone in recognising that the constable in uniform has authority. People may be less comfortable when someone comes up in plain clothes and simply says, "I am a police officer and I am exercising my powers." There is a distinction between clause 41 and clause 42 because of the relationship of the police office to the exercise of the duties under those clauses.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> I appreciate what the Minister has said. I certainly do not seek to be destructive. I very much agree that the police should have the power to search, but I am not wholly convinced by what the Minister has said. I wonder whether he will give the matter further thought and return to it at a later stage. As I understand it, clause 41(1) fully covers the powers in clause 42(2) and therefore renders it redundant. I quite agree that clause 41(1) does not relate to vehicles and so 42(1) is therefore necessary, but I should like the Minister to consider whether there is some redundancy in the coexistence of the two subsections.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> Let me try to explain this further. Clause 41(1) deals with someone who is a suspected terrorist, whereas clause 42(2) does not. The ways in which police officers go about their business differ in those circumstances. There is a difference between the way in which those clauses apply: one refers to a suspected terrorist and the other to the powers that can be exercised where a suspicion may apply. Clearly, if the hon. Gentleman's view has merit, we are duty bound to give it consideration.
<P>
My advice is that clear powers are set out in clauses 41 and 42 and they are defined because of the different sets of circumstances that apply. The hon. Gentleman would be right to say that clause 41(1) would apply to certain circumstances set out in clause 42, but not all the time. If there is a redundancy in the legislation, we are always honour bound to consider it. My best advice is that these are not redundant clauses: each sets out clear responsibilities for the police officers carrying out their duties in respect of suspected terrorists under clause 41 (1) and in relation to suspicion about passengers under clause 42.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> With your permission, Mr Malins, I should like to say a few words about reasonable suspicion. I always fasten my seatbelt when I see "reasonable suspicion", because it can be quite difficult to justify that after the event. The paradox is that, in certain circumstances, there is no need to inquire whether the suspicion was reasonable because of what later happens.
<P>
Perhaps I may use the analogy of breathalyser legislation. It is not normally linked with such sensitive or grave matters, but we all know that someone at the wheel of a motor car who has drunk excess alcohol is capable of inflicting fatality. You will know better than I, Mr. Malins, that there are only three circumstances in which a police officer can ask a motorist to give a sample. The first is if the motorist has been involved in an accident, the second is if he has committed a moving traffic offence and the third is if he has given reasonable suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol. Thus, the concept of reasonable suspicion occurs in another area of English law. In breathalyser cases, too, subsequent events frequently eliminate any examination of whether the officer had reasonable grounds for suspicion; the question becomes nugatory.
<P>
I am not even sure that I seek a reply from the Minister, but I did not want the moment to pass. This is an important piece of interpretation. There has been a lot of grief down the years over the use of the word "suspicion". If the Minister would like to comment on that, I would be grateful, but if he chooses not to, I will not mind. I shall reflect on this issue with a view to revisiting it on Report.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I should like to make three comments. First, I understand the point that the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) was making, but a lot of European convention case law--as well as the convention itself--upholds the test of reasonable suspicion as the right one for someone to be subject to detention, arrest or other procedural consequences.
<P>
We are about to reach a clause that uses the word "expedient". We have tabled an amendment to it because we think that the test of reasonable suspicion is better than other tests in the Bill. That is not meant to counter the argument of the hon. Member for Solihull; I just wanted to point out that the test of reasonable suspicion is a recognised test and better than some others. When we discuss the concept of expediency and its alternatives, I hope that the hon. Gentleman may be thoughtfully supportive of my argument that it is even more important to revisit that wording than the wording of clause 41.
<P>
Secondly, on the grounds of civil liberties and general respect for people, I welcome the fact that clause 41(3) requires that searches under this provision must be carried out by someone of the same sex.
<P>
Thirdly, any definition-type phrase--clause 41(1) is one such phrase--will raise the same caveats and concerns. I am not so concerned about the word "terrorist" because its meaning is clear where it links to specific offences--obviously, I have concerns about the broader definitions of terrorism in clause 38(1)(b) and clause 1. More importantly, however, can I take it that the intended interpretation of the last part of clause 41(1),
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"whether he has in his possession anything which may constitute evidence that he is a terrorist",<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
has no limiting definition? In theory, could anything be evidence? Obviously, other parts of the Bill relate to what is necessary for matters to be evidence of an offence. My reading of subsection (1) is that a constable may reasonably suspect someone to be a terrorist--as defined in the Bill--and seek to discover whether he or she has anything in his or her possession. However, anything may be included in that.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I ask in relation to a general legal background, as opposed to a particular Northern Ireland terrorist background. However, Ministers and others are aware that someone with a pair of scissors may be stopped in the street. It may be argued that that person has scissors for the purpose of an offence. Someone with builders' tools in a van can be stopped, and a similar argument can be made. Throughout the land, there have been many cases of criminal offences being charged on such grounds. Do the Government intend the provision to be as wide as that? Are they happy about that?
<P>
Picking up the point made by the hon. Member for Solihull, is there not merit in the law being a little tighter? Evidence should be qualified: that is equally true for a non-terrorism Bill. So, it may be helpful to include a phrase such as "anything that may be reasonably viewed as constituting evidence". Otherwise, there is a danger that anything may be thrown in. I am testing the wording. I would be happy to receive an answer, although later I may make a proposition that evidence should be qualified more tightly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ingram:</B> The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is on a bit of a fishing trip. He asked whether scissors would constitute something which a terrorist would use. Who knows? Scissors may be used for cutting wire or may be forensic evidence used by the police.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman is right to pursue such matters. However, he is not clear about how he would define the powers of a constable in such circumstances. If there were such a list of items, it might cause difficulties. Police officers carrying out their authority under the Bill will do so partly in relation to counter-terrorism. In the framework of a known or potential threat, officers may be told to do things by senior officers or they may identify something of their own volition. A known threat in a certain area would allow them to carry out their actions. Therefore, we must give police officers some latitude in those circumstances. That goes back to my earlier point about good policing stopping terrorist action or bringing people to book. The framing of clause 41(1) is therefore appropriate and commensurate with the level of threat to be dealt with.
<P>
I return to the matter that I was debating with the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter). Clauses 41 and 42 are conditional on clause 43, which sets out how power is conferred on a constable authorised under clause 42. Clause 42 is especially conditioned by clause 43(1)(d). I hope that we have dealt with the relationship between those clauses and, more importantly, that with clause 41, which should stand part of the Bill.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Clause 41 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 42</center></H4>
<H4><center>Authorisations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 19, line 20, leave out "expedient" and insert "strictly necessary".
<P>
This is exactly the amendment to which I referred in our previous debate about definitions. Clause 42(3), which deals with authorising stop-and-search operations, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"An authorisation under subsection (1) or (2) may be given only if the person giving it considers it expedient for the prevention of acts of terrorism."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Our amendment would replace "expedient" with "strictly necessary".
<P>
Unusually, we have been in Committee for an hour and a quarter without any amendments being moved. That is the result not of delaying but of not rushing through the Bill. That is a relief to those of us tabling amendments, as well as to the Minister, as it makes life a little easier. However, we are back to normal now.
<P>
I shall pick up a point that relates to my proposition. The Minister said that we shall return to how the Bill is reviewed. I accept that debate on the Govemment's new clause is the peg on which to hang that review. However, in order to have a considered assessment of the progress of the Bill, it would be helpful to know who will be collecting information and monitoring.
<P>
Once the Bill is enacted, will there be any process for objective, independent assessment of its effectiveness between implementation, enactment and review? That is as pertinent to the amendment and the clause as other aspects of the Bill. The Government set up bodies, such as Lord Lloyd's inquiry, to examine how legislation operates; will someone monitor the Bill independently and report to us?
<P>
The amendment is simple and would raise the threshold for a stop-and-search authorisation. A dictionary published by Cambridge University Press gives the definition of "expedient" as "helpful or useful" in certain circumstances, but adds that that is "sometimes not morally acceptable". I claim the aid of a valid definition in making my point.
<P>
Clause 42 is important and deals with the power to grant authorisations. That power is potent because it limits individuals' right to do what they want in public places and therefore affects their ability to go about their business. Setting a low threshold is the wrong approach. There should be a normal threshold in law; that is not what "expedient" is. Members of all parties are surely sympathetic towards ensuring that there is a recognised common threshold across the law, rather than an open-ended definition.
<P>
I have been advised--and have checked--that, under the European convention, someone who is stopped and searched is being detained for that period. That is also a detention within the context of the law generally. Failing to comply with a request to stop authorised under this part of the Bill is clearly an offence, albeit not a terrorist offence. In any event, there is no need for someone to have reasonable suspicion before a search is carried out.
<P>
Clause 43(l)(a) and (b), to which we shall come shortly, deal with the exercise of the power under the authority given in clause 42. Clause 43 clearly states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The power conferred by an authorisation under section 42(l) or (2) ... may be exercised only for the purpose of searching for articles of a kind which could be used in connection with terrorism, and ... may be exercised whether or not the constable has grounds for suspecting the presence of articles of that kind."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is a wide power.
<P>
Clause 42 is widely drafted and I have been advised that it may be contrary to article 5 of the convention. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Solihull is not present, as he raised this point in a previous debate. Article 5.1.c of the convention permits stop and search where there is "reasonable suspicion" that a person has committed an offence or where it is "reasonably considered necessary" to prevent a person from committing an offence. Expediency, allied with the lack of any need for reasonable grounds for suspicion in clause 43(1), provides a lesser test of reasonable suspicion than article 5 of the convention. A strong case can be made for arguing that we are lowering the threshold too far. As you know, Mr. Malins, road checks are possible under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. However, reasonable grounds need to be adduced and specified offences and people have to be involved. Again, a tighter test and a tighter definition are applicable.
<P>
I am conscious of the fact that the provisions are partly a continuation of PTA legislation, which has been tested from time to time. However, we need to link it in with the proper level of authorisation. Later amendments deal with who should provide the authorisation, touching directly on the point made earlier by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The Minister was in Westminster Hall when that point was made, so let me tell him that the hon. Gentleman raised the issue of who should have authority--police officers, judges, Ministers or other political authorities. If I understood him correctly, he argued for greater political accountability. He preferred a Secretary of State authorisation to a police constable authorisation. I am sure that he will make his own point later.
<P>
Currently, senior police officers have the authority and they can get away with authorising stop and search when they believe that it is expedient to do so--clearly a subjective test. A police officer authorises other police officers on the basis of a subjective test by a senior police officer. It is difficult to challenge the validity of that authorisation. The expediency test--although I do not like it in any event--would be more acceptable if there were a different authorisation procedure. If the police were not authorising the police, people would be more comforted and consoled. However well the police do their job, there is bound to be criticism when the police authorise themselves--just as there is criticism now of the Police Complaints Authority, through which again the police investigate the police. The criticism applies across the board, not just to the police. When solicitors investigate solicitors, similar complaints are heard. To put it bluntly, the police are the law enforcement agency. By virtue of this part of the Bill, they become the management of the law enforcement agency, too. Such unqualified power will be difficult to challenge.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Although Lord Lloyd accepted stop-and-search powers, he argued that the Secretary of State, not police officers, should possess authority over them. If the Bill had come to us in that form, the Government might have been able to get at least half an argument up and running about the expediency test. It has been found in the European Court that the United Kingdom breached European guidelines on reasonable suspicion. For example, we were found to have breached them in respect of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1978 in the Fox, Campbell and Hartley case.
<P>
A search without the objective test of reasonable suspicion violates article 8 as well as article 5 of the European convention on human rights. Article 8 provides that privacy must not be interfered with unless the interference is in accordance with the law and necessary in a democratic society. Interference through stopping and searching, although governed by law, is not precise and does not at present include the reasonable suspicion test, so it may not reach the threshold necessary to comply with the necessary protection in a democratic society. I hope that the point will be taken seriously and that the Minister will at least undertake to reflect further on the merits of replacing expedient" with "reasonable suspicion".

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Charles Clarke):</B> I must apologise for my earlier absence. I had to attend the Westminster Hall debate. I had not appreciated that I was giving my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, such a striking birthday present with which to start the day. I am sure that he will remember it throughout his life. He referred to the review, which we shall debate in greater detail when we reach new clauses later in the proceedings. I would prefer to respond then to the point raised.
<P>
On human rights, the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said that there was a risk of arguably contradicting article 5 of the convention. However, we do not accept that the clause faces difficulties in respect of the European convention on human rights. The action that we propose is proportionate, limited in time and area and is subject to confirmation. The European convention on human rights stresses the importance of how long a person is detained, and clause 43(4) makes it clear that the time should be strictly limited to how long it takes for the search. We do not therefore believe that there is any risk of non-compliance with the ECHR.
<P>
It is common ground that the police have stop-and-search powers at their disposal in certain circumstances to prevent acts of terrorism. The issue is what the test should be--expediency or strict necessity? We view it as a practical issue. If I may give an example, on occasion an officer may have two courses of action open to him regarding the policing of an event--for example, a public event such as a military band appearance, a large sports meeting or a Remembrance Sunday service--in the wake of a terrorist threat. In the light of that threat, the police may be aware of intelligence suggesting that the event could be the target for terrorist activity. Obviously, the safety of the public is the officer's first responsibility in the wake of that threat. He may believe that that can be secured either by cancelling the event altogether or by putting in place heightened checks in the vicinity to eliminate, so far as possible, the chance of an attack being mounted successfully. The police have faced that genuine operational choice on many occasions when they have been notified of terrorist threats.
<P>
It is indeed possible that the checks that are put in place in the vicinity of the event will include stopping and searching people in vehicles to prevent acts of terrorism. In such circumstances, I am sure that most of us would support a decision to go ahead with the event if that were assessed as a safe option. The organisers and those who were planning to attend would be happy, and the terrorists would have been denied the oxygen of publicity that often accompanies the cancellation of such events on security grounds. If, however, the officer or his senior could authorise the use of stop-and-search powers only if that were strictly necessary to prevent acts of terrorism, he would not be able to take the second option. The word "expedient" gives the power to set in motion an alternative to cancelling the event.
<P>
I do not accept the dictionary definition of "expedient" as not being morally acceptable, although I understand why the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey quoted it. We believe that the word denotes occasions when it is advantageous or suitable for the police to stop and search to prevent terrorism even when it may not be strictly necessary. That is why we chose the word. The police are well used to--and highly expert at--deciding, almost daily, what level of action should be taken in response to all sorts of circumstances; they take such decisions all the time. They minimise disruption wherever possible and judge how best to proceed. We want to continue to give them powers in the terrorist context to carry on being able to do that.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey mentioned the authorising process, but that would be debated more appropriately under amendments Nos. 124 to 126, so I shall respond to his points then. I hope that he understands why we have chosen the word "expedient" and accepts that it will enable us to deal with terrorist threats more effectively and live our lives more appropriately. It is not a matter of lowering the burden of proof for some arbitrary reason; I have indicated the specific, practical and operational reasons that apply. With that clarification, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We welcome the Minister back to the Committee.
<P>
I am sorry to be unco-operative, but I am not persuaded. There may be further examples, which the Minister is welcome to give, but he has not shown that the test of expediency comes from other than an emergency powers context or comes on the basis that it has been tried and tested. I do not pretend that the words "strictly necessary" are the perfect alternative, but the test of expediency seems to be entirely subjective and open to any justification that a police officer gives it.
<P>
I can see no way of controlling the use of this power if that term is used. It appears to give carte blanche to the police officer. Were the authorisation power given to the Secretary of State as Lord Lloyd proposed, at least there would be some check and balance, but the Minister chose not to address that. Given that it is police officer to police officer, it seems a dangerous, broad and unqualified power that has no justification from other history.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I am not sure that I am quite with the hon. Gentleman on this matter. It would not be for the police officer to interpret the meaning of expediency. If there were any question that the police officer had acted improperly, it would be for the court to interpret the word "expediency". In ordinary English usage, the word expediency" has acquired a slight tarnish in relatively recent years. It was drawn cleanly from the well from which it came, and it had a good meaning and implied a generally favourable purpose. That might surprise the hon. Gentleman; he may have thought that, given an earlier intervention, I would agree with him, but respectfully, I do not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The hon. Gentleman made two points. I understand the first point. However, I was not seeking to argue that the police should adjudicate any legal challenge. Clearly, that would be a matter for the courts. I was making the point--I am sure that he understands it, because it is a matter of fact--that the Government's proposal is that the stop-and-search powers will be granted to police officers by other, senior police officers, who will be authorised to organise its use. Lord Lloyd's proposal was that the Secretary of State should grant that power, an alternative being that the courts should grant it.
<P>
Whatever good use is made of the power, people will say that it involves the police authorising themselves. Of course, if such matters were taken to the courts, they would decide whether the police officer who had been given the authority to stop and search people believed the use of the power to be expedient. I was making the point that the police officer would always be able to justify the use of the power.
<P>
I am not suggesting that the word "expedient" need necessarily be pejorative, but it is so subjective that, provided that the police officer gave any reason at all, he or she would get away with using the power. Any test that allows someone to get away with using stop-and-search powers in any circumstance if a senior police officer has granted them to him or her is too broad. I have made my points in reply to the Minister. I am not persuaded by his comments. I shall consider whether a better alternative phrase could be used.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Lidington </B>(Aylesbury): I have listened carefully to the exchanges in the debate. I have been more persuaded by the Minister than by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I shall briefly make three points. First, if there is a problem about the exercise of stop-and-search powers, it is not that the police exercise them too frequently or with excessive enthusiasm--if anything, the reverse is true.
<P>
Secondly, the practical issue to which the Minister referred is key: the police may have to act quickly on receipt of a bomb warning or on the discovery of a list of possible targets or other intelligence information. With the best will in the world, it is difficult to get a Secretary of State to approve an authorisation quickly. Therefore, the procedure in clause 42 represents the right way forward, subject to the various safeguards incorporated in clauses 43, on the nature of the search, and 44, on the duration of the authorisation.
<P>
Thirdly, one must have regard to the position of a police officer if a complaint were made, or if a civil action were initiated on the unlawful use of stop-and-search powers, subsequent to the exercise of powers under the clause. In such circumstances, it would be unfair to tell the police that they must meet a high threshold in demonstrating that the complaint was unjustified. If a terrorist incident had not taken place, it would be difficult for the police to show that they had acted on the ground of reasonable suspicion, let alone on the higher threshold suggested by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in the amendment. In the practical circumstances of terrorist threats and the short time scales within which police have to make decisions on the ground after receiving intelligence information, although we wish that such powers were unnecessary, we believe that the language that we have, subject to the safeguards in later clauses, is the right way forward.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 125, in page 19, line 20, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'(3A) In this Part "judicial authority" means--
<P>
(a) in England and Wales, the Senior District Judge or Chief Magistrate or his deputy or a District Judge or Magistrate who is designated for the purpose of this Part by the Lord Chancellor,
<P>
(b) in Scotland, the sheriff and
<P>
(c) in Northern Ireland a county court judqe or a resident magistrate who is designated for the purpose of this Part by the Lord Chancellor'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 124, in page 19, line 21, leave out from 'given' to end of line 34 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'by a judicial authority'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 126, in page 19, line 21, leave out from 'given' to end of line 34 and insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'by the Secretary of State'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I remind the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey that, when we discussed the earlier amendment, we strayed a little into these areas. I hope that he will tailor his remarks accordingly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Even before you prefaced the debate with that remark, Mr. Malins, I intended to say that Committee colleagues would be glad to know that I will be brief. I still intend to be, even after your encouragement.
<P>
The three amendments relate to the three sources that should give the authority. Amendment No. 125 defines "judicial authority" as a senior district judge or magistrate, or his deputy, or a district judge or magistrate designated by the Lord Chancellor in England and Wales, a sheriff in Scotland and in Northern Ireland a county court judge or resident magistrate designated by the Lord Chancellor. Amendment No. 124 proposes that a judicial authority should replace the four ranks of police officer in each of the four parts of the United Kingdom. There is special provision for the City, the Metropolitan police and Northern Ireland. I pray in aid Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I am sure that he has never anticipated being prayed in aid so often by a Liberal Democrat, but as someone who took his title from the place where Beveridge used to be the Member of Parliament, what can he expect?
<P>
Lord Lloyd concluded in paragraph 10.25 of his report that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"there would be advantage in extending the requirement, which now exists in section 13B"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
of the PTA--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to obtain the Secretary of State's approval of any authorisation which has been given."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He certainly suggested that, of the three options, a governmental option should be supported. My amendment No. 126 puts that as the alternative. As you rightly said, Mr. Malins, I questioned earlier whether we should allow senior police officers to authorise junior police officers to take these exceptional powers, or someone else. There was support from the Northern Ireland Benches for the idea that we should give power to the somebody elses more often. There is a good case for doing that, and I should be grateful for at least an explanation from the Government on why it should remain with the police.
<P>
Finally, I agree with the Minister that there is a speedier turnaround in decisions when matters go to police officers, rather than the Secretary of State. That is why the judicial authority and local magistrates should be used in the same way as they are for bail applications. We have a tried and tested system for going to a judicial being by day or night, in the week or at weekends, to get permission. That would be a worthwhile safeguard, which would help, rather than hinder, the police.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> An important and well-established principle of our policing system is that chief officers of police have operational independence. They are best placed to make operational policing decisions which, in my opinion, include deciding whether making a stop-and-search authorisation is expedient in preventing acts of terrorism. It is sensible that decisions are made on the ground, where detailed knowledge of circumstances of the area are readily to hand. Sometimes, decisions have to be made very quickly to be effective, so an authorisation could be made orally, then confirmed in writing. The Bill makes specific provision for that.
<P>
If that initial decision had to be made by the Secretary of State, valuable hours would almost inevitably be lost, especially as he would almost certainly need detailed briefing on the geography of the area and the local security situation to make an informed decision. He would otherwise end up as little more than a rubber stamp.
<P>
Lord Lloyd took the view that the powers continued to be necessary, and that the requirement for the Secretary of State to confirm a decision made by the police was the right approach to such matters. Clause 44(4), which deals with the Secretary of State's confirmation of the chief police officer's decisions, meets Lord Lloyd's recommendation and the general concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
The Secretary of State has a clear role in authorising decisions. A process has been established that indicates the significance of such decisions without interfering with the key issue of chief constables' and chief police The right in clause 43 exists for 12 months after the stop. It is a real right to get a written statement. If someone is stopped, the officer will give him information about the grounds of the authorisation for the stop and he can then get a written statement on the matter at any time within 12 months; it is not unreasonable to think that anyone who does not co-operate in those circumstances is behaving wilfully. For that reason, the clause is correct as drafted. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am aware of the provision to ask for detailed stops. It came in an earlier bit of the Bill that I did not argue with. I am grateful to the Minister for his additional suggestion on what should be included. He may like to consider whether that suggestion should be incorporated in the system, rather than just proposed in the Committee.
<P>
I shall test the Minister on another matter. Criminal cases often involve one police officer and one defendant, so what is said will invariably be disputed. Why could not the police officers who act under such authorisations be given a simple bit of paper to hand out when they make the request? I suggest that simply because of the evidential point. In such cases, the police officer will say that he or she was acting under the powers, but the defendant will say that the police officer was not. An additional way to confirm what was said or done would be helpful, even if it involved handing out a bit of paper.
<P>
I appreciate that that would not be a perfect evidential answer. People can refuse to accept bits of paper; they can throw them on the ground and so on. However, that system would at least provide the same written justification that people receive, for example, from traffic wardens. I do not seek a final answer now; I ask that the Government consider how to ensure that such powers are not abused and can be made more acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I am obviously prepared to consider the implementation of the Bill. We have set out in the Bill the process by which the event happens, and an individual can request written clarification after the event. We do not intend to write into the Bill the obligation to make a written statement at the beginning, as suggested by the hon. Gentleman. Of course, to ensure that the Bill is implemented effectively, I shall consider any proposal that he makes.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On the basis of the debate, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 115 in page 21, leave out line 7.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 116, in page 21, leave out line 9.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> These probing amendments, which are similar to others that I have tabled, are intended to test the appropriateness of the sentencing options, which include imprisonment or imprisonment and a fine, that will be the punishments for being found guilty of the offences of the failure to stop an obstruction or the failure to stop a vehicle. It would be helpful to know what the expected, normal and traditional tariff has been and whether prison sentences have been imposed on people for such failures under parallel provisions in existing legislation. I am not saying that no one should be imprisoned, certainly for obstruction, but I should be grateful to hear a justification for the options.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> This debate replicates some previous discussions in Committee. Those are perfectly reasonable points. A balance of judgment is involved in such matters. I want to emphasise that the consequences of non-compliance could be serious. At the very least, they could include the diversion of police resources at the time of a heightened terrorist threat. In addition, we should not abandon the prison option for the most serious breaches. For example, serious action should be taken against someone who intentionally obstructs a police officer, so letting a terrorist plant a bomb. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I hope that the Minister will put any relevant factual information into the system, as he has already started to do. I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> The Minister will be aware that, in the Northern Ireland context, the stop and search powers are entrusted to officers, which includes members of Her Majesty's armed forces and police officers. I seek clarification because clause 45 refers exclusively to constables. In exceptional hard-to-imagine circumstances of heightened terrorist activity or threat, what legal powers would members of Her Majesty's forces have to act as they can under clauses 85 and 86, for instance, in the context of Northern Ireland?

<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Gentleman says, the clause deals specifically with constables. My understanding is that Northern Ireland is dealt with in part VII and that, currently, we have no intention of providing in this part of the Bill for people who are not constables to have the rights set out there. I will consider the situation in more detail and write to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 21, line 11, after 'constable', insert 'in uniform'.
<P>
The amendment means that only a constable in uniform may prohibit or restrict parking. We want to ensure that that is clear.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hunter:</B> Why do the Government believe that the amendment is necessary? Could there not be circumstances in which it would counter the effectiveness of anti-terrorist measures?
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> As in all such matters, there is a balance of judgment. Large numbers of people may be on the scene, and it is important that members of the public are clear that the request is made by a police officer. The uniform is the most obvious means of ensuring that, so that arguments cannot develop about whether a person had the right to act in that way. I am aware that one could argue perfectly reasonably that the amendment is unnecessary, but the balance of judgment is in favour of ensuring that, in the circumstances envisaged by the clause, everybody is clear about the position of the person making the request.

Offences
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 122, in page 22, leave out line 22.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we may discuss amendment No. 118, in page 22, leave out line 24.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B>  The amendments are similar to those taken under clause 45. This probing amendment comes with the same request for information about past practice that has been made elsewhere.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I do not want to reiterate a debate that we have already had, but we included the penalties because we considered that there were broad similarities between the parking regulation and obstruction offences and some trespass--type offences. For instance, there is a similarity with the offences in sections 63 and 65 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 of failing to leave land or failing to proceed towards land when directed to do so by a constable. That is why we set the penalty at the same level.
<P>
The amendment would remove any distinction in penalty level between the offence of parking in contravention of a restriction in clause 49(1) and the offence of refusing to comply with the instruction of a constable in clause 45(2). The distinction between the offences should be reflected in the penalties. I hope that that is clear and that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> It is clearly sensible that the tariff shows the greater seriousness of the offences in clause 45; those offences should carry a higher penalty. Obstruction and failing to comply with requests are clearly more serious matters than failure to comply with parking regulations. I understand that and, as I said earlier, the amendment is simply a probing one. I do not disagree with the idea that there should be a different top tafiff for the offences in the two clauses. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 50</center></H4>
Interpretation
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 81, in page 22, line 28, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>'in relation to England and Wales and Scotland) or section 14 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 (in relation to Northern Ireland).'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the definition of the term "disabled person's badge" extends across the United Kingdom. This technical amendment is designed to ensure that the parking provisions in clauses 46 to 49 have the same effect throughout the United Kingdom. Clause 50 currently defines "disabled person's badge" by reference to the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. The Act has effect in England, Wales and Scotland, but not in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland equivalent is the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1978. The amendment therefore adds a reference to the Northern Ireland Act to the definitions. I apologise for the late submission of the amendment, but hope that the Committee will agree to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> The amendment is fine and welcome, as is having a consistent standard across the United Kingdom.
<P>
If we try to counter terrorism through legislation, we must ensure that people do not deceive others into believing that they are lawfully going about their business when they are not. All hon. Members are aware--if we are blunt about it--that there is some abuse of the orange badge system, and I have certainly dealt with such cases in my constituency.
<P>
Although the matter is the primary responsibility of another Department, will the Minister take one thing away with him? One of the things that we still have not done in legislation is ensure that use of the orange badge is tied to a person and that vehicle he or she normally uses. As we all know, the badge can be moved from vehicle to vehicle and is often attached to a vehicle that has nothing to do with a disabled person. That gives people justifiable cause for complaint about abuse of the system. I do not have a solution, but I know that abuse continues, that people are rightfully aggrieved and that I am regularly asked what I am doing about it. Perhaps the Minister could feed that back into the system. He may already have an answer, but, even if he does not, some consideration of the concern would be appreciated.
<P>
<B>Mr. Clarke:</B> I will of course feed the matter back to the Departments that deal with such things. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the point of the provision is that disabled badges do not let anybody off the hook. However, I understand his general point and will pass it on to colleagues.
<P>

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lidington:</B> What is the Government's view on the carding scheme in existing legislation? As I understand it, the clause will enable the Secretary of State to repeal that scheme in due course. Although their discussion document said that representations against the scheme had been made, my impression was that the Government still believed that there was merit in continuing the current arrangements for now. I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the Government's thinking on that point in more detail.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Matters relating to the ports issue would be best dealt with in the debate on schedule 6 rather than on the enabling clause--although without the clause, the schedule would not exist. If I may, I will reserve my comments for that debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Charles Clarke:</B> As the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey said, the substantive debate will take place on schedule 6, but the point made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury is perfectly fair. There has been much debate on the power. The police have often stated that it is a useful tool for tackling terrorism, but others have objected on the grounds that it delays journeys and is used disproportionately against Irish people. Therefore, we have decided that, instead of being permanently available, the provision should be able to be switched on or off according to the circumstances. One of the main factors in deciding that status will obviously be the security situation. Perhaps that may not seem an entirely satisfactory state of affairs to the hon. Gentleman, but I think that it is a reasonable approach. I hope that he understands our reasons.
