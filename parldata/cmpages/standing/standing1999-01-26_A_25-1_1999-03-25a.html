<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I welcome all members of the Committee to this, the 25th sitting of the Greater London Authority Bill Standing Committee. Perhaps we all feel a little like Olympic runners approaching the end of a marathon and seeing the Olympic stadium in the distance. Bearing in mind the fact that we have reached the provisions on culture, media and sport, the analogy may not be entirely inappropriate. Now that I have got that off my chest, we shall begin.
<P>
<B>The Minister for London and Construction (Mr. Nick Raynsford):</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1231, in page 131, line 20, leave out

</UL></FONT>
<P>
As an amendment to the proposed amendment: (a), leave out ``appointment'' and insert ``election''.
<P>
Government amendment No. 1240.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am afraid, Mr. Winerton, that your reference to Olympic prowess brought back an unhappy memory. Quarter of an hour ago, while on my way here, I found myself trapped in the lift in Eland house. I envisaged having to prise open the lift doors and run at enormous speed to avoid being late. Fortunately, the engineers managed to open the doors and liberate me in time for me to get here in a more orderly way, so no Olympic prowess was required.
<P>
As you rightly said, Mr. Winterton, we have come to the part of the Bill dealing with matters of culture. I am pleased to move a group of amendments that will strengthen the provisions establishing the cultural strategy group for London.
<P>
The clause and Government amendments provide for an appropriately sized body. We believe that the body should have executive functions if the mayor considers that appropriate. Corporate status for the cultural strategy group for London will avoid any potential problems over personal liability for members of the group&#151;I believe that the change proposed by amendment No. 1231 would be necessary on those grounds alone.
<P>
The cultural strategy group for London, acting through the mayor, is to have broad discretionary powers consistent with the rest of the Bill. The amendments build on the foundations of the group as laid out in the Bill. For example, it will be able to acquire premises and employ its own staff for the purposes of carrying out its functions. The provisions on the mayor's funding of the group's expenses have been amended to give more flexibility. In the original draft, the mayor was to provide the cultural strategy group for London with staff and equipment; as amended, the clause will give the mayor broader power to fund the group for the exercise of its functions. Further provisions clarify the status of the group, providing that its seal can be used and presumed valid unless proved otherwise.
<P>
The size of the cultural strategy group has been set at between 10 and 25 members&#151;as a body corporate, the upper and lower limits must be identified. The London Heritage Forum&#151;the body that currently brings together the principal cultural agencies in London&#151;has a membership of 14. It has done much good work already towards achieving an integrated approach to culture in London, and it seems logical that the expertise and experience of its members would be drawn on by the mayor in pulling together the new cultural strategy group. Nevertheless, the appointment of members will be at the mayor's discretion. I firmly believe that it is right that the mayor should have a good measure of flexibility.
<P>
By setting a lower limit of 10 and an upper limit of 25, we have accommodated both flexibility and manageability. The group should not be too unwieldy, but the mayor must have sufficient leeway to appoint extra members as he or she sees fit.
<P>
We have also made it explicit that the mayor will appoint a group member to chair the group and that its activities will not be invalidated by vacancies. The Government amendments allow the cultural strategy group for London to develop flexibly so as to accommodate changing circumstances and functions. The group parallels the initiatives launched by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to establish cultural consortiums in the other English regions. The consortiums are part of a developing agenda that is still at a comparatively early stage. They will not be statutory bodies, however, London is different because the mayor is responsible for the cultural strategy group.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes (Southwark, North and Bermondsey):</B> The Minister may be about to deal with my point and if he is, I apologise for interrupting him. I have been asked a question that the Bill does not answer, and it would be logical for the Minister to answer it now. How will the new cultural strategy for London interrelate with the Secretary of State's proposals for the rest of the country, which will presumably apply to London? I gather that a geographical network of cultural organisations is proposed. How will that fit in?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I have just explained that point. Cultural consortiums will be established in the other regions, while London will have a cultural strategy group. The Bill provides a statutory basis for the group because London has a mayor who is responsible for culture. In the same way as for the regional development agencies, arrangements for the English regions will have parallels with those for London. The London development agency is accountable in the same way as the cultural strategy group to the mayor, who will appoint its members. Our overall aim is to establish a network of organisations throughout the country to contribute to the better co-ordination and promotion of culture in the English regions.
<P>
Liberal Democrat Members have tabled three amendments that seek as usual to weaken the position of the mayor: that has been the leitmotif of Liberal Democrat amendments throughout our consideration of the Bill. Proposed amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 1236 would ensure that members of the cultural strategy group, istead of the mayor, would elect a member of the group as chairman. Proposed amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 1237 would specify that the mayor shall, rather than may, provide funds for the group. These amendments are contrary to the spirit of flexibility that we have sought to ensure in arrangements for the mayor vis-a-vis the cultural strategy group, and to the principle of wide discretionary power for the mayor in making appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Is the Minister aware of the logical implication of his remarks? He seems to suggest that the Goverment are providing flexibility for the mayor to provide no money for culture. He may want to defend that position, but Liberal Democrat Members think that a guarantee of at least some money might be generally acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being curiously obtuse. Not only did he not listen to my earlier comments about the network of other organisations, but he has not noticed that our amendments enable the mayor to provide funding for the cultural strategy group. We have addressed the issue that he raised. We differ from him in that we do not believe that it is right to impose on the mayor a loose, open-ended statutory obligation to provide funding such as that proposed. Such an obligation could fetter the mayor's discretion and open him or her to the sort of charges and legal challenges that the Liberal Democrats love. In their view, endless argument, debate and legal challenge should be the stuff of politics, rather than getting on and doing things.
<P>
The Committee will recognise that the Bill puts in place structures that allow the cultural strategy group to operate effectively and to receive appropriate support from the mayor, who will be the key player. As we have established throughout our sittings, the mayor will be the executive and the person speaking for London. It is right that he should have discretion to appoint the chair of the cultural strategy group and determine the appropriate funding.
<P>
The attempt to force the mayor to provide funds strikes at the heart of the flexibility and discretion that we seek to provide. As I said, I have no doubt that expenses properly incurred by the members of the cultural strategy will be covered by the mayor, but we do not intend to second guess him by requiring him to allocate such sums. I hope that the Liberal Democrats will not press their amendments, but will accept the improvement offered by our amendments, which will strengthen the position of the cultural strategy group&#151;an important agency in promoting the interests of the arts and cultural activities in London.

<P>

<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): We believe that the Government amemdments improve on the original provision. They spell out the situation much more clearly and give more teeth and structure. Indeed, we are a little surprised that the provisions were not included in the first place. Nevertheless, they do not go quite far enough.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 1262 and 1263 provide that while the strategy group should still be under the mayor's guidance, he should give at least half of the places, plus one, to bodies that he considers it relevant to consult, for them to make appointments. In that way, the person whom the relevant body, rather than the mayor, considers appropriate will be a member of the group.
<P>
No doubt the Minister will say that the mayor will obviously consult, but the final decision should lie with the groups themselves. We propose that just under 50 per cent. of the group should be appointed by the assembly&#151;that is right and proper&#151;but that the various cultural, media and sports groups in London should have more of a say in those who are appointed to the group. It would also be appropriate for the group to elect the chairman, rather than him being appointed by the mayor&#151;that is the purpose of amendment No. 1263.
<P>
You, Mr. Winterton, have wisely grouped amendments Nos. 1268, 1269 and 1270 under schedule 20. In truth, their effect is similar to that of Liberal Democrat amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 1237, so with your indulgence I will now spend 30 seconds speaking to them, which will save us time later. Those amendments provide that, as well as allowances being paid to members of the group, consideration should be given to remuneration. By and large, in my experience, someone who is remunerated is far more likely to respond actively than if he were earning only travel expenses. If we are to get the great and the good involved, some kind of carrot is needed.
<P>
If we consider some organisations that have been very cash-strapped, such as the Royal Opera house, and various moribund music festivals and sporting initiatives, we find that unsalaried, part-time direction usually guarantees financial unsoundness and short-term failure. As someone said to me the other day, there is a general rule that if you pay the great and the good next to nothing, you get next to nothing that is great and good. In the circumstances, I hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider those amendments, and those to which I spoke earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I am glad that we have at last come to culture, media and sport. This is a modest part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth </B>(Bromley and Chislehurst): Thank goodness.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) is in danger of being represented as a Philistine if he suggests that we should have London government, but no provision for culture, media and sport.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> For confirmation of that, happily.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> The hon. Gentleman probably believes that there are quite a few Philistines out there. Does he not think that they deserve representation in this place?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Philistinism is in the eye of the beholder. Philistines&#151;whoever they are&#151;would say that they have their culture, media and sport, too.
<P>
<H5>2. 45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke (Cities of London and Westminster)</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Mr. Brooke, a non-Philistine.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) for giving way. I have been conscious throughout the Committee of the fact that he and I are the only two inner London Opposition Members on the Committee and I therefore offer him help whenever I can. In the light of the intervention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, is the hon. Gentleman aware that modern scholarship has demonstrated that the Philistines have earned a totally erroneous reputation down the years? They were in fact very civilised people.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I guessed that that would be the nature of the right hon. Gentleman's intervention. His early-morning research on amendments has clearly gone nice and wide. All that I can say to the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is that, from my personal experience, there are people in Bromley and Chislehurst who are interested in culture, media and sport. I am sure that they would want something on those matters to be in the Bill.
<P>
As with all such things, this set of amendments allows us to consider some of the detail&#151;the particular&#151;before we debate the general, which is always the odd way of Committee proceedings. The first Government amendment is logical and gives the strategy group recognition in law. That will allow it to get on with things, make contacts and so on. A corporate structure is probably better as a matter of organisation than an unincorporated one.
<P>
On the other Government amendments, I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway). They are welcome because they have at last fleshed out some of the things that were rather thin. I am sure that we all got a note dated 18 March from London First the other day. It stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Parts IX and X of the GLA Bill provide for the Mayor to prepare and publish five strategies for London, four of which relate to the environment and one of which relates to culture, media and sport. The Mayor is, however, given little or (in the case of the culture strategy) no power to implement these strategies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
At least some of the amendments have given the mayor power to do some things. In the light of what the Minister said, however, I would not want to suggest that the mayor had to spend any money, but only that he or she might spend some on anything he or she thought was good.
<P>
The first of our amendments is simple and democratic. We thought that it might be a good idea for the group, which will be appointed by the mayor, to be able to choose its own chair. That represents just a little whittling down of the mayor's powers. I know that the Government believe that the mayor has to be all-singing, all-dancing, doing everything and appointing everybody, and even responsibility for that appointment can be left to no one else. The people in the strategy group might, however, be happier if they could choose their own chair, rather than having the chair imposed on them. That is not an absolute view, but a preference.
<P>
On the second amendment&#151;amendment (a) to Government amendment No. 1237&#151;if we do not require there to be any staff at all, we are likely to have a pretty thin strategy. We welcome the fact that there will be proper recognition of such things.
<P>
We will come in a moment&#151;in the group of amendments led by that tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke)&#151;to what we should call the group to give it status. At the moment, I am not sure that something that is described as the cultural strategy group for London will have quite the authority or prospective clout to which people who might want to serve on it are likely to respond. I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Croydon, South that we need, in the linked group of amendments, to provide for those people to be good and competent&#151;they will presumably largely be into doing other things with their time&#151;and for them to be remunerated for sharing their expertise in the interests of London as a whole.
<P>
The amendments are intended more as probing amendments than as hard and fast ones&#151;those will come later. It may be that the Government are going to be difficult to catch at the beginning of the afternoon; if so, I would rather that they were more generous later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> You opened our proceedings, Mr. Winterton, with a reference to the marathon, which reminded me of the fate of poor Dorando, who in the 1908 Olympics staggered into the stadium and never reached the finishing line&#151;or if he did, had to be helped over it. I prefer the analogy with which I opened Tuesday's proceedings&#151;that of a race course, with you, Mr. Winterton, as its clerk. I hope that I can get the whole of this paragraph out before you call me to order.
<P>
I say that because of the Government's misjudgement of how long the Committee's proceedings on the Bill would take. When the Derby was run in 1945, Mr. Denzil Batchelor, the distinguished journalist, was asked to broadcast a running commentary on the race to the forces overseas programme. As it was to be recorded rather than go out live, he thought that he would therefore not spoil his first Derby after the war by working during it, but would instead make notes on his sleeve and compose the broadcast later that evening. Broadcasting is of course, Mr. Winterton, part of culture, media and sport.
<P>
All was well until three weeks later, when the BBC received a letter from a corporal in Burma, who had been out of the United Kingdom fighting throughout the war. He said that the letters that he had received from home had obviously been censored, and he had not been aware of how large the privations had been on the home front. He realised exactly how bad they had been when he heard Mr. Denzil Batchelor's broadcast, because a race that before the war had taken only two and a half minutes now took four minutes, and it was clear that British bloodstock had been subjected to a very severe war. I cite that as a demonstration of how the Committee's race has also expanded, thanks both to the Goverment's generosity and to their lack of precise calculation at the beginning.
<P>
My question to the Minister relates to that process. I am fascinated, as I was when the Government tabled a series of new clauses when we were dealing with transport provisions during an earlier stage of the proceedings, as to whether the Government always intended this to happen. They originally put fairly modest provisions into the Bill&#151;we made allusion to them on Second Reading, saying that they were simply a makeweight to give the Bill a greater strategic sense. Were the Government so shamed by criticism of the original provisions that they felt it necessary to bring forward much fuller and&#151;here I wholly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South&#151;more valuable provisions at this stage? Had they come forward with the provisions originally, it is possible that I would not have needed to table any amendments.

<P>

<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thank the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminister and the hon. Member for Croydon, South for welcoming the amendments that we have tabled to try to improve the definition of the role of the cultural strategy group. The right hon. Gentleman asked why we tabled them. At some very much earlier stage of the Committee's proceedings, my hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London made the point that the cultural sections of the Bill are relatively skeletal, but that we hoped to amplify and expand them. That is what we have set out to do.
<P>
We recognise that it is important that the powers that the Bill creates should be defined in such a way as to make clear the importance that the Government attach to the cultural role of the mayor and to make it possible for the mayor to operate effectively through the cultural strategy group. We recognise the importance of having a cultural strategy group, and the amendments that we have tabled flesh out those provisions. They have been developed in parallel with the thinking of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on the cultural consortia that are being established elsewhere in the country. There is a necessary process of linkage between those two.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In a sense, the Minister's final remarks have forestalled me. I was about to ask him whether the reason for tabling the amendments was that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had not prepared the relevant clauses when the Bill was originally issued&#151;which would explain why the provisions are rather skeletal, as he accurately described them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As the right hon. Gentleman knows, the Bill is long. Inevitably, not every detail was absolutely right at the outset of the drafting process. As he knows only too well, a lengthy Committee stage such as this is part of that process. It has broadly followed the same timetable as we envisaged, but we have allowed some additional time in response to Opposition requests in order to ensure thorough and rigorous scrutiny of the entire Bill, and I am pleased that he recognises that. We want to ensure that the Bill leaves the Committee in a better shape than that in which it arrived. We thought that it was pretty good when it arrived, but we are not so arrogant as to believe that it was perfect, and feel that the process has improved it. It will continue to be improved, I hope, on Report, and possibly thereafter.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> And in the Lords.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I said, ``Possibly thereafter''.
<P>
The issues raised by the hon. Member for Croydon, South relate to appointments to the cultural strategy group. It is not right to fetter the mayor's discretion. It is right that the mayor be able to choose appropriate people who have a contribution to make and can represent the wide range of different cultural activities in London. Allowing the mayor such discretion, just as we have in the Bill's other provisions, seems appropriate.
<P>
We differ from the hon. Member for Croydon, South on payment of members of the cultural strategy group. There is a great deal of merit in the principle of public service, and people will want and be happy to serve on that body without remuneration. I do not accept his view that the absence of payment for membership will reduce the quality of the contributions that we receive from people who believe in and have a commitment to the arts and want to make a contribution voluntarily. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman and his party should doubt the validity of that willingness to serve in a voluntary capacity, which has always been an important feature of public life in this country, and, I hope, will continue to be so for many years to come.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I think that I probably agree with the Minister on that matter, but a niggling doubt is in my mind, and I wonder whether he might put my mind at rest. If we continue to rely on public service as a motivator in such cases, might we not tend to have unrepresentative people on such bodies&#151;the usual suspects:&#151;the rather grand, the rather well-off and people who can afford the time or who are senior in businesses that allow them to take time off? If we are not careful, people on lower incomes or who have demanding jobs and cannot take time off will not be represented. Does the Minister recognise that risk?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I recognise that theme quite readily, and accept that in some areas that is such a worry that it is necessary to ensure payment. However, I doubt very much whether the relatively modest payments that would be appropriate in the case of a body such as the cultural strategy group&#151;which will meet not full-time but only periodically, and would therefore qualify for only relatively modest payments&#151;would make a genuine difference to people. I suspect that people who are genuinely interested in and care passionately about the arts will be prepared to serve without a relatively modest allowance for doing so. I could be wrong; I accept entirely that a risk exists, but in principle, we are doing the right thing in this instance.
<P>
It was rather touching to listen to the plea of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey for his amendment, describing it as ``just a little whittling down of the mayor's powers''. How many times during the past two months has the hon. Gentleman moved amendments, all of which could have been justified on the ground of just a little whittling down of the mayor's powers? Had all those amendments been accepted, the mayor would not have any power but would be a political eunuch with no say over London. Cumulatively, they would have entirely emasculated the mayor's work, as the hon. Gentleman should recognise. I pay as little heed to his claim for just a little whittling down as I do to the introduction to so many of his speeches that begin with the words, ``Just a short intervention.''
<P>
<H5>3 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
I think that I have responded to the concerns of the hon. Member for Croydon, South about the additions to the Bill. I hope that the Committee accepts our amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, I just about accept the Minister's response to amendment No. 1263, but not in respect of amendment No. 1262. There is a good case for the mayor appointing half the group, less one, from the assembly and nominating bodies to make the appointments to the other half of the group, plus one. It is a better way in which to involve those in the world of culture, media and sport. Although it is not the lead amendment, I wish to press amendment No. 1262 to a Division.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> To help the committee, I shall allow the official Opposition a vote on amendment No. 1262, when appropriate.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
<B>Mr. Steven Pound </B>(Ealing, North): On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I think that it is one on which you may be uniquely qualified to rule. Last week, I addressed Conservative Members who have performed distinguished service to the state, under the colours of the Queen, as honourable and gallant Gentlemen. However, I notice in the Hansard report of our proceedings that the words ``and gallant'' are in parenthesis. I appreciate that such usage is a tad archaic, but I was under the impression that Conservative Members who had served under the Queens' colours are referred to as honourable and gallant&#151;in the case of the hon. Member for Croydon, South, to great distinction. Will you correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Winterton?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> For many years, it was the tradition and custom of the House of Commons to address a Member of Parliament if he was a current serving officer or a senior retired officer as hon. and gallant or right hon. and gallant. If a Member was a barrister, he would have been addressed as hon. and learned or right hon. and learned. If an hon. Member wishes to address other MPs as such, it can still be done, but the Modernisation Committee has changed the traditions and customs of the House&#151;a matter on which I shall not comment, although I have very strong views about it.
<P>
If hon. Members wish to address other hon. Members as honourable and gallant, honourable and learned, right honourable and gallant or right honourable and learned, I shall not correct them. It is up to the Official Report how such procedure is reported. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is now aware of some of the traditions, conventions and customs of this great House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I think that the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) was referring to me. All I can say is that I covered the withdrawal from Aden, and I commanded two of her Majesty's warships, but I certainly did not feel gallant in the process. The hon. Gentleman need no longer refer to me as such.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall now make an inadequate attempt to add to your utterly comprehensible explanation. Would it be possible to address a parliamentary colleague as right honourable, gallant, learned, reverend and noble?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall rule on these points of order when I have taken the final one.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Wilkinson </B>(Ruislip-Northwood): Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Was it not the practice in times gone by for hon. Members to be addressed as gallant if they had reached the field of major, squadron leader or lieutenant-commander? Of course, the Modernisation Committee is entirely right that anyone who has served in the armed forces is, ipso facto, gallant, as is the hon. Member for Ealing, North.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that honour has been done in our brief debate on that point of order. The hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) may be right that a limited number of people could be all the things that he suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull included ``reverend'' in his list. Have you considered that that would creep in only if the Member was non-denominational?

<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall be adept in dealing with that: I always note the interesting interventions of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. We now come to amendment No. 1213, which is in the name of the Vicar of Bray. I call Mr. Peter Brooke.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1213, in page 131, line 21, leave out `Strategy' and insert `Consultative'.

<P>
No. 1224, in clause 262, page 132, line 16, leave out `Strategy' and insert `Consultative'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I thank you warmly for calling me, Mr. Winterton, particularly in the light of our previous exchange. My remarks will be brief. I provided a trailer in the previous debate.
<P>
I hasten to say that the situation has been improved by the Government's amendments, but I tabled my amendments before the Government suggested those improvements. A strategic group without a budget but with a licence to meddle is a potential source of unfunded mandates, which, as I said on Tuesday, is an American phrase. To some extent, the mayor will be able to control the group through his grip on appointments. The Bill should be more explicit about the group's status and activities, but I acknowledge that the Government have responded to that fault with their amendments.
<P>
The group should be consultative, and it should be charged with identifying budgets for any proposals that it wishes to make. The word ``strategy'' will be inappropriate until the mayor has looked at the wish list and decided how to place it in his scale of priorities. I do not propose to say any more; as I said, the amendments were tabled before the Government tabled theirs. I should nevertheless be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I think that the right hon. Gentleman is misguided; let me explain why. The cultural strategy group will not be merely a talking shop. We have made it clear, and it is implicit in the amendments that have just been agreed to, that the cultural strategy group will have a range of powers and functions. It will be able to take extremely effective steps to help meet the needs of culture throughout London, and to ensure co-ordination between a range of different cultural activities.
<P>
The city has an extraordinary wealth and variety of cultural activities. It benefits hugely not only from the well-established cultural activities for which London is renowned&#151;especially the theatre, music and other arts&#151;but from the blossoming of a variety of cultural activities that has taken place in the past 20 or 30 years among the many disparate ethnic communities in London. London has a richness and variety of cultural activities that is probably unparalleled in western Europe, if not in the world. We must cherish it and encourage it.
<P>
We need to consider how those various elements might cumulatively build together to enhance London's standing as a great cultural centre in Europe. That will help to promote London and its economic success, as well as ensuring a rich cultural range of activities for people who live, work and want to enjoy themselves in London. The cultural strategy group will do that. It is not consultative as it has a much wider role. The right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster will be aware from our earlier amendments that it will be able to take initiatives and be funded by the mayor to carry out specific roles.
<P>
Therefore the substitution of ``Consultative'' for ``Strategy'' would be inappropriate. It would downgrade the group, and imply a much more restricted role than we want to give it. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that his amendments are inappropriate and should be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> On Tuesday, I described how I had missed the Monet private view at the Royal Academy because I had been attending to Liberal Democrat amendments. The Liberal Democrats table so many amendments that my time is sometimes devoted to them rather than to examining how my probing amendments have caused the Government to respond, and whether I have caused the Government to produce amendments of their own that invalidate the purpose of mine.
<P>
I am not wholly convinced by what the Minister has said.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> As my right hon. Friend enlightens us on so many subjects, will he tell us whether, in general, he regards Liberal Democrat amendments as impressionist or post-impressionist?
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If my hon. Friend had given me the option of ``expressionist'', I would have opted for it.
<P>
Before that helpful intervention, I was saying that I understood the points that the Minister had made. To my recollection, he did not dwell on the point that although there will be parallel arrangements in other parts of the country, if the mayor's role is to be genuinely significant in this context, an ability for the group or the mayor to play a role in the context of the funding of the Arts Council in London or of the London Arts Board would substantially flesh out the mayor's executive capabilities as described by the Minister.
<P>
When I moved the amendment, I acknowledged that it had been to some extent overtaken by events. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> There were lots of amendments in the name of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster in the last group&#151;there seemed to be at least 17&#151;and not even a miniature Liberal Democrat amendment was sneaked in. That shows that we do not try to disrupt his enjoyment of paintings all the time.
<P>
I hope, expanding on the point that the Minister made well, that the cultural strategy group will reflect two sorts of cultural diversity. I had a go at the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst for what he said about popular culture and highbrow culture. Popular culture means things that are not of great expense&#151;things that are not only affordable by the few but, to use a phrase that I have heard elsewhere, available to the many.
<P>
Secondly, I hope that the cultural strategy group will reflect the cultural ethnic diverstiy of London. One of the paradoxes of London is that the only large traditional non-British cultural festival is carnival, which is traditionally a Caribbean festival.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> The mela?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The only other one that could be counted is the mela. Given the significant number of communities in London&#151;a figure of around 250 was cited the other day&#151;it is odd that London does not hold large cultural events that reflect the interests of the faith and ethnic communities. We have Diwali festivals and a few other events, but London is not fulfilling its potential as a centre for cultural, ethnic and faith groups and their festivals. There is a surprising dearth of such festivals. Many hon. Members experience them at a local level because we are constantly invited to them.
<P>
<H5>3.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> On a historical note, I should have thought that the fair is the great British cultural tradition.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Indeed. I said earlier that I was excepting what I consider traditional British or English events, although even those have diminished&#151;events such as the old river fairs that were held over a frozen Thames and the annual seasonal fairs have almost disappeared.
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Dowd </B>(Lord Commissioner to the Treasury): It does not freeze any more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Indeed&#151;global warming, or climate change as it is now called means that we no longer have fairs on the river&#151;although there is a very good new Thames river festival, of which the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) and I are patrons and/or trustees, which ensures that the river is celebrated. We cannot legislate for it, but I hope that the Bill expresses Londoners' ethnic and faith interests, as well as the character of their culture. If we are not too prescriptive&#151;as the Minister would not wish us to be&#151;I hope that our words will be read in the bound volume that will be in the new building, and that the mayor, whoever he or she will be, will follow them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> If I understand the hon. Gentleman, he attributes the disappearance of the ice-bound fairs to global warming. It is characteristic of the Liberal Democrats that he is ignorant of the fact that those fairs were the result of the piers of London bridge filling three quarters of the river, creating a mill pool.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I was distracted by the Labour Whip into making a point about global warming and climate change. The right hon. Gentleman is of course right; someone who has half of London bridge in his constituency has to learn such facts as part of the training.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> On the fear that the hon. Gentleman is establishing a template for future pan-London festivals and fairs, will he add to the list of Fleadh Ceol; which is extremely popular and represents an excellent day out for London's Irish community?

<P>

<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Indeed. The Fleadh is an extremely good event that is held once a year in north London, although it gets a bit noisy in the evening. There are a few such events. I hope that we will have a cultural strategy hierarchy that will reflect all of London and not just some of the organisations.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am pleased to give the hon. Gentleman the reassurance that he wants. I had hoped that I had made it clear that the cultural diversity of London was one reason for having a strategy group to ensure the promotion and to achieve greater integration of the wide range of activities that London currently enjoys.
<P>
We have had something of a debate about the quality of Liberal Democrat amendments. To continue the artistic parallels, they are not minimalist in any sense of the word and give me an overwhelming feeling of the surreal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes</B><I> rose&#151;</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> No. I am afraid that the Liberal Democrat amendments are not relevant to the clause stand part debate. I hope that we will stay within that debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I shall return rapidly to it. As we have already established, the purpose of the clause is to create the cultural strategy group for London as a corporate body responsible for providing advice to the mayor on a range of cultural activities, and with the power to do more. That is the purpose of our amendments.
<P>
The cultural strategy group may in due course acquire other functions, perhaps of an executive nature. For that reason, we propose to table a further amendment on Report to clause 31, to include the cultural strategy group as one of the bodies to which the mayor can delegate functions. We cannot do that today because we passed clause 31 about two months ago, but that will be the logical consequence of what we are doing today. I hope that the Committee will recognise the logic of tabling that amendment on Report.
<P>
The clause relates to an important part of the Greater London Authority's role. It will enable the mayor to act authoritatively and receive expert advice on cultural matters. I urge that the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
On two previous occasions, I have explained the provenance of amendments that I have tabled about the London tourist board; this amendment falls into the same category. This time, I am reinforced by the Liberal Democrats, who are slow to arrive on the field, but have nevertheless added their names to mine. I am grateful to them for their reinforcement for this third amendment, even if they could not find it in them to support the previous two. In response to previous amendments, the Minister demonstrated that the concerns of the London tourist board have been taken care of in the Bill. I hope that the Minister for Transport in London will be able to do the same on this occasion.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats may have joined me because they thought that the amendment, which I tabled on behalf of the London tourist board, was especially apposite and acute. It is obvious that tourism plays a significant part in the issues that we are considering, just as it is part of the duties of the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. It is, therefore, wholly appropriate that we should press the board's claims in this matter. I do not propose to say any more because the importance of tourism in London is familiar to everybody in the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We are delighted to reinforce the righ hon. Gentleman. I apologise if it appears that we have nearly swamped him because there are four of us, but only one of him.
<P>
Like the right hon. Gentleman, we think that it is important that tourism should be recognised and protected. The representative body of the tourist industry in the capital city&#151;the London tourist board&#151;should have a rightful place at the table. That is what the amendment is about. It seeks to add the London tourist board as a member of the cultural strategy group.
<P>
The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman will move amendments later to suggest that we take tourism out of culture and have a separate tourist body. There is no great theology about that. On balance, however, my judgment is to support the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. The reason behind his amendment is that it is better to put tourism in the context of culture, media and sport. Those are the reasons why tourists come to see us; if they are not, it is a bit difficult to work out what they come here for, although I am sure that suggestions could be made. It is important that the London tourist board plays a part as it does an extremely good job for London. I will not make the obvious point about tourism strategy not just being important to our revenue, but being complicated and difficult. Getting the right balance of people in the right place at the right time is important&#151;just as it is anywhere else&#151;if we are to preserve our culture in this city.
<P>
I will give an example of why it is important for the board to be involved. We are planning the opening on the south bank next year of a museum of modern art in the new Tate gallery building&#151;a wonderful conversion of the Bankside power station. That is expected to attract a huge number of visitors to the south bank. The number is already growing because of the Globe theatre, which, coincidentally, is where I was again this morning. If we are going to promote places such as the Globe, the Tate and the new museum of modern art, we need to consider how we will accommodate the people who go there. We need to think about coaches, transport access, hotel buildings and so on. It seems logical to consider those provisions together.
<P>
We need to consider issues of traditional culture&#151;the beautiful buildings of London, the squares and so on&#151;and decide where responsibility will lie. If we are to formulate a cultural strategy that will preserve places such as Westminster abbey in such a way that people can enjoy them in the way that it was intended, we need to think about how we manage the tourist numbers. If 1 million people go round Westminster Abbey at the same time, it will hardly fulfil the purpose for which it was built&#151;a haven from the manic world outside.
<P>
I hope that the Government are sympathetic to the proposition of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster that we put tourism and its representatives formally in place&#151;ideally, in the schedule. I hope that we get a positive response.
<P>
<H5>3.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster. I did not put my name to his amendment, but I notice that it is swamped by the names of Liberal Democrat Members, including one who is not a member of the Committee. I could have collected about 160 names, although I am not quite sure what their relevance would be. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey referred to a clause that Committee will soon consider. We do not seek to remove tourism from the provisions, but to give it a separate strategy in its own right.
<P>
That does not mean that we are wobbling in our support for my right hon. Friend's amendment. We believe that tourism is an important issue for the cultural strategy group, and I await with interest the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> The Committee has had a fairly electric discussion that I have enjoyed listening to, but not much has been said about sport. The Bill will not have been enacted, or at least we will not have a mayor, when Britain plays host to the cricket world cup this summer. I am sure that the Oval and Lord's cricket grounds&#151;

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> I always listen with great care to what the hon. Gentleman says, and I am generally amused and interested. The amendment concerns tourism, and his remarks will be in order as long as they relate to it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I follow what you say, Mr. Winterton, and I am grateful.
<P>
The cricket world cup will attract many tourists into the country&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick </B>(Poplar and Canning Town): I know that the hon. Gentleman will not want to deceive the Committee by referring only to tourism being stimulated in Britain. One of the most attractive fixtures in the world cup is Bangladesh versus the West Indies, a match that will be played in Dublin, which is in another country.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The hon. Gentleman is right&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> But out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> The territorial application of the Bill does not affect that match. I shall concentrate on sport attracting tourism to London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My hon. Friend will be aware that any member of the European Union can attend people's question time, so the matter is not restricted to the jurisdiction of London.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I was going to give a prize to the first person to introduce Europe into the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Just to complete the circle, I should point out that the European tourist is hugely important. The fixtures are not just in England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales; they are also hosted in the Netherlands.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am having difficulty getting to the point. I should like to think, as I hope that the Committee will, that tourists who come to London to watch cricket&#151;I refer especially to Lord's and the Oval&#151;will be accommodated and welcomed. Perhaps other pastimes will appeal to them when they are not watching cricket, as London has so many wonderful things to see.
<P>
I shall try asking the Minister a question, and I do not mind whether she replies to it now. I would be happy to receive her answer in a letter. Do you think&#151;
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The Minister, not me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Taylor:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Winterton. Did I use the second person singular, after 16 years?
<P>
Will the Minister comment now or by letter on whether there is a favourable prospect that the mayor will be able to assist that great cricket ground south of the river, the Oval? It is the home of Surrey county cricket club, and such help could perhaps make its spectator facilities as good as its playing facilities.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Transport in London (Ms Glenda Jackson):</B> I am not chary of responding directly to the hon. Member for Solihull now because I do not have the relevant information&#151;even though I do not&#151;but because I am sitting next to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall who represents the constituency in which that hallowed ground is sited. I understand that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales also has an interest in that part of London, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman might consider widening his area of inquiry. I shall, however, try to respond to his question.
<P>
The amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the speeches of the hon. Members for Southwark, North and Bermondsey and for Croydon, South and, in a somewhat more oblique way, the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) highlighted the importance of the London tourist board to this great city.
<P>
This may be an appropriate moment to pay tribute to the work done&#151;and, I have little doubt, the work that will continue to be done&#151;by the London tourist board. As I am sure hon. Members know, it is a private company, essentially funded by its members, yet it has managed to transform, by ability, &#163;1.5 million into more than &#163;3 million by attracting additional funds. Clearly, it has a major role to play in ensuring that London maintains its primacy as a tourist location for the individuals and groups who choose to visit it&#151;from wheresoever in the world and for whatever purpose.
<P>
The amendment relates to appointments to the CSGL. Clearly, the right hon. Gentleman's overriding concern is to ensure that the London tourist board would be represented by specifying in it the provisions. I have noted the major contribution that the London tourist board makes to this great city. However, the amendment largely duplicates the existing provision, which states that the mayor must appoint either representatives of bodies dealing with matters relevant to the culture strategy, or individuals with relevant knowledge, experience or expertise.
<P>
From what the right hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have said and, I trust, in the light of what I said, it is highly unlikely that the tourist board will not be considered to be a relevant body. It is an obvious partner and adviser in the important area of tourism. I have no doubt that the mayor would wish to work very closely with the board&#151;it is already a member of the London Heritage Forum. I repeat, however, that we intend to give the mayor the power to choose advisers; it is for the mayor to decide who he perceives to be relevant advisers in that regard. We believe that it would be too prescriptive to place these three words in the Bill, not least because it could be deemed to be the beginning of a little list, and there would no doubt be pressure to increase the size of that list. I trust that in the light of what I have said, the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I do not intend to get into an argument with the Minister, but on previous occasions, LTB amendments were rejected because they were otiose and there was already sufficient provision in the Bill. In this instance, the problem is not quite so readily resolved. My amendment would have prescribed that the LTB should be represented on this body. By rejecting the amendment, the Government will be giving the mayor discretion to decide whether the LTB should be represented. I accept the Minister's view that it would be extraordinary for the mayor not to ask for tourism to be represented, given its importance to the city. I hope that the LTB will accept with equanimity the Minister's decision to reject the amendment. Its self-confidence, given the success that it has enjoyed over the past 20 years, should encourage it to believe that it is certain to be selected. The Minister and I would have to have a word if, by any chance, a future mayor chose not to select it.
<P>
I am aware that the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, who is my second-in-command on the amendment, may well mutiny. I cannot guarantee that he will accept my advice, so I may have to speak again, but I now give him the opportunity to contribute to the debate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> Like the right hon. Gentleman, I understand the general proposition that we do not have lists, although there are lists elsewhere in the Bill&#151;we debated some the other day.
<P>
I wonder whether, if the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment, she would seriously consider whether tourism could at least be named as a ``relevant matter'', which is a phrase that appears in paragraph 1(3) of schedule 20, and is defined, by an example rather than in total, in paragraph 1(6). I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that I am not proposing to mutiny, but it would be helpful to know that at some point, before we come to the end of schedule 20 or of the second clause&#151;clause 262&#151;which deals with the mayor's cultural strategy, it could be made clear that tourism is to be included. If the Minister would be happy to say that that is possible, I shall be happy to leave the matter for now on the basis that we will return to it later.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest now. Clause 262(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The policies that may be contained in the culture strategy include policies with respect to each of the following matters&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the arts, tourism and sport;''.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I appreciate that, but may I press the Minister? There are other items on that list which we will debate shortly so I shall not go into detail about them now. Can there at some stage be a linkage between the matters that are listed in clause 262(5)&#151;the policy list&#151;and the representatives list?
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The Minister is saying no or not now.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I said no.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> If she is saying no, I ask her to think again. It would be helpful for it to be clear that the representative group for the list of activities is linked to the policy list.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> In response to the last part of the hon. Gentleman's contribution, I say to him that what he is essentially trying to do is the antithesis of what we expect the mayor to do. The hon. Gentleman wishes to break up, to be prescriptive and to make ever longer lists. The Bill already covers the importance of tourism in the definition of the strategy. Having to compartmentalise in the way that the hon. Gentleman would clearly prefer would run counter to our expectations not only of this strategy, but of all the mayoral strategies. As we have had occasion to say before, all the strategies must work together in a complementary fashion.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about tourism&#151;they have already been expressed by the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. However, the Bill also covers tourism in other contexts, where it will impact on other mayoral strategies. Business is the obvious example that comes to mind. Therefore, although I understand what the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is saying and appreciate why he is saying it, I believe that his fears are unfounded.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> In turn, I understand what the Minister is saying, I think that I am right in saying that although the Department is now called the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, its Ministers have the titles, which represent at least part of their functions, of Minister for Arts, Minister for Sport and Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting. If the Government think it necessary that someone should have ministerial responsibility for disabled people, or for various other things, perhaps those responsibilities should be listed in the schedule.

<P>

<B>Ms Jackson:</B> Undoubtedly, that is the case, but we are creating an extremely powerful figure in the mayor. The mayoral strategies, upon which I have already touched, will inevitably include and have to reflect the importance of the role that tourism plays in our capital city, of which the mayor will be not only the primary political power but the clear figurehead and ambassador on a range of interests and issues. I repeat that there is no need to place even more in the Bill.
<P>
<H5>3.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I suffered moments of apprehension during the exchange between the Minister and the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. I had secured from the hon. Gentleman a commitment that he would not mutiny, I feared that the Minister's dialogue with him might still provoke and incite mutiny. I have to say, from long experience, that the hon. Gentleman is a dangerous man when roused, even if long winded. I am relieved that he has remained in an obedient capacity. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1273, in page 235, line 15, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `(5A) In sub-paragraph (3)(a) above ``such bodies'' shall include bodies with knowledge and experience in the arts, film, heritage, libraries, local government, the lottery, museums, royal parks, sport and tourism.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the veritable Giverny garden of amendments that we have debated recently, this is a lillypond of an amendment. It sets out for our delectation a beautiful list of the sort of bodies that should be included. It lists them simply, and I need do no more than read them once. We should be looking for people with experience in the arts, film, heritage, libraries, local government, the lottery, museums, royal parks, sport and tourism.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Is that it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> The person who typed the note that I am reading has been rather mischievous. Hoping that I would not spot it and, as a result, that I would read it, that person had inserted ``cuddly toys'' in the list.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Facetious Liberals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Facetious Liberal's staff is the answer to that.
<P>
I have two serious questions. First, the Government proposed in the White Paper the possible transfer of certain functions, activities and responsibilities from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to the mayor. For example, it included responsibility for the theatre museum, for the museum of childhood&#151;which is subject to discussion with the Victoria and Albert museum&#151;and for parts of the historic estate of London, such as Parliament Square and Trafalgar Square, Marble Arch, Wellington Arch and some statues. What has happened to that proposal? The Minister reprimanded me the other day for suggesting that a change should be made to something that had been included in the White Paper. The White Paper is expected to lead to the Bill, but the White Paper seems to have a disappearing element, and we want to know whether it will come back.
<P>
Secondly, we seek to ensure that the mayor is linked to the other relevant London bodies. Some obvious examples are the Museum of London, the Horniman museum, the Geffrye museum, the South Bank Board&#151;with which the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department and I have regular involvement&#151;and the bigger bodies such as the London Arts Board, the South East Museums Service, the London Advisory Committee on English Heritage and the London Film Commission.
<P>
We are trying to establish that the definition of the bodies is all-encompassing. We do not want an absolutely inclusive list, but one that flags up the major culture, media and sporting sectors. Will the Government at least confirm that the items in the list will be acknowledged and incorporated? As a final prompt, I hope that we can have a response to the question of the specific proposals that we welcomed as White Paper proposals but which have, twixt cup and lip, disappeared.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I trust that it will be in order if, before dealing with his amendment, I respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey, particularly on museums. I draw his attention to the written answer given by my hon. Friend the Minister for London and Construction. I shall not read it all&#151;I am sure that you would not allow that, Mr. Winterton. It states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the White Paper raised the question of future responsibility for some London museums currently directly funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport . . . The White Paper also considered future arrangements for the Theatre Museum and the Museum of Childhood. Following the conclusion of his departmental CSR''&#151;<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
the comprehensive spending review&#151;
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has concluded that there should be no change at the present time to the funding arrangements for these bodies, but that the GLA's role in funding the museums should be reviewed in due course.''&#151;[Official Report, 24 March 1999; Vol. 328, c. 252.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I trust that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman on the position of the most important assets in London's cultural life.
<P>
The amendment is concerned with the nature of the cultural strategy group for London. As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows, we have given that careful thought, and making the CSGL a body corporate is a clear result of that process. We have concluded that, to promote London's cultural interests, the mayor should have the discretion to appoint advisers. Those people will of course have knowledge and experience of relevant cultural matters, whether as individuals or as representatives of organisations.
<P>
Culture is an extremely wide-ranging subject. I have no intention of attempting to define it now, other than to say that we do not seek in any way to constrain the mayor in the work of promotion and co-ordination in that area. However, that is precisely what the hon. Gentleman's amendment would do. I am sure that we all found his list of relevant areas interesting; I have no quarrel with it, but we return to the same old argument about lists. As I said in a different context, the important thing about lists is that, inevitably and invariably, there are individuals or organisations that do not appear on them. In light of those points and of the reassurances that I gave the hon. Gentleman on some of London's museums, I trust that he will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> On the first point, I am grateful to the Minister for putting on record the summary of the written answer given yesterday, which my hon. Friends and I have seen. I hope that that measure will be implemented in appropriate stages before too long. On the second point, my purpose was to flag up the sort of bodies that we think should be in the list that the mayor will consult. I did not expect the Minister to leap at it and say that it was just the list that he had been waiting for, but I hope that we have put on record the areas of London life that should be included, although I accept that there are others, too, such as archaeology, archives and others, which we shall discuss later.
<P>
It is a broad list, like the checklist to which we&#151;although no other member of that Committee is serving on this one&#151;referred when we abolished the GLC, upstairs in a Room like this, in trying to ensure that all such areas of life with a Londonwide interest were looked after. We spent some time ensuring that they were looked after; we need to give as much attention now to ensuring that they are looked after in future. They are all important; they add to the diversity of London. I am sure that the new GLA will pay heed to them. However, it is helpful to show that we were not unmindful of the breadth of interest shown in the schedule. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1246, in page 235, line 17, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`or represent demands for the Authority's funds'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In a sense, this amendment harks back to those that I tabled to clause 261, when I wanted to point out that, just as there is no such thing as a free lunch, so there is no such thing as a free culture strategy. It is a reminder that the expenditure implications of a culture strategy should be considered. I tabled the amendment merely as an aide-memoire. It relates to my observations about unfunded mandates, and I should be interested to hear the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The amendment would insert a description of the culture strategy as including matters that represent a demand for the authority's funds. The view of the culture strategy implicit in the amendment is misguided. The strategy's purpose is essentially to help identify funding priorities and channel resources to meet London's needs, thereby providing the means by which the mayor can ensure that best use is made of available funds.
<P>
The basis of our proposals is that the mayor should provide the leadership to promote the capital's cultural and creative interests. That is best achieved by co-operation with all involved. I have no doubt that the CSGL will provide the means to bring all the relevant parties together in advising the mayor on an appropriate cultural strategy for London that will reflect the best use of available resources. I therefore ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I tabled the amendments to clauses 261 and 262 quite a long time before I tabled the consequential amendments to schedule 10. Hence the amendment is No. 1246, and appears to follow Government amendments Nos. 1231 and 1234, which we discussed at the beginning of our sitting. Although my amendments were tabled later, they had been conceived earlier, before the Government improved the Bill. I therefore have no hesitation in saying that I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
No. 1267, in page 235, line 23, leave out `But'.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> This is the final part of our trio of constitutional checks on the cultural strategy group. We debated remuneration for members of the cultural strategy group and the method of appointment under clause 261. I failed to persuade the Minister of my argument on the first two proposals and it remains to be seen whether I have more luck now. The two proposals are straightforward: first, that the terms of office of members of the group should be limited and, secondly, that the mayor should have a discretionary power to intervene if any member of the strategy group is unable or unfit for any reason to discharge his functions. The amendments are reasonable and I hope that the Minister accepts them.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The amendments relate to the appointment of members of the CSGL and I say to the hon. Member for Croydon, South that we believe them to be either unnecessary or inappropriate. Amendment No. 1265 defines the length of time for which members may serve. It would limit the powers of the mayor to determine the basis on which members of the CSGL are appointed. We have carefully considered the relationship between the mayor and the CSGL and we propose to give the mayor the power to appoint members on such terms as the mayor deems appropriate.
<P>
As for amendments Nos. 1266 and 1267, the mayor will have the power not only to appoint on terms that the mayor deems to be necessary, but to define the circumstances that will terminate the appointment of a member who, for example, is unable or unfit to act. It is for the mayor to define the terms. Obviously, guidance will be available to the mayor, but there is no reason to fix such terms in statute before the mayor has taken office. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I take the Minister's point about length of service. The mayor can define that when he makes appointments. However, will the Minister have legislative cover to remove someone who is unfit? I confess that I cannot see it under paragraph 1 of schedule 20.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> The mayor will have such powers. If the mayor has the power to appoint such advisers, the mayor would devise the terms that make people appropriate for such appointments. The mayor will also define in essence the terms stating when an appointment can be terminated. I understand&#151;with the assistance of the mayor for London, schedule 20 and clause 261&#151;that tenure of office is covered by the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Given the Minister's praying in aid the mayor of London, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Twentieth schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I hope that the Committee will not think me too jaundiced if I inject a slightly sceptical note about the provisions of schedule 20 and the cultural strategy group. I am mindful of the fact that usually the most totalitarian democracies take the greatest pride in their enthusiasm for culture, and have the most elaborate programmes to support it. Culture is essentially subjective, is it not?
<P>
We were mindful during the previous Parliament that connoisseurs, like most members of the Committee&#151;
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> I think not.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Perhaps not the hon. Gentleman, but the rest of us greatly appreciate fine ballet. However, for Mr. Terry Dicks, the predecessor of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. McDonnell), ballet was just young men prancing about in tights.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> He was right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> My right hon. Friend says that he was right.
<P>
The qualities required of the cultural strategy group will surpass those that most of us possess. We are not all like the former Member for Putney, the right hon. David Mellor, equally at home commenting on football or choosing records as a disc jockey on radio. We do not have the capacity for combining classical musical appreciation with an interest in football.
<P>
The qualities required of the mayor were enunciated in a document that we all received unsolicited from London First. That document painted a picture of a paragon of excellence, a person&#151;I could not call him a man&#151;capable of managing big budgets, getting things done, taking a grip of big organisations and so on. Those are more the qualities of a Gradgrind than of a connoisseur of the arts, music and the finer points of culture.
<P>
The mayor will, of course, need a cultural strategy group to provide guidance and to help with the formulation of the mayor's strategy. The choosing of those individuals is bound to reflect the mayor's taste; indeed, it presupposes that the mayor has at his disposition advice on choosing the advisers. It is a great pity that nothing is written into the Bill about utilising the various tastes of the 25 assembly persons. Certainly those that are elected without any constituency will have the time to appreciate London's varied cultures, the contributions of its ethnic communities, and so on. They will have the same salary as those with constituencies, and I hope that they may use their time to advise on choosing appropriate individuals.
<P>
There is a risk that patronage will prove a temptation to the mayor. With the appointment will go the opportunity to attend internationals at Twickenham, the opera, the ballet, special showings at the national gallery. It will be a desirable appointment, but I hope that the mayor will not be too seduced by the great and the good on the various bodies, which according to the schedule will have first call on the appointments. Those who are most cultured are often not those who sit on quangos but those who are genuinely in pursuit or artistic excellence and who are individuals of discernment and good taste. I am anxious that the cultural strategy group may prove an opportunity for the mayor to surround himself with cronies who may not have the right qualities but who will do nicely out of the appointment.
<P>
How right was my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South to try to tie down the question of the tenure of office. As I read the schedule, the office could theoretically be held in perpetuity&#151;although we know that a successor may or will not be happy with the cultural tastes of those appointed as advisers by his predecessor. None the less, there is an openness to cronyism that could be offset by giving the assembly a bigger role.
<P>
Then there is the question of expenses. Perhaps I am a miserly individual but, as a custodian of the public purse, I see that as my primary purpose. I notice that the mayor will provide the cultural strategy group with allowances for ``travel or other expenses''. Of course, they will judge that those costs have been ``properly incurred'', but are not trips to Hollywood and other places around the world, hotel bills, entertaining media figures, and so on&#151;no doubt for the benefit of Londoners&#151;the sort of expenses that will soon mount up? There is little provision for controlling such expenses.
<P>
Any strategy group or advisory body will want premises and persons appropriate to its status. We all know that its status will be important. The man or woman holding the mayoralty will not necessarily be an individual of great culture him or herself. Those individuals will need accommodation, equipment and other facilities. There may not be room to accommodate them in the fog lamp on the south bank, so another building may have to be found, and the cost to the people of London will grow.
<P>
Lastly, the people of London will want to know that the proceedings of the strategy group are properly conducted. They will at least need proper minutes published for all to see, so that nothing goes on behind closed doors, sub rosa, in a manner not open to public scrutiny. However, the schedule provides that the proceedings of the strategy group are for the group itself to determine&#151;how very convenient. That is not in the best interests of London. Even the quorum is for the group to decide. Where two or three are gathered together, that may be sufficient to conduct business, but I am not sure that that is the way to conduct business properly on behalf of Londoners.
<P>
I suspect that dissatisfaction with the operation of the cultural strategy group may grow over the years. Claims for its largesse and beneficent patronage will become clamorous. Those hoping for handouts or good plaudits in a mendicant posture will at times be extremely upset and disappointed and will complain. I suspect, however, that the worst complainants of all will be the people of London, because they will perceive that its operation will have cost them a great deal of money. They will appreciate, as do many Committee members, that art and culture are manifestations of the human spirit which grow best spontaneously, not by the injection of public money or the intervention of public bodies.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> We are sympathetic to the part of amendment No. 1265 that would limit to four years the term of office of a member of the group. If the Government do not confirm that that would automatically be the length of appointment, we would deem the amendment worthy of support.
<P>
<H5>4.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to a specific amendment, but I must remind him that this is a schedule stand part debate. The hon. Gentleman does not need to refer to an amendment, just to the general theory and detail of the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> I am perfectly well reprimanded, Mr. Winterton. Certain issues which we think are worthy of bearing in mind are covered by amendments that have not been accepted by the Government. The schedule sets the parameters for membership of the group and the rules, as far as Parliament is going to set them, but certain issues have not been dealt with.
<P>
Although I would not have used his words, the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) made an important point. We must ensure that we do not create bodies that are seen to be regional quangos emulating national quangos, in that they are the subject of great patronage without accountability.
<P>
One of the reasons why we have persistently argued in favour of qualifying the mayor's power is that the mayor will have such great power and therefore such huge patronage that she or he could fill up places with friends and the great and the good. Unless there are ways of challenging such appointments, we are in difficulty.
<P>
Perhaps I could give a topical and relevant example. Debates are going on elsewhere on how this country chooses its Commissioners to the European Union. I believe that there is a growing national view that there should at least be scrutiny here, by Parliament on behalf of the people, of those who are nominated by Government to be our representatives, at very high salaries and with huge pensions and great advantages in terms of expenses and lifestyle. We argue that the same should apply in London, although on a smaller scale. We want to ensure that none of the valid criticisms of the Greater London council are heard again when the new London government is set up; the control of patronage and the scrutiny of appointments&#151;ideally by people who are elected and accountable&#151;is the only way of doing that. We are worried that the Bill does not allow sufficient scrutiny at all stages to reassure the public that, once in office, the mayor will not be able to do her or his own thing for four years, with far too little opportuinity to be called to account by the people.
<P>
<B>Ms Glenda Jackson:</B> I thought that the speech of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood was perfectly structured&#151;I make no criticism of the form&#151;but its contents had to be among the most depressing that I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. I found it astonishing that the hon. Gentleman believed that the only person who is capable of enjoying both football and opera and other forms of music is David Mellor, the former Member of Parliament for Putney. Millions of people in this great city of ours have no difficulty whatever in appreciating the finer points of not only football but opera&#151;not necessarily the classic opera that, in my humble opinion, far too often makes up the bulk of programmes in this great city. People have a wide range of interests, not only in sport, but in music, literature, and the visual arts, which often form part of such activities.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> The point that I was unable to make and should have made is that perhaps only the former Member of Parliament for Putney has the rare capability of being able to make money out of his knowledge both of football and classical music.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I have no intention whatever of intervening in private feuds.
<P>
I also found somewhat disheartening the hon. Gentleman's view of those who are committed to and engaged in and who believe in culture, however we want to define that phrase&#151;I am not attempting to do that now. The hon. Gentleman thinks that such people are somehow excluded by virtue of their interests from being practical and may be incapable of understanding a balance sheet and knowing how best to balance a budget.
<P>
I should remind the hon. Gentleman of the enormous contribution that was made by Renaissance man and woman&#151;I trust that the correct word for them is polymath. In the first era of Elizabeth, people could be pirates, sail the seven seas, be expert in sinking ships and stealing bullion and have no qualms whatever about engaging in military activities. At the same time, they were entirely capable of returning home and supporting the greatest dramatist the world has ever seen and others, too.
<P>
In that period, every single capacity known to human nature was burgeoning in this country. The world was shrinking because of the explorative abilities of the British. The first theatre, as named, was created at a time when there was huge cultural and great economic activity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Pound:</B> Not in Solihull.
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I have been slightly provoked from the lower reaches of the Committee by a Labour Member who presumes that I will necessarily intervene to talk about Solihull. I was born in Warwickshire in the village that provided the setting for ``As You Like It''. Before the Minister gets too carried away with the wonders of the Elizabethan age, which she portrayed so splendidly, it is necessary to remind the Commitee that 16th century England saw the economy shrink and shrink, and that the lot of the people was appalling.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order I can only assume that that had something to do with the cultural strategy group for London. If it did not, I hope that the Minister will ensure that her reply does.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I was tailoring my response to what I perceived&#151;certainly as far as London in the time to which I referred is concerned&#151;as the burgeoning not only of great cultural activity but of commerce and business, which took place by virtue of the move out of the port of London into the wider sea. I simply make the point that it is entirely possible&#151;in contradiction of the theory that the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood suggested&#151;to be interested and active in and to wish to see the promotion of cultural activities while being capable of dealing with what one could, if one wished to be hypercritical, deem to be the practical realities of life. They are not and have never been separate.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> Just before my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull intervened, the Minister referred to the first named theatre. My intervention is supportive of her case, but she may be forgetting the theatre of Dionysus. I would say in her support that the Athenians had exactly the same dual strategy of massive practical expansion combined with great cultural history.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> As always, I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster for his contribution. I was attempting, however, to anchor my remarks to the first building in London that was named as a theatre. I did not mean the first theatre in the history of the world.
<P>
<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I want to make a more mundane contribution than the previous two. The Minister will know that if she ever wants to find people with a love of opera who are keen followers of sport, she has only to come to a football ground such as Millwall on a Saturday afternoon. Although the opera there may be comic, it is available in plenty, and often describes mediaeval events that might effect the referee or his family, depending on the outcome of the match.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I agree that there is often more energy at such matches than in more formal operatic venues.
<P>
I take issue with the suggestion of the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that people appointed by the mayor as advisers to the cultural strategy group will be interested only in what he described as events to which they would be privileged to go. He seemed to argue that they will be interested only in what they can receive from an existing culture. The mayor's advisers will work on a strategy to ensure not only that culture thrives now but that it continues to thrive. In advising on a cultural strategy, they will be most concerned about the future.
<P>
I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about corruption&#151;let us not beat about the bush. The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey also raised the issue, although in a different manner. The Government have been specific and clear about incorporating into the Bill controls to preclude such activity. The mayor will have to publish his strategies, which will be examined and scrutinised by the assembly and by the public. We are discussing a high-profile appointment with real power, and the mayor will not be able to get away with anything, even if he or she wishes to do so.
<P>
That will be equally true for advisers to the mayor on the cultural strategy. The mayor will not look exclusively at aspects of culture on which only the great and the good will be expected to offer advice. This great capital city has many layers of what I would deem to be culture, to which the mayor will undoubtedly look.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hughes:</B> Have the Minister and her colleagues considered the idea that members of the group should be nominated by the mayor and then scrutinised by the assembly? That seems to the Liberal Democrats a perfectly proper model, and I cannot understand why it is objectionable.
<P>
<B>Ms Jackson:</B> I give the hon. Gentleman credit. He tries this approach every time, regardless of the part of the Bill under discussion. I am sorry to be continuously repetitive, but I should point out again what he knows full well. Throughout our sittings, he has proposed to unbalance what the Government believe to be the most productive form of mayor and assembly for London, whereby the mayor has the power and the assembly scrutinises. Yet again he spoke of a model in which power would be in the hands of the assembly, which could say who would and would not advise the mayor. The Liberal Democrats have applied that argument not only to the cultural strategy but to all the other mayoral strategies. They have advanced it many times in the Committee, proposing a balance of power in the GLA that we have rejected and will continue to reject.
<P>
Members of the CSGL will not have the status of agents or servants of the Crown, and they will not be civil servants. We expect the CSGL to consist of between 10 and 25 members, who will be appointed by the mayor on the basis of the expertise that they will bring to the work of the group. They will include representatives of the principal cultural agencies operating in London and individuals with a particular relevant knowledge or expertise whom the mayor believes will contribute to the work of the CSGL. We believe that the size of the group that we have determined upon will provide both manageability and flexibility. Clearly, before making any appointments the mayor will consult any body or person he considers to be appropriate.
<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The mayor may make funds available for the payment of expenses, which was a point of great concern to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood. I say to the him that in my experience, many hotels in Hollywood are cheaper than hotels in London, and it would be entirely reasonable, and underline the attractions of this great capital city, not least as a location for films, for such visits to take place.
<P>
The mayor will appoint one of the members of the CSGL to chair the group. Members may resign at any time, but will be eligible for reappointment. Any Vacancies on the CSGL will not affect the validity of its procedures.
<P>
In my experience, people who are actively engaged in the cultural and creative life of this, or any other, country are immensely hardworking, expect few&#151;if any&#151;perks and are invariably used to exercising their abilities and talents in surroundings that any other profession would simply walk away from. I cannot believe that the mayor's appointees to the CSGL would be so extraordinarily outwith the main stream of such people and their experiences as to be anything other than intensely dedicated and hardworking. I therefore commend the CSGL and the schedule to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 20, as amended, agreed to.

<P>

<B>The Chairman:</B> The Committee has had a wide-ranging stand part debate. We discussed the activities of David Mellor, that wonderful period in our history of Elizabeth I, and then ancient Greece and Athens. I hope that in future we shall stick more closely to the Bill.
<H4><center>Clause 262</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Mayor's culture strategy</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1223, in page 132, line 2, at end insert `with a clear indication of potential sources of funds to meet any costs involved'.
<P>
I have indicated the manner in which I have tabled amendments to this part of the Bill. Those who maintain a scholarly and vigilant eye will notice that amendment No. 1223 is one of what I would describe in archaelogical terms as the Brooke protoculture amendments rather than the Brooke deuteroculture amendments. Therefore chronologically, and certainly conceptually, it comes before Government amendment No. 1231. The amendment returns to the issue of costs, to which I referred earlier. Having given that simple account, I am prepared to sit down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> As always, the right hon. Gentleman moved his amendment in a delightful way, although I shall not follow him into textual analysis or speculation as to which period of history or prehistory the amendment belongs to. I had a brief moment of anxiety that he might have been concerned about subsection (5)(f) of the clause, thinking that the cultural strategy group would have him in mind when addressing issues relating to
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``antiquities of a movable nature.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have to say to the right hon. Gentleman that it is unlikely that the cultural strategy group, in making its deliberations on the content of the strategy, would ignore the issue of costs and funding, and I do not believe that it is necessary to add the provision that the amendment suggests to the Bill. I hope that he recognises that, and will agree to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster should not, perhaps, be listed as an antiquity, but he should be listed as something that is worth preserving.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In response to the Minister, I remind him of that happy definition of pre-history as a cross between Sir Rider Haggard's ``She'' and Sir Leonard Woolley's Ur. On that note, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1271, in page 132, line 5 leave out `tourism'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take the following new clause 100&#151;Tourism for London&#151;

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The group of proposals is intended further to develop the principle that tourism be given a higher standing in the GLA. We propose establishing a new corporate body, to be known as Tourism for London&#151;removing the tourism function from the culture strategy group to create a strategic body for London tourism.
<P>
Undoubtedly, tourism is important to London's economy. Tourism brings in about &#163;8 billion a year to London and accounts for about 8 per cent. of London's gross domestic product. London accounts for about 15 per cent. of the United Kingdom's gross domestic product, which tells us something about the relevance of London tourism. Currently, more than 85 per cent. of visitor spend is accounted for by overseas visitors. On average, overseas visitors to London stay six nights and spend &#163;500. Of international visitors to the UK, 53 per cent. stay in London during their visit. Tourism is the forecast growing sector of the London economy. Forecasts indicate that revenue could increase at an average of 7 per cent. a year, and reach more than &#163;9 billion a year by 2000. Finally, tourism is one of the largest employers of labour, providing about 200,000 jobs for Londoners.
<P>
Let no one misunderstand the important and relevance of tourism to London's economy. Our concern is that tourism has to a degree been marginalised by the Bill. I accept the Minister's earlier remarks&#151;one problem of tabling a new clause in the right place is that we tend to have the debate before we reach the new clause. Nevertheless, tourism should be given greater standing in the Bill.
<P>
I do not know to what extent the Department has liaised with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, but that Department's tourism strategy, entitled, ``Tomorrow's Tourism'' and published a couple of months ago, states in paragraph 3 of page 24:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Without a strategic authority for London, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult&#151;despite the efforts of the London Tourist Board and London First&#151;to establish a coherent approach to the development of tourism in London or to the development of infrastructure needed to support such a major tourist destination.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am sure that the Minister will say, ``We will have the strategic authority, so we don't have to worry''. The point is that those comments give some idea of the importance of tourism in the eyes of the DCMS.
<P>
The report continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``London needs to continue to invest if it is to benefit from tourism development. To encourage this . . . The new Mayor of London, supported by the London Development Agency and the London Tourist Board, will develop a strategy to ensure that tourism continues to contribute fully to the London economy''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The report then refers to funding for the London tourist board
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``to work with the BTA on overseas promotion of London as a gateway to Britain''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I hope that the Minister will confirm that the current funding for the London tourist board of &#163;1.5 million a year will continue for the next three years, as set out in the DCMS's strategy.
<P>
The report also speaks of the need to ``encourage further hotel development'' and sets a target of 10,000 rooms to be built between 2001 and 2006. However, nothing in the Bill tells us how the Government intend to implement those proposals. We believe that a separate body corporate for tourism would be a positive step towards implementing the Government's declared tourism strategy. When one considers these matters, one realises how important it all is and the scale of the undertakings that have been given by other Government Departments.
<P>
I hope that the Minister will reflect carefully on the need to separate tourism from the cultural strategy. Both are important&#151;I do not seek to belittle the cultural strategy, but I believe that a separate tourism strategy with a separate group of people dedicated to that specific task is probably a more effective way of delivering the Government's worthy pledges, which were in our minds when my party left office in 1997.

<P>

<B>Mr. Simon Hughes:</B> I indicated earlier that we think it right to include tourism, but that we tend to the view that it is better to include it with culture, media and sport than create a separate organisation. There is no theology about that argument, and I understand the hon. Gentleman's case. We agree that it is important to recognise the role of tourism in London, not least its value in creating jobs, attracting inward investment and putting money into the economy.
<P>
Although we are unlikely to support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Croydon, South for the reasons that we gave, we would ask that the London tourist board and tourism in general are given the recognition that the hon. Gentleman wants. We think that that means going further than the list to which the Minister referred earlier.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I applaud most warmly new clause 100 and new schedule 12, which would create Tourism for London. My hon. Friends have done London a service and demonstrated that our party genuinely cares for business. The Labour party will impose road user charges and parking charges, whereas the proposal by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South would provide the mechanism to establish a body that could do something really worth while for London's economy, the quality of life in the capital and its standing in the world.
<P>
The tourism industry is global and highly competitive. It requires more than a virtually parenthetical mention in the Bill under the heading of culture, media and sport, which is what the Government propose. It requires a stand-alone body with properly qualified personnel to promote it. To give a few simple examples, tourism has the greatest importance for the airport system, not just in London but for airports outside it that feed London. It has an impact on inner London but, if properly developed, it could also have an impact on the outer London boroughs. Their tourism potential has hitherto been somewhat neglected and their potential for hotel developments has not yet been fully utilised.
<P>
Tourism has an impact on small and large business, on transport and on the environment of the capital, in how we accommodate the large influx of tourists and in the quality of tourism that we want to develop. It is a strategic matter as well as one of choice.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> I am bothered that my hon. Friend is not taking me with him on this issue. I thought that under the previous group of amendments, my hon. Friend was arguing for 1,000 flowers to bloom naturally, without being inhibited by bureaucrats and bureaucracy. I am distressed that my hon. Friend now seems to be arguing for the creation of a body of bureaucrats and then, even more incredibly, going on to argue that that bureaucracy would help business. Can my hon. Friend help me with this?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Experience has shown that tourist boards have been remarkably effective.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Oh, really?
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> Yes. The English tourist board, the London tourist board and others have been helpful to the industry&#151;of that there is no doubt. It would be a mistake to underestimate the potential of such bodies. It will be up to the mayor&#151;hopefully it will be a Conservative mayor who will count the pennies and demand value for money&#151;to work closely with business to develop business's potential in relation to tourism. I understand the apparent discrepancy in my remarks to which my right hon. Friend referred. However, I believe that the industry is of such manifest importance to the capital's economy and quality of life that my hon. Friend deserves support for tabling the new clause and the new schedule, which I wholeheartedly support.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> There is one aspect of the debate on which I believe that all Committee members are agreed&#151;the importance of tourism to London. It is a vital component of London's economy and a growing source of wealth, and it is in all our interests to continue to develop it to its fullest possible potential.
<P>
However, I disagree with the hon. Member for Croydon, South about the need for a new body to promote London tourism. The mayor will undoubtedly be keen to promote tourism because it is fundamental to the future of London's economy. The mayor is already empowered to do so in many ways. The London development agency, which we debated a week or so ago, will be responsible for creating a strategy for economic development, and tourism will undoubtedly play a significant part in that. The cultural strategy for London should embrace issues related to tourism, because many of London's cultural activities are major magnets drawing tourists to our city. I was grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey in insisting that it would be wrong to delete reference to tourism from the cultural strategy, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South proposes.
<P>
The mechanisms are already in place to enable a proper consideration of issues relating to tourism. There are also bodies in existence to give the mayor the advice that he or she needs on tourism matters. Tributes have already been paid to the London tourist board, and I should like to say how much I personally value the terrific work that it does. David Batts, its chairman, and Paul Hopper, its chief executive, have both shown enormous energy and enthusiasm in promoting London and using the money that the Government make available to extraordinarily good effect to lever in substantial additional private funds. That is all to the good, and it must be wrong to duplicate the excellent work that the London tourist board is doing by creating an entirely new bureaucracy.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was absolutely right to say that we do not need more bureaucrats. We already have bodies that are doing the job well and effectively. It is astonishing that Conservative Members are proposing this unnecessary, bureaucratic structure, which will add no value but simply involve more bureaucrats. That is not the way forward, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> It is telling that the minute one comes up with a new idea, the Labour party immediately thinks, ``More bureaucrats.'' It is quite possible to structure this without involving more bureaucrats. The Ministers may laugh&#151;they are incapable of thinking up ideas without adding more bureaucrats, but this party is capable of doing so. The proposals would promote focus, allowing different groups of people to concentrate specifically on the relevant matters. I remind the Minister that I asked him earlier about the funding of the London tourist board.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me, and I apologise for not having responded earlier. We have confirmed our commitment to supporting the London tourist board. I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks: there is a guarantee of continued funding. I have already mentioned that the Government greatly value the work that the London tourist board does. I also mentioned the cost-effectiveness of the contribution that the Government make to lever in additional funds.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Perhaps the Minister would also respond to the point about hotel development. How does he envisage the cultural strategy group promoting the building of the further 10,000 rooms between 2001 and 2006?
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I thought that the hon. Gentleman would have heard what I said earlier. We do not simply see the cultural strategy group as the means for economic development. We have a development agency, which will be responsible for considering all economic development strategy issues. Unquestionably, the need for additional hotel provision will be one of the priorities.
<P>
Many of the people who already play a key role in the voluntary partnership&#151;the forerunner of the development agency&#151;are well aware of the need for new hotels. That is particularly true of the middle range of the market, where there is a serious gap and where we need to provide more opportunities for people to stay in London. Hotel development will certainly be part of the mayor's strategy and will certainly be on the agenda of the London development agency. There is no particular reason why the cultural strategy group should embrace it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is fine, except that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport White Paper says that such issues will be a matter for the London tourist board, which will work with the cultural strategy group. The Government's White Paper says nothing about the London development agency having the responsibility.
<P>
<B>Mr. Raynsford:</B> I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not listening during the Committee's earlier debates about the role of the London development agency. The message that we have tried, above all, to get across is that we are promoting joined-up government. We are trying to ensure that the various agencies that work with the mayor work together, and that there is consistency between them. We do not want new and unnecessary bureaucratic bodies to proliferate. We want to ensure that that agencies that are involved work together and that the London tourist board continues to do its excellent work, supplemented by the mayor and the London development agency. That is all that is necessary to ensure effective action to promote hotels in London. There is no need for Tourism for London, the new body that the hon. Gentleman wants to foist on us.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I always know when the Minister is on weak ground because&#151;a bit like the Minister for Transport in London&#151;he waves his hands around a lot. He has not persuaded me. There is confusion about the issue. It is obvious that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport takes a different approach to the matter. Under the circumstances, we will not seek leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Wilkinson:</B> I am glad that my hon. Friend has made the stand that he has, and I am sure that he is entirely right to do so. If, as the Government propose, responsibility for tourism is subsumed in the functions of the cultural strategy group, it will have to compete with 15 other items of responsibility. It will not get the attention that it deserves.
<P>
The point that I am sure that my hon. Friend was trying to make quite clear and which the Minister found hard to understand was that the London tourist body that my hon. Friend proposed would be integral&#151;it would be specifically under the mayor, as would the other ancillary bodies within the authority. As such, it would explicitly, clearly and in its own right come under the scrutiny of the assembly, which would provide an input into the deliberations of that group and of the mayoralty and the authority with regard to tourism.
<P>
The tourism industry requires marketing to an extraordinary degree&#151;certainly beyond the financial resources of most small tourist enterprises. A body of the kind that my hon. Friend proposed would, therefore, be entirely appropriate. It would be integral to and work in co-operation with the other bodies connected to the authority and would ensure that the development of tourism in London was fully compatible with other areas of the authority's activity. If it is simply left to the Greater London development agency, it will be one among many areas of economic activity in which that agency has an interest. There is no guarantee that the development agency will have the expertise necessary to secure a good future for tourism in London. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South on his proposed new clause and new schedule, and in his insistence that the amendment be pressed.

<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I rise briefly at the conclusion of an extremely good debate. Earlier, I was pleased to be reinforced by Liberal Democrat support when I spoke to an amendment of mine relating to tourism, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South has entered the field.
<P>
There has been an explosion in tourism during the past 40 years. I recall in far-off days when I worked for the Financial Times reading a review of the OEEC tourism report, which would now be the OECD tourism report. It began memorably with the words, ``Those interested in these matters will want to know that five more Turks visited Iceland last year than in the year before''. At that time, one could poke fun at the modest numbers. An explosion has since occurred, and I am mildly surprised that the Government rejected the overtures of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South. Although the body that he proposes is intended to advance the cause of tourism, we should remember the hazard of the golden age being killed off by too much activity. Somebody should address that problem. I am not totally convinced or reassured that the Bill's provisions and arrangements for tourism provide a natural vehicle for nurturing tourism in accordance with that thinking.
<P>
The hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey is currently absent, but I should like to cite a tiny example. Soho and Covent Garden are now so overwhelmed with tourists that there is a hazard that their previoiusly enormous attraction will gradually diminish. That shows the importance of encouraging activities on the south bank in the way suggested by the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey.
<P>
I cannot speak for my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst, but I for one will be happy to support the amendment.
<P>
