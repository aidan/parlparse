minor and technical amendment will ensure that clause 50 functions as

which the clause inserts, will require co-operation between the
Secretary of State and other people or organisations engaged in health
protection activity, to ensure a joined-up approach to fighting the
spread of disease and other dangers to health. Most provisions in the
Bill extend to England and Wales only, but apply only to England.
However, by virtue of clause 280(3), the intention is that clause 50
will apply across the UK, including the areas covered by the
Governments of the devolved
Administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000023">&#160;</a>

international health. The amendment is necessary to ensure that the
Secretary of State is able to provide assistance outside England under
his duty of co-operation. Section 271(1) to the 2006 Act states that

amendment—the lead amendment. It is perhaps worth saying at the
outset that I am aware that some people argue that HealthWatch England
should be a separate organisation from the Care Quality Commission, or
should have a greater degree of independence from its workings. I
certainly understand their concerns. I also

                           </div>understand the strength of feeling behind ensuring that the patient
voice is heard throughout the health and care system. However, let me
explain why I believe that having HealthWatch England as a committee,
as part of the Care Quality Commission, is the right choice and very
much in the interests of patients and service users.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">As hon.
Members will know, our vision for the NHS is built around the patient.
It includes bringing commissioning decisions closer to patients through
the establishment of commissioning consortia. It also includes the
provision of far more information about the quality of services through
the information revolution, on which we published a
consultation last year; we will publish our reply to the many responses
we received to that consultation in due course. However, the new NHS
will not deliver on that ambition if we do not make sure that patients
have a stronger voice in the system. We have considered how best that
can be achieved and how the patient voice can be amplified through the
new NHS commissioning architecture. As part of the CQC, HealthWatch
England will have a real influence. It will work in partnership with
the commission, with the clear ability to escalate local
concerns.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000040">&#160;</a>

the argument is clear before the hon. Lady attempts to rebut it. The
point I was to make was that a stand-alone body would not have adequate
equipment or resources to be able to deliver for patients. As a
committee of the CQC, HealthWatch England will be able to take full
advantage of its infrastructure and expertise: for example, it will be
able to draw upon the CQC’s extensive information networks and
analytic ability. Returning to the consultation responses, a member of
the public said that the role within the CQC will give HealthWatch
“substantially more weight”.

next point is important because it starts to address directly the
concerns of the Patients Association, for which organisation we have
great respect. We wanted to ensure that HealthWatch England had a
distinct identity within the CQC. That is why it will be a statutory
committee, represented on the CQC’s board by its chair, who will
be appointed by the Secretary of State. The Bill sets out clearly the
committee’s powers to provide advice to the NHS commissioning
board, the Secretary of State, the CQC and
Monitor.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000048">&#160;</a>

amendment 348 would require the CQC to respond in writing to advice and
information that  it receives from HealthWatch England
committee. I sympathise with the point the Opposition are trying to
make on behalf the Patients Association, with the intention of ensuring
that HealthWatch England is able to have its own distinct identity
within the CQC. However, the amendment could work against the building
of effective working relationships between HealthWatch England and the
CQC. Staff working for the committee and the wider commission should be
having an open and ongoing dialogue about their work. Formalising that
as the amendment proposes would give the impression that communication
between the committee, with its independent role, and the CQC should be
conducted by means of correspondence rather than open and ongoing
dialogue. For that reason, we do not support that approach to
prescribing the nature of that
relationship.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000049">&#160;</a>

amendment 415 is simply intended to correct a minor drafting error with
regard to the terms “information” and
“advice”. New section 45A of the Health and Social Care
Act 2008, inserted by the clause, deals specifically with the functions
to be exercised by HealthWatch England. Under new section 45A(3)
HealthWatch is to provide the Secretary of State, the NHS commissioning
board, Monitor and English local authorities with information and
advice on the views of people who use health and social care services
and other members of the public on their needs for and experiences of
health and social care services. Similarly, HealthWatch England is to
provide information and advice on the views of local healthwatch and
other persons, on the standard of provision of health and social care
services, and on whether or how the standard could or should be

                           </strong> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and we
agree that HealthWatch England and local
healthwatch are an important part of the new architecture and an
important way in which the patient voice is heard. I draw attention to
proposed new section 45A of the 2008 Act, which addresses the advice
given by HealthWatch England. Subsection (5)
states:<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000054">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“A
person provided with advice under subsection (3) must inform the
Healthwatch England committee in writing of its response or proposed
response to the
advice.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
would apply to the Secretary of State. It is there in black and white
on the face of the Bill, which is a novelty in legislation. Hopefully
the hon. Gentleman will welcome the fact that we do not leave the
matter to regulations, as used to be done in the past. I hope that
reassures
him.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000055">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
348 would place a duty on the commission to respond in writing to
HealthWatch England with its response or proposed response to the
advice. The reason for the amendment, as the Minister has already
anticipated, is that there is spreading and deepening concern about the
place of HealthWatch England in the CQC. We all agree that we should
have a national healthwatch informed by local healthwatch bodies. That
is greatly to be welcomed, but a structural problem is being created by
the Bill in that HealthWatch England will have a place within the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000061">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The CQC is,
of course, a regulator; it is supposed to conduct investigations. I
have been thinking about what would happen if, for example, HealthWatch
England was suddenly to tell CQC that 40 different hospitals or areas
need urgently to be investigated. The CQC, as we all know, will not
have an ideal amount of investment and will not be of an ideal size.
The Minister frowns, but he knows that. The CQC needs to be much larger
than it is to do its job effectively and make the number of visits it
needs to
make.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000062">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
concerns go together. There is a concern about the amount of money
being spent to set up the CQC and the number of visits it will be able
to make to old people’s homes, for example. On the other hand,
HealthWatch England is supposed to be independent 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 612<a class="bkMark" name="Column612">&#160;</a>
                           </div>and it might need to suddenly tell the CQC that it has to do 40
different investigations for which it simply does not have the staff.
They are sharing a building and HealthWatch England is part of the
sub-committee of the CQC. One could imagine the
good edges of HealthWatch England being knocked off by a close
relationship with the CQC and by being dependent on the CQC for its
funding, its place and everything
else.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000063">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Will the hon. Lady confirm that the legislative
basis for the CQC and in its current arrangements for dealing with
essential standards of quality and safety were put in place during the
last Parliament by the Labour Administration, and that all of the
decisions on staffing levels and budgets were made by that

                              </span>
                           </strong> Yes. What I am saying to the Minister is that
HealthWatch England should not be part of CQC—for the arguments
already made—if it is to have a role that stands up, makes
sense, and does everything that the Government claims it will. I am
quite prepared to be straightforward with the hon. Gentleman on this
issue: I want HealthWatch England to be a strong independent voice for
patients nationally, and for local healthwatch organisations to be the
same locally. My concern is that the legislation does not do this, and
it is quite clear to any open-minded and fair-minded person looking at
the Bill that there are fundamental flaws in the arrangement. That is
why the amendment has been
tabled.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000065">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
may seem somewhat clunky for CQC to have to write back to HealthWatch
England, particularly if they are in the neighbouring office, but the
point is that there is supposed to be some form of separation between
the two bodies. The amendment simply puts some acknowledgement of that
into the Bill. Otherwise we are setting up a body to fail, and that is
the last thing that we
want.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000066">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                           </strong> I take issue with some of the language used, for
example, “spreading and deepening concern”—that is
a very interesting flourish, but I do not think it is evidenced by the
responses to the consultation on the White Paper last year. More than
6,000 organisations responded, and I quoted just a couple of the well
respected organisations that expressed support for the
Government’s approach. Of course we listened carefully to all of
the respondents to the consultation, and indeed we made many changes.
We are trying to make sure that the Bill does exactly what the hon.
Lady says and exactly what we have intended all along. That is to have
a clear, distinct and powerful voice for the patient and public
interest, both at a national level—which does not currently
exist—and at the local
level.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000067">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The difficulty the Minister gets into is that
he tries to set up, with a flourish, bodies that most people agree
with, but when we tell him that although the motivation and ambition
are good, it is not being done in the right way, he does not listen. He
says that there is no spreading and deepening concern. I hope he will
be attending Liberal conference this weekend, where he will hear much
concern expressed about precisely these sorts of

hon. Gentleman has rightly articulated those concerns at all of the key
points considered so far. As he knows of course, there is currently an
independent inquiry taking place, and we are paying very close

the proposed changes to the commission will strengthen its role of

focusing the commission’s attention on the concerns of health
and social care consumers, by working with other bodies to reduce the
regulatory burden on providers and by ensuring that reviews are
conducted in the most appropriate part of the system. I was asked
specifically about what would happen if the CQC needed to investigate
40 hospitals all at the same time. The CQC would work with HealthWatch
England, to act on its concerns. That is precisely the value we attach

Minister’s motivation, I care about the Bill and whether it will
stand up as legislation. The legislation might have an impact on this
country for much longer than the hon. Gentleman is in his current post.
Whatever his motivation is does not really matter—what matters
is that the legislation is good, rigorous and makes

Minister, in answer to questions from the hon. Member for Stafford, did
not give a sufficient response. He should think more carefully about
the hon. Gentleman’s question. Given what happened at the Mid
Staffordshire hospital and that patients were not listened to, it is
important to have a robust
organisation—HealthWatch —fed into by local
healthwatch organisations. The hon. Gentleman’s question needs a
better answer than, “Well, we have an inquiry going on, I am
grateful for the question and we are setting up HealthWatch, which
didn’t exist before.” That is not
sufficient.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000083">&#160;</a>

amendments relating to HealthWatch England. Amendment 416 corrects a
minor inaccuracy in the drafting. Proposed new section 45B(1)(b) of the

after the end of the financial year, HealthWatch England must publish,
I quote,<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000091">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

important to note that the functions set out in clause 166 are those of
the Care Quality Commission. The commission must arrange for these
functions to be carried out on its behalf by HealthWatch England. The
amendment reflects this distinction and properly ensures that
HealthWatch England has to report on the discharge of those functions
by referring to its publishing a report on the way it has exercised,
during the year, functions exercisable by it. In other words, the
report of HealthWatch England will need to cover all the functions it
is responsible for exercising on behalf of the Care Quality Commission
under section
45A.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000092">&#160;</a>

417 ensures consistency in the provision governing the Secretary of
State’s power to direct HealthWatch England if it is failing in
relation to the discharge of functions. It also ensures that he or she
can direct HealthWatch England where it is failing or has failed
properly to discharge a function it is required to discharge, along
with functions under section 45A,. That brings the position in line
with the power of direction under section 82, new subsection (1A)(a),
which relates to the Secretary of State’s power of direction
where HealthWatch England is failing or has failed to discharge those

Amendments 421 and 422 ensure that members of HealthWatch England and

healthwatch organisations will be drawn from local communities, so it
makes sense for local people to have an organisation that puts forward

was attempting to understand them at 11 pm last night, there were some
that were beyond me, so I have been listening with care to the
Minister. Much of what I wanted to say in relation to clause stand part
has already been said, but I will outline our difficulties
briefly.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000106">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Broadly, we
welcome the establishment of HealthWatch England, which provides an
opportunity for increasing patient engagement. We are pleased that
there will be a national body representing the views of users of health
and social care services—the public—and that there will
be local healthwatches. HealthWatch England will advise the Secretary
of State, the national commissioning board, Monitor, English local
authorities and the CQC, which is to be welcomed. We understand the
need for a national body such as this, but it is not an alternative to
proper patient and public representation on key decision-making bodies,
such as the board, consortia and so on, and there will be scrutiny of
that, too. Having patients on HealthWatch England and having local
healthwatch bodies is to be applauded, bit it is not sufficient in
itself, and we need to ensure that there are checks and balances
throughout the system.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000107">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Given
HealthWatch England’s remit, it is a shame, first of all, that
the name HealthWatch does not reflect its responsibility in relation to
social care services. I am sure that the Minister shares my
disappointment that social care is always the Cinderella service when
it comes to health care, because some of the most important care that
happens in this country is social care. If HealthWatch has a
responsibility for not only looking after people’s health, but
social care, we want to ensure that people have a clear signpost.
Ensuring that it is called health-and-social-care watch is a small
thing, but it would make a difference. As some of the most fractured
service areas are in social care, some of the most important work that
HealthWatch is likely to be doing nationally and locally will be to
ensure that the most vulnerable are getting the care that they deserve,
and that people know that they should go to health-and-social-care
watch. That would be helpful. It is a small opportunity that would cost
nothing. Again, it is a symptom of the pace that the Bill is going
through. It is unfortunate that we have not had a chance to think
through such issues. Had we had that chance, perhaps it would be
entitled properly, and the Government could have thought more carefully
about where HealthWatch should be instead of in the centre of the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000108">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">HealthWatch
will provide advice and information to local healthwatch organisations
on their functions, but it will not fund them. One of the strengths of
HealthWatch England is that it will be a national voice for patients,
but unfortunately it will be put under the CQC. That is another
structural problem. Presumably, it will be well informed, know what is
going on nationally, be a national voice for patients and have a
relationship with local healthwatches. However, because it will not
have a financial relationship with local healthwatches, there will not
be a close relationship that would be ideal. There is a phrase,
“Who pays the piper.” It will be local authorities that
will pay for local healthwatches, which are supposed to have a close
relationship with the national HealthWatch. Again that seems to be a
structural problem in the establishment of local healthwatches. I know
that the Minister has received those sorts of

more credence has not been given to those sensible criticisms. We want

                           </strong> The Government have made a great deal about the
importance of giving patients and the public a much stronger and
clearer voice within the NHS, a goal that I support. However, I do not
believe that HealthWatch England as it is currently constituted will
achieve that goal. I would like to make four
points.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000110">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">First,
under the Government’s new architecture for the NHS in the Bill,
there will be three big players—the national NHS commissioning
board run by Sir David Nicholson; the Care Quality Commission, which
will ensure that basic standards of care are met, run by Cynthia Bower;
and Monitor, which will promote competition as a means of improving
quality—or so the Government claim—run by David Bennett.
However, there will not be a fourth, crucial arm, which is a much
stronger voice for patients and the public. I do not agree with the
Government’s approach. I firmly believe that if patients and the
public are to have far greater say, equal to—arguably, it should
be more important than—any of those three bodies, HealthWatch
England should be an independent
body.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
HealthWatch England will lack independence as it will sit within the
CQC. There are two problems with that. Obviously, HealthWatch England
would have to work closely with the CQC, as it would do with any of the
other bodies, including the national commissioning board, because it
would want to ensure that its information was passed up through into
the CQC to allow it to conduct inspections and investigations. However,
what if HealthWatch England thought that the CQC had failed to do its
job or work as effectively as it should have? The hon. Member for
Stafford will know that many players did not act as they should have
over the problems with Mid Staffordshire. How would a committee that
sat within the CQC be able to say, “You have failed to pick up a
certain piece of information
locally”?<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000112">&#160;</a>

                           </span> I know that we are looking
specifically at the clause, which deals with HealthWatch England.
However, I do not think that we can look at it without including the
power and influence of the local healthwatch, which is extremely
important and feeds into the matter. But my main point is that
HealthWatch England will have more influence if it has a seat at the
table, backed up by its statutory role, to influence any Care Quality
Commission issues. I want it to be at the table, and not another
separate body that just makes another report. Let it be at the table to
fight its cause. That is worth considering, without assuming that it
will just lie down and be
complacent.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000113">&#160;</a>

service, I know—from experience in the NHS, which I know he also
has—that it is the big organisations and big players that push
the real decisions and have the real power. Yes, patients can have a
seat at the table, but I firmly believe that they should have their own
table.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000114">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The other
problem related to HealthWatch England sitting in the Care Quality
Commission is about resources, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Islington South and Finsbury said. I take the Minister’s point
that the plan for CQC was established under the previous Government and
was absolutely the right approach, but let us be clear and honest. By
the end of 2012 the CQC has to register 30,000 new providers, including
9,000 from primary medical services which have never been registered
before and 12,500 new providers in social care. That is only the
providers, but it also has to inspect and register individual sites.
That is a huge task and the CQC, like other arm’s length bodies,
is having its resources reduced. I urge hon. Members not to
underestimate how massive that task is. The real concern is that
sufficient resources might not be put into HealthWatch England. If the
Minister wants to guarantee a ring-fenced budget for it, I would be
grateful for his
confirmation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000115">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> What I would like to do is to respond to the
point made by the hon. Lady a few moments ago, which is worth putting
on the record. She referred to the task of registering social care
providers as if that is to be done in the future. I am sure that she
would join me in applauding the CQC for successfully finishing that
work on time and on
budget.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000116">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do, but the Minister will realise that new
social care providers regularly come into the system. I was talking
about the overall number of providers that the CQC will have
registered—I am sorry if I was not entirely accurate in my
comments. Those things change all the time and, under the Government
policy of any willing provider, many more providers might come into the
system. It is a big task and I urge hon. Members to be aware that
HealthWatch England might not receive the resources that it needs for
its vital
role.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000117">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My
third point is also about independence. It is not just that HealthWatch
England will be sitting within the CQC; it is—I hope I have read
this accurately—that the chair of HealthWatch England
will be appointed by the Secretary of State. I am not sure how
independent that person will be, and some

                           </strong> Let me finish this important point. Some members
of the committee of HealthWatch England will be elected—I assume
that they will be from local healthwatches, but that is not
clear—and others will be appointed. Questions have been raised

members will

some sensitivity to that remark, because we should not necessarily be

agree that the whole structure of the Bill will move democratic
accountability a great step forward. It is not necessarily right to
draw the conclusion that the Secretary of State therefore wants to
micro-manage by default by making an appointment. That is clearly not
the intention of  the Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Alas, we are not in government any more, so none
of them are Labour party placemen. The hon. Gentleman may wish to look
at the various reports about Sir David Nicholson’s appointment
as head of the NHS commissioning board. As reported in the <em>Health
Service Journal</em>
                           <em>,</em> he was not the Secretary of State’s
first choice. The Secretary of State wanted somebody else but the
Minister for the Cabinet Office and others intervened to ensure that he
did not get his first choice.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000124">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">My fourth and
final point relates to something that made me spring up earlier to
intervene on the Minister, but alas, he did not take my intervention
very early on. He had said that the Government do not believe that it
would be “in the best interests of patients” to have an
independent body—he referred to a body that is independent of
the CQC, sitting separately from it. However, patients’
groups—not only the Patients Association but Rethink, Diabetes
UK, the Stroke Association, the British Heart Foundation, National
Voices, which represents 100 charities, Asthma UK, the
Alzheimer’s Society, Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Age
UK—have all questioned this. There is a gap between rhetoric and
reality. The charities say:<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“The
reforms will place £80 billion of the NHS budget into the hands

                        </p>
                        <p>They
go on to talk about the problems with local healthwatches, to which we
will come. If the Minister genuinely believes that patients should have
choice, control and a say over how services are run, surely he should
listen to those organisations and give a far stronger role, not only to
HealthWatch England, but to the local
healthwatches.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000126">&#160;</a>

that the key to patient involvement is the ability, first, of people to
make a fuss when it needs to be made, and secondly, of the people in
authority to listen and respond. At the moment we have neither of those
things in practice. We have had weak local organisations. The LINk
organisations—local involvement networks—were variable
across the country, but in my part of the world the LINk was
particularly weak, and we had an organisation higher up such that when
letters were written right up to the Secretary of State’s
office, the response was, “This is not really our business,

trust.”<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000127">&#160;</a>

when one puts that learning into effect is up to local people.
In Staffordshire, the LINks were closed and
re-established under the organisation of the county council, and I
believe that they are better now than they were before. However, I am
certainly not arrogant enough to say that we cannot go on learning all
the

a mechanism by which people’s voices are heard—not only
heard but responded to—must be put in place by legislation. What
is in the Bill is certainly an improvement on the current situation. I
welcome the Minister’s comment that he is following the Mid
Staffordshire inquiry very carefully. If the need for such a mechanism
were to emerge from that inquiry, and if one of the recommendations by
Robert Francis were to be around that issue, I would urge the
Government to look at that very carefully. In my experience, patients
have simply been ignored—not throughout the country necessarily;
it depends very much on the local organisations. In other primary care
trusts, strategic health authorities and foundation trusts, there may
have been extremely responsive people who got things sorted out, but we
must ensure that that applies across the country and is not variable
and dependent on the nature of the people who happen to occupy those
positions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000130">&#160;</a>

rightly needs to be at the heart of the Committee’s
considerations. He is right to highlight some of the weaknesses in the
current patient voice structures as being a cause—at least, a
contributory cause—of what happened in Stafford. The Government
set up the Francis inquiry specifically to ensure that we could learn
lessons across the system. We had hoped that the inquiry would be in a
position to conclude its work and report by now, but that has not
proved possible. We do not deprecate that. It is simply the case that
it is doing a thorough piece of work and we want it to have the time to

on the record at this stage. We would not set up an inquiry without the

                           </strong> Sometimes I think perhaps I should not have given
way. The hon. Lady made a number of points to which I will try to
respond. She made the point that HealthWatch England should not be
inside the CQC. That is a running theme in contributions from
Opposition Members. She argued that we have not considered the matter
enough. One of the recurring arguments is that the pace is too
quick.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000137">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
think we should quickly rehearse the timetable. We had a White Paper
published in July last year. We had a full consultation with more than
6,000 responses. We deliberated on those responses and published a
Command Paper in December, which set out how we responded to the
consultation and how we saw that being reflected in subsequent
legislation. We then published the Bill in January. We are now in
Committee. That does not seem like an undue rush; it seems like a
considered, deliberative process that ensures that Parliament is able
to do its part of the job, which is to properly scrutinise the
legislation in the fashion of the hon. Lady in her attempts both to
improve and to undermine
it.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000138">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I do not know whether the Minister was
listening to “The Food Programme” on Radio 4 when the
Secretary of State—his boss—was asked about trans fats
and he said that it was impossible for him to introduce legislation
quickly enough because of the timetable. We all agree that trans fats
should be banned because they are dangerous. The Secretary of State
said he had to have an agreement with food producers because it was
quicker to do that than to legislate. It struck me that if he can
produce a health Bill such as this one—with all its complexity
and clauses, completely turning upside down the NHS within a short
period of time—he could certainly sort out trans
fats.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000139">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Why does
HealthWatch England not fund local healthwatch? I have a clear
recollection of the arrangements that were made when we last had a
national body responsible for public and patient involvement. I had
conversations at that time with the local organisations that were
established under it, and I know that they felt very much at its beck
and call. The relationship was not a healthy one. That influenced our
decision to ensure that the commissioning of healthwatch at a local
level should sit at the local level, to build on the existing strengths
and relationships between local authorities and LINks and to ensure
that we have a smooth transition to the new
arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000143">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
should also like to pick up the point about funding. By having strong
links into the local authority, local healthwatch organisations, as
with LINks, will still be able to raise concerns about any
commissioning or provision of social care. The hon. Member for
Leicester West referred to the appointment by the Secretary of State of
the chair of HealthWatch England. It is worth reminding the Committee
that similar appointments apply to the big three, as the hon. Lady
described them: the NHS commissioning board, Monitor and the
CQC—and also, for that matter, NICE.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000144">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Monitor, the
CQC and NICE were set up by the previous Government with those
arrangements. It also worth pointing out that the appointments
commission works only on behalf of the Secretary of State and as we
remove that arrangement, all arrangements regarding public appointments
will still be regulated by the Office of the Commissioner for Public
Appointments. So the safeguards are there to ensure that this is not
done in a partisan way, but that the best person for the job is
appointed and able to discharge his or her duties in the public
interest.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000145">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Can
the funding of HealthWatch England be ring-fenced? Who would impose the
ring fence and when does a ring fence turn into an artificial cap that
limits the resources available to HealthWatch England? I am fearful
that that could be the unintended consequence of such a ring-fencing
and for that reason I do not support such a proposition. It is much
better that the creative relationship that will operate between the CQC
and HealthWatch England will provide access to all the analytical
skills and other resources of the
CQC.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000146">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not agree with the hon. Member for Leicester West when she describes
the system architecture as having a big three. I am sure she will want
to disabuse me of that in a moment, but let me develop my point. I do
not agree that the NHS commissioning board, the CQC and Monitor are the
only big three. She has missed out two important ingredients. I think
patients’ voice is an important part of that and the
architecture of the Bill ensures that it will be. Moreover, there is a
change in the relationship between local government and the NHS; local
government becomes part of the architecture as it has never been
before.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000147">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Finally, if
HealthWatch England thinks that the CQC is not fulfilling its statutory
duties and functions, the Bill already provides for HealthWatch England
to write to the Secretary of State to offer advice and information. I
have already dealt with that in respect of her hon. Friend the Member
for Islington South and Finsbury. It is in a unique place to be a
critical friend when it comes 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 624<a class="bkMark" name="Column624">&#160;</a>
                           </div>to challenge around the performance of those tasks. There is a route by
which concerns about the CQC can be directly raised with the Secretary
of State, who has the necessary powers in extremis to deal with that.
With those reassurances, I hope that Members will allow this clause to
stand part of the
Bill.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000148">&#160;</a>

schedule is the bones of the local healthwatch organisations—and
that, unfortunately, does not say a lot. It is one of the schedules
that the Minister, the right hon. Member for Chelmsford, said that he
used to see when we were in government and that he used to complain
about, but I am sure that that is not right. It is difficult, when
looking at this schedule, to understand properly what local healthwatch
organisations will be like. It essentially gives provision for the
Government to introduce, at some future stage, a whole lot of
regulations. Earlier this morning, there was talk about the great
benefit of putting things into the Bill as opposed to there being
regulations at a later stage. This amendment attempts to help with
that.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000166">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is a
sub-clause to proposed new schedule 16A, “Procedures”
(8), to allow local healthwatch organisations to adopt and publish
procedures for making decisions about the exercise of their
functions—in other words, to have a constitution that everyone
knows about—and to review such procedures from time to time, to
ensure that they remain effective and efficient for the purposes of
carrying out their functions. The healthwatch organisations shall
publish and adopt procedures for selecting authorised persons to
exercise the local healthwatch rights of
entry.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000167">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">One
of the great powers that the local healthwatch organisations will have
is the power to insist on going into local provision—for
example, turning up at an old people’s home and saying,
“We want to come in; we hear terrible stories about this
place”. But it needs to be done in a way that has regard to the
safety, privacy and dignity of patients and service
users.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000168">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is also important to find out who should be allowed in and who is not
going to be allowed in and in what circumstances. Those procedures need
to be published by the local healthwatch so that it is in some way
accountable to the local community that it is seeking to serve. Again,
local healthwatch will review such procedures from time to time to
ensure that they work.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000169">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment’s new subsection (2) relates to the procedure to be
followed by the local healthwatch in determining the circumstances in
which it intends to exercise rights of entry. When will it enter local
provision and when will it not? There should be some form of
accountability to the local public, and local healthwatch should meet
in public. Papers should be published in advance so that people know
what they are going to be discussing and they can be involved. The
local healthwatch should publish an annual report on how it has been
carrying out its functions over the preceding 12 months, including an
assessment of how effectively and efficiently it has carried out those
functions and of the changes to health care and social care services
that have resulted.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000170">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We are
offering some flesh to Government Committee members in terms of what
local healthwatch ought to look like. On the face of it, it seems
unlikely that they will vote against such an amendment. It is perfectly
sensible and is offered in good faith.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000171">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have no doubt that this is one of those
amendments that attempts to improve the Bill, rather than undermine it.
However, the amendment as currently drafted is not necessary, not least
because the main thrust of the hon. Lady’s arguments seem to be
about issues to do with requests and rights of entry to properties; she
made that point at some length. It is worth drawing the
Committee’s attention to a clause that we will reach soon,
clause 171. It deals with the issues around rights of entry. For ease
of reference, I should say that it is also covered on page 154 of the
explanatory notes. I think that clause sets out a framework by which
those matters and those questions can be properly answered.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000172">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">But the
amendment relates to clause 168. It sets out a number of new functions
that the hon. Lady has described. That will affect local healthwatch
organisations. Clause 168 amends the Local Government and
Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 to include additional functions,
building on those carried forward from the local involvement networks
in section 221 of the 2007 Act. Section 221 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 627<a class="bkMark" name="Column627">&#160;</a>
                           </div>sets out a duty for local authorities to make contractual arrangements
to ensure that certain activities can be carried out. Currently, those
activities are carried out by local involvement networks.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000173">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 167
provides for the establishment of local healthwatch. Schedule 13 then
makes provision for local healthwatch organisations, such as status,
membership, general powers, exercise of functions and accounts. The
schedule reflects the degree of flexibility that we have in mind for
those organisations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000174">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">For
hon. Members to add a detailed list of procedures is too prescriptive
for these organisations. It would be unhelpful to them as they evolve
and develop. Local healthwatch organisations need to decide locally how
they will be transparent to local people. Earlier, we discussed the
Government amendment that will ensure that they meet in public and that
all their papers are public,

Government have a strong commitment to localism and greater
transparency, which are central to the approach that we are taking to
public service reform, so clear information must be made easily
available so that people can make informed choices and compare and

over-prescriptive inputs really is not the
answer.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000178">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">It
might also be worth underscoring a point that I think the hon. Lady
referred to. A statutory requirement is placed on local bodies to
publish a constitution. That is a much better way of codifying,
clarifying and setting out for the public the way in which those
organisations will discharge their functions.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Some hon.
Members have voiced their concern that there were too many regulating
powers in schedule 13. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State has
quite rightly made the point that, over the last 13 years at least, we
have seen a progressive use of clauses that simply allow regulations to
be made, without there being any detail in the Bill. This Bill reverses
that trend significantly. In effect, it creates the second part of the
NHS constitution because it ensures clarity about how various
organisations within the context of that constitution discharge their
function. So it is a very helpful guide that has not previously existed
because such issues have all been down to individual
regulations.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000180">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There is only
one regulation-making power—in paragraph (2) of new schedule 16A
to the 2006 Act, inserted by schedule 13. Paragraph (7) of schedule 13
enables the Secretary of State to determine matters such

                           </div>as the form in which local healthwatch must keep account. It must
prepare annual accounts. This is not an issue about regulation-making
powers, so I hope that my hon. Friends and the hon. Lady have been
reassured that the amendment is not necessary, and that the provisions
are sufficient to achieve the goal that we all share—an
effective local healthwatch. I resist the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000181">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I want to comment on the hon. Member for
Stafford’s comment that, currently, LINks organisations are very
variable in their standards. The amendment is trying to ensure that we
strengthen and have a minimum standard. If we are saying that it is up
to the local healthwatch to provide their own constitutions, that
allows for some flexibility. The amendment ensures that key standards
are included within the terms of
reference.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000182">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Again, the missing piece of the equation with
LINks was that there was no national body to bring together good
practice, to disseminate that good practice and to provide support and
guidance to these organisations. That is one of the strengths that we
bring through our legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000183">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister says that we should not be overly
prescriptive, but the amendment’s provisions on procedures are
hardly that. They do not say how local HealthWatch should exercise its
rights of entry; they say that it should publicise what it does and
when it is going to exercise its rights of entry. They do not say what
a constitution ought to be, but that it should simply publish its
constitution.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000184">&#160;</a>

central criticism that the schedule is not sufficiently specific. If we
accept the provision, we pass legislation that enables the
establishment of local healthwatch organisations. How do the Government
envisage such organisations? How many staff will they have? How will
funding work in different populations and areas? Dudley, for example,
which is a metropolitan borough, has 306,000 people. How will a
population such as that be served by a local healthwatch? What will be
a sufficiently large—or small—organisation? My own
borough of Islington has a population of 191,000—it is a
metropolitan, inner-city borough. Again, what will be the staffing and
funding levels?<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000192">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If the
provision is accepted, we will establish local healthwatch
organisations in good faith, anticipating that the Government will do
the right thing on regulation, and that local authorities will do the
right thing when they establish the organisations. It is so important
to get that right. Many leaps are to be made in good faith and we hope
that everything will be all right—perhaps it will, but perhaps
it will not.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000193">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">How many
people do the Government anticipate will be employed in Chelmsford,
which is a non-metropolitan district with a population of 167,000? What
will be a sufficient size for a local healthwatch? It is fair to raise
such questions, because we are in the dock when it comes to
establishing local healthwatch, which will be an important part of the
architecture and an important part of ensuring that local
patients’ voices are heard.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000194">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I have a couple of points on healthwatch. I
welcome the establishment of the organisations, but I bring a little
experience from Mid Staffordshire to bear. I realise that this is not
part of the Bill and will come forward in regulations, but to whom,
precisely, will healthwatch be open? As a local councillor, I have
learned that we restrict the pool of people from whom we can draw the
volunteers who serve in organisations such as healthwatch. County
council meetings, for example, are held during the day, so people who
are in employment find it extremely difficult to take part, to become
members or to stand for election.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000195">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It is
therefore vital, when the regulations are introduced and implemented
locally, that great care is taken to ensure that people who are in
full-time employment, women—or indeed men—who stay at
home with young children, and the disabled can be part of the body. We
all have a great interest in healthwatch, but such people are likely to
have an even greater one. From my experience, locally, members of
LINks—or their predecessors—are greatly committed to the
health service, but often the membership does not reflect the widest
range of people.<a class="bkMark" name="11031041000196">&#160;</a>
