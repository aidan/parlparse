</P>
<P>
<B> The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's  Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon):</B> I beg to move, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Access to Justice Bill [Lords],  the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at  half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock  and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Thursday 6th May when  the Committee shall not meet. <P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
May I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson and, in due course,  your colleague, Mr. O'Brien, to the Chair. The Bill is  important; it sets out the Government's proposals for the  wide-ranging reform of our legal system and deals with  many issues in considerable detail. I know that members  of the Committee look forward to our sittings under your  chairmanship. Given that the Bill is wide ranging, rather  than spend undue time debating the sittings motion, I hope  that we can soon proceed with its detail. 
   
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): May I join the  Minister and the Solicitor-General, who will no doubt be  addressing the Committee during our deliberations, in  welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. I trust that we  will have some interesting and fruitful discussions as we  progress through the Bill. 
<P>
Although the Bill will not be in Committee for long,  we shall have enough time draw out some of the big  issues of principle that underlie our concern a matter  in which I am joined by the Liberal Democrat party  and which have not been dealt with properly by the  Government, and perhaps not even thought about by  many Labour Back Benchers. I do not particularly  blame them for that, although one or two notable  exceptions have given much thought to the matter. The  hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) is already  beginning to bridle at the fact that he may have to sit  in Committee and not say very much for some time. I  hope that we shall encourage him and his Back-Bench  colleagues, some of whom are lawyers and some who,  I am happy to say, are not, to join our discussions.  Only two non-lawyers who are members of the  Committee are visible from where I am standing,  although, unfortunately, the hon. Member for Streatham  (Mr. Hill), the Government Whip, who is a fine man  with a good voice, will not be addressing us much  during our proceedings. That is a pity because many of  his constituents would like him to speak on their behalf  and to hear his comments on the Government's  proposals for access to justice. 
<P>
This is called the "Access to Justice Bill" and, were I  a frivolous person, I would have thought that that was  quite a good joke. However, I am not such a person and  I am genuinely concerned about the effects of the Bill and  the Government's wider proposals for the reform of  access to justice. I am not accusing the Minister or his  colleagues of malicious intent, but I fear that the law of  the unintended consequence is about to be visited on the  wider public and on those who in the past have had  reasonable and fair access to the law. 
<P>
Several issues in the Bill are not controversial and I  trust that they will be accepted in Committee with all due  speed. However, many highly important matters need to  be discussed in detail before the Bill returns to the Floor  of the House and the other place. Several amendments  were made to the Bill in the other place and I understand  that, even when the first group of amendments was  discussed, the Government were already marshalling their  forces to do away with clause 1. 
<P>
If I am lucky, I shall hear every Labour member of the  Committee justify the removal of that clause. I am sure  that local newspapers, local radio stations, local branches  of the Law Society, local consumer groups and local  welfare groups will be interested to hear why they are in  favour of the deletion of clause 1, and why they think that  the Government amendment to clause 5 is an adequate  replacement. Clause 1 is the result of an amendment made  to the Bill in another place. That amendment was moved  by Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who is a retired Law Lord,  a noted jurist and, if I may say so, a most humane and  civilised person. 
<P>
As I say, we look forward to hearing why Labour Back  Benchers want to do away with clause 1. We look forward  also to hearing their justification for the amendment to be  made to clause 5, which the Government claim removes  the description of gimmick from clause 1 and replaces it  with something rather better. 
<P>
There will, I fear, be votes from time to time; I trust  that that will not inconvenience Labour Members, who  are no doubt getting on with other matters. We shall  sometimes test the opinion of the Committee, and we  expect the opinion of Labour Members to be justified by  argument and by evidence. 
<P>
The time that we have available to us will allow the  public at large, represented here by Members of  Parliament and those able to listen to our debates, to judge  for themselves whether the Government and their  supporters will be doing right by the public with their  approach to the question of access to justice for the least  well-off. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor </B>(Solihull): I join my hon. and  learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)  and the Minister of State in their welcome to you, Mr. Atkinson, as Chairman of the Committee. 
<P>
Even as we discuss when to meet to scrutinise the Bill,  I am anxious about some of the features in its provenance  that have possibly still to identify themselves. In answer  to a written question, the Minister of State, Lord  Chancellor's Department, mentioned rights of audience  for members of the Crown Prosecution Service, the  proposed Community Legal Service and the proposed  Criminal Defence Service. 
<P>
I had the honour to serve as a junior Minister in the  Lord Chancellor's Department during the previous  Parliament. That experience gave me an insight into the  difficulties of rights of audience in the higher courts,  where there are still privileged monopolies. I do not say  that pejoratively, because I realise the historic reasons that  lie behind those exclusive rights. Indeed, exclusive rights  of audience is probably a better and more felicitous  expression for my purpose. 
<P>
While I was at the Lord Chancellor's Department,  various moves were made and initiatives undertaken to  try to widen the categories of people who might have  rights of audience in the higher courts. In those days,  reference was necessary to a body known by the acronym  ACLEC the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on  Legal Education and Conduct. That body held the ultimate  and decisive hand on whether rights of audience should  be widened. It was, to some extent, a frustrating  experience; not a lot of headway was made. Indeed, there  was a degree of organised resistance from some of those  who held those superior rights of audience. 
<P>
We now have the prospect not merely of reconsidering  the rights of the CPS, an issue that has been around for  some time, but of two new entities that could emerge if  the Bill is enacted the Community Legal Service and the  proposed Criminal Defence Service. 
<P>
The Minister said in his answer: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Government will seek to amend the Access to Justice Bill  to ensure that full rights of audience in the higher courts are  exercisable by lawyers employed by the Crown Prosecution Service,  the Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence Service,  subject to individual lawyers satisfying the qualification  requirements and rules of conduct of the appropriate authorised  body." [Official Report, 22 April 1999; Vol. 329, c. 676.] ,
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
That is all still a little unclear. On balance, I would  welcome progress being made on the subject and I hope  that the Minister and the Solicitor-General can tell us  more. 
<P>
I have an historic interest to declare, inasmuch as I  practised as a high street solicitor for 22 years. My  address was 2 High street, Solihull I was the original  high street solicitor. In those days, I helped start a duty  solicitor scheme to operate in Solihull magistrates court  when such schemes were not backed by statute and  supported by public opinion and the powers that be.  Instead, they required the permission of the Law Society.  They were a certain anathema, as they were seen to strike  against the principle that a defendant is absolutely entitled  to choose his or her own lawyer. In their infancy, duty  solicitor schemes looked as though they prescribed as a  lawyer the person who was on duty and available. That  was not a matter of choice, but more to say, "Well, he's  here if you want him."  There was inertia about that, but  people often said, "Yes, we will take him."  
<P>
We had to get sanction from the Law Society to set up  the scheme, and I was helped in that by a gentleman by  the name of Dr. Denis Grey. At that time, Dr. Grey was  chairman of the Bench of Solihull magistrates and  president of the Solihull Labour party, so it was a  cross-party initiative seen to be in the public good. 
<P>
I believe that duty solicitor schemes have been an  outstanding success. There may be some Government  members of the Committee who would like to identify  themselves as also having been involved in such schemes.  I would welcome that it is slightly scary to think that I  am the only person in Committee who has had first-hand  experience of them. 
<P>
Furthermore, in all the controversies that have  surrounded the legal aid budget, one is bound to remark  that duty solicitor schemes provided the best value for  money of any function of that budget. I think that I know  why that is the case. When it was one's turn to be duty  solicitor, one identified the unrepresented defendants,  made sure that they were all right and knew what was in  prospect for them, and whether they needed some advice  and representation. Once they had been toured all round  the court, human nature being what it was, there was then  a vested interest in dealing with the situation, getting it  over with and returning to the office.   
<P>
There is a downward pressure on time in that specific  area of legal aid expenditure that is probably almost  unique. In every other area of legal aid activity, there is  either no downward pressure on time or a perverse  pressure to lengthen affairs. Duty solicitor schemes,  having come into being in a slightly intuitive and  experimental way, have turned into something utterly  worth while for all concerned, not least for magistrates  and their clerks. Such people are frequently ill at ease  when they have unrepresented defendants before them.  The temptation for a magistrates clerk is sometimes to try  to help them, which gives him or her professional  problems. If he or she is tending to the assistance of a  party, is he or she maintaining the impartiality also needed  to advise the Bench? 
<P>
The emergence of the duty solicitor scheme has suited  solicitors, other court services and the probation service.  It has probably suited the police and the custodial  services. As far as I can see, it has suited everyone at no  great cost. 
<P>
Even as we are preparing our work, I want to take the  opportunity to say that if the proposals in the Bill, some  of which are rather unspecific and not very sharp of focus,  are intended to supplant, replace and do away with duty  solicitor schemes, they are profoundly bad. They will do  something perverse, contribute nothing and negate the  concept that seems to be, or should be, embodied in the  title of the Bill, Access to Justice. 
<P>
<H5>10.45 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Duty solicitor schemes have contributed handsomely to  the concept of access to justice. If the Government intend  to strike them down, I shall resist them with all my  strength, based on what I think is right and my experience.

<P>

<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): I join  the Minister and the hon. and learned Member for  Harborough in welcoming you, Mr. Atkinson, and, in due  course, Mr. O'Brien, to the Committee. I too must declare  an interest, in that I am still a partner of a firm of  solicitors, but, as I have said before, I shall shortly retire  from that position. 
<P>
I summarised my views on Second Reading on 14 April. There is a worrying paradox in the Lord  Chancellor's words in the foreword and in the aims and  objectives section of the White Paper, "Modernising  Justice" , the precursor to the Bill. Unfortunately, the Bill  falls significantly short of the objectives that he has set.  The Government fail to live up to those objectives. Where  the Government fall short of the principles that they  themselves have set out for the Bill, we shall vigorously  challenge them in order to ensure genuine access to  justice. 
<P>
Question put and agreed to. 
<P>
Resolved, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That, during proceedings on the Access to Justice Bill [Lords],  the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at  half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock  and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Thursday 6th May when  the Committee shall not meet. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I shall deal first with one or two  housekeeping matters. I remind the Committee that there  is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies  of which are available in the Room. I also remind hon.  Members that adequate notice of amendments should be  given. As a general rule, Mr. O'Brien and I do not intend  to call any starred amendments that may be reached  during an afternoon sitting. The Bank holiday next  Monday affects notice required for next Tuesday's sitting.  In order to be unstarred and therefore selectable next  Tuesday, amendments should be submitted not later than  the rise of the House this Thursday, 29 April. 
<P>
Resolved, 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely,  Clauses 1 and 2; Schedule 1; Clauses 3 to 7; Schedule 2; Clauses 8  to 15; Schedule 3; Clauses 16 to 24; Schedule 4; Clauses 25 to 36;  Schedule 5; Clauses 37 and 38; Schedule 6; Clauses 39 to 57;  Schedule 7; Clause 58; Schedule 8; Clauses 59 and 60; Schedule 9;  Clauses 61 to 69; Schedule 10; Clauses 70 to 83; Schedule 11;  Clause 84; Schedule 12; Clauses 85 to 88; new Clauses; new  Schedules.

<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 17, in  page 1, line 15, after `of', insert

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take  the following: Amendment No. 18, in page 2, line 4, at  end insert  
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) that persons obtaining access to legal services under this Part  shall have the widest possible choice of provider or services'. 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Clause 1 stand part. 
<P>
Government amendments Nos. 3 to 6. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> We now begin the rather more detailed  analysis of the Bill for which I must move my chair.  (Laughter.) Sadly, that is probably not the final laughter  that we shall hear from the Government Benches,  probably because labour Members' minds are not fully on  the matters under consideration. I dare say that over the  next few days they will become rather more acquainted  with the Bill's content. 
<P>
The clause was added to the Bill in the other place  following a debate on 11 February. It was proposed by  Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a retired Law Lord. The  Government were defeated in the House of Lords and  clause 1 was added because the Bill as previously  drafted and, no doubt, as it will stand when the  Government have their way in this Committee was  remarkably empty of detail. As I have said, I look forward  to hearing from Ministers why the Government want to  re-amend the Bill by deleting clause 1. 
<P>
This is a coathanger Bill. It will allow the Lord  Chancellor by regulation, some of which will be  constrained by the need for affirmative resolution in both  Houses to do many things to the way in which the courts  are run and to the way in which we ensure that our  constituents gain access to legal services and the courts.  However, the Bill does not provide much detail; it is an  enabling Bill, following which the Lord Chancellor will  be able to introduce secondary legislation to give effect  to the powers that he will be given under the Bill. 
<P>
The principles that should apply to the use of part I   were not made clear. Therefore, the Lords added clause  1(1), which states: 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Every person exercising functions in connection with this Part  must act, so far as possible, in a way which is compatible with the  objectives set out in subsection (2)."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Part I deals with the creation of the Legal Services  Commission and its two subsidiary bodies the  Community Legal Service, which is intended to replace  the current civil legal aid system, and the criminal  Defence Service. The CDS is a wholly new concept to the  law of England and Wales and is the mirror image of the  Crown Prosecution Service, or the nearest equivalent to  that. It will constitute a state-funded form of  representation for those accused of criminal offences. 
<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I wonder whether my hon. and  learned Friend would care to comment on the fact that a  criminal defendant at the Crown court faced with being  prosecuted by a lawyer on the state payroll may find that  he can turn for advice only to another lawyer on the state  payroll. How does my hon. and learned Friend feel  about that? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I feel uncomfortable about it, and we  shall have an interesting debate when we come to clause  13 and the subsequent clauses under the subheading, "The  Criminal Defence Service" . While we are discussing part  I, to which the provisions on the CDS are relevant. I echo  what my hon. Friend has said. What he suggests is likely  to happen in many criminal cases, but not in all. To be  fair to the Government, criminal representation will be  provided by not only state employees but by members of  the private profession. 
<P>
None the less, the Bill constitutes the beginnings of a  state system of prosecution and defence. Those whose  liberty and reputation is at risk will be assisted by  employees of the state, whose intentions and motives  may, whether wittingly or unwittingly, be somewhat  diffuse and not concentrated on the aims of the private  practitioner, defendant's counsel or solicitor that is,  fearlessly to represent his client irrespective of his  promotion prospects or other matters. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman is  criticising proposals that will, perhaps initially, allow  relatively few lawyers to be directly employed by the  Criminal Defence Service. Is he saying that the  Conservative party opposes that in principle? 
<P>
<B> Mr. Garnier:</B> The Minister will find that we are a party  or principle and that we are discontent with many of the  Bill's provisions. 
<P>
When we come to clause 13 stand part, the hon.  Gentleman and his ministerial colleagues will find that,  although they may win the vote, they will not be able to  guarantee the whole-hearted support of the wider public.  I do not deny that the hon. Member for Streatham will be  able to sleep easy most nights, knowing that on Tuesday  and Thursdays he can deliver to the Chief Whip what is  required by the Lord Chancellor and the Government's  business managers.   
<P>
The Minister lives a dangerous life shuttling between  the Government Whip's Office and the Lord Chancellor's  Department, occasionally popping in for tea or  something of a similar nature with his boss, the Lord  Chancellor, to be given further advice on how to make  progress with this Treasury-driven Bill. It will not  necessarily be an altogether comfortable journey because  the Committee will bring him face to face with some of  the consequences of what he and his Government  colleagues propose. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The answer that I want to be brought face  to face with is whether the hon. and learned Gentleman  opposes the provisions that allow for the direct  employment of defence solicitors by the Criminal  Defence Service. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am not in favour of the setting up of  the Criminal Defence Service. However, because I can  add up as well as the Minister can, I know that there will  be a CDS. I know also that the Minister will have to live  with the consequences of it. I am concerned that, under  the CDS, those accused of criminal offences will not be  given a choice of representation in court or of an adviser  prior to a case coming to court. 
<P>
If the Minister thinks that that is fine and that he can  sign the declaration that the Bill complies with the Human  Rights Act 1998 and the convention, that is a matter for  him. I suggest, however, that he may have to argue his  way out of that problem. I am disappointed that a  Government who used to represent the poor and those  unable to fend for themselves should now provide an  Access to Justice Bill that will inhibit access to justice.  The Bill will inhibit the freedom to choose a  representative who can fearlessly appear in the courts,  irrespective of the career and promotional needs and the  office politics that will apply in a state defence service. 
<P>
I had not intended to divert to an essay on the ills of  the CDS, but one has only to go to the United States to  see what happens in jurisdictions there to understand that  a state defence service is not ideal. Indeed, it is not  supported by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of  the United States, who has made clear his support for the  way in which the independent advocate in this country,  whether a solicitor or a barrister, can appear for a  defendant unhindered by concerns about whether his  promotion or career prospects in the CDS depend on how  he performs. 
<P>
Before I gave way to the Minister, I was seeking to  explain, as best I could it may not be apparent to some  members of the Government team how clause 1 came  into being. It was introduced by Lord Lloyd of Berwick.  It was the opinion of the majority of their Lordships that  the Bill was deficient because it did not set out clearly the  objectives that should be applied by those operating the  Legal Services Commission, the Community Legal  Service and the Criminal Defence Service.  
<P>
In moving the amendments, my hon. Friends and I  and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon  (Mr. Burnett) seek further to improve the objectives  listed in clause 1. The objectives are 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that persons have access to legal services and the machinery of  justice which they would otherwise be unable to obtain on account  of their means; ... that such access is not to be impaired on account  of disability (within the meaning of the Disability Discrimination  Act 1995) or the place in England and Wales where any legal  services are sought"  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
and 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that legal services and facilities of high quality be available such  that disputes may be resolved, and proceedings determined,  expeditiously, fairly and with the parties placed on an equal  footing."  
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11 am  </H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendment No. 17 would insert in line 15 of the clause  after "of"  the words 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"racial grounds, gender, sexual orientation" . 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Amendment No. 18 would add a subsection (d), which  states 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that persons obtaining access to legal services under this Part shall  have the widest possible choice of provider or services."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
Lord Lloyd's proposal was eminently civilised and  sensible because, despite what the Lord Chancellor said  in the other place on 11 February, the remainder of the  Bill is deficient. The clause is necessary because what is  proposed under Government amendment No. 5 to clause  5 does not meet the glaring need that is apparent in the  Bill. Why are the Government shying away from making  it a clear objective, which can be tested and taken by  judicial review to the courts, that a functionary under the  Legal Services Commission, the Community Legal  Service or the Criminal Defence Service ensures that  people have access to legal services and the machinery of  justice that they would otherwise be unable to obtain on  account of their means?

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Dismore </B>(Hendon): The hon. and learned  Gentleman referred to the lack of detail in the Bill, but I  am troubled about the lack of detail in the subsection.  Perhaps he could explain how, for example, a litigant who  wished to instruct a Queen's counsel but who could not  afford to do so would be debarred from a judicial review  if that were denied to him by the Community Legal  Service? There is no proportionality in subsection (2)(a). 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Did the hon. Gentleman say "could" or  "could not"  afford a Queen's counsel? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Could not. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The ability or inability to afford a  Queen's counsel does not impair access to the courts.  Plenty of members of the Bar and of the hon. Gentleman's  profession can argue more than adequately matters that  need to be decided by the courts. I know that he has a  fixation about Queen's counsel and I hope that, one day,  the Lord Chancellor will put him out of his misery and  make him a silk so that we do not have to listen to his  fulminations on the subject. If ever an argument were  advanced for the retention of the Queen's counsel system,  the hon. Gentleman is it. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I am grateful to the hon. and learned  Gentleman for giving way; no doubt we shall return to  the issue of Queen's counsel later in our proceedings.  However, he is trying to duck my point. Subsection (2)(a)  refers to access to legal services; it does not refer to  proportionality in access to legal services. Legal services  are, for example, provided by QCs. I could certainly not  afford to instruct a QC if I were involved in litigation so,  on account of my means, I would be unable to obtain  access to legal services. Nothing in the clause would  prevent me from applying by way of judicial review to  the courts if I were denied access to a QC in such  circumstances. The clause contains no proportionality. Let  us suppose that I do not have the means to employ a QC,  but that I want a QC and to go to judicial review. How  will the hon. and learned Gentleman answer that point? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I answer it by asking the hon.  Gentleman, if he has been considering the clause since  February, why he has not tabled an amendment to deal  with that point? If he thought that it was worth making at  all and was not simply some tedious debating point, he  would have had the courage to table an amendment. No  doubt he has been advised by the Government Whips that  interventions during our deliberations should be limited,  and should certainly not include adding things to Order  Papers and amendment papers, as that would be deeply  off-message. 
<P>
Despite the hon. Gentleman's experience in the law and  the way in which he presents himself and his arguments  in Committee and on the Floor of the House, I am not  convinced that he has bothered to read over the page. If he  reads clause 1(2)(c), he will see that the third objective is 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that legal services and facilities of high quality be available such  that disputes may be resolved, and proceedings determined,  expeditiously, fairly and with the parties placed on an equal  footing."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore) may think  I think that the argument was advanced by the Lord  Chancellor against the clause in the other place that that  means that the publicly assisted litigant, through state  assistance, should be able to have access to lawyers  getting the same rates of remuneration as members of the  privately funded profession. 
<P>
For example, let us say that Mr. Derry Irvine, as he  then was, appeared in a case and charged £20,000 on the  brief and £2,000 a day I have no idea whether those  figures underestimate the sort of fees that he used to  receive in his days at the Bar, but let us take them as  round figures. It is not our purpose to ensure that the  bodies that will be created under part I of the Bill should  be able to fund opposing lawyers at those rates, but they  must be able to fund opposing lawyers at such rates as  will attract someone of an equal legal quality as, in this  case, Mr. Derry Irvine, be he a QC or be he someone else,  so that the parties are given equality of footing. 
<P>
To be honest, although I am a great admirer of the  ability of the hon. Member for Hendon to turn any  discussion, be it about the weather, cricket, decorations or  anything else, into a discussion about the worth or  otherwise of retaining the system of Queen's counsel, I  feat that his recent intervention did him no good whatever. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Dominic Grieve </B>(Beaconsfield): It is apparent that  the intervention by the hon. Member for Hendon is  complete bilge. Under the existing legal aid system, the  question whether one is represented by Queen's counsel  arises, but the fact that one side is so represented has  never automatically meant that the legally aided party  should be so represented as well. In my own experience,  I can think of no occasion when, if an application has  been turned down, that has subsequently been the ground  for arguing that the way in which the legal aid service  operates is wrong. 
 
<P>
The point made by my hon. and learned friend is  correct. There has to be equality, and therefore by the  nature of the case a barrister or solicitor of sufficient  seniority needs to be appointed to represent the party. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his  intervention and I trust that the hon. Member for Hendon  and his colleagues are now satisfied. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Gareth Thomas </B>(Clwyd, West): Will the hon. and  learned Gentleman give way? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Another keen young man wishing to  get on. 
<P>
<B>Mr. Thomas:</B> I have listened with interest to the  comments of the hon. and learned Member for  Harborough. He has not answered the point eloquently  made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon. In the  light of clause 1(2)(c), what does the hon. and learned  Gentleman say about the equality of legal services? Surely  the amendment as it stands is an invitation to frivolous  applications for judicial review? 
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I think that the short answer to that is  why. If the hon. Gentleman is in the business of making  frivolous applications in his professional career, it says  more about him than about clause 1. 
<P>
I shall deal with the arguments that the Lord Chancellor  used against clause 1 in the other place on 11 February.  He began by saying that nothing that he was about to say  should be taken as in any way showing that he was 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"not in some sympathy with the broad aspirational purposes of the  new clause."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He used the phrase "broad aspirational purposes"  several  times during debates on the amendments that he moved  and on that moved by Lord Lloyd of Berwick. At least  we have the Government's good will on the aspirations  behind the clause, but we do not have their practical  assistance; nor have they given the matter mature thought,  as is shown by the two interventions that we have heard. 
<P>
The Lord Chancellor then says that his 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"preference is for separate clauses setting out the purposes of the  community legal service and the criminal defence service."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He also believes that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that approach better reflects the different nature and objectives of  the two schemes."  
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
He also believes that 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"that will be a tighter and more effective means of defining what  the legal services commission will do and what directions and orders  the Lord Chancellor may give separately in relation to each  scheme."  
 
<P>
</UL></FONT> 
<P>
I understand what he is trying to do and the rationale  behind his arguments, but his proposals will not provide  a common set of objectives or principles that bind those  operating or working in the ambit of the Legal Services  Commission, the Community Legal Service or the  
Criminal Defence Service. 

<P>
It might be thought that this is merely an argument of 
style, not one of substance. However, it seems to me 
the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon might 
agree that it is best to set out the ruling principles and 
objectives of any Bill at the outset. Rule 1 of the new civil 
procedure rules sets out the objectives and principles of 
the new regime in civil courts, so it is entirely sensible, 
logical and reasonable that clause 1 should be retained 
and that it should govern both subsidiary bodies and the 
operation of the Legal Services Commission. 

<P>
The Minister would lose nothing if he were to introduce 
his version of a clause on the objectives and principles at 
the beginning of the Bill. I am disappointed that neither 
he nor any of his hon. Friends thinks that appropriate. If 
they believe that clause 1 is deficient and needs 
improvement, I am disappointed that they have not 
thought fit to amend it themselves. I am also disappointed 
that, so far at least, the Government have not adequately 
addressed themselves to the value of the clause and the 
arguments put forward in the House of Lords. 

<P>
The Lord Chancellor then said that he had 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"difficulty in seeing why discrimination on the grounds of 
disability is singled out by contrast with other forms of 
discrimination which exist in society."  [Official Report, House 
of Lords, 11 February 1999; Vol. 597, c. 333-4.] 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That is a fair point. Therefore, under amendments Nos. 17 
and 18, we would provide a remedy by extending the 
grounds of discrimination beyond disability within the 
meaning of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to 
include 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"racial grounds, gender, sexual orientation" . 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
We then deal with the geographical discrimination that 
we fear may arise. 

<P>
Those are not empty points. I understand that, given the 
abolition of legal aid for a raft of types of case and given 
the increase in franchising and block contracting, the 
number of solicitors' firms in England and Wales able to 
provide access to legal assistance will fall from about 
11,000 to about 3,000. That is likely to lead to a denial of 
access to justice simply because of the numbers involved. 
It will lead to a geographical restriction of the areas in 
which firms of adequately qualified solicitors are 
available.

<P>

<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman 
will explain how proposed paragraph (d) would prevent 
or protect a potential client from hiring a lawyer who was 
incompetent or who charged twice the going rate. 

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I shall discuss proposed paragraph (d) 
after I have dealt with paragraphs (b) and (c). 

<P>
Geographical restrictions on access should worry not 
only those of us who represent provincial towns and rural 
areas. It should also worry those who represent inner-city 
areas. The point about rural access to justice is obvious. 
The main town in my constituency, Market Harborough, 
has about six or seven firms of solicitors, all of which 
operate some form of legal aid assistance. They are firms 
of high street solicitors like that of my hon. Friend the 
Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor); indeed, four out of six 
are on the high street. The largest firm has a partnership 
of about four or five, with perhaps two or three fee earners 
in addition to the partners. The smallest is a one-partner, 
single practitioner firm with perhaps one or two 
employees. 

<P>
I do not know how many of those firms will apply for, 
or have already succeeded in attracting, a contract under 
the new arrangements, but it is likely that they currently 
provide access to justice for people over about 1,000 
square miles of England. People come north from 
Northamptonshire and south from other parts of 
Leicestershire for advice and representation from those 
high street solicitors firms. I suspect that four, perhaps 
even five, of those six firms will go. 

<P>
It might be said that if those firms are not able to secure 
a franchise or block contract, they should go and should 
not provide the access to justice that they currently 
provide. However, such an argument misses the point. No 
one has ever suggested that any of those firms is incapable 
or inadequate in any aspect of its provision of access to 
the law and to advice and representation. Nevertheless, 
the drawing of the purse strings will, necessarily, reduce 
the number of firms from about 11,000 to about 3,000, 
with a corresponding reduction in my town and, no doubt, 
in towns such as Beaconsfield or in west Devon, 
Gloucestershire, north Oxfordshire and other rural areas. 
However, the provision will also apply to inner-city areas. 
Although Solihull is not a traditional inner-city area, it 
is not endangered by the sparsity factor present in rural 
Leicestershire, rural Oxfordshire, rural Gloucestershire 
or Devon. 

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> To underline the point that my 
hon. and learned Friend has just accurately made, the 
largest open spaces in my constituency are golf courses. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> It may be that not everyone who walks 
across those golf courses is worried about the 
Government's proposals, because they have disposable 
income that allows them to exercise discretion about how 
to spend their money. By virtue of their means, they will 
be able to go to any lawyer who they choose, whether in 
inner Birmingham, inner Solihull or London. However, 
perhaps the employees of the golf clubs who cut the grass 
and keep the courses looking as fine as they no doubt do 
do not have such incomes, and will be denied the access 
to the law to which they are currently entitled. 

<BR>




<P>
I shall speak about some of the areas represented by 
Opposition Members. I do not know the democratic 
make-up of Dudley, Upminster or Hastings. The hon. 
Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) has not 
blessed us with his presence this morning; he is doubtless 
doing something else. Plymouth is not similar in every 
respect to the leafy suburbs of Solihull. I know from 
personal experience that Streatham is not a wildly well-off 
place. The rural hinterland of Ashfield, the Minister's 
constituency, is not exactly brimming with people with 
lots of money to spend. 

<P>
The hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Linton) he, too, 
seems to be busying himself with other matters 
represents an inner city seat. Wellingborough, which I 
have visited, is one of those half-and-half places; it is 
reasonably well-off but, like my constituency of 
Harborough, it has pockets of deprivation. I do not know 
Clwyd, West or South Derbyshire, but I know that 
Leicester  

<P>
<B>Mr. Mark Todd </B>(South Derbyshire): I have been 
missed out. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Member for South Derbyshire 
(Mr. Todd) is quite right; I look forward to speaking to 
solicitors in South Derbyshire to ascertain whether they 
are wholly supportive of their Member of Parliament's 
view on clause 1. I do not mean to be patronising, but I 
was impressed by the hon. Gentleman's excellent speech 
on Second Reading. It was thoughtful, and not entirely 
supportive of the Government's proposals. Perhaps the 
hon. Gentleman is the token rebel but not too rebellious 
a rebel. I hope that he will be able to maintain his sceptical 
attitude about what the Bill may do for his less well-off 
constituents. 

<P>
The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), who 
was here a moment ago but who has slipped off to better 
things, represents parts of inner-city Leicester. From my 
knowledge of that city, I would be very surprised if the 
less well-off people there and those who live in 
Southampton, Test were entirely supportive of the 
Government's decision to remove clause 1. Subsection 
(2)(b) requires those operating within the system to 
ensure that 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"access is not to be impaired on account ofthe place in England and 
Wales where any legal services are sought."  

<P>
The reason why those who live in inner cities will be 
as much affected as those who live in less populated rural 
areas is that, as a consequence of the Bill and wider legal 
reforms, solicitors will eventually go where the market 
sends them. The likelihood is that cases from the less 
well-off areas, particularly inner cities, will be more 
difficult and less remunerative. 

<P>
As a consequence, it will not be economically sensible 
or viable for those firms to remain there. Much as 
members of those firms might like to stay many of them 
have a social conscience and work for the free 
representation units or the equivalent for the solicitors' 
profession they will not be able to afford to remain in 
their inner-city offices. They will not be able to earn 
enough money to pay the rates and rent or to employ 
younger solicitors; they will therefore not be able to 
provide a service. Hence, there will be a flight from those 
inner-city areas to the marginally better-off and much 
better-off areas found in the main thoroughfares of the big 
cities, and the well-to-do areas such as the one represented 
by my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull. 

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Dismore:</B> I wonder whether the hon. and learned 
Gentleman has considered that the legal profession, 
particularly specialist lawyers, tend to congregate where 
the work is? Housing law is primarily concentrated in 
inner cities and, as we know from what my hon. Friend 
the Minister said in response to press comments, it will 
still come within the ambit of legal aid. I know from my 
interest in personal injury law that the major personal 
injury specialist practices are based in inner cities. Has the 
hon. and learned Gentleman taken that into consideration? 

<BR>




<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman is quite right: 
housing law is one of the provisions of what is loosely 
called civil legal aid that the Government propose should 
remain publicly funded. I am pleased about that, as I am 
sure are the hon. Gentleman and many of his colleagues. 
It may be true in Hendon as it is in Leicester that 
constituents come to our surgeries primarily because they 
have housing or immigration problems, but the greatest 
public concern about the removal of publicly funded legal 
assistance is with regard to personal injury. 

<P>
 Many people who have had access to the courts and 
justice by virtue of the legal aid system and who, say, live 
in Hendon, Southampton, Plymouth or Leicester will not 
have such access in future because such solicitors will 
not be practising in those areas, but in big cities such as 
Birmingham and London. The hon. Gentleman's former 
firm, Russell, Jones and Walker, which used to instruct 
me when I was a junior at the Bar, operates from Gray's 
Inn road. That is not the sort of firm that my hon. Friend 
the Member for Solihull would recognise as a high street 
firm of solicitors, nor is it the sort of firm that those who 
practise in my high street in Market Harborough would 
recognise as such. Russell, Jones and Walker is a large 
concern with a turnover of millions of pounds. I would 
not be surprised if it now has nearly 50 partners and 
employs about 200 people in its office in Gray's Inn road. 
That is not a typical high street firm of solicitors. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the hon. and learned Gentleman 
agree that people in remote country towns with housing 
or personal injury problems who need to consult solicitors 
may not be able to afford the time or the money to do so? 
They might not have cars to enable them to travel 40 or 
50 miles to consult solicitors in a large city. They do not 
do that now; they go to local solicitors. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman speaks from local 
and personal experience. I sympathise with his argument; 
it is reflected in my constituency and in similar other rural 
constituencies. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member 
for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson) whose constituency is in 
rural Gloucestershire has had similar experiences, as has 
my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry). 

<P>
It is a pity that the Government have not got their heads 
round the consequences of their actions. As I said at the 
outset, I am not accusing the Minister of acting out of an 
ill motive. I am personally rather fond of him something 
that no doubt will embarrass him and ruin his career.
I fear that the Government are being thoughtless and that 
the consequences of the Bill will be with us for many 
years to come. That will be evidenced by people from 
rural areas queuing up at the Minister's surgery at 
weekends and those of his hon. Friends wanting to 
complain about this, that or the other, saying, "Where are 
the lawyers? They are no longer here. I am being denied 
access to justice."

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman must have a 
springing mechanism in his back. 

<BR>




<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> When the hon. and learned Gentleman 
kicked off, he challenged me to become involved in the 
debate and that is what I am trying to do. 

<P>
People come to my surgery about legal services not 
complaining that they cannot get access to good lawyers, 
but wanting a recommendation of another firm of lawyers 
because their present ones have cocked up their case. The 
biggest problem is of people taking on work that they are 
not qualified to undertake. The thrust of what we are 
trying to do through block contracting and other proposals 
is to ensure that people have access to high quality legal 
advice at an affordable price. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> That may be true but it is an entirely 
different point. At the moment there is a wide availability 
of lawyers to serve the public. In future, people will not 
come to the hon. Gentleman's surgery to say, "I am 
concerned about my lawyer, who's got it wrong,"  or, "Can 
you recommend a lawyer that I can go to?" . If they do, it 
will be in addition to asking where the lawyers are in 
Hendon, Upminster, Leicester, Wyre Forest or wherever. 
It may be legitimate for the hon. Gentleman to tell us 
about his experiences in his surgery now, but I will be 
interested to hear what his experiences in the same 
surgery two or three years hence will be like. I suspect 
that he will have a far wider range of complaints, many 
based on the absence of any lawyer to whom to have 
access. 

<P>
In the Lords on 11 February, the Lord Chancellor 
objected to clause 1(2)(c), laying specific emphasis on 
the words 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the parties placed on an equal footing."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
The Lord Chancellor said: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I believe that my proposed purpose clause for the criminal 
defence service, which speaks of the interests of justice, covers that 
point adequately. As regards the community legal service, I believe 
that that objective may place too much emphasis on proceedings 
and disputes, but its underlying purpose is adequately and 
realistically met by the reference in my purpose clause to services 
that can meet people's needs."  [Official Report, House of Lords, 
11 February 1999; Vol. 597, c. 335.] 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
I do not suggest for one moment that the Lord 
Chancellor did not believe what he said. However, I 
return to my concern that we hope to provide, by the 
retention of clause 1, that there will be legal service
providers if I may use that awful expression of high 
quality available to those who have to use the 
state-assisted system, and that their 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"disputes may be resolved, and proceedings determined, 
expeditiously, fairly and with the parties placed on an equal 
footing."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
As I said not long ago in response to an intervention, 
saying that the parties should be placed on an equal 
footing does not mean that the state has to pay the levels 
of remuneration form time to time available to the 
privately funded profession. It should mean that the 
publicity funded advocate, or rather the publicly funded 
litigant, is placed on some sort of parity with the 
commercially funded opponent. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I believe that the current clause 1 was 
introduced by Lord Noland and Lord Lloyd of Berwick, 
both distinguished Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. Does the 
hon. and learned Gentleman agree that the words in clause 
1(1), "so far as possible" , answer the question asked by 
the hon. Member for Hendon on proportionality? In other 
words, the person exercising functions must act "so far as 
possible"  within the set budgetary constraints. 

<BR>




<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The hon. Gentleman might find it 
instructive to compare the current clause 1 with 
amendment No. 5, which is the Minister's preferred 
purposes clause. It will deal with the Community Legal 
Service, stating: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`() Every person who exercises any function relating to the 
Community Legal Service shall have regard to the desirability of 
exercising it, so far as is reasonably practicable, so as to  

<P>
(a) promote improvements in the range and quality of services 
provided as part of the Community Legal Service and in 
the ways in which they are made accessible to those who 
need them, 

<P>
(b) secure that the services provided in relation to any matter 
are appropriate having regard to its nature and 
importance, and 

<P>
(c) achieve the swift and fair resolution of disputes without 
unnecessary or unduly protracted proceedings in court.'. 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
I am not sure that there is much to be gained from the 
difference between the line taken in amendment No. 5 and 
that taken in clause 1, which states: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Every person exercising functions in connection with this Part 
must act, so far as possible" . 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That allows for financial constraints and proportionality. 
In so far as proportionality is a concern of the hon. 
Member for Hendon, he may have overlooked the fact 
that compatibility with objectives under subsection (2) 
does not necessarily mean that proportionality should be 
overlooked. When he and his colleagues have more fully 
considered the clause, they may take a different view of 
it they should certainly reconsider their proposals. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> The matter goes further than that because 
we must now view the Bill against the background of the 
Human Rights Act 1998, which interestingly the 
Government introduced but are now remarkably reluctant 
to implement. We know that article 6.1 of the European 
convention on human rights specifically provides that 
legal representation should be made available either in 
certain cases where it is compulsory, or because of the 
complexity of the procedure or the case. The Bill cannot 
be viewed in isolation from that requirement or, indeed, 
from the civil procedure rules, under which the intention 
is to put the parties on an equal footing. Those rules came 
into operation yesterday. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It is deeply 
concerning that the Government do not do the same thing 
in every respect of their activities. They have an 
objectives clause at the outset of the civil procedure rules, 
the draft financial services and markets Bill and the draft 
food standards Bill, but they pretend that their 
amendments to clause 5 and to provisions relating to the 
Criminal Defence Service will meet the case. 

<P>
My hon. Friend refers to the European convention on 
human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998. That is 
precisely our point. We all accept that the Government 
have recognised the need to comply with that Act and the 
convention in so far as criminal representation is involved, 
but in their funding arrangements for the civil side of 
state-assisted representation and advice, they intend to 
give the Community Legal Service what is left over after 
the Criminal Defence Service has had its bite. We have 
to accept that line because the Government have given no 
details about the funding arrangements for either the CDS 
or the Community Legal Service. 

<P>
Until we know more precisely what the budgets will be 
and whether the Community Legal Service budget will be 
ring-fenced or whether it is true, as the Lord Chancellor 
said in the other place, that it must make do with what is 
left over, the likelihood is that complicated but necessary 
civil disputes will not be resolved. Thus a swathe of the 
British public will be denied access to the courts, which 
is contrary to article 6. I have yet to hear a convincing 
argument from anyone representing the Government 
about that. 

<BR>




<P>
A further concern is the Government's proposal, which 
is met by clause 1, to do away with legal aid for personal 
injury cases. It is apparent to us that the Government 
intend to tell us not to worry about the denial of access to 
justice as a result of their failure to follow through the 
objectives and implement clause 1 because, in large part, 
our objections will be met by the introduction of 
conditional fee arrangements. The Opposition believe that 
legal aid should run alongside conditional fee 
arrangements for some time to ensure that access to 
justice is not impaired, to ensure the funding regime, and 
to ensure that CFAs work properly before the removal of 
legal aid, but the Government seems to wish to ignore the 
principles of clause 1. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman will 
recall that, in the many debates about conditional fees that 
he and the Minister of State have attended, I have voiced 
severe reservations. Nevertheless, as we are talking about 
a purposes clause, does the hon. and learned Gentleman 
regret the tepid and insipid manner in which the 
Government have approached the possibility of having a 
contingency legal aid fund? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> There is much that I regret about the 
Government, and that is one example. I wish that 
Government Back Benchers would apply their minds to 
that question. However, I acquit the hon. Member for 
Hendon; he has been an active member of the Committee 
and I hope that the hon. Member for Streatham will 
encourage him further in that direction. 

<P>
The removal of clause 1 and the Government's decision 
to finance access to the law through CFAs rather than 
state-assisted representation will affect all personal injury 
cases except cases of clinical negligence. We ask the 
Government to consider, first, giving the Community 
Legal Service the authority to make financial assistance 
available in those personal injury cases that meet the 
funding code requirements if a CFA is unavailable or 
unaffordable; and, secondly, to give the Community Legal 
Service authority to make financial assistance available in 
certain categories of personal injury cases. 

<P>
The first suggestion is based on the fear that if such a 
residual authority is not given, the effect of the 
Government's reforms will be to disfranchise the poor. 
That touches on our arguments in favour of clause 1. The 
Minister will know that about 86 per cent. of all legally 
aided claimants make a nil contribution. Recent research 
suggests that more than 50 per cent. of legally aided 
accident victims are children, or retired or unemployed 
people; and that fewer than 35 per cent. are unemployed. 
Those figures come from a paper published in 1998 by the 
Legal Aid Board research unit entitled, "Personal Injury 
Litigation in Practice" . 

<P>
The limited evidence currently available suggests that 
it is the litigant, not the solicitor, who has to pay the 
after-the-event insurance premium and the disbursements 
of running a CFA case. Middle England may be able to 
afford those costs, but the poor will not. It will be no 
comfort to them to know that if only they could find the 
money to bankroll their cases, their lawyers' success fees 
and most of those costs would be recoverable from the 
defence when they win. 

<P>
In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that some 
after-the-event insurers, without whom CFAs cannot 
work, are in a parlous financial position, refusing to 
accept cases unless the prospects of success are high, and 
that they are delaying dramatic increases in premiums 
only until public funding for personal injury cases has 
been abolished. It is suggested that solicitors will 
therefore not take on CFA cases unless the prospects of 
success are at least 70 per cent. Indeed, at least one insurer 
requires an 85 per cent. prospect of success before it will 
issue after-the-event insurance. Further recent anecdotal 
evidence suggests that a leading after-the-event insurer is 
now seeking even higher success rates and is striking 
solicitors off its panel unless they have a very high 
success rate. It is also notable that big insurers have not 
hitherto entered this field. 

<P>
The Minister provided us last night with a list of 
insurance companies prepared to provide some form of 
cover for conditional fee arrangements, but only the 
scantiest information has been given about the likely 
premiums. 

<BR>




<P>
The ability of people in the field to meet their current 
claims obligations, let alone to increase their portfolio to 
cover the additional 75,000 personal injury claims 
currently funded by legal aid, is at best open to 
speculation. I fear that at worst they will go under and not 
be replaced, or at best that there will be a massive rise in 
premiums. Either way, the poor will be the losers, and 
the absence of clause 1 will not provide them with the 
necessary protection. 

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>


<P>
It may be said that such fears are misguided and arise 
from a general opposition to conditional fee arrangements. 
I do not oppose the principle of conditional fee 
arrangements indeed, the Conservative Government 
introduced them and made the legal but I am worried 
that, with some exceptions, they will be introduced in 
place of what is now funded by legal aid, and will lead to 
a denial of access to justice. The question is whether the 
Government are prepared to guess wrongly, and end up 
unwittingly doing wrong, when the Lord Chancellor 
himself acknowledged in a previous existence that the 
legal aid system was a conspicuously successful aspect of 
public service. 

<P>
Giving the Community Legal Service the duty, or at 
lest the power, to support cases that pass the funding code 
criteria when conditional fee arrangements are unavailable 
or unaffordable would prevent the Government reforms 
from denying rather than increasing access to justice. I 
have been advised that if a claimant lacks the financial 
resources to fund the running costs of his claim himself 
and a solicitor cannot meet them for him, the lack of 
public funding for his claim could amount to a violation 
of a claimant's right of access to a court under article 6.1 
of the European convention on human rights, a point to 
which my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield
(Mr. Grieve) drew the Committee's attention. 

<P>
It is not enough for the Government to say that they 
will reconsider the reforms if they do not work. That will 
not mean anything to claimants who have been unable to 
bring their claims in the meantime. I accept that the Lord 
Chancellor and the Government have already gone a little 
way towards meeting the second suggestion by retaining, 
at least for the time being, public funding for medical or 
clinical negligence cases and for the investigative costs of 
other complex cases relating to matters such as industrial 
disease, product liability and environmental torts. 
However, we cannot understand why the Government do 
not accept that public funding should be retained for such 
cases in their entirety. I appreciate that in such cases a 
risk assessment will be possible under the investigation 
process. However, the same logic that leads to the 
retention of pubic funding for clinical negligence cases in 
their entirety high running costs and difficulty of 
accurate risk assessment even after investigation applies 
with equal force to those other complex cases. The hit 
recently taken by plaintiff solicitors in the tobacco 
litigation will lead solicitors to be even more cautious in 
taking such cases on conditional fee arrangements. 

<BR>




<P>
If the Government are unwilling to accede to the first 
suggestion, further categories for which public funding 
should be retained are infants, patients, the seriously 
disabled and the retired, who are especially vulnerable. 
Without clause 1, or under its amended form, we fear that 
those vulnerable sections of society will continue to 
remain precisely that. 

<P>
I ask the Government to consider whether the deterrent 
to accepting cases the cap on the success fee leads to 
the conclusion that public funding should be available for 
fast-track cases when a conditional fee arrangement is 
unavailable or unaffordable. Although that deals simply 
with the matter of personal injuries, it is in that context 
that the Government's reforms and inability to get their 
heads round clause 1 are most starkly illustrated. 

<P>
I am grateful to the Minister for having sent me, as I 
believe he sent all members of the Committee, the letter 
of 26 April, which we picked up on the Members' letter 
board last night. I understand the Minister's and the Lord 
Chancellor's personal anxiety about the Law Society's 
advertising campaign that hit the public prints yesterday 
morning. On the Radio 4 programme "Today" , yesterday 
morning, the Lord Chancellor was apoplectic. If he is 
dealing with an inaccurate advertising campaign, he is 
perfectly entitled to put it right. However, the manner in 
which the Lord Chancellor went about doing so 
certainly on that radio programme was regrettable. It 
may be pompous of me to say so, but he should not 
descend into making personal, abusive remarks.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Keith Darvill </B>(Upminster): Does the hon. and 
learned Gentleman accept the validity of the points made 
by the Law Society in that campaign? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> If the hon. Gentleman will hang on, I 
shall explain what I mean. The Lord Chancellor made 
a mistake in resorting to personal abuse. he also made 
a mistake  

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman 
give way? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> No. I am making a point. The hon. 
Gentleman will just have to wait for a moment. 

<P>
The Lord Chancellor also made a mistake by accusing 
those who were concerned about the Government's 
proposals of being a vested interest and of trying to 
feather their own nests. It is not true that those who are 
concerned about what the Government are doing are 
bothered only about protecting their own financial 
position. 

<BR>




<P>
The majority of lawyers who are concerned with the 
provision of legal services, particularly to those who 
cannot afford them, are altruistic. Of course, they want to 
earn a living, but they should not be tarred with the brush 
that was waved around yesterday morning by the Lord 
Chancellor and on earlier occasions when he made 
accusations about fat cats. Such comments are unworthy 
and unintelligent. Even if the Law Society's campaign is 
wrong, it has at least drawn to the public's attention the 
deep-seated concern that not only it has, but those who 
will be denied access to justice will have. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does not the support of altruistic 
organisations such as the Legal Action Group and the 
Consumers Association give a lie to the Lord Chancellor's 
assertion so rudely and pompously made on the "Today"  
programme that the amendments and opposition to the 
Bill are the result of self-interest? 

<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. Garnier: I have no doubt that the Lord Chancellor 
has 100 per cent. support from the Government Benches 
and throughout the parliamentary Labour party not only 
for what he does, but for the way in which he does it. 
Although I may agree with the hon. Gentleman, I fear that 
those on the Government Benches in Committee admire 
the Lord Chancellor, find him to be a thoroughly 
sympathetic character and consider that he should remain 
in office for a god many years yet. No doubt the Minister 
is happy to work with him for as long as he is required. 

<P>
I shall quote one or two points from the Minister's letter 
of 26 April, which might assist the Committee in its 
decision about what to do with clause 1. I take fully on 
board the Minister's comment that 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The government is not cutting the overall amount of money 
available for legal aid. However as the government does not have 
unlimited resources to spend on legal aid, we must ensure that we 
can use taxpayers money where it can have the greatest effect."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That is what all Governments do, so I cannot criticise that 
point. It goes on to say that the Government must 
therefore 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ensure that we have control of expenditure"  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
and 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"ensure that we do not use taxpayers money to fund cases where a 
satisfactory alternative source of funding legal cases exists."  

<BR>




<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
My complaint is that there is not yet a proven satisfactory 
alternative source of funding legal cases exclusively. In 
the light of clause 1, I urge the Government to reconsider 
whether the abolition of legal aid across the board apart 
from the few aspects that will be retained is good 
enough. 

<P>
The Minister went on to say: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The government will only be able to increase the areas which 
receive funding by ensuring that we control expenditure in the areas 
which have traditionally received public funding. We are determined 
to give more help to the very poorest and most disadvantaged in 
society, the new Community Legal Service, which the Bill will set 
up, will enable us to do this."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That is robbing Peter to pay Paul. Again, I do not accuse 
the Minister of State of having ill motives, but I am not 
convinced, and I trust that the Committee will not be 
convinced, that what the Government propose will give 
more help to the poorest and most disadvantaged in 
society. It certainly will not do so if clause 1, whether or 
not it is amended, is deleted from the Bill. 

<P>
The Minister then writes: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Bill makes significant changes to the operation of 
conditional fees agreements which will mean that many more people 
will be able to receive help with their legal problems. The winning 
side will be able to claim the solicitors' uplift from the losing side, 
therefore suffering no loss in damages. Any insurance premium to 
cover against the risk of paying the other side's legal costs will be 
recoverable in the same way."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
Again, that is fair enough. Under the Bill, the insurance 
premium and the uplift will be recoverable from the losing 
side. The damages that are paid or awarded to the plaintiff 
will therefore not be diminished to that extent. However, 
insurance companies are not pouring into the market to 
provide the products needed to underpin conditional fee 
arrangements. In the absence of clause 1, the Government 
will be throwing to the winds those who are unable either 
to find insurance or to afford it. Without it, lawyers will 
not take on the cases that the Minister says that they will. 

<BR>




<P>
I shall not repeat what I said about personal abuse, 
but if Labour Members look at the press notice issued 
on 23 April, which was embargoed until yesterday, they 
will see that it was couched in somewhat more 
moderate terms than the Lord Chancellor's words 
spoken on the radio. It says merely that the Lord 
Chancellor is 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"extremely disappointed that the Law Society has resorted to 
irresponsible scaremongering."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
The Law Society has done no such thing; it has drawn to 
the public's attention a raft of areas in the law where, in 
the absence of guarantees and in the absence of clause 
1 there is a danger that access to the legal advice and to 
the justice system that are necessary in a civilised society 
cannot be ensured. Any civilised Member of the House of 
Commons should take it as given that access to the law 
for all should not be inhibited. 

<P>
The Minister kindly provided us with a list of those 
who are interested in providing some sort of insurance. 
However, from an interview that the Minister gave to the 
magazine Litigation Insurance, a magazine that was first 
published earlier this year, it seems that the insurance 
market is not coming forward to fill the gap. Until it does 
so, and unless premiums for those no longer able to 
receive legal aid advice or assistance are affordable, the 
matter cannot be advanced. The written answers that I 
have received about such insurance have been woefully 
vague and inadequate, and I am not convinced that the 
paper on the availability of insurance enclosed with the 
letter takes the matter much further. 

<P>
It is interesting to note that in small print at the bottom 
of the page we see printed the words: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"NB. All of the information provided above is subject to change 
or withdrawal."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That is dead right, Mr. Atkinson it will be. I assure you 
that many of those legal insurance products are not as 
wonderful as they are cracked up to be. Furthermore, 
under the Minister's pet scheme, the only-pay-if-you-win 
insurance scheme, the assessment fee is £200. That has to 
be paid even before one sees whether or not the case is a 
runner and where the insurance premium will apply. 

<P>
It is argued in one of the papers provided by the 
Minister with his letter last night that most personal injury 
cases are suitable for conditional fee arrangements. That 
presupposes that there is insurance to go with them, and 
that there are lawyers available and willing to do them. 

<BR>




<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>


<P>
The Minister seeks to persuade us by saying that the 
advance costs are so small on average that they can easily 
be taken care of by a solicitor. The average disbursement 
paid out by solicitors in cases costing £4,000 or less was 
only £304. The Minister says that most personal injury 
cases do not cost lawyers much 81 per cent., I think, 
cost £4,000 or less. He does not say that most solicitors 
do more than one case, so it is not simply one sum of 
£304 but several, multiplied week in and week out. If the 
Minister has any understanding of the financial standing 
of small firms of solicitors, he will appreciate that, unlike 
Russell Jones and Walker and other large firms of London 
solicitors, most firms currently on legal aid work are not 
in a position to provide the funding required. They cannot 
borrow from their banks the sums that might be required 
to enable them to produce the goods for the public, despite 
interest rates being low. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Dismore:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman has 
rightly concentrated on conditional fee arrangements as 
the alternative to legal aid, and has discussed the issue of 
insurance premiums. No doubt we will return to the 
subject in our debate on schedule 2. However, I put to 
him that there is more than one alternative to legal aid. 
Has he considered the enormous growth in 
before-the-event insurance for legal services, such as the 
add-ons that we all see on motor insurance policies, 
domestic policies, membership of motoring organisations 
in relation to road accidents, the development of trade 
union schemes and so forth? There is a plethora of options 
that cost little. [Interruption.] 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Yes. I do not know whether we are 
listening to an early meet of the Cotswold fox hunt or 
whether it is something more alarming. 

<P>
The hon. Gentleman made that point forcefully on 
Second Reading. I do not object to other products and 
funding instruments to allow wider access to the law 
that is perfectly sensible. I know that as a lawyer he was 
backed by trade unions, has done cases for them and has 
great expertise in the provision of legal costs through 
membership of trade unions. Trade unions, such as the 
Police Federation, have instructed me to deal with cases 
through his firm. There is nothing wrong with that. Our 
complaint is that the Government's sledgehammer 
approach to conditional fee arrangements and the 
abolition of legal aid will not achieve [Interruption.] 
That is not the Cotswold fox hunt. 

<P>
I would like to finish with a query about the funding 
that comes to the fore in discussion of clause 1. It flows 
from a written parliamentary question to the Minister, 
which was reported in the Official Report on 20 April. I 
asked the Minister: 

<BR>




<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if he will list which areas of expenditure in his Department in the 
non-criminal legal aid budget wil be funded first when the criminal 
legal aid budget has been met; and if he will make a statement about 
how these areas have been determined."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
The Minister gave me a lengthy answer, but as is so often 
the case with his answers to my questions, whether they 
are on the Floor of the House or on paper, they say rather 
less than perhaps he would like to believe. He replied: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is an oversimplification to suggest that help through the 
Community Legal Service will be provided only after claims for 
criminal work. The Lord Chancellor has said that there will not be 
an overall budget for legal aid or a cash limit. In order to make the 
expenditure in each area transparent, the Lord Chancellor has made 
a commitment to inform Parliament immediately of any transfer of 
resources (other than a de minimis one) between the Criminal 
Defence Service and the Community Legal Service. The Lord 
Chancellor will direct national priorities for public funding taking 
account of the findings of need and the Government's intention to 
give priority to tackling social and economic exclusion. The White 
Paper `Modernising Justice' indicated that likely areas of priority 
would be social welfare cases; other cases of fundamental 
importance to the people affected (such as child protection, and 
protecting people from violence); and cases involving wider public 
interest. The Access to Justice Bill places a duty on the Legal 
Services Commission to assess the need for legal services 
throughout the country and to inform the Lord Chancellor of its 
findings, these findings will be used to direct resources so that 
identified priority areas receive funding."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
I also asked the Minister: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"what assumptions he had made about factors affecting the need for 
criminal legal aid with particular reference to demographic trends, 
economic trends, social trends and policy changes in arriving at the 
estimated expenditure on criminal legal aid for the financial year 
1999-2000 and 2000-01" . 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
He candidly, if somewhat disarmingly, replied: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No explicit assumptions are made about demographic, economic 
or social trends. However, forecasts do take account of inflationary 
pressures and planned policy change effects."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
Well, that is reassuring, is it not? He continued: 

<BR>




<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The assumptions underpinning the likely impact policy change 
effects take account of price, volume and behavioural changes."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
I then asked the Minister 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if he has set a level of funding for (a) civil legal aid and (b) advice 
and assistance below which he does not consider it viable to reduce 
them for (1) 1999-2000 and (2) 2000-01" . 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
He said: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"No minimum levels of funding for civil legal aid and advice and 
assistance have been set. Neither I nor the Lord Chancellor believe 
that any Minister in a responsible Government would be willing to 
guarantee that a given level of spending on a particular function 
would be maintained, whatever financial pressures might fall 
unexpectedly on his or her Department. 

<P>
We are, however, determined that the Community Legal Service, 
which will encompass civil legal aid and advice and assistance, will 
be properly funded. The available resources will be committed to 
the Community Legal Service through the system of contracting, 
and will be allocated to meet priority need. In order to provide 
contractors with reassurance that funding will not be suddenly cut 
or contracts terminated, the Lord Chancellor has asked the Legal 
Aid Board to extend from six to twelve months the notice that will 
need to be given to vary or terminate a contract, except in cases of 
misbehaviour or breach."  [Official Report, 20 April 1999;
Vol. 329, c. 532-3.] 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
As recently as last week, it was clear that inadequate 
forethought has been given to funding, the use of the word 
"means"  in substitution (2)(a), disability and geographical 
matters or to the provision of services, so that those 
involved in disputes can be placed on an equal footing. 

<P>
In due course, I shall invite members of the Committee 
to express an opinion in favour of the retention of clause 
1, because it is right in itself and because it requires the 
functionaries in the Community Legal Service and the 
Criminal Defence Service, under the control of the Legal 
Services Commission, to behave in a civilised, sensible 
and humane way, subject to the needs of justice. I look 
forward to hearing from Labour Members why they think 
that they can do away with clause 1 and the entirely 
proper objectives in it, so making an inadequate Bill 
more inadequate.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> The speeches so far in Committee have 
given us an interesting insight into the tensions that divide 
Conservative Members. They recognise the need for 
change but are unsure whether to embrace it or whether 
to cling to the past, rather like a small child hangs on to 
a security blanket. As I listened to Opposition Members, 
especially Front-Bench Members, I could not get out of 
my mind pictures of Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear. 
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has a touch 
of Christopher Robin about him; he always wears his 
wellingtons and raincoat even on a sunny day with no 
prospect of rain. However, the hon. Member for Solihull 
loves honey; he cannot resist emptying the jar and, as a 
result, he is much more fun and interesting. Indeed, he 
welcomes change when it is put in front of him. 

<BR>




<P>
The hon. Member for Solihull made an interesting point 
about duty solicitors in speaking to the sittings motion. In 
a sense, his argument is a metaphor for the difficulties 
that his party faces. He described siren voices warning 
how awful duty solicitor schemes would be. Who are 
those siren voices? They are precisely those to whom the 
hon. and learned Member for Harborough has been 
listening and has repeated. The people who criticised the 
valuable contribution of the hon. Member for Solihull in 
developing a duty solicitor scheme were other lawyers. 

<P>
Those lawyers were not willing to take such an 
initiative, to embrace such a change or to provide a 
valuable service to the community that the hon. Member 
for Solihull wanted. They said that such a scheme was a 
bad thing, that it would restrain choice and that it would 
deal unfairly with the way in which solicitors had 
traditionally gone about doing their work. Yet the hon. 
Member for Solihull was above such petty arguments; he 
recognised that what he and his colleagues were doing in 
advocating a duty solicitor scheme was much better for 
the community as are the proposals in the Bill. They are 
changes designed to help the community. I recognise that 
the hon. and learned Member for Harborough went wide 
in his comments about the Criminal Defence Service. 

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> I do not want the Minister to get 
away with being too nice to me. I admit that there was a 
certain self-interest in referring to a duty solicitor scheme. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I am grateful for that admission. 

<P>
I shall deal briefly with the Criminal Defence 
Service. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough, 
being the good lawyer that he is, has prepared his 
argument in respect of only the first few clauses of the 
Bill and has not troubled to look further. Had he done 
so, he would have noticed that all his criticisms of the 
Criminal Defence Service have been answered in the 
Bill. The hon. and learned Gentleman criticised the lack 
of choice. However, choice is guaranteed specifically 
under clause 15(7). 

<P>
<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> I am interested to hear that. I listened very 
carefully to the closing speech of the Solicitor-General on 
Second Reading. I sought to intervene, but I was not given 
the opportunity to do so. The words that registered in my 
mind were that "choice would be allowed in most cases."  
Those words appear in Hansard, and I should be grateful 
to receive clarification on that point. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Perhaps I should not have succumbed to 
the temptation to respond to the points of the hon. and 
learned Member for Harborough, but at least he has 
now had the chance perhaps for the first time to read 
clause 15(7). I invite the hon. Member for Beaconsfield 
to do the same. The hon. and learned Gentleman should 
also read clause 15(9) because it deals with another of 
his criticisms. I recognise that he has not got that far 
in his preparation, but it might assist us to make 
progress in future if criticisms were made in the round 
rather than being so technical. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I shall not intervene each time the 
Minister makes a childish remark; I shall merely make a 
note of them. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I have much ground to catch up with. 

<BR>




<P>
I shall not go into the comments of the hon. and learned 
Gentleman about personal injuries and conditional fee 
arrangements at this stage. They will be dealt with 
thoroughly when we discuss schedule 2, which is the 
specific, technical provision that deals with changes in 
legal aid. For the benefit of the Committee, it will be best 
to deal with them then. 

<P>
I shall explain why clause 1, as a whole, should not 
stand part of the Bill. In doing so, I shall comment on the 
substance of the two amendments tabled by the hon. and 
learned Member for Harborough and I shall speak to 
Government amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5 and 6, which 
elaborate on particular objectives within the overall 
purpose of the Community Legal Service as set out in 
clause 5. 

<P>
Clause 1 was inserted in another place, despite the fact 
that the Government were proposing under their own 
amendments to set out more clearly the separate purposes 
of the Community Legal Service and the Criminal 
Defence Service. The proponents of clause 1 insisted on 
pressing it to a Division before the Lord Chancellor had 
had an opportunity to explain the Government's approach. 

<P>
Clause 1 as drafted is confused. Its heading and title 
refer to principles, but the clause itself deals with 
objectives. More important, the clause muddies the waters 
by trying to cover two separate schemes with a single set 
of objectives. We have tried to make a clear distinction in 
the Bill between the Community Legal Service and the 
Criminal Defence Service, reflecting the different policy 
objectives behind the public funding of legal services in 
civil and criminal cases, the different mix of services 
required for example, criminal legal aid is far more 
court-centred and the different factors driving demand 
and cost. 

<P>
The clause as drafted also expresses some unrealistic 
aspirations. Subsection (2)(a) states that people should 
have access to services that they would 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"otherwise be unable to obtain on account of their means" . 

<P>
However, no mention is made of a test of merits or of 
priorities. Nor is there any hint that people can obtain 
legal services other than with their own or taxpayers' 
money, because legal expenses insurance and conditional 
fees did not exist in 1949 when that description of legal 
aid was first used. 

<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
Legal aid was originally conceived as a universal 
scheme for plugging the gap between what people could 
afford to pay and what lawyers chose to charge. That was 
a laudable aspiration at the time, but it has proved 
unsustainable in recent years. As Opposition Members 
will know, and as some, in particular the hon. Member 
for Solihull, conceded when in government they were 
consistently forced to cut back on eligibility levels to 
maintain the cost of legal aid at reasonable levels. As a 
result, means are defined by rigid and increasingly 
stringent financial eligibility limits. 

<P>
Obviously, the Government could have continued to cut 
back on eligibility. Instead, the Bill creates a flexible 
scheme with more sophisticated levers of control than 
crude eligibility cuts. It is a radical and necessary reform, 
which is not served by clinging, as in subsection (2)(a), 
to the language of 1949. 

<BR>




<P>
Subsection (2)(b) deals with access, and
subsection (2)(c) refers to quality. The powers in the 
Bill, in particular the power to contract for services, 
will make it possible to improve both. For example, the 
Legal Services Commission could offer contracts 
designed to attract providers to particular areas where 
existing services are inadequate. There is obviously a 
valuable tension between the two objectives. They may 
pull in different directions at different times. Quality 
might be better promoted by fewer contracts, access 
perhaps by more. It wil be the commission's task to 
balance such competing desirable objectives in 
particular, access, quality and price. 

<P>
Subsection (2)(b) states that access should not be 
impaired on account of where in England or Wales legal 
services are sought. I have two difficulties with that 
formulation. First, it focuses solely on physical access and 
geographical proximity.There is no recognition that much 
can be done perfectly well by telephone or fax, no hint of 
the larger role that information technology will play in 
future, and no suggestion that a lawyer should ever be 
troubled to leave his or her office to visit a client. 
Secondly, it implies that people who live in rural areas 
can enjoy the same geographic access as people who live 
in large cities. 

<P>
Subsection (2)(c), which deals with quality, speed and 
fairness, in general is excellent. My only reservation is 
that the reference to quality relates only to services 
connect with disputes and that the emphasis on disputes 
and proceedings retains the lawyer-dominated flavour of 
legal aid rather than that of a more widely based 
Community Legal Service. 

<P>
Amendment No. 18 would insert a new subsection (d) 
that states that people obtaining legal services should have 
the widest possible choice of provider or services. Our 
task is to balance competing desirable objectives, or 
which the choice of lawyer may be only one. Therefore, 
we cannot specify an overriding objective to provide the 
widest possible choice, because that could easily rule out 
consideration of quality or of value for money. 

<P>
It is desirable that an accused person should have a 
choice of legal representative but not necessarily an 
unlimited one as it helps promote confidence in his or 
her lawyer and in the criminal justice system. On the other 
hand, in cases of civil litigation, which most people, 
fortunately, experience only once in a lifetime, I am not 
sure that it is especially helpful to single out the choice 
of provider as such as opposed to specifying access to 
justice, for example. 

<P>
If I understand the amendment correctly, it is positively 
undesirable to say that people should have the widest 
possible choice of services, when it is an explicit aim of 
the Community Legal Service to provide the most 
appropriate means of dealing with a particular problem 
a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon made 
effectively and that, so far at least, has been unanswered 
by the Opposition. 

<BR>




<P>
The Government are sympathetic to most of the 
intentions that underlie clause 1. That is true, above all, 
of its attempts to address discrimination. However, 
subsection (2)(b) is limited because it concerns 
discrimination only in relation to physical access and then 
only against the disabled. I realise that amendment No. 17 
seeks to address the latter problem. The Government have 
considered carefully whether amending the Bill would 
deal squarely with a range of discrimination matters, but 
we concluded that nothing could usefully be added to 
existing law. 

<P>
The Legal Services Commission and those whom it 
engages to provide services are, as employers and service 
providers, already subject to the provisions of legislation 
dealing with sex, race and disability discrimination. As a 
public body, the commission will be covered also by the 
Human Rights Act 1998, which outlaws discrimination on 
a wide range of grounds in relation to people's access to 
their convention rights. 

<P>
Discrimination legislation is becoming increasingly 
complex, because it necessarily includes a large number 
of careful definitions. A discrimination clause that deals 
with sex, race or disability will therefore have to adopt 
precisely the same definitions as existing legislation.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Grieve:</B> Perhaps I should declare an interest: I am 
a member of the council of Justice. The Minister will be 
aware that Justice sought the advice of Philip Havers QC, 
who has done a great deal of Government work, on the 
wording of the Bill, in particular on why there was no 
restatement in the Bill of the principles of article 6.1 of 
the convention on human rights. He expressed some 
surprise that the non-discrimination principle, which is 
absolutely enshrined in the convention, was not stated in 
the Bill. Will the Minister comment on that? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> On the front of the Bill, I certify on behalf 
of the Government that the Bill in its entirety conforms 
with the European convention. I am slightly surprised at 
the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's observation. He knows 
full well that the European convention, once it is brought 
fully into force, will bind all public bodies. His appeal for 
a restatement is, I assume, an appeal for a restatement of 
existing and well-established law. Quite what that would 
add to the law, other than a few more lines in our already 
large legislative structure, is hard to see. I thought that he 
conceded the answer to his question by using the word 
"restatement" . A restatement is, by definition, a 
restatement of something already part of the law. It would 
therefore add nothing, which is why it should be resisted. 

<P>
Those responsible for drafting clause 1 recognised the 
difficulties by referring to the Disability Discrimination 
Act 1995. As I have said, such a clause would add nothing 
to existing law except potential confusion. Equally, 
anything that extended the scope of existing 
discrimination law would require more than a simple 
clause; it would merit, and properly deserve, separate 
legislation. 

<BR>




<P>
I fully recognise the importance of providing a system 
that will deliver help to those who need it, irrespective 
of race, sex or disability. That is why we need flexible 
machinery, that can respond to the changing needs and 
priorities of the community. For the first time in the 
history of legal aid, we shall be able to address the 
particular needs of any part of the community, whether it 
is the disabled or people from an ethnic minority 
background. 

<P>
Clause 7(5) specifically refers to "areas or 
communities" , so that the commission may target 
non-geographical communities. The Legal Aid Board has 
already directed its regional legal services committees to 
ensure that their strategies for assessing the needs and 
priorities of their communities should 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"include a section which discusses any specific client group (for 
example, ethnic minorities, disabled, elderly, carers, remote 
communities) needs which should be addressed, and advice on 
methods of delivery which might be employed in contracts to 
address need in particular geographical areas, categories of work 
and client groups."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That deals with a point made in passing by the hon. and 
learned Member for Harborough, and echoed by other 
Opposition Members, about the importance of rural access 
and providing assistance to those who live in remote 
communities. I would have been much more impressed 
with their observations if they had applied them to the 
existing scheme. Nothing in the existing rules encourages 
lawyers to establish practices in a rural area. It depends 
entirely on the lawyers whether they practise in those 
areas. I am disappointed that Opposition Members have 
not recognised and welcomed the fact that power will be 
given to the Legal Services Commission to direct that 
contracts should be made available specifically to assist 
those in rural and remote areas. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The point that the Minister has not 
addressed is that although lawyers are there now, they will 
not be in future. There will be a reduction of 11,000 to 
3,000 lawyers. There are currently six lawyers in my high 
street in Market Harborough but, under his proposals, 
there will be many fewer than that a position that will 
be replicated throughout the country. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I caution the hon. and learned Gentleman 
about relying on statistical estimates of those who have 
an interest in criticising the Bill. He should be more 
sensitive to reality. Let me give him one or two statistics 
to demonstrate why the figure of 3,000 lawyers is wrong. 
One interesting statistic about the way in which the 
existing scheme operates is that 96 per cent. of all the 
money that is spent on family work, which people living 
in remote areas often need badly, goes to only 6,000 
firms. 

<P>
The proposal is that the money should be spent only in 
relation to those firms that have an expertise or a 
particular ability in a certain field. That is why franchising 
has been developed as a means of encouraging firms to 
develop appropriate systems to provide a high quality 
service to their clients. The Government have extended 
the period for franchising and we anticipate that about 
5,000 to 6,000 firms will apply for franchises. That is not 
inconsistent with the 6,000 firms that currently undertake 
some 96 per cent. of family work. The amount of such 
work currently undertaken by firms will be pretty 
consistent with that which will be available to them in 
future under franchises and contracts. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Minister is hitting on an important 
point. Is he saying that, provided firms can achieve the 
appropriate quality standard in other words, can obtain 
a franchise they should automatically be entitled to a 
contract? 

<BR>




<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Securing the appropriate quality standard is 
not something that we have set out as yet. We have 
outlined interim measures for securing a franchise; we 
have said that it is a step along the way towards a 
contracting system that will concentrate the work in the 
hands of those who are competent to do it. We are looking 
for the most effective way in which to ensure that there is 
access to justice throughout the country on a geographical 
basis, which will guarantee that those who seek advice 
will receive it from those who are best qualified to do 
the work. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> It might help us if the Minister set out 
clearly how the Community Legal Service partnerships 
will work in defining needs in rural areas, such as mine. 
I share some of the concerns of Opposition Members 
about how services will be provided in such areas, partly 
because of my experience of the closure of a magistrates 
court in one small town in my constituency. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall 
not set out in any great detail the operation of the 
Community Legal Service. 

<P>
As for partnerships, for the first time a system will be 
in place that identifies particular needs in different areas. 
The Community Legal Service will have information that 
will allow it to address the needs that arise in rural areas, 
such as my hon. Friend's constituency, as opposed to the 
needs that arise in inner cities. They are very different. At 
the moment, access to justice and to advice and assistance 
depends solely on where lawyers choose to locate. 

<P>
The evidence is that lawyers tend to locate less often 
in some remote areas than in inner cities. Equally, 
sometimes lawyers who operate in inner cities do not 
provide the sort of advice and assistance that those 
communities require. The purpose of planning and the 
partnerships of the Community Legal Service will be to 
identify those needs to try to match in the provision of 
contracts the precise advice and help that is required in 
those communities. That is the essence of the 
partnerships. 

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>


<P>
<B>Mr. Todd:</B> I respect the remarks that I made on Second 
Reading. I welcome the introduction of contracting; it is 
the right step. Will the Minister set out the criteria that 
partnerships are likely to take into account to determine 
local needs? One of the difficulties with the concept of 
local justice has been to define exactly what local justice 
means and to determine the availability of magistrates 
courts, for example. It would help to reassure me if the 
Minister were to set out those criteria. 

<BR>




<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> I do not want to enter into a discussion 
about local magistrates courts, but there is an analogy in 
that the decision on any closure was taken by the local 
committee, which considered the matter in the light of 
what is arguably the best information available the 
information on the ground. The important work of the 
regional legal services committees will reflect precisely 
that; they will consider the needs of the areas that they 
represent and draw up proposals for balancing needs 
against resources. I am straying a long way from my 
argument on discrimination, but I shall give way one 
more time. 

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I want to bring the Minister back to a 
point on the subject of sparsely populated rural areas, 
which is important to many members of the Committee. 
The Minister referred us to clause 7(5). Would he 
welcome an amendment to clause 7(5) under which the 
word "shall"  would replace the word "may" ? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Hoon:</B> Perhaps we could consider that suggestion 
in more detail when we reach clause 7. I am dealing with 
discrimination and why it is central to the Government's 
concerns that all those responsible for providing legal 
services are subject to relevant legislation. Indeed, the 
Legal Aid Board's legal aid franchise quality assurance 
standard makes it mandatory that firms wishing to obtain 
a franchise should have a written equal opportunities 
policy in effective operation. The policy must make it 
clear that the firm will not discriminate on grounds of 
race, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation in 
deciding whether to accept instructions from clients, in 
instructing counsel and other experts in the provision of 
services or in the selection, recruitment and treatment of 
staff. 

<P>
Clauses 5(1) and 13(1) set out the purposes of the 
Community Legal Service and the Criminal Defence 
Service respectively. The purpose of the CDS is to 
provide the advice, assistance and representation that 
suspects and defendants require in the best interests of 
justice. That is clear and retains the same absolute 
entitlement that exists now, and I can see no reason to try 
to put a gloss on it or to qualify it further. 

<P>
I recognise that the purpose of the Community Legal 
Service is more complex. Briefly, it is to secure the 
provision of a wide range of services, not simply lawyers' 
services, to meet people's needs, subject to the constraint 
of available resources and according to priorities. Given 
the concerns that clause 1 seeks to address, especially on 
access, the Government have decided to elaborate on 
particular objectives within that overall purpose. That is 
why we tabled amendment No. 5, which will insert a new 
subsection in clause 5. 

<P>
The new subsection contains three objectives the first 
of which is 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"to promote improvements in the range and quality of services 
and in the ways in which they are made accessible" . 

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
That shows our commitment to provide effective access 
through the Community Legal Service, without tying the 
concept of access solely to the number and location of 
offices. In other words, it allows for new technology, 
outreach services, telephone advice lines and other 
non-traditional ways of delivering services. The second 
objective is to secure that services are appropriate to the 
nature and importance of each matter, and the third 
objective is to 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"achieve the swift and fair resolution of dispute without 
unnecessary orprotracted proceedings in court."  

<P>
Amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment
No. 5, and amendments Nos. 4 and 6 make other drafting 
changes to clause 5.

<P>

<B>Mr. Tony Baldry </B>(Banbury): I shall declare some 
interests. I am a practising barrister. I have not undertaken 
any criminal legal aid work for 10 years and I do not 
envisage doing any in the foreseeable future. I do not 
think that any other parts of the Bill relate to my practice, 
which deals mainly with construction law disputes and 
international arbitration. 

<P>
Every member of the Committee must have an interest 
in ensuring that justice is always done. However, a bigger 
issue is at principle we are enjoined in the Old 
Testament to 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God" . 

<BR>




<P>
We also have a self-interest: if we get the Bill wrong, 
the people who are weakest in society will end up on our 
doorstep in our constituency surgeries. I spent a large part 
of Saturday morning trying to work through a bundle of 
papers from a constituent who came from an ethnic group. 
His English was not good and he had had problems with 
the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, for which 
there is no legal aid at the moment. He had been stabbed 
and had had an argument as to the level of compensation 
that he had received. Looking through a great bundle of 
papers, pleadings and inter-party correspondence is not 
something I am unused to, but if we get the Bill wrong 
we will all see more such cases. 

<P>
It seems to me that the debate was encapsulated 
yesterday by the mutually bad-tempered exchange 
between the president of the Law Society and the Lord 
Chancellor on the "Today"  programme. I certainly am 
not averse to change in public institutions indeed, 
Conservative Members revolutionised many public 
institutions when we were in government. My concerns 
are as to what happens if the Government have got the 
Bill wrong. The most recent press release from the 
president of the Law Society in response to one from 
the Lord Chancellor was on what the Government will 
guarantee. In this clause, the Law Lords in the other 
place were trying to establish some guarantees. 

<P>
As one would expect, Labour Members have been 
fairly robust in support of their Front Bench spokesmen, 
but I caution them. If it was only the Law Society or a 
professional body seeking to represent professional 
interests, one might have some understanding of the 
Government's dismissing it. However, I suspect that most 
Labour Members have at one stage or another been 
involved with the Legal Action Group and the Law 
Centres Federation, and that many of them who are 
lawyers have at one time or another undertaken pro bono 
work for law centres. The Bill has been through another 
place and there has been plenty of time for consultation, 
yet the Law Centres Federation and the Legal Action 
Group are still saying to members of the Committee that 
they support the existing clause 1 and are genuinely 
concerned about the operation of the Bill. On reading 
what they say, one understands that they are concerned 
about what happens if matters go wrong. 

<P>
I have read carefully through all the briefing and 
explanations that the Minister has kindly sent us, and I 
am concerned that there does not seem to be an attempt 
to suggest that the introduction and implementation of the 
Bill will be monitored. How will we ensure that the fears 
voiced by the Law Society, the Legal Action Group, law 
centres and colleagues representing rural constituencies 
will not become actual problems? If they do, how will 
they be picked up and where is the flexibility in the Bill 
to respond to them? I say to the Minister that I for one 
intend to talk to the Law Society and the Bar Council 
about setting up a monitoring unit so that if members of 
either the Bar or the Law Society pick up problems, they 
can be channelled to a particular unit that can monitor the 
Bill. There would therefore be no question of Ministers 
not being aware at the earliest possible moment of things 
going wrong. 

<P>
</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will my hon. Friend also have 
discussions with non-legal groups that are interested in 
the Bill's progress, such as the Consumers' Association, 
the National Consumer Council and the National 
Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which are 
outside the traditional law professions but are none the 
less interested in the provision of legal services to the 
public? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> My hon. and learned Friend makes a good 
point. The citizens advice bueraux in my constituency 
sends me regular briefings on especially difficult cases. 
In addition to colleagues' constituency surgeries, citizens 
advice bureaux would be among the first groups to pick 
up whether the Bill is working properly. 

<P>
Because of the size of their majority, the Government 
can steamroller the Bill through Parliament. We can have 
some interesting debates about the meaning of words such 
as "may"  and "shall" , but the bottom line is that the Bill 
relates to the weakest in our community, not to lawyers. 
It just so happens that most members of the Committee 
happen to be lawyers. The people about whom we should 
worry are some of the poorer, the weakest and those in 
the most vulnerable circumstances. 

<BR>




<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for 
giving way, because I sought to intervene earlier. As such 
matters go on the record, I should like him to correct me 
if I am wrong. Did he say that mutually bad-tempered 
exchanges took place yesterday morning on the wireless? 
On reflection, does he agree that the contribution of the 
president of the Law Society was both restrained and 
compelling? 

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> no. I listened carefully, and they sounded 
equally bad tempered. I hold no brief for the president of 
the Law Society, or for any other body. Clearly, the 
president of the Law Society wanted to make a point, but 
there seemed to be no meeting of minds. 

<P>
If I were the Minister in charge of the Bill, I should 
think, "Here I am; a Bill has gone through the Lords. 
There has obviously been plenty of time for consultation."  
I have no doubt that the Minister is a conscientious guy. 
His officials have been in close contact wit the Law 
Society over a long period. Yet the Law Society still felt 
moved to publish and to spend its own and solicitors' 
money on a series of full-page advertisements in the 
national newspapers, which must have cost a substantial 
sum. Opposition Members are grateful to it for doing that 
in the middle of a local government election campaign; it 
must have been irksome to the Government. However, the 
message to the Government must be that the Law Society 
has raised several legitimate anxieties that Ministers have 
not managed to satisfy in seeking to reassure it. 

<P>
The clause as drafted in the other place is a signal to 
the rest of the world that there will be some guarantees. I 
hope that in Committee the Minister will examine 
documents such as the Law Society's press release and 
some of the material published by the law centres and 
others, and consider how many anxieties he can meet by 
giving such undertakings and guarantees. 

<P>
When the Minister sums up, I should welcome some 
sign of what his Department intends to do to ensure that 
the workings of the Bill are monitored and that, if 
problems arise and some groups are not securing access 
to justice in the way in which Ministers genuinely believe 
that they will under the Bill, the Government will be 
sufficiently flexible to rectify those problems. He need 
worry not about Members of the House of Commons but 
about people who work in law centres and citizens advice 
bureaux many of whom work in inner-city areas and the 
constituencies that Labour Members represent who will 
need reassurance that, if perchance the Government have 
got the Bill wrong, matters can be rectified later and the 
most vulnerable in our community will not be prejudiced. 

<P>
<B>Several hon. Members rose  </B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call the next speaker, 
I wish to explain that, because of the sessional order that 
was passed by the House on Friday in relation to the 
Committee, existing rules do not apply and the Committee 
does not automatically adjourn at 1 o'clock. For it to 
adjourn, the Government Whip has to table a motion. 
Given how many lawyers there are in the Room and 
knowing how fond they are of their lunches, I ask 
members of the Committee to be careful as 1 o'clock 
approaches. 

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. 
We are very grateful for your guidance. My opposite 
number, the Government Whip, and I have both reflected 
on the matter and you may like to know that Opposition 
Members have been instructed not to talk through the hour 
of 1 o'clock. 

<BR>




<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am sure that the Committee is 
grateful for that point of order. 

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>


{**p5 **}Mr. Burnett: Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. I am also 
happy that our proceedings will be adjourned at 1 o'clock. 

<P>
The thinking behind the clause and amendments
Nos. 17 and 18 comes from the Government's stated 
"Aims and objectives" , which are set out clearly in the 
White Paper "Modernising Justice" . We applaud much of 
what the Lord Chancellor said in the White Paper. In the 
"Foreword" , he stated: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"It is not enough for people to have rights; they must be confident 
they can enforce those rights if need be."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
He added: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The justice system should serve everyone, regardless of their 
means."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
Towards the end of the introduction to the White Paper, 
the Lord Chancellor said: 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The disadvantaged and the socially excluded will find help with 
the issues that affect their everyday lives at the heart of the new 
service."  

<P>
</UL></FONT> 

<P>
Furthermore, at paragraph 1.9 of the White Paper, the 
Government say that they have twin aims, the foremost 
of which is to 

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"bring about a significant increase in access to justice."  

<P>
The Government also set out how they wish to achieve 
those aims. Opposition Members cannot understand the 
Government's objection to enshrining their own aims in a 
purposes clause under the Bill. The Government's words 
are fine words, as are those of the Lord Chancellor, and 
we aim to ensure that the Government live up to their 
words and aspirations. The matter is made more important 
by the difficulties in funding what is effectively the 
continuation of civil legal aid. That funding will comprise 
such sum after the Bill is enacted that the Lord Chancellor 
deems fit after the provision of funding for the Criminal 
Defence Service. 

<P>
As was mentioned several times on Second Reading 
and conceded by some Labour Members, Criminal 
Defence Service funding could effectively squeeze out all 
funding for civil legal aid. That is not acceptable to the 
Liberal Democrat party nor to the party of the hon. and 
learned member for Harborough. It is the opposite of the 
Government's stated "Aims and objectives"  and there is 
no reason to depart from clause 1, as amended by 
amendments Nos. 17 and 18. 

<P>
Debate adjourned. [Mr. Hill.]

o'clock till Thursday 29 April at half-past Ten o'clock.
