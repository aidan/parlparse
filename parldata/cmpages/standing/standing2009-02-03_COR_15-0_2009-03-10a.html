Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): On a point of order,
Mr. Cook. My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk
and I learned over the weekend that the Government propose to drop
clause 152 concerning the data-sharing provision on which we have spent
a good deal of time in Committee. Indeed, it also took up time on
Second Reading. Through you, I ask the Government to clarify their
position in regard to clause 152. Such action is an extraordinary way
in which to construct a Bill. It is in bad enough shape as it is
without the Government adding yet more clauses, as they frequently do,
and then pulling one out in the middle of Committee proceedings. My
hon. Friend will try to catch your eye to deal with a parallel but not
identical point. It is deeply confusing and reprehensible to construct
legislation in this way.</div>
<a name="090310124000029"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090310124000454"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): Further to
that point of order, Mr. Cook. The Minister has made it
clear in Committee that the Government would work with the Opposition
to find a solution and that nothing would be said to anyone until such
meetings had taken place. In <i class="I">The Sunday Telegraph</i> last Sunday,
under the headline, &#147;Backlash forces U-turn on sharing private
data&#148;, it was reported that the Secretary of State &#147;is to
shelve proposals&#148;, and that, according to a spokesman,
he</div>
<a name="090310124000360"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;recognised
that the clause was drafted in a way that was too wide, so it needed to
be looked at
again.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000030"></a><div class="hs_Para">Surely
Ministers should not have been talking to the press before talking to
Opposition spokesmen. If an announcement is to be made, it should be
made not in the press but in this Committee. You are an upholder of
Back-Bench rights and the rights of shadow spokesmen, Mr.
Cook, so surely Ministers should be careful about what they do in such
circumstances.</div><a name="090310124000031"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000455"></a>The
Chairman:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes his point clearly. I am
sure that the Government will have taken note of what he said and,
given the opportunity, I am sure that they will
respond.</div><a name="090310124000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000456"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> Further to that point of order, Mr.
Cook. I accept that the Committee in its scrutiny is aware of the
difficulties with clause 152. In fact, I have said in Committee that I
want to see
whether</div><a name="090310124000361"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;we

scrutinising matters in Committee, we have decided to remove clause
152. I apologise to the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk that such
details should have appeared in the press before they were brought to
the attention of the Committee. However, I have followed the proper
process and have asked Cabinet colleagues to withdraw the clause from
the Bill so that we can have further consultation. I hope that we shall
be able to look at how we can draft a more appropriate clause, not
necessarily under the Bill, but at some further stage, so that we can
put in place a proper data-sharing provision. I hope that I have
clarified the
position.</div><a name="090310124000017"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000459"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Minister&#146;s last point should lead the
entire Committee to celebrate the fact that clause 152,
which received little support from hon. Members, has now been
withdrawn. I thank her for her
statement.</div><a name="090310124000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
87 is about examining a defendant through an intermediary if the
defendant suffers from a disability that makes it difficult for them to
participate effectively in the proceedings. The logic behind the
clause, as I understand it, is that provision already exists to help
witnesses in such circumstances, and since defendants are also often
witnesses they should be offered the same facility. There are questions
to be asked about why the criteria for defendants seem to be much
stricter than those for prosecution witnesses. Either way, it is
arguable that it is an improvement for the defendant, because they do
not have to apply for intermediary help, but they are allowed to do so
through their counsel.</div>
<a name="090310124000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is one
obvious difference between witnesses and defendants: witnesses are not
on trial. The question arises with regard to a defendant&#151;but not
a witness&#151;of why a person who suffers from a disability that
interferes with his or her ability to participate effectively in the
proceedings should be on trial in the first place. I accept that it is
possible for that not to be the case and that the person with a
disability could, with the help of an intermediary, overcome the
disability for the purposes of the trial. But it is not clear to me
exactly what kind of case&#151;what sort of person, disability or
circumstance&#151;the Government have in mind, and I will ask them to
put that on record. Even if there are such cases, as there might well
be, obviously that will not always be so. That is why we tabled
amendment 448, which provides the safeguard that, before moving to the
procedure laid down in the clause, the court must ask itself whether
the defendant is fit to
plead.</div><a name="090310124000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">For
example, if the defendant cannot comprehend the proceedings so as to
make a proper defence, or to challenge jurors, understand evidence or
give instructions to his or her legal advisers, the defendant is not
fit to stand trial in the first place, at which point the judge has a
number of options. The judge can make a guardianship order, a
supervision and treatment order, or simply give the defendant an
absolute discharge. The Government might say that the defence could
raise that point anyway, because the defence is able to raise the
fitness to plead point itself, but it might not. If it does not, there
is no obligation on the court, as I understand it, to raise it of its
own motion, although the court may do so if it wishes.</div>
<a name="090310124000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
argument against the proposal is that the defence might have a tactical
reason for not wanting the issue of fitness to plead to
arise&#151;for example, if they 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column588" />Column number: 588</div>do not want there to be the possibility of a supervision and treatment
order. The question is why a defendant who is not fit to plead should
be treated as one who is. If the problem is that the options open to
the court on a finding of unfitness to plead are not flexible enough,
perhaps we should revisit that area of the
law.</div><a name="090310124000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
485 points to an apparent anomaly in the way in which under-18s and
adults are treated under the clause. For an under-18 to qualify for an
order,  the defendant&#146;s ability to participate
effectively in the proceedings must have been compromised by their
level of intellectual ability or social functioning, which seem to be
two different ways of describing a learning
disability.</div><a name="090310124000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
for an adult to qualify, the defendant must be</div>
<a name="090310124000363"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;unable to
participate effectively in the
proceedings&#148;,</div><a name="090310124000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">either
because of a mental disorder, or because of a</div>
<a name="090310124000364"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;significant
impairment of intelligence and social
function&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">Three
questions therefore arise out of the way that the clause is drafted.
First, why does mental illness count for adults, but not for under-18s?
Secondly, why is the test for under-18s that their ability to
participate effectively is compromised by their condition, whereas an
adult must be &#147;unable to participate&#148;? The under-18 test
seems to be much easier than the over-18 test. The third point, which
is specifically the subject of amendment 485, is why does
the possibility of an order arise for an under-18 if there is either a
problem with the defendant&#146;s intellectual ability, or with the
defendant&#146;s social functioning, whereas for an adult it must be
both a matter of intelligence and a matter of social function? In
passing, what is the reason for the apparently unnecessary variation in
phraseology&#151;intellectual ability on one side, and intelligence
on the other; social functioning on one side, and social function on
the other? Those are my main points.</div>
<a name="090310124000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
amendments in the group simply raise the verbal question of why the
clause maintains the old-fashioned language of the
&#147;accused&#148; instead of the modern language of
&#147;defendant&#148;.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000461"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will deal with amendments 464 to 484 first,
and then move on to the more detailed amendments. Regarding the
proposed substitution of the term &#147;accused&#148; for
&#147;defendant&#148;, first, there is no legal difference between
the two. When I first looked at the amendments, I had every sympathy
for them; in fact, I was tempted to accept them. But, unfortunately, I
must ask the hon. Member for Cambridge to withdraw his amendment. The
clause inserts a new section into the Youth Justice and Criminal
Evidence Act 1999, and we have used the language of that Act to achieve
consistency. If I accepted the amendments&#151;much as I would like
to modernise the language, as the Under-Secretary of State for Justice,
my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston rightly advocates that
we do&#151;we would end up, in the 1999 Act, with the word
&#147;accused&#148; in some parts and &#147;defendant&#148; in
others; that would just sow seeds of confusion all round. For that
reason alone, I am unable to accept those amendments on this
occasion.</div><a name="090310124000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the use of an intermediary by vulnerable defendants if and when they
are giving oral evidence, it is important to explain that the
intermediary is there to assist with communication when a person is
being questioned as a witness. The clause is modelled on the vulnerable
witnesses intermediary provision in section 29 of the 1999 Act, which
was rolled out nationally last year after a successful pathfinder
phase. The intermediary eligibility criteria for vulnerable adult
defendants refer, as the hon. and learned Member for Harborough said,
to the Mental Health Act 2007. Amendment 216 would add a reference to
the 2007 Act, but that is superfluous, as the 2007 Act amends the 1983
Act, so the clause correctly refers to the 1983 Act alone. The same
principle applies to amendment 256, which would make a similar
change  to clause 107, which concerns sentencing
provisions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column590" />Column number: 590</div><a name="090310124000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
448 would create a precondition that the court must determine that a
defendant is fit to plead, before giving a direction for him or her to
be assisted by an intermediary. But clause 87 provides that vulnerable
defendants are eligible for intermediary assistance if
their</div><a name="090310124000380"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;ability
to participate effectively in the proceedings as a witness giving oral
evidence in court is compromised by the accused&#146;s level of
intellectual ability or social
functioning&#148;,</div><a name="090310124000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
they are under 18. As the hon. Member for Cambridge said, if the
defendant was over 18, the test would be that the defendant
must be suffering from a mental disorder
or</div><a name="090310124000381"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
significant impairment of intelligence and social
function&#148;,</div><a name="090310124000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that the use of the intermediary was necessary to ensure that they
would receive a fair trial.</div>
<a name="090310124000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">To require
defendants to be found fit to plead before they can be granted an
intermediary confuses two separate issues. The test for fitness to
plead is a different and more stringent common law test, regarding a
defendant&#146;s capacity to understand the course of proceedings and
to make a proper defence. It is a matter for the defence or the
prosecution to claim unfitness to plead. The judge will not determine
that except on the basis of evidence from medical practitioners, at
least one of whom must have specialist experience in the diagnosis or
treatment of mental disorder. That is an entirely separate procedure
from the issue of whether to apply for an intermediary application,
which will be relevant only if the contested trial is allowed to
proceed, and the defendant intends to give
evidence.</div><a name="090310124000082"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000462"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept that point. The question then arises of
whether fitness to plead determinations are intended to be taken before
intermediary order determinations or after. If they are taken after,
the intermediary order could be taken into account in fitness to plead,
but if the other way around, not. The drafting of the Bill is not clear
on what process&#151;the order of decision making&#151;is intended.
That will need to be sorted out at some stage, because it will
arise.</div><a name="090310124000083"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000463"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> It is important to make the order in which such
things would happen clear. My understanding is that the fitness to
plead ought to be taken first; if the person was found not fit to
plead, no trial would take place. With specialist medical
practitioners, presumably their evidence might address whether, if the
trial were to go ahead, that particular defendant would need to make
the application for intermediary help. That would be the logical and
sensible order, but I shall ensure that that is
clarified.</div><a name="090310124000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
would be wrong to restrict the ability of the defence to apply for an
intermediary for a defendant by making it a condition that fitness to
plead must be determined first. It would not necessarily always be the
case that fitness to plead would have to be determined in a particular
defendant&#146;s case. For example&#151;the hon. Member for
Cambridge asked for examples&#151;someone at the lower end of the
autism spectrum might need the help of an intermediary, but would not
be likely to have to ask for a fitness to plead decision to be made.
Someone might have difficulty with long concentration spans and might
need to be given the opportunity to have breaks in the course of
questioning&#151;again, that is not a fitness to plead issue, but it
concerns their ability to communicate during the
trial.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column591" />Column number: 591</div><a name="090310124000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
amendment 485, the hon. Gentleman raised the issue of making an adult
defendant&#146;s eligibility for an intermediary closer to that for
someone under 18. As he said, the effect would be that eligible adults
must have a significant impairment of intelligence or social
functioning rather than both. The reason for having both is the same as
that in section 33A of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act
1999, which is the provision that made the use of live links available
for eligible, vulnerable defendants to give evidence in court, when
that use was previously available only for eligible witnesses. The
distinction between the eligibility criteria applied to adults as
compared with children reflects the fact that it is not uncommon for
juvenile defendants to require assistance giving oral evidence and
communication generally, regardless of their mental capacity. There
should, however, be a strong presumption that adult defendants are able
to give oral evidence in court. That is why the more stringent test is
required by the court before it would approve the use of a live link
for adult
defendants.</div><a name="090310124000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
the light of those explanations, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will
withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000087"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000464"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am grateful for the explanation about
&#147;accused&#148; rather than &#147;defendant&#148;, although
it means that we have long chains back. The amendments to the Act were
only passed in 1999, in which year &#147;defendant&#148; was the
current phrase, so presumably the old-fashioned language was used
because the amendments were to some other Act, and back it goes. We
shall end up using &#147;prisoner&#148; on that basis, if we do not
watch
out.</div><a name="090310124000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
fitness to plead, I am glad for the explanation, but as I said in my
intervention it raises the issue of the order in which things happen.
The Bill might have to be altered to clarify
that.</div><a name="090310124000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
the final issue&#151;adults as against under-18s in eligibility for
the order&#151;I took the Minister&#146;s point about not having
the same presumptions for young people as for older people. She
answered that question, but not the other points about the differences
between the two eligibility criteria. Will she further consider those
matters as well as the ones raised directly by the amendment? With
that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000465"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I beg to move amendment 217, in
clause 87, page 51, leave out lines 14 to
27.</div>
<a name="090310124000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment stands in my name and those of my hon. Friends. It looks to
be a drastic measure as it seeks to delete the whole of subsection (7),
but it is tabled not in any spirit of aggression, but because I want to
find out what the Government mean.</div>
<a name="090310124000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">I might have
entirely misread it, but I am not sure that the syntax allows the
subsection to be understood properly. I will read it out, and perhaps
in doing so I will provide an answer to my own question:</div>
<a name="090310124000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Where
a live link direction under section 33A has effect in relation to the
accused, any examination of the accused in pursuance of a direction
under subsection (3) must take place in the presence of such persons as
Criminal Procedure Rules or the direction under subsection (3) may
provide, but in circumstances in
which&#151;&#148;</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column592" />Column number: 592</div><a name="090310124000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">and it sets out three
sets of circumstances. It continues:</div>
<a name="090310124000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this subsection any impairment of eyesight or hearing
is to be disregarded.&#148;</div>
<a name="090310124000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can probably guess
at what it tries to do, but I am not sure how it works. When the
subsection mentions &#147;circumstances in which&#148; certain
things apply or happen, one would expect something to follow. However,
nothing follows but a full stop. I wonder whether there are words
missing after &#147;accused&#148; in line 25, or whether I have
failed to spot a verb within the preceding passage, or whether, instead
of a full stop after &#147;accused&#148;, there should be a comma
or semi-colon, line 26 should start with &#147;for&#148; rather
than &#147;For&#148;, and something else should follow. It is as
simple as that. I might have utterly misread it, but if this is to
become part of the criminal law of England, we should know what it
means.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000466"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I hope that I can clarify this point for the
hon. and learned Gentleman. It was helpful of him to read out
subsection (7) as it began to fit into place more coherently. It states
that where a live link direction is given and an intermediary is
appointed, for such a person to be there the following three things, as
listed in paragraphs (a) (b) and (c), must happen. The judge must be
able to</div>
<a name="090310124000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;see and hear
the examination of the accused and to communicate with the
intermediary,&#148;</div><a name="090310124000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
jury should be able to</div>
<a name="090310124000098"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;see and hear
the examination of the accused,&#148;</div>
<a name="090310124000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">as should</div>
<a name="090310124000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;any other
person charged in the same proceedings as the
accused&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where
a live link takes place, all those people must be able to see and hear
what is going on. That is the explanation for subsection (7). I agree
that it is worded in a convoluted fashion. Does that make it clearer to
the hon. and learned Gentleman?</div>
<a name="090310124000101"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000467"></a>Mr.

<a name="090310124000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me try
this again as I am genuinely confused. I understand what the Minister

Prentice:</b> I do not disagree with the objective of the
amendment tabled by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, but I
hope that I can convince him that it is unnecessary. When defendants
are represented, we legitimately expect that their representatives will
explain to them the nature of the hearings. Indeed, if there are doubts
during the hearing about the defendant&#146;s understanding of the
process, we expect the court rightly to intervene. In cases when the
defendant is unrepresented, the court will always endeavour&#151;as
it does at the moment&#151;to give whatever assistance is necessary,
so that the defendant can understand the proceedings. In fact, it would
be highly unlikely in practice for a court to begin a live link hearing
without an explanation being given to the defendant about its nature
and purpose. That explanation can be given either at the start of the
hearing when the direction is given or, for example, at a pre-arranged
sentence
hearing.</div><a name="090310124000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
court has to be satisfied that it would not be contrary to the
interests of justice to give the live link direction. It could not
satisfy itself in that way without first ensuring that the defendant
understood what was going on. I hope that I have given the hon. and
learned Gentleman sufficient confidence to enable him to withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000122"></a>

amendment.</div><a name="090310124000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000476"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk has said from a sedentary position. That we
associate the Liberal Democrats with recording information in police
stations shows how politics is
changing.</div><a name="090310124000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
91 gives rise to a discussion similar to the one that we had earlier.
It would make it clear that proper procedures and processes must be
followed. It sounds tedious, but it essentially changes
&#147;may&#148; to &#147;must&#148;, which is an old argument
that often takes place in Public Bill Committees.</div>
<a name="090310124000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">I seek to
ensure that those who are in police stations answering to bail via a
live link between the police station and the court have their
possessions adequately recorded. It should not be a matter only of
constables&#146; discretion; we need something a little more formal.
I appreciate that police officers have plenty to do without writing
down huge amounts of information, but this measure comes from an
abundance of caution. It seeks to ensure that there are no problems
after a live link hearing, when the person answering to bail says,
&#147;Well, I came in with such and such, and now I don&#146;t have
it. The policeman must have stolen it, or the police have lost
it.&#148; It is a sensible precaution to have things recorded as a
matter of course, rather than as a matter of discretion.</div>
<a name="090310124000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 87
is perhaps of more importance. It is designed to help the police and
those who administer the criminal justice system. At the moment,
subsection (6)
says:</div><a name="090310124000393"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
constable carrying out a search under subsection (1) must be of the
same sex as the person being
searched.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
a matter of general policy, that is sensible and civilised. However,
one can imagine circumstances in which it would not strictly be
necessary for a same-sex search to take place, particularly those
circumstances outlined in amendment 87. There might be people who are
happy to be searched by someone of the opposite sex, and as long as
that does not cause embarrassment or other problems for the searcher,
the police should be prepared to accept that
consent.</div><a name="090310124000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
there is a wholly unreasonable refusal to be searched by someone of the
opposite sex, why should a relatively senior police officer not be able
to exercise common sense and discretion to conclude that a same-sex
search would be impractical, and that an opposite-sex search could be
carried out without causing the concerns outlined in our amendment?
There are plenty of good reasons for having same-sex searches, but
there may be occasions where that is not sensible and it would be
unreasonable to insist on it. I put that forward for the consideration
of the Committee, and invite the Government to respond.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000477"></a>David

provision seems to work.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000478"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000481"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will do what I can. Clause 91(4), which the
amendment relates to,
states:</div><a name="090310124000394"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
constable may record or cause to be recorded all or any of the things
seized and
retained&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is based on section 54(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,
which applies to searches of detained persons at a police station. The
provision originally required a recording of everything that a detained
person had with them, which is the effect of the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s amendment. But the present wording was substituted
in by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to reduce the substantial burden on
police officers through having to record large volumes of property. The
change enabled officers to put all the defendant&#146;s belongings
into a sealed bag, and then record the bag rather than each individual
item. The amendment would create a provision that is not unlike one
that was amended by Parliament as recently as 2003. Given that both
sides of the Committee would like to reduce unnecessary police
bureaucracy, I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will withdraw
his amendment, and after that, I will discuss amendment
87.</div><a name="090310124000140"></a>

that unreasonably to insist on a same-sex search would unnecessarily
delay the bail
hearing.&#146;.</div><a name="090310124000143"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000484"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000486"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I have a slightly more general worry about how
the clause works. Subsection (2) states
that:</div><a name="090310124000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
person who fails to attend at a police station at the time appointed
for the person to do so includes a reference to a person
who&#151;</div><a name="090310124000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
attends at a police station to answer to bail granted subject to the
duty mentioned...
but</div><a name="090310124000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
refuses to be searched under section 54B&#148;.</div>
<a name="090310124000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The provision is
rather strange. If someone turns up at a police station to answer to
bail, so that they can take part in a live link, they count as not
having turned up if they refuse to be searched. However, they are
allowed to refuse to be searched under the clause, for example, in
circumstances where a person of the same sex is not
available.</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column597" />Column number: 597</div><a name="090310124000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">In any case,
the whole thing seems odd. Proposed new section 54B gives a power to
search, and in circumstances where the clause applies, it appears that
people who turn up at a police station, say that they are answering to
their bail, but do not want to be searched, would go against the law.
If that were the case&#151;if they were then forced to be
searched&#151;they will count, simultaneously, as having refused to
turn up for their bail hearing. That seems to make no sense, so the
whole section seems rather confused. I would like the Minister to
explain why it is that a person in that position is put in jeopardy of
being told that they have failed to turn up, when plainly, they
have.</div><a name="090310124000148"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000487"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I will first respond to the hon. and learned
Member for Harborough, who tabled the amendment. He suggested that
there are situations where the search could be conducted by a constable
of the opposite sex. Proposed new section 54B to the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires that the defendant answering to
live link bail be searched by a constable of the same sex, which is in
line with the position of searches for detained people under section
54(9) of the 1984 Act. I do not see a particularly good reason for
treating defendants answering to live link bail differently from other
detained persons. I am not sure that everyone would accept that it is
better to oblige a defendant to submit to being searched by a member of
the opposite sex rather than, perhaps in a live link case, to delay the
hearing by a little while. Practically, it would be unusual for there
not to be an appropriate officer who could conduct a same-sex search in
a live link bail case. On that basis, I hope that the hon. and learned
Gentleman will withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
turn to the comments made by the hon. Member for Cambridge. In order to
ensure the safety of people and minimise any risk of harm to them or
the defendant at the police station, it is important that the police
have the power to search defendants on their return to the station to
answer to live link. The new power will be available as a matter of
routine, though the police will have some discretion, and in practice
the search will be risk-based. That is appropriate, because it puts the
defendant answering to live link bail at a police station in the same
position as those answering to bail at
court.</div><a name="090310124000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
realise that does not fully answer all the points made by the hon.
Gentleman, but I want to reflect on what he said to make sure that
there is no distinction between what happens to the live link bail
defendant and someone bailed at court. It is not the purpose of the
provision to force defendants to be searched; it is just to confer
power on the constable to be able to do so. If the defendant were to
refuse, they would be treated as though they had just been charged.
That is in effect what would happen, and they would be dealt with
accordingly, which would put them on a parallel with someone bailed
from court. On that basis, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000488"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000492"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
amendment is trying to avoid a doubt that does not exist. Although
clause 92 does not apply for the purpose of making confiscation orders,
where the application is contested or not, orders can still be made by
live link under the sentencing provisions in section 57E of the Crime
and Disorder Act 1998. A live link direction can be given only if the
court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of justice
to do so and, if the defendant is to give oral evidence, that it is not
contrary to the interests of justice for them to give evidence in that
way.</div>
<a name="090310124000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">In practice,

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000494"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Clause 94 amends section 138 of the Criminal
Justice Act 2003. That section has never been brought into force.
Clause 94 raises the question whether the Government intend to bring
section 138, and section 137 which goes with it, into force.
Why does removing the
rule,</div><a name="090310124000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
evidence in chief on matter dealt with adequately in recorded
account&#148;,</div><a name="090310124000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">make
section 138 more
acceptable?</div><a name="090310124000358"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Perhaps
I should give some background. Sections 137 and 138 of the 2003 Act
would cause a big change&#151;a radical departure&#151;in how
evidence is given in many cases. They would mean that all the
significant witnesses in a case could be interviewed on video soon
after the incident took place and that that video could count as their
evidence in chief. That goes way beyond the present arrangements, which
are only for vulnerable witnesses and children. I do not need to go
into the history&#151;the 1989 Pigot committee&#151;although that
committee made the even more radical suggestion that for children, the
cross examination should be in chambers, and videoed as well. That was
part of some radical thinking on the way in which evidence might be
taken in
court.</div><a name="090310124000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Do
the Government intend to bring sections 137 and 138 into force? If that
is the case, why will the clause help them to do so? Finally, sections
137 and 138, if they are brought in, apply only to offences specified
by the Secretary of State. The obvious question is, if the intention is
to bring those provisions into force, which offences do the Government
intend to
specify?</div><a name="090310124000426"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000495"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The hon. Gentleman provokes me into making a
further point. He correctly states that section 138 of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 has not yet been brought into force. If one
goes through the 2003 Act, many provisions have not yet been brought
into force; some have been amended, as this one will be, despite not
having been brought into force, and some have been brought into force
and already repealed. We have an object lesson in how not to construct
the criminal law. The Bill is a classic example, as we have seen with
clause 152, of how the Government rush into things. They
thought that passing a Bill was the answer to the problem, but they did
not even implement the solution that they said was so
essential.</div><a name="090310124000171"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000496"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I remind the Committee that we are
discussing the question of clause 94 standing part of the Bill, not
wider
arguments.</div><a name="090310124000172"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000497"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am illustrating why there is a real question to
be asked of the Government as to why clause 94 should stand part of the
Bill. History tells us that the Government make other clauses stand
part of other Bills and then seek to effect those provisions with
subsequent Bills, such as clause 94, leaving us all deeply sceptical
about how the Government produce legislation. My point is of general
application, but is particularly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column600" />Column number: 600</div>highlighted by clause 94. The hon. Member for Cambridge made a point,
correctly, about section 138 not being
enforced.</div><a name="090310124000173"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000498"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> With regards to sections 137 and 138, we value
video-recorded statements, but we are giving priority to video-recorded
statements made by vulnerable and intimidated witnesses under section
27 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. Considerable
resources are needed to provide verbatim transcripts of the video
recording, which the courts require for contested trials. The practice
of recording witness statements also has substantial resource
implications for the police, including the cost of equipment and
training. Priority has, therefore, been given to statements from all
child witnesses, vulnerable adults and complaints in sex-offence cases
in the Crown court. We hope to extend that further to other intimidated
witnesses in due course, but the use of video-recorded statements for
such witnesses has not been ruled out. It is a matter of case-by-case
discretion.</div><a name="090310124000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">Consideration
will be given to implementing video-recorded statements for significant
witnesses after we have had the opportunity to assess the impact of
section 27. No decision has yet been taken on the offences
that will be covered by that provision. It is likely that it will apply
to serious offences&#151;indictable ones only&#151;but there is the
power to extend it to either-way
offences.</div><a name="090310124000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
present, there is a bar on asking significant witnesses further
questions about matters that the court considers have been dealt with
adequately in video recording. The present restriction was introduced
in line with the current restriction on asking vulnerable or
intimidated witnesses supplementary questions following the playing of
the video-recorded evidence in chief. However, clause 86 relaxes the
restrictions in the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. This
clause brings the legislation for significant witnesses giving evidence
by live link broadly into line with clause 86, while taking into
account that we are not dealing with vulnerable witnesses, so no

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000499"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I want to clarify the purpose behind the
amendment of section 120(7) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The
relevant part of the 2003 Act sets out the conditions under which a
previous statement made by a witness
is</div><a name="090310124000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;admissible
as evidence of any matter stated of which oral evidence by the witness
would be
admissible.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will not go through the first two conditions, but the third is
that</div><a name="090310124000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(a)
the witness claims to be a person against whom an offence has been
committed,</div><a name="090310124000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
the offence is one to which the proceedings relate,</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column601" />Column number: 601</div><a name="090310124000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">(c) the statement
consists of a complaint made by the witness (whether to a person in
authority or not) about conduct which would, if proved, constitute the
offence or part of the
offence.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">Paragraph
(d) is the one to be excised. It refers to cases
where</div><a name="090310124000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
complaint was made as soon as could reasonably be expected after the
alleged
conduct,&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
cases are
where</div><a name="090310124000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;(e)
the complaint was not made as a result of a threat or a promise,
and</div><a name="090310124000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">(f)
before the statement is adduced the witness gives oral evidence in
connection with its subject
matter.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(8)
states:</div><a name="090310124000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of subsection (7) the fact that the complaint was elicited
(for example, by a leading question) is irrelevant unless a threat or a
promise was
involved.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
emerges, I assume, from allegations of historical sex attacks. Those
could involve a young child or teenager who makes a complaint of a
sexual assault when they are in their 20s or 30s. The fact that the
complaint is old, but none the less
made</div><a name="090310124000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;as
soon as could reasonably be expected after the alleged
conduct&#148;</div>
<a name="090310124000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">should not prevent the
information from being presented to the court.</div>
<a name="090310124000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">During the
past few months, there was a Court of Appeal decision in which Lord
Justice Latham was the lead judge&#151;I will be corrected, if I have
got that wrong. If I remember correctly, he permitted old complaints of
sexual assaults to be adduced before the current trial under common
law. That is sensible, as long as appropriate direction is given as to
the weight of the old evidence. It must be clear that arrangements will
be made through practice directions or other forms of guidance to
ensure that juries are properly warned that although old complaints are
not inadmissible under all circumstances, appropriate consideration
must be given to their weight as evidence in a case that might be tried
10, 20 or 30 years after the
event.</div><a name="090310124000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000500"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> There is little, if anything, on which I
disagree with the hon. and learned Gentleman. The change is to allow
evidence of complaints of an alleged offence to be admitted, even if
there has been a gap between the alleged offence and the victim
bringing it to someone&#146;s attention. The court will retain its
discretion to decide to exclude such evidence, if it feels that it is
unfair to the defendant. The hon. and learned Gentleman uses exactly
the right types of examples&#151;we are looking carefully at the
Court of Appeal case to which he referred to see how we can use the
clarification made there and ensure that we give effect to
it.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000503"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> This clause is of considerable significance, as
it adds to the authorities that may give immunity from prosecution.
Under section 71(4) of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005,
a specified prosecutor can issue an immunity notice. It lists
the</div><a name="090310124000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Director
of Public Prosecutions...the Director of Revenue and Customs
Prosecutions...the Director of the Serious Fraud Office...the
Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern
Ireland&#148;,</div><a name="090310124000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">as
specified prosecutors and refers to their being able to designate
someone within their departments as a specified prosecutor for the
purposes of issuing an immunity notice. That is fine so far as it goes,
but additional specified prosecutors can be created under clause 96(3),
such as the Financial Services Authority. Moreover, I find the
reference
to</div><a name="090310124000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform,
acting
personally&#148;</div><a name="090310124000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">alarming.
I know that the Secretary of State, the noble Lord Mandelson of every
conceivable village we can think of, might be a relevant witness in a
criminal proceeding having had green

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000505"></a>Mr.

It was not very funny, I agree, but it makes the day worth
living.</div><a name="090310124000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Why
on earth should a Secretary of State, irrespective of the current
office holder, be designated as a specified prosecutor for the purposes

capacity?</div><a name="090310124000198"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090310124000506"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): I
appreciate that the hon. and learned Gentleman is asking a question,
not making a point. Surely the right principle is involved, which is
that people should use the powers of the Secretary of State only when
it is clear that that is what they are doing. I always objected if an
announcement was made that the Secretary of State had done x, y or z,
if I had not taken that decision. It should be clear that the person
was acting within the powers. The wording makes it clear that the power
can be exercised only personally by the Secretary of State. It is does
not mean a personal capacity in that sense, but that the power cannot
be used anonymously by someone within the
bureaucracy.</div><a name="090310124000199"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000507"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> That may be the answer. The right hon. Gentleman
has been a Secretary of State as well as a Minister of State, so he
understands the nicety of the exercise of power by an officer of the
Crown.</div><a name="090310124000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
section 71(4)(e) of the 2005 Act, a prosecutor can be a designated
person, and the DPP can therefore designate someone else. That may be
why such a distinction is placed under the Bill, but why should the
Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform be
singled out as a relevant person to have the power to issue an immunity
notice? Why not the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary or
the Foreign Secretary? What is so magic about the office of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column603" />Column number: 603</div>Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform? I am
concerned not about the office, but about the fact that the office
holder will be acting personally. Such constitutional questions need a
response.</div><a name="090310124000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
90 simply deals with the consequential adjustment of the
paragraphs.</div>
<a name="090310124000427"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">11.45
am</div><a name="090310124000202"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000508"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I strongly support the amendment. It seems
peculiar to count the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform, as acting personally as a prosecutor. Is one to
imagine Lord Mandelson carrying out interrogations of potential
witnesses, before deciding to drop
cases?</div><a name="090310124000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, there is a constitutional
issue that relates to the Bill of Rights 1689. We say in this country
that the Crown has no power to dispense with the law or to give
immunity to particular individuals from prosecution. So far, the
exceptions that we have made to that principle in legislation have
involved examples where the prosecutor has at least some degree of
independence. I am often worried about whether prosecutors in this
country have sufficient independence from Ministers. That has been a
problem especially with the Serious Fraud Office, which is subject to
superintendence by the Attorney-General not only in its prosecutorial
decisions, but in its investigations, which is too close a
relationship.</div>
<a name="090310124000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">The example
in the Bill goes way beyond that. Here, it is not just a question of a
Minister of the Crown superintending a prosecutor with no one being
exactly clear what that means and, for example, different
Attorneys-General having different views about what they can do. The
Bill says that this particular Secretary of State can act personally,
which raises some serious problems. If the Secretary of State for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform were in a position to give
immunity to Mr. Deripaska or Sir Fred Goodwin, it would seem
to cross a constitutional
line.</div><a name="090310124000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">Underlying
that is a serious organisational problem in DBERR, because it brings
criminal prosecutions&#151;it has the old Department of Trade and
Industry powers&#151;under companies legislation of various sorts.
Fraudulent trading is the classic example, and part of the Department
conducts such prosecutions. But unlike, for example, Revenue and
Customs, the SFO and the DPP, that office is not set up separately
under statute and given a separate statutory existence and its own
powers. Technically, it exercises the powers of the Secretary of State.
That is where the problem is&#151;leaving aside the perfectly
reasonable, but perhaps more knockabout points about whether Lord
Mandelson is going to intervene in particular prosecutions.</div>
<a name="090310124000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
underlying, serious point is that there is something wrong with the way
in which DBERR is organised, and there needs to be a much clearer
separation of its prosecuting powers from the Secretary of State. It is
far too political in an area that is normally&#151;perhaps this is no
longer the case&#151;not political. A prosecutorial decision about
whether to prosecute a case of fraudulent trading is not a political
issue, and Ministers should be, clearly and under statute, further
removed from those
decisions.</div><a name="090310124000207"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000509"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I suspected that the clause and amendment would
be a gift to the Opposition in that they would not be able to resist
making some comment about the present Secretary of State for Business,
Enterprise 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column604" />Column number: 604</div>and Regulatory Reform, my right hon. and very excellent Friend Lord
Mandelson. However, I hope to persuade them that their anxiety is
unnecessary.</div><a name="090310124000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
powers of the special prosecutor are exceptional, and they are
available to prosecutors dealing with serious and organised crime.
Clause 96 extends those powers to DBERR and the FSA, because both of
them deal with serious financial crime that has a serious impact on the
United Kingdom&#146;s economy. Both need to have the full range of
tools available to other prosecutors, if they are to fight serious
financial crime. The amendments in the name of the hon. and learned
Gentleman would remove from DBERR the opportunity to be one of those
prosecutors.</div><a name="090310124000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">No
one would disagree that part of that Department&#146;s role is to
investigate and prosecute serious fraud, which is crucial in
establishing fair markets for legitimate enterprises and creating
wealth and employment in this country. Increasingly, sadly, it is
dealing with more and more serious and complex fraud allegations. The
most common offences investigated and prosecuted relate to personal or
company insolvencies. The offences include fraudulent trading and
malpractice by company directors during the wind-up or liquidation of a
company and the use of phoenix companies. The seriousness of the crimes
investigated and prosecuted by DBERR is illustrated by their current
investigation of some 80 fraudulent trading cases, in which the total
loss to creditors is estimated to be in excess of &#163;200 million.
We are talking about not minor offences, but pretty serious
stuff.</div><a name="090310124000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Department is also investigating criminal offences with an estimated
total loss to the UK economy of over &#163;333 million. It makes no
sense to extend the powers to one body that deals with serious
financial crime, the FSA, but to deny them to the other body that
similarly deals with serious financial crime, which has such an impact
on our
economy.</div><a name="090310124000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might be helpful if I explain that the intention is not for the
Secretary of State, whoever they may be, to use the powers themselves.
That will be for an appropriately senior prosecutor, meaning a chief
prosecutor or deputy chief prosecutor in the Department. The reason
that &#147;acting personally&#148; is in the clause is to disapply
the Carltona doctrine on the use of powers granted to the Secretary of
State. Under the Carltona doctrine, civil servants can exercise the
duties and powers of their Minister. The provision in the Bill is a
necessary safeguard to ensure that the exceptional and serious powers
can be delegated by the Secretary of State to no more than two
appropriately senior prosecutors within the Department. That is in
keeping with the exceptional nature of the powers, and the practice
that they should be exercised only by a small number of specific senior
prosecutors in any prosecuting
authority.</div><a name="090310124000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
might also be useful for the Committee to know that, as well as the
safeguard of strictly limiting who can use the powers, there is an
additional safeguard in that neither the FSA nor the Department for
Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will be able to offer
immunity from prosecution without the consent of the Attorney-General.
That reflects the fact that such decisions are taken on a public
interest basis and bind other
prosecutors.</div><a name="090310124000213"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000510"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The Attorney-General consent provision alarmed me
most, because it shows that there is some 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column605" />Column number: 605</div>disquiet in government about how the clause will work&#151;otherwise
one would not need to go to another Department for the safeguard. Would
it be better, at a later stage, to put what the Minister has said about
to whom the powers should be delegated&#151;perhaps a duty to
delegate them&#151;in the Bill? Otherwise, the impression will be
given that the powers will be exercised literally personally by a
Secretary of State, regardless of the identity of that Secretary of
State, which does not sound
proper.</div><a name="090310124000214"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000511"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I shall reflect on that. I accept the strange
nature of the phraseology, although I think that my right hon. Friend
Lord Mandelson would be an excellent prosecutor should he ever want to
turn his hand to
that.</div><a name="090310124000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(4) covers the issues that the hon. and learned Gentleman has raised,
and I will make sure that we look at it again. The Attorney-General
will issue guidance, which will ensure a consistency of approach. There
will be proper oversight of the use of the
powers.</div><a name="090310124000216"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000512"></a>David
Howarth:</b> Subsection (4) says &#147;may&#148; not
&#147;must&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000217"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000513"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman
and will reflect on
it.</div><a name="090310124000218"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000514"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> In her reflections, will my hon. Friend take on
the point that the most important thing in delegation is transparency,
so that it is clear if a decision is being taken by a Secretary of
State. When officials are acting with the powers of a Secretary of
State&#151;notwithstanding the Carltona doctrine&#151;that ought to
be made clear as well, because that is then honest and
transparent.</div><a name="090310124000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000515"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> My right hon. Friend has made a very good point.
Whether it is in the Bill or in some other form, we will make sure that
clarity is maintained. On that basis, I ask the hon. and learned
Gentleman to withdraw his
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000516"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am glad that the Minister has mentioned the
Carltona doctrine because, as she will appreciate, in the pubs and
clubs of Market Harborough, we talk of nothing
else.</div><a name="090310124000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
short debate has exposed an important area of law that needs further
clarification. It may be better arrived at in the other place, where
they are not quite so time-constrained. The Minister is entirely right
to say that the Attorney-General can issue guidance to particular
prosecutors, because that is set out in subsection (7), but it is very
much a &#147;may&#148; as opposed to a &#147;must&#148; point.
I know from the olden days, when I worked in the Conservative
Administration before the Attorney-General, there was a lot going on in
that Department. Plenty of Ministers and Departments constantly contact
the Attorney-General&#146;s Department for advice about one thing and
another, and so the issue of guidance will be yet another thing to land
on the Attorney-General&#146;s desk. We really need to think a little
more carefully about the construction of clause 96 before it is
enacted. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000519"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> We now move on to a different aspect of the law
and bail procedure, which can be simply described. Amendments 218 to
222 simply seek to add to murder other offences, including attempted
murder, manslaughter, rape and attempted rape. The amendments therefore
add a further list of offences that the court should be wary of when
granting bail. The default position would be that a person will not get
bail if they have been charged with one of those offences, whereas that
is not necessarily the case at the moment.</div>
<a name="090310124000428"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12
noon</div><a name="090310124000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
further expand our thinking in relation to those sets of offences by
our new clauses 22 to 27, which I shall explain as briefly as I can.
New clause 22 seeks to amend the Bail Act 1976 by adding a requirement
for the court to consider the way in which the applicant poses a risk
to public safety. I suspect that this is in the back of every
magistrate&#146;s or judge&#146;s mind when they are considering
application for bail: does this person constitute a risk to public
safety? However, it would be helpful to set out that consideration
expressly in the 1976 Act.</div>
<a name="090310124000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
23, and a number of those that follow it, seeks to adjust the way in
which those who are asking for bail are dealt with by the courts. New
clause 23 adjusts section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order
Act 1994, which deals
with</div><a name="090310124000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;no
bail for defendants charged with or convicted of homicide or rape after
previous conviction of such
offences&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000241"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new paragraph (2) of that new clause amends the text of that part of
the 1994 Act.</div>
<a name="090310124000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important part of new clause 24 is proposed new paragraph
6ZA:</div><a name="090310124000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
defendant need not be granted bail if he has been convicted but not yet
sentenced for an imprisonable
offence.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
seems a matter of common sense that, if someone has been
convicted of a reasonably serious offence, but is yet to be
sentenced because the court has adjourned sentencing for
pre-sentence reports or for other reasons, we need to be careful not to
grant bail in the interim.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column609" />Column number: 609</div><a name="090310124000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 25
deals with the removal of the presumption of bail for prolific, or
persistent, offenders. Again the important part is proposed new
paragraph
6ZB:</div><a name="090310124000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
defendant need not be granted bail if he is 18 years or over, has been
sentenced for recordable offences by the Crown Court or a
magistrates&#146; court on three or more occasions, and within 3
years of the date of the pronouncement of the last such sentence by a
court in England and Wales is subsequently arrested (or had information
laid against him) for a further recordable
offence.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">All
too often, one reads in the newspapers and comes to learn through
constituency casework of offenders who reoffend, on any number of
occasions, while on bail. While I am not seeking wholly to remove the
courts&#146; discretion to grant bail in appropriate cases, we need
to be much more thoughtful about granting bail to that type of
offender.</div>
<a name="090310124000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
26 deals with those previously convicted of breaching bail. Someone who
has shown a history of not respecting bail conditions&#151;either by
failing to turn up when required to report, or by otherwise abusing the
licence that was given to them under a bail order&#151;should not be
treated in the same way as someone coming before the court for the
first
time.</div><a name="090310124000247"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000520"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I do not agree with a lot of what the hon. and
learned Gentleman has said. However, on that particular point, it is
already an offence not to report. His new clause adds an offence of
breaching a condition&#151;only that point is
new.</div><a name="090310124000248"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000521"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I agree with the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="090310124000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 27 has been taken from Scottish legislation&#151;it is more or
less a direct lift, so I cannot claim to have been clever about it.
However, I have adjusted the Scottish legislation and put it, I hope,
in terms that fit within the jurisdiction of this country. New clause
27 would create a specific offence of breaching bail, for which the
court could impose an additional penalty to the one that would be
imposed for the underlying substantive offence. I will not go through
new clause 27, because it is in the amendment paper, but I hope that
the scheme behind it, which has, I think, been in place in Scotland for
about 10 years, appeals to the
Committee.</div><a name="090310124000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
brings us to the end of discussing the new clauses that are relevant to
this debate. The scheme is an attempt to tighten up bail, give the
public greater confidence in the bail system and make practitioners and
those who grant bail more wary of giving bail to those whom the public
might not think deserve
it.</div><a name="090310124000251"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000522"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I hope that the Government resist these new
clauses and amendments&#151;although it is partly the
Government&#146;s fault for putting clauses about bail in the Bill in
the first place. I think that those clauses are largely there for
symbolic value, rather than to make any big practical difference to
what is going on.</div>
<a name="090310124000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Two cases
have received a lot of publicity: the Weddell case and the Peart case.
In the latter case, it should be remembered that the defendant was not
on bail in the first place, so it comes down to the Gary Weddell case.
There is no need for a panic about bail based on one exceptional case.
I urge both the Government and the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column610" />Column number: 610</div>Conservative party to stay calm and not go down a damaging route that
could, in the end, increase the crime
rate.</div><a name="090310124000253"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
the end of 2007, the Justice Committee visited Canada, which is
normally known for its progressive criminal justice policies. When we
visited a large prison near Toronto, we found that it was packed full
of people on remand because of bail panic in Canada. The prisoners were
not doing anything in the way of activities, because it is difficult to
fit remand prisoners into the regime of a prison. They ended up
spending a long time on remand and before appearing before the courts.
They were often given either no prison sentence at all or a prison
sentence equivalent to their time served, and then they were released.
Canada ended up with a large prison population, when the prison
population had previously been falling. That decline was halted, and a
prison population was created that was doing nothing at all
constructive. We need to be aware of the dangers of having panics about
bail in this country,
too.</div><a name="090310124000254"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
consistent view that one gets from practitioners is that bail is
virtually never given in murder cases. The Government conducted a
snapshot survey in which they found that a surprisingly high
percentage&#151;I cannot remember the exact figure, but I think it
was 13 per cent.&#151;of defendants in homicide cases had been given
bail. That does not fit with the experience of any practitioner to whom
I have talked in any court. In fact, Liberty has suggested that such a
high percentage is simply a one-off problem&#151;a
blip&#151;because there was one case in which a large number
defendants who were all aged under 21 were given bail. I urge the
Government to conduct another survey, before Report, to see whether
they obtain a result consistent with the previous one, because that is
not what practitioners say, and it is certainly not what magistrates
say. Perhaps I should remind the Committee of my interest&#151;my
wife is a
magistrate.</div><a name="090310124000255"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000523"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> We have not
forgotten.</div><a name="090310124000256"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000524"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am afraid of the competitive punitiveness that
often breaks out between the Labour and Conservative parties. In this
case, it is not just that it might not do any good because it is based
on one exceptional case&#151;the Weddell case&#151;which could have
been dealt with differently under existing provisions, but it might
even lead to an increase in crime in the long term. The problem with
tabloid populism is that tabloid editors must respond only to the short
term and to selling their paper the following day. They do not have to
take responsibility for the long-term consequences of their
decisions.</div><a name="090310124000257"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000525"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Like the Liberal
Democrats.</div><a name="090310124000258"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000526"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In this case, we have a particular responsibility
to call the other parties and tell them not to do that, because they do
not have to and it may make the problem worse.</div>
<a name="090310124000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">One must
understand how bail works to see what the problem is. If someone is
remanded in custody, there are only three possibilities for what might
happen to them. First, they may eventually be found guilty and
sentenced to prison. Secondly, they may be found not 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column611" />Column number: 611</div>guilty or the case may be dropped, in which case they will be released.
Thirdly, they may be found guilty, but sentenced in some way other than
prison. Those three possibilities show what the problem is with
tightening
bail.</div><a name="090310124000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
first possibility is that someone is found guilty and sentenced to
prison. The time that they served on remand is deducted from their
sentence, so putting someone on remand in custody does not increase the
time that they spend off the streets in prison, and does not reduce the
risk of offending or protect the public. In fact, to the extent that
putting people in prison increases the risk of reoffending, it
increases the risk of future crime. We know, and the Ministry of
Justice briefing shows, that if people are put in prison, they often
lose their job and their home, and we know that those two conditions
are associated with an increased risk of
reoffending.</div><a name="090310124000261"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
remarks do not apply to the Government&#146;s proposals, because
there will be so few cases&#151;virtually none&#151;that they will
make no difference, but they may apply to the Conservative
party&#146;s proposals. From the information given by the
Conservative party and certain assumptions, the Library calculates that
they will increase the prison population by about 3,000. That is a
problem, and those 3,000 people, because they will have been
imprisoned, will be more likely to reoffend than people who have not
been put in
prison.</div><a name="090310124000262"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second possibility is that the person is found not guilty, the case is
dropped and the person is released. In that case, what happens? We will
have imprisoned an innocent person for up to six months&#151;that is
how long people are held on remand&#151;and perhaps made them worse
by putting them in a position in which they lose their job and their
home. The third possibility is that the person receives a non-custodial
sentence, in which case we will have imprisoned someone whom the court
eventually decides should not be in prison with all the effects that
that might
have.</div><a name="090310124000429"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.15
pm</div><a name="090310124000263"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000527"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):</b> The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing against
remanding people into custody at all. Is that his
argument?</div><a name="090310124000264"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000528"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is just one of those populist points that
people make. The Bail Act 1976 works. The 1976 Act, under which the
Government themselves are operating, creates a presumption in favour of
bail. Are the Government saying that they are against a presumption for
bail? If they are, they should put a clause saying that into the Bill.
However, they have not done so and, since they have not, the
Minister&#146;s point also applies to her. Is that what she is
saying? No, it is not. Therefore it is also not what I am
saying.</div><a name="090310124000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point is that there is a presumption for bail with certain exceptions
that are designed to balance the public interest against the downside
of remanding people in custody. The question is whether that balance
should go in one direction or another. The problem is that, if it is
shoved in the direction of bail panic, more crime will be caused in the
long term, not in the short term. The tabloid headlines might be
avoided in the short term, but in the long term there will be more
victims of crime.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column612" />Column number: 612</div><a name="090310124000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not want
to go through the new clauses one by one, but there are problems with
particular ones. The problem with new clause 24, for example, which is
about removing the presumption of bail for convicted but unsentenced
prisoners, is precisely the problem that I have raised. If someone is
remanded in custody for a time, that time is knocked off their prison
sentence, so the public are not protected for any more time. If the
person is sentenced to a non-custodial sentence, there is a presumption
in the law that contradicts the court&#146;s eventual decision. I
cannot see how that
works.</div><a name="090310124000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to mention all the new clauses one by one, but there are
serious problems with all of them. New clause 23, for example, violates
human rights standards under existing case law and therefore could not
possibly survive. A version of that new clause in the existing law was
read down by the courts, because it violated human rights
standards.</div><a name="090310124000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
political system has to get off the merry-go-round and start thinking
about the long term and about how we reduce crime. Amendments with the
same intent to the new clauses have been tabled on the part of the Bill
dealing with the sentencing provisions, which we will come to later on.
This is really about whether criminal justice policy works to reduce
crime or to reduce bad
headlines.</div><a name="090310124000269"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000529"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> In order that we can get to the debate on
sentences, I shall try to be as brief as I possibly
can.</div><a name="090310124000270"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="090310124000530"></a><b class="B">Ian
Lucas</b> (Wrexham) (Lab): Hear,
hear.</div><a name="090310124000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000531"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I thank my hon. Friend the Whip, who supports
that.</div><a name="090310124000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
assume that some of the amendments express the views of the previous
shadow Secretary of State for Justice, who issued proposals on the
matter in summer last year. However, although he has moved on, clearly
the policy has not. I understand the motive behind extending the
provisions beyond murder. In some ways, it does not seem unreasonable
that the provisions should extend to crimes that give rise to
apprehension of further violence elsewhere. But there are two reasons
why I feel unable to accept the
amendments.</div><a name="090310124000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
it is right to keep the focus on the offence of murder, which has a
unique position within the criminal justice system because of its
seriousness, and dealing with that offence is the best way to address
the concerns of the public. Obviously, the line has to be drawn
somewhere. There are strong precedents for treating murder differently
from other
offences.</div><a name="090310124000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
and more practically, clause 98 requires bail decisions in murder cases
to be made by a Crown court judge. If we were to extend that provision
to catch defendants charged with other serious violent or sexual
offences, the number of cases to which it would apply would
substantially increase, which would have major implications for the
Crown court. The number of defendants proceeded against for murder in
2007 was 812, whereas almost four times as many were prosecuted for
attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or attempted rape. New clauses 22
to 26 seem to be designed to make remand in custody more likely for a
larger group of people, as the hon. Member for Cambridge has pointed

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000532"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I support the Minister on this. It is difficult
to imagine a case where someone can be a threat to public safety and
yet not likely to commit an offence while on bail. That seems to be
impossible. The new clause adds nothing to the existing
law.</div><a name="090310124000277"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000533"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for
repeating my point in a different way. We believe that clause 97(3) is
a better way of taking public protection into account. It makes the
risk of injury to another person a consideration that the courts must
have regard to when making bail decisions. It is not a free-standing
exception to bail, but rather an adjunct to the existing one. It
operates only where there are substantial grounds for believing that
the defendant would commit an offence, if released on bail.</div>
<a name="090310124000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
23 would extend the offences covered by section 25 of the Criminal
Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It is right that a
provision such as this, which is designed to affect the liberty of the
unconvicted persons to whom it applies, should be very limited in its
scope. The wider the range of offences caught by the new clause, the
greater the likelihood that it will catch defendants who would properly
be granted bail. The court would then have to strain to find a
justification, in the form of exceptional circumstances, for granting
bail. We do not think that it would be right to widen the provision in
that
way.</div><a name="090310124000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clauses 24 to 26 would remove the right to bail for a different group
of defendants. Under new clause 24 the presumption to bail
would be removed from convicted but unsentenced defendants. The hon.
Member for Cambridge made a perfectly valid point in relation to that.
It would mean that offenders who are not likely to be sentenced for a
period of imprisonment and who have given no cause for alarm during
time already spent on bail would automatically lose that right to bail.
We do not believe that to be
necessary.</div><a name="090310124000280"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
right to bail does not prevent the court from remanding a defendant in
custody, regardless of the remand status before conviction, if it
believes that conviction, with the probability of a long prison
sentence, has increased the risk of the defendant absconding,
reoffending or interfering with
witnesses.</div><a name="090310124000281"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 25 would create an exception to bail, where the defendant has
been convicted three times of a recordable offence. We are not
convinced by that; it is a rather prescriptive approach and not
necessarily the most helpful way to go about it. Having said that, the
courts already take into account a defendant&#146;s previous
offending history when making remand decisions.</div>
<a name="090310124000282"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
26 would mean that the defendant need not be granted bail, if they have
a previous conviction for failure to surrender&#151;which is already
an offence 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column614" />Column number: 614</div>under the Bail Act 1976&#151;or for breach of bail conditions, which
is not already an offence, but would become so under new clause
27.</div>
<a name="090310124000283"></a><div class="hs_Para">The problem
is that the connection between the previous conviction, and the risk
that justifies the refusal of bail, could be tenuous. For example, it
is not evident that a defendant who failed to answer his bail 30 years
ago as a youth is still not to be trusted now that he has achieved
middle age and some element of respectability in his community.
However, the court is required to take into account previous behaviour
on bail when considering the risk of someone absconding, offending or
interfering with witnesses. That is a more flexible approach that the
one given by new clause 27, and we expect that the courts would be able
to make the decision on a case-by-case
basis.</div><a name="090310124000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 27 suggests that failure to comply with court bail conditions,
while not an offence at present, should be an offence. However, there
are other ways in which to deal with the matter. The police already
have a power of immediate arrest when a breach occurs, and courts can
always revoke bail and remand the defendant in custody or alter the
conditions, if they think it appropriate. The risk of immediate custody
without the need of a trial is a strong incentive to comply with bail
conditions, so we do not believe that there needs to be a separate
offence of
breach.</div><a name="090310124000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
an offence is committed while on bail and that fact is specified in the
indictment, new clause 27 would require the court to have regard to
that and to any previous convictions for breach of a bail condition
when determining sentence. The fact that an offence was committed on
bail is already an aggravating factor that the court should take into
account, when considering the appropriate sentence for a particular
offence. It is questionable therefore how much difference adding
another year to the maximum penalty would be likely to make to the
sentence actually
imposed.</div><a name="090310124000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">Has
the hon. and learned Gentleman quantified the resource implications of
the proposals? Does he accept, as the hon. Member for Cambridge has
said, that an extra 3,000 prison places might be needed? How would that
be achieved? However, that is an aside to the general principle that
the new clauses are not necessary, because the clause strikes the
proper balance between the right to bail and the exceptions that a
court can take into consideration, if it considers that a particular
defendant should not be given bail for the specific offence that is
before them? On that basis, I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to
withdraw the
amendment.</div><a name="090310124000287"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000534"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I am sorry that the hon. Member for Cambridge has
accused me of following a tabloid agenda. I have been accused of many
things in my time. I have even worked for a number of tabloid
newspapers as a defamation lawyer, but I have never followed a tabloid
agenda.</div><a name="090310124000288"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000535"></a>David
Howarth:</b> From the low key way in which the hon. and
learned Gentleman discussed the new clauses, I fully accept that he
personally rarely follows the tabloid agenda. However, on this
occasion, his party
does.</div><a name="090310124000289"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000536"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Let us not have a lengthy discussion about that
matter. I hope to have a debate in a reasonably intelligent
way&#151;although I sometimes fall below that&#151;on how the law
of bail should develop. The Bill adjusts the Bail Act 1976. Common to
both the Bill and the 1976 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column615" />Column number: 615</div>Act is the element of discretion that is given to the courts to deal
with cases in a just way. As the hon. Gentleman&#146;s wife has no
doubt experienced in the granting of bail applications as a justice of
the peace on the Cambridge bench, I assume, so from time to time have
I, as a recorder in the Crown courts of London as well as in
Nottingham, to deal with bail applications. As, no doubt, does the hon.
Gentleman&#146;s wife, I have to sentence people and do so after some
delay between the finding of guilt and the sentencing hearing, so
neither she nor I is unaware of the implications of some of the
arguments and their logical extensions that I have been putting
forward.</div><a name="090310124000359"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">Having,
as I have said at least once in our proceedings during the past few
weeks, been to about 50 prisons in England and Wales in almost three
years, I am utterly aware of the disgusting state of some of them and
the identity and nature of some of those who are in them, and who
should not be in them but elsewhere. I am wholly aware of the fact
that, were my new clauses to be accepted, more people would be going to
prison, but we cannot avoid such implications and consequences in order
to have a moderately calm discussion about the law of
bail.</div><a name="090310124000430"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.30
pm</div><a name="090310124000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
did not actually mention any particular case&#151;others have done
so, but I deliberately did not&#151;but one must look at the
Government&#146;s record on prison capacity over the past 10 or 11
years, in which time prisoner numbers have increased from about 61,000
to about 83,000 but the available space to house them has not increased
adequately to cope with them. In the case of about 20,000 to 23,000
prisoners, two men share a single-man cell, or sometimes three men
share a two-man cell. In essence, when prisoners are doubled up, it
means that two adult men spend long hours of every day eating,
defecating, sleeping and reading in a shared
lavatory.</div><a name="090310124000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">One
must be very careful about wanting more people to be pushed into such
conditions or producing authorities that suggest that that should
happen. I do not want to see that. I do not want to undermine judicial
discretion on the granting of bail, but I do think that every now and
then we need to think a bit more carefully about the
situation.</div><a name="090310124000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
accept that this Government, who have been in office for the past 11 or
so years, could not always be accused of thinking carefully. They
frequently make many mistakes. I dare say that they do not do things by
mistake, but they do make mistakes, and their approach to prisons, the
law of bail and indeed the whole canon of criminal justice law is
littered with mistakes. My purpose in discussing these clauses is not
that I naively thought that everything that I said or drafted would
find its way into the Bill but that I thought that we need to think
about such matters from time to time. It does not matter whether we
think about these questions in a rage or in a calm and rational manner;
they need from time to time to be thought about. It was in that spirit
that I entered the discussion, and it is in that spirit that I beg to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000539"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The clause sends bail decisions in murder cases
to the Crown court, away from the magistrates court, and I want to ask
why that should be. As a matter of practice, magistrates deal with bail
applications every day. In fact, one of the main sources of activity in
a magistrates court is these difficult and often technical decisions,
which are dealt with by magistrates who are expert in them. Crown court
judges simply are not. In fact, if one looks at the Weddell case, which
I mentioned previously, the problem was that the decision did go to a
Crown court judge. It was a Crown court judge who let that individual
out on bail. In general, magistrates believe that Crown court judges
are too soft in bail decisions, so one questions the policy underlying
the clause. However, even if one did not question that policy, one
should start to question the detail of how the clause works. We tabled
our amendments for precisely that reason.</div>
<a name="090310124000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government seem to have been told that if one transfers such decisions
from a magistrates court to a Crown court judge, there will be certain
practical consequences. One is that a Crown court judge would take a
long time to organise&#151;there are fewer Crown court judges than
magistrates and it is difficult to fit such applications into their
lists. Therefore, the accused&#151;the defendant&#151;will wait
three days before receiving a bail hearing, whereas that would be only
one day if the bail hearing were to be held in the magistrates court. I
question whether holding someone for three days simply to find a Crown
court judge is acceptable, when the matter could be dealt with more
expeditiously by a
magistrate.</div><a name="090310124000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly,
the clause implies that the Government have been told that Crown court
judges do not work on weekends or in holidays, because the clause does
not count those days in the period within which a bail hearing has to
be heard. A great advantage of magistrates is that they are local and
there are a lot of them&#151;magistrates who are prepared to act on
weekends can be found. The Saturday magistrates court is a common
institution throughout the
country.</div><a name="090310124000301"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
end up with the possibility of unacceptable delays&#151;if we add
together the three-day delay, a weekend and perhaps a bank holiday, we
are looking at nearly a week without a bail hearing, simply because of
the nature of Crown court judges as opposed to magistrates. My
amendments would therefore get rid of the extra delays designed for the
convenience of Crown court judges&#151;the three days and the
exemption for weekends and bank holidays&#151;taking the period back
to the 24 hours that magistrates operate in</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column617" />Column number: 617</div><a name="090310124000302"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the
Government say in reply that the amendments would make the provision
not practicable, it seems to me that the whole clause is impracticable
and we should return those decisions to where they should be taken, in
a magistrates
court.</div><a name="090310124000303"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000540"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Either of the changes&#151;the reduction in
the upper limit or the removal of the exclusions&#151;would be
impracticable individually and, together, wholly so. Secondly, the
changes are unnecessary. Most defendants charged with murder are not
granted bail and, even under the present system, those who are would
not be granted bail by the magistrates courts. Defendants in such
categories would not be affected in practical terms if the remand
decision was delayed for the maximum period specified in the
clause.</div><a name="090310124000304"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
are occasionally murder cases in which there would be a strong argument
for remanding the defendant on bail. In those cases, which are rare,
arrangements would be made to bring the case before a judge of the
Crown court in much less than the 48-hour maximum. In those wholly
exceptional cases in which there is a strong argument for immediate
bail, the section 51 sending hearing might take place before a district
judge who, using the powers available to him as a judge of the Crown
court, could consider bail on the
spot.</div><a name="090310124000305"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendments, which are
impracticable and
unnecessary.</div><a name="090310124000306"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000541"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I note with interest that the Minister now agrees
with me about how rare the granting of bail in murder cases
is&#151;very rare. She is using that very rareness as an
argument&#151;quite a good one&#151;for saying that the amendments
would make no difference, because in almost all cases the defendant is
remanded in custody anyway. That is quite correct. The point is simply
about process and whether it is acceptable to have such delays before
that hearing, which almost inevitably results in remand in custody,
simply because of the desire to have that decision taken by a Crown
court judge rather than by a magistrate, who would make the same
decision. It seems that the Government have not produced any evidence
on which to base the transfer of such cases to the Crown court,
especially given the fact that in the exceptional case where it plainly
all went wrong, bail was granted by a Crown court judge in the first
place. I urge the Government to think about why they are doing this. Is
it simply for symbolic reasons? If it is, I urge them to think again.
On the basis that the point has been made, I beg to ask leave to

Michael:</b> It is my pleasure to have tabled
amendment 150, which introduces a group of amendments that I
am sure Ministers will find constructive and helpful. My amendments are
intended to provide clarity and focus in the work of the sentencing
council, whose establishment under the Bill I welcome and applaud. All
that I will say about the Opposition amendments that would prevent the
establishment of the sentencing council is that I disagree profoundly
with that approach. I agree with the Government that there should be a
sentencing council and that sentencers should not only hear a case
objectively and fairly before reaching a judgment, but have a good idea
of the outcome that will follow from the sentence that they give. That
is the fundamental reason for having a sentencing council, but if that
is to work, the council needs to be genuinely objective and focus its
work on real, hard evidence. The Bill as it stands does not achieve
that sort of clarity or give that sort of role to the sentencing
council.</div><a name="090310124000327"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suspect that Ministers will share my general frustration that the
so-called explanatory notes that accompany any Bill are rarely clearer
than the Bill itself: they rarely provide any explanation and
contribute only to the recycling targets in this House&#151;indeed,
they ought to be recycled as opaque and unhelpful notes. That is not
the fault of the officials who draft them, but there is a degree of
paranoia about saying anything useful that might affect the
interpretation of the Bill
itself.</div><a name="090310124000431"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">12.45
pm</div><a name="090310124000328"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although
the notes on this clause are as useless as ever, they unintentionally
reveal a defect in the Bill. Paragraph 528
says:</div><a name="090310124000414"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
it draws up guidelines, the Council must have regard to current
sentencing practice, the need to promote consistency in sentencing, the
need to promote public confidence in the criminal justice system, the
cost of different sentences, their effectiveness in reducing
re-offending and the Council&#146;s monitoring of the application of
its
guidelines.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000329"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
problem is that we get to item five of six before we find a reference
to the effectiveness of &#147;reducing re-offending&#148;. The
order of priorities is wrong. Even if it is argued that each of the six
items is of equal importance, the effectiveness of sentencing in
reducing reoffending is not given the high priority that it needs. Such
an item is essential and should be the focus of the sentencing
council.</div><a name="090310124000330"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
amendments are intended to address two key questions, which are not
answered by the Bill as it is drafted. First, what is the sentencing
council for, and what is it meant to achieve? That is not dealt with in
the Bill as it stands. Amendment 150 provides clear purpose for the
Bill. It
states:</div><a name="090310124000415"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
purpose of the Council shall be to issue guidance to sentencers, having
particular regard to the effectiveness of each form of sentence in
reducing
re-offending.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000331"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
means not that other considerations must be cast to one side, but that
effectiveness must be the clear first focus, the first thing that
enters the mind of members of the sentencing council when they reach
their conclusions.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column620" />Column number: 620</div><a name="090310124000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
big question is who should be on the council and why? I have made two
contributions in that regard. Amendments 160 and 161 propose that there
should be additional members. Either amendment would improve
considerably the membership of the sentencing council. Amendment 160
proposes:</div><a name="090310124000416"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;6
members appointed by resolution of the House of
Commons.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000333"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
161 proposes an alternative or complementary approach. It
says:</div><a name="090310124000417"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;6
members appointed by the Prime Minister (&#145;independent
members&#146;).&#148;</div><a name="090310124000334"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
then address the issue of who such people should be. Amendment 158
would insert the
words</div><a name="090310124000418"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;their
experience and capacity for evaluating evidence on the effectiveness of
different
sentences&#148;.</div><a name="090310124000335"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is important because judges, who are to be members of the sentencing
council, bring experience of the courts and of judgments. They do not
bring experience of the effectiveness of sentences once they are
passed.</div>
<a name="090310124000336"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted to
clarify the purpose of members appointed by the Prime Minister, so in
amendment 162, I propose the
following:</div><a name="090310124000419"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;When
appointing independent members, the Prime Minister shall have regard to
their experience of and capacity for assessing evidence especially in
relation to the effectiveness of sentences in terms of reducing
re-offending.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is to ensure that the people appointed are capable of addressing the
key question of how to reduce reoffending, which has to be at the core
of what the criminal justice system is about, but is currently not at
the heart of what the criminal justice system thinks it is
about&#151;if I can address such a complex organisation in that
way.</div><a name="090310124000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
153 places a similar responsibility on the sentencing council itself.
It
says:</div><a name="090310124000420"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
proposing sentencing guidelines the Sentencing Council must have
specific regard to the comparative effectiveness of different sentence
options and indicate the data, research findings or other evidence on
which the Council has relied in preparing its
guidance.&#148;</div><a name="090310124000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will touch on the Carter review in a moment, but there is a case for
arguing that a link between the evidence and the conclusions is
something that should be made compulsory. My point is that we should
ensure not only that the right people are on the sentencing councils
and that they have the right skills but that they are told what their
priority is with regard to reducing
reoffending.</div><a name="090310124000340"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
151 and 152 would, by deletion, extract</div>
<a name="090310124000421"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;and their
relative effectiveness in preventing
re-offending,&#148;</div><a name="090310124000341"></a><div class="hs_Para">from
low down the list of priorities and make the provision the first
priority on the list of elements that the sentencing council would take
into account when making its
recommendations.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000546"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Judges have some experience of the effectiveness
of their sentences, because, all too often, they see offenders again
and again. Judges therefore takes a close interest in the effectiveness
of their sentence, for fear that it will not prevent, or help to
prevent, reoffending.</div>
<a name="090310124000343"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000547"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I understand the hon. and learned
Gentleman&#146;s point and respect his belief in judges&#146;
capacity to evaluate the impact of sentencing. However, his belief is
not well placed. The problem is that, in 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column621" />Column number: 621</div>seeing before them people who constantly reoffend, judges see the
outcome of failure, not of effectiveness. I shall give an example of
that in a few moments.</div>
<a name="090310124000344"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000548"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> On drug treatment and testing orders, judges
review the individual, who comes back at two to four-week intervals,
and one can often see the progression from drug addiction to health. It
is one of the few occasions on which a relationship builds up between
the judge as a human being and the defendant as a human being, rather
than a statistic flowing down the criminal justice stream. That is
something from which we can really benefit.</div>
<a name="090310124000345"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000549"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am happy to agree with the hon. and learned
Gentleman, but he makes my case for me, because that, in his own words,
is the exception when it comes to sentencing. It is a valuable and
useful one, not only for the person who undertakes the rehabilitation
and whose situation the judge reviews, but for the judge, who can see
its progression.</div>
<a name="090310124000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">I used to
chair the youth court&#151;then the juvenile bench&#151;in Cardiff,
and I felt that the engagement of the sentencer with what happened
after the sentence was particularly useful. My experience was informed
by the fact that I was a youth worker with young offenders, and those
whom I had sentenced often appeared on projects I ran. It was a
salutary experience, because I thought that when I had told youngsters
precisely why a particular sentence had been decided upon, they would
understand every word; by and large, however, they had either not
understood or not heard a word in the court situation.</div>
<a name="090310124000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">The link
between the sentence and what happens afterwards is often not available
to sentencers&#151;I hasten to add that I never sat on a case
involving a youngster about whom I had prior knowledge, because that
would not have been right. On occasions, however, I saw the
consequences of the sentencing process and its limitations, and that
has encouraged me in the approach I propose.</div>
<a name="090310124000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response
to the hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s interventions, my point is
that the relevant experience of judges, to which he referred, is
already available to the sentencing council. At present, judges are to
be on the council and in the majority, which is fundamentally wrong.
Their experience should form a part of the council&#146;s
deliberations, but not the whole of it; there is more to it than that.
My basic belief is that the sentencing council should be about
evidence, evidence, evidence. I do not mean court evidence or evidence
heard in court, or evidence about the nature and seriousness of a
specific offence; I mean evidence of what works.</div>
<a name="090310124000349"></a><div class="hs_Para">Judges are
influenced by the media and by political debate in the media, as they
acknowledge. They tell us so, and sentences demonstrate that they are
influenced by the wider media debate. I am thinking of, for instance,
the increase in prison numbers. The public think that courts are
extremely lenient, yet in fact the evidence is that by and large courts
take the decisions that the public would take if they were passing the
sentence. The reality is closer to what the public think is just and
right.</div><a name="090310124000350"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
sentencing council needs to balance the tendency to be influenced by
wider public and media debate,  by having the guiding principle
that it is informed by  what actually happens as a consequence
of different sentencing options.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column622" />Column number: 622</div><a name="090310124000351"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000550"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I agree with every word that the right hon.
Gentleman has said, as other Committee members will be able to tell
from the fact that I have signed nearly all his amendments. I would
like to illustrate the point about judges not knowing. I once had a
conversation with a High Court judge&#151;I will not name
them&#151;who said to me, &#147;We should go back to the short
sharp shock. People come before my court and I see them not responding,
so a short sharp shock would work.&#148; The evidence shows that
short sharp shocks do not work. The social science evidence on that is
very clear, but eminent judges have never been exposed to that sort of
evidence and they need to
be.</div><a name="090310124000352"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000551"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Gentleman has made a good point, and I
am grateful for his support for my argument. In the course of visiting
a number of penal institutions in America, I found attending a boot
camp a salutary experience. For the first half-hour that I was there, I
thought I was seeing all the characteristics associated with a short
sharp shock. The young men in the boot camp were being marched around,
barked at, made to smarten themselves up and all the rest of it.
However, I thought that something different was going on when 
I saw the number of people, including volunteers, who were engaged with
those young men when they went into the educational part of the
establishment. There, they were made to pay attention, but they were,
in effect, being dragooned into learning to read and
write.</div><a name="090310124000353"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
headline &#147;Short Sharp Shock&#148; had the subscript of
&#147;Let&#146;s make sure that these young men go from this place
with the ability to read and write, because then there is a chance of
them becoming useful members of society.&#148; That is why it is very
important to get under the headlines of what sentencing is about, into
the detail, and in understanding that detail, to understand that
sometimes a headline can be combined with something that works, and
sometimes something that works can be combined with a headline that
reassures the
public.</div><a name="090310124000354"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000552"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The more I listen to the right hon. Gentleman,
the more I think that he must have read our paper &#147;Prisons with
a Purpose&#148;, published last March. I want to make a helpful
intervention in relation to the point made by the hon. Member for
Cambridge. I am sure that what the High Court judge said was what he
thought was right, but by and large High Court judges tend to try the
most serious criminal cases and therefore they do not deal with the
sentencing options that the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth as a magistrate or I as a recorder have to deal with. For what
we are talking about, the evidence will most usefully come from the
general infantry of Crown court judges and magistrates, rather than
from the High
Court.</div><a name="090310124000355"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="090310124000553"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> Listening to the hon. and learned Gentleman, I
think that his contribution is informed by his experience as a defence
barrister, rather than a recorder&#151;I am sure that the judges will
be very pleased with their advocate here. I am not talking against
judges; I am merely trying to define the limitation on the sentencing
council if only judges bring their issues to bear. At the top end of
danger&#151;the most dangerous criminals&#151;I am not too bothered
about that, because that is where the public need to be protected and
where the focus of the court system is quite good. It is the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column623" />Column number: 623</div>generality that I am concerned about. We have ended up with numbers of
people who do not need to be in the criminal justice system or do not
need to be in it in the long term and who could be taken out of it by
interventions at the right stage.</div>
