have had a look at the grouping of amendments. It is fairly
comprehensive and it might be for the convenience of the Committee if
we treat our discussions also as a stand part debate. Members of the
Committee might like to bear that in mind when seeking to make
contributions to the debate.</div>
<a name="0902275000031"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000469"></a><b class="B">David
Howarth</b> (Cambridge) (LD): The hon. Member for Stafford was
in the middle of an intervention at the end of this morning&#146;s
sitting, and I would be glad to hear the rest of
it.</div><a name="0902275000032"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000470"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. This Chairman takes the view that
interventions fall when the guillotine comes down. However, if the hon.
Gentleman wishes to give way to the hon. Member for Stafford, he may do
so.</div>
<a name="0902275000033"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000471"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am happy to give way to the hon.
Gentleman.</div><a name="0902275000034"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000472"></a><b class="B">Mr.
David Kidney</b> (Stafford) (Lab): Does the hon. Gentleman
agree with Sir Mark Walport, who said that he never envisaged that
clause 152 would deal with medical records, and that he expected a
separate scheme especially for medical records? The fact that observers
fear that medical records could go willy-nilly everywhere under the
clause shows that it is too widely drawn and needs restricting. Does
the hon. Gentleman accept that the present group of amendments does not
quite meet the objections that Richard Thomas disclosed to us in his
evidence, and in his memorandum that we have received since
then?</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column363" />Column number: 363</div><a name="0902275000035"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000473"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I accept both those points. The evidence of
Richard Thomas and Mark Walport shows that the Government&#146;s case
that they were simply following the Thomas and Walport review is not
right. Both Richard Thomas and Mark Walport have clarified their
position and say that they are worried that the clause is now far too
wide. The hon. Gentleman might also be right that our amendments to
tease out the Government&#146;s position are not the proposals that
Walport and Thomas wanted to
see.</div><a name="0902275000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Gentleman made an important point about medical records, and
perhaps now is the right time to mention that the BMA said that there
will often be a big benefit for medical research in being able to share
information, but that the information does not have to be associated
with a named individual. The BMA&#146;s support for data sharing was
support for anonymous data to be shared for medical research purposes,
not for the purposes allowed under the clause. I should have referred
to the use of pseudonyms rather than the data being completely
anonymous. We need to track through an individual to undertake the
research properly, but the individual must not be
named.</div><a name="0902275000037"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000474"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Tim Boswell</b> (Daventry) (Con): Although I do not dissent
from the thrust of the hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, does he agree
that one of the difficulties behind such matters is something that I
have already mentioned in Committee? The Government tend to take an
on-off view of data sharing, as if everything has to be shared rather
than just salient parts of the record, which may or may not be
anonymised for the purpose for which they required to be
shared?</div><a name="0902275000038"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000475"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I am sure that is right, but the way to proceed
is that mentioned by the hon. Member for Stafford, which is under a
specific scheme for pseudonymised medical record sharing. We are
talking about an important special case.</div>
<a name="0902275000039"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000476"></a><b class="B">Alun
Michael</b> (Cardiff, South and Penarth) (Lab/Co-op): In his
introductory remarks, the hon. Member for Cambridge was painting the
clause as a great plot. However, his argument is now much more to the
point. It is about how we undertake the appropriate use of data. Does
he accept that it is all about making the right judgments according to
the right principles, and the importance of the code of conduct
applying in all
cases?</div><a name="0902275000040"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000477"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I agree that the code of conduct is important,
but we have to get the primary legislation right, so that we do not
allow the Government too broad a power. We have to somehow control it
by using the code of conduct, which will not be all that clear in
individual cases. It is important to get the powers right first so that
it is more difficult to use them disproportionately. I am not sure
whether it is a conspiracy, though I suspect that the right hon.
Gentleman is right, but it has become a habit.</div>
<a name="0902275000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">My underlying
worry about the clause is that it has become a habit to draw up such
statutory powers over-broadly. That is how the problems of detail are
solved&#151;not by thinking hard about them and being more specific.
It seems that the tendency is to solve them by saying, &#147;We will
grab the broadest possible power and leave the  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column364" />Column number: 364</div>problems until later.&#148; That is not good enough. Our duty as
parliamentarians is to ensure that the powers are incapable of being
used in an inappropriate
way.</div><a name="0902275000042"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000478"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Edward Garnier</b> (Harborough) (Con): The hon.
Gentleman&#146;s point is reinforced when one looks at proposed new
section
50B:</div><a name="0902275000382"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
information-sharing order may provide for the creation of offences
triable either way which are
punishable&#151;</div><a name="0902275000383"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
on conviction on indictment, by imprisonment for a term not exceeding
the specified period or to a fine or to
both&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">Here
we have vague crime and sentencing-making powers that are not described
in the Bill, which will be left to a subsequent or the present
Secretary of State to devise, about which he and I as Members of
Parliament have absolutely no idea. If we are to make the criminal law,
it should be clear in the
Bill.</div><a name="0902275000044"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000479"></a>David
Howarth:</b> That is an important principle. As the penalties
and the consequences get worse, the need for parliamentary scrutiny
rises. The breadth of the powers are breathtaking in the way that they
have been written. The data can be shared with any person or
organisation, presumably in any part of the world, not just with
someone or with an organisation in Britain, and certainly not just with
an organisation that is bound by the Human Rights Act and is not an
organ of the
state.</div><a name="0902275000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">An
order can be made in pursuance of any relevant policy without any
restriction at all. Among the many consequences of an order, or part of
the content of an order, is the power to amend primary legislation to
change any enactment. It is important to bear in mind that when Mark
Walport and Richard Thomas wrote their report, they made it clear that
they did not envisage such breadth. They talked about specific
circumstances and they now object, and I strongly object, to the
possibility of using an information-sharing order to override the
provisions of the Data Protection Act.</div>
<a name="0902275000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Walport and
Thomas envisaged information-sharing orders subject to the Data
Protection Act and all eight of the data-sharing principles, which
include the idea that data collected for one purpose should not be used
for another. The Government should acknowledge that the Bill as drafted
goes way beyond the evidence and policy base that they thought they had
in the Walport and Thomas
report.</div><a name="0902275000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
will go through the points that our amendments raise and ask the
Government to comment on them individually. My first point concerns
amendment 49 and how information-sharing orders can be in favour of
&#147;any person&#148;. I realise, and we debated it earlier, that
there are examples of the line being blurred between the public and the
private sector. It is now often difficult to tell where that line lies.
I can see the origin of &#147;any person&#148; in that. However, to
leave the wording unrestrained like that has many dangers.</div>
<a name="0902275000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">What happens
in the case of data that are controlled by foreign corporations and
Governments, and especially by organisations that are not subject to
the Human Rights Act, and therefore are not subject to the controls and
respect for individual rights and freedom that the Act establishes? I
know what the problem is, but I cannot accept that the solution is
simply to leave it to Ministers to make up their minds later whether,
in any particular case, the person with whom data have been shared is
appropriate.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column365" />Column number: 365</div><a name="0902275000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">I consider
amendment 52 to be the most important in the group, and if I am not
happy with the Government&#146;s reply, I shall press it to a
Division. The amendment would remove from the definition of
&#147;sharing&#148; data that are used for a different purpose from
the one originally authorised. That is automatically a violation of the
principles of data protection, and I object to a provision in the Bill
undermining data
protection.</div><a name="0902275000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
need to be clear. The idea that Mark Walport and Richard Thomas put
forward&#151;that the orders are not meant to be used to undermine
the Data Protection Act&#151;is inherently contradicted by the
clause. If the Government accept, as I hope they will, Mark
Walport&#146;s and Richard Thomas&#146;s criticisms, it follows
that they must remove those
words.</div><a name="0902275000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
have already covered some of the examples. For instance, the medical
example is relevant when it comes to using information for difference
purposes, as is the identity card database example. The DNA database
example is especially relevant, because using DNA in a criminal
investigation is very different from using DNA for all the other
purposes for which it could be used by the state or others. Amendment
52 is crucial, and I am more interested in the Government&#146;s
reply on it than any other point that I
make.</div><a name="0902275000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other amendments are more technical, but there are still weaknesses in
the clause. Amendments 53 to 56 would change the part of the clause
that says that the authority&#151;the Government
Minister&#151;needs to be satisfied, before an order can be made,
that it</div>
<a name="0902275000384"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is necessary to
secure a relevant policy
objective&#148;,</div><a name="0902275000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">that
it</div><a name="0902275000385"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;is
proportionate to
that...objective&#148;,</div><a name="0902275000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
that it balances</div>
<a name="0902275000386"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the public
interest and the interests of any person affected by
it.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
strikes me as being far too weak. Our proposals test ways in which the
measures in subsection (4) can be
strengthened.</div><a name="0902275000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
53 would remove the subjective element. Instead of a decision being
made on the basis that the conditions are satisfied in the opinion of
the Minister, there would be a requirement for the conditions to be
satisfied. That goes back to the point made by the right hon. Member
for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East on judicial review. We need to
ensure that there is a proper basis for effective judicial review, and
give the courts a clear way into the substance of a
decision.</div><a name="0902275000435"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.15
pm</div><a name="0902275000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
54 raises the problem of what constitutes a &#147;relevant policy
objective&#148;. How do we know what the Government&#146;s relevant
policy objectives are? Could they make new objectives up on the spot,
including ones that undermine the principles of data protection? There

in a way that changes policy under any circumstances. If that is to be

simply because the Government now say that our policy is something
different.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000481"></a>David
Howarth:</b> It could be relevant but new&#151;that is the
problem. To follow what Walport and Thomas said about not allowing the
orders to be part of a change of policy, we must have a list of
existing policies and apply them in the relevant way. We cannot have a
new but relevant policy that would justify a change. That important
point is what lies behind amendment 56.</div>
<a name="0902275000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 55
raises the point that a fair balance between the public interest and
that of the individuals concerned will always, in the minds of
Ministers, come out in favour of the public. That is the job of a
Minister&#151;they are supposed to think about the interests of the
public. If we are going to protect the interests of individuals and
their right to privacy, we must say so far more clearly, rather than
simply allowing Ministers to do a balancing test in their own heads,
which will inevitably come out in one direction. That is what amendment
55 seeks to achieve.</div>
<a name="0902275000062"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 57
is about the problem that the information sharing order could grant
powers to do whatever to anyone. It ought to be restricted to people or
organisations that count as public authorities and are covered by the
Human Rights Act. The amendment also seeks to stop onward delegation of
powers to people or organisations that are not covered by the Human
Rights Act.</div>
<a name="0902275000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 59
seeks to remove what I think is a rather weird provision in the clause.
In the list of things that the order can do, proposed new paragraph (f)
states:</div><a name="0902275000387"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
for a person to exercise a discretion in dealing with any
matter&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know what is envisaged, so I want to ask the Government what
such a matter could be, and about the possibility of allowing someone
to have discretion over whether to ignore the data protection
principles.</div>
<a name="0902275000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 60
and 61 are about any enactment provision. They seek in one case to
remove, and in the other case replace, a Henry VIII clause that allows
Ministers to change primary legislation by order. I have had a couple
of conversations with a leading legal historian who asked me to mention
the fact that calling such clauses Henry VIII clauses is a bit of a
calumny on Henry VIII, since he never got this power through
Parliament&#151;it would not let it through, which illustrates how
serious such powers are. The orders should certainly not be allowed to
change the Data Protection Act&#151;Walport and Thomas are clear
about&#151;or, of course, the Human Rights Act. Whether orders should
be allowed to change any primary legislation is, in practice, a more
difficult question. If there is going to be such a power, it needs to
be very specific and not what seems to be a
catch-all.</div><a name="0902275000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are our central amendments, but there are also amendments 147 to 149,
on privacy impact statements, which are a useful technique recommended
by the Information Commissioner. If the Government are not going to do
anything else at this point, they should think about more effective use
of privacy impact assessments.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column367" />Column number: 367</div><a name="0902275000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the end, the
question before us is that raised by the right hon. Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East: is what is being proposed justified
by the size of the problem identified? The answer to that is that it
cannot be. The breadth of the power proposed goes way beyond the
inconveniences first identified as the problem to be solved. What are
we introducing instead? Through all the submissions from a whole host
of organisations, from Privacy International to the British Medical
Association&#151;I shall not read them all out because we know them
from having received all the briefings&#151;the theme is that the
provisions are destructive of trust in the Government and in
professionals, such as doctors, doing their jobs. I am perfectly
willing to accept that that was not the intention, but I am afraid that
that is the effect. The clause has to be changed very clearly and very
soon, otherwise people will start to suspect that the intention of the
Government is changing in favour of doing something that they really
should not be
doing.</div><a name="0902275000068"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000482"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Henry Bellingham</b> (North-West Norfolk) (Con): Good
afternoon, Mr. Gale. The clause is horrible and we would
intend to strike it out, although it could be improved if the Minister
accepted two of our amendments and two of the amendments tabled by the
hon. Member for Cambridge, which we have
signed.</div><a name="0902275000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
amendment 356 would remove the
phrase</div><a name="0902275000388"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;secure
a relevant policy
objective&#148;</div><a name="0902275000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
insert &#147;serve the public interest&#148;. Amendment 357 is
similar to amendment 147, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Cambridge. It demands that the designated authority wanting to make an
information sharing order must supply a full privacy impact assessment.
We also support the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment 52&#151;that is
why we signed it&#151;because it removes the frightening proposed new
subsection (3)(b) that enables information collected for one purpose to
be shared out with organisations for a wholly different purpose. That
is a wide-ranging part of the clause, the consequences of which would
be to give much more power to Her Majesty&#146;s Government. I ask
the Minister to accept the amendments because they would improve an
unsatisfactory
clause.</div><a name="0902275000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
are not at all happy with the clause. From what the excellent
Information Commissioner told us the other day in the evidence session,
he wanted more powers, which is what clause 151 is all about. However,
I do not believe that he wanted to see the Government take for
themselves the extra powers to share data&#151;between Departments,
as well as with the private sector. He did not want that at all; he was
tactful when he spoke to us, but to me he looked uneasy and far from
happy.</div><a name="0902275000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000483"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> This cannot be right. The hon. Gentleman says that
he trusts the Information Commissioner, but he is now misrepresenting
his views. The commissioner wrote the report that recommended the
fast-track procedure to enable data sharing to take place. How can the
hon. Gentleman say that he is backing the Information Commissioner in
opposing the
clause?</div><a name="0902275000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000484"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> The clause goes much further than the Thomas
and Walport review. Perhaps I am a suspicious person, but judging from
the mood music at the evidence session, the Information Commissioner
did not look to be enamoured with the clause.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column368" />Column number: 368</div><a name="0902275000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">In this
technological age, more data are always going to be shared. We accept
that medical records are going to be shared among hospitals and GP
practices, and that the police and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency are sharing more and more data. We recognise that the fight
against crime requires more data to be exchanged and shared. There are
increasing numbers of CCTV cameras, and local councils are going to
share that information with the local police. There was a recent
example of that in my constituency. An unfortunate Polish migrant
worker was minding his own business in the centre of King&#146;s Lynn
when he got beaten up by a bunch of drunken hooligans. The incident was
caught on CCTV and the four people involved were then prosecuted,
convicted and sent to prison. That is an example of CCTV cameras
working well and how data should be shared.</div>
<a name="0902275000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">We accept that
in this terrifying, terrorist environment there will be more and more
data sharing. We want the police and security services to retain the
powers that they have, and that will mean more data sharing. However, a
balance needs to be struck between the needs of the police in fighting
crime and the rights of the
individual.</div><a name="0902275000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
recently saw a quote from Sir David Omand, the Cabinet Office&#146;s
former security intelligence co-ordinator, saying:</div>
<a name="0902275000077"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Finding
out other people&#146;s secrets is going to involve breaking everyday
moral rules.&#148;</div>
<a name="0902275000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">The intrusive mining of
databases, including accessing phones, could involve &#147;breaking
everyday moral rules&#148;. We have to go so far, but surely there is
a stage beyond which we should not go. However, much of the data that
are shared could, and should, be shared on a voluntary basis. The
public do not mind some of their data being shared and we all know what
sort of data that is.</div>
<a name="0902275000079"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000485"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am following the hon. Gentleman with some
interest. The idea that there should be a balance between the public
and individual interest is one of the basic principles of data sharing.
However, he seems to be straying into saying that he accepts that there
will be more data sharing, but that it should be done on the basis of
common sense. Is that really a basis for decision making? I accept that
judgment needs to be applied, but is it enough to leave things to
common sense? Does he accept that there are occasions when data that
should be shared are not shared, because of the tendency in some courts
to retreat into a comfort zone of saying that the safest thing to do is
not to share
it?</div><a name="0902275000080"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000486"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My concern is that if the Government are given
more powers, they are going to use those powers on an increasingly
draconian basis. One can look at any Government and see them using
their powers in the way I described the other day as &#147;Executive
creep&#148;. They want to find out more about what people are
doing.</div>
<a name="0902275000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The role of
quangos and agencies has grown enormously over the past few years and
the private sector has become more involved in working for Departments
under contract. I cited this morning some of the Departments that are
using private sector agencies. I mentioned that the Office of the
Solicitor General has a 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column369" />Column number: 369</div>large contract with Logica. I talked about the Department for Business,
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, and I remind the Committee that, as
at June last year, it had 165 databases, of which 90 were maintained by
external companies that are private sector contractors.</div>
<a name="0902275000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">The MOJ owns
and maintains 74 different databases. In a recent parliamentary answer,
the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Garston, did not break down&#151;like some Departments
did&#151;which of those 74 were wholly owned by the Department and
which were maintained by the Department but run by the private sector.
I will be coming back with questions about that because obviously quite
a few of those databases are run by major IT companies such as Logica
and Autonomy. We do not mind that, because they are excellent
companies, but we are looking at some very sensitive databases, such as
ARIA, which is the asylum and immigration system, the magistrates
courts&#146; database, the centralised attachment of earnings system,
C-NOMIS, and the recorded appearances
database.</div><a name="0902275000436"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">1.30
pm</div><a name="0902275000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
concern is that more of that data will be shared between Departments
without the necessary checks, because the clause does not carry those
checks. Perhaps it would not matter so much if we could trust this
Government and if they have had a good record on handling and storing
our data, but can we trust them? I am not going to give the Committee a
long list of some of the scandals over the loss of data that have
occurred in the past few years, where data have not been properly
looked after, but the Government are
incompetent.</div><a name="0902275000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
other thing that worries me is that the Government are becoming
increasingly illiberal. I would never have guessed that, as a
mainstream Conservative, I would be finding myself way to the left of
this Government on some libertarian issues. If one looks at the
national ID card scheme, the extra powers that bailiffs have to break
in and enter people&#146;s homes to enforce not Crown court or
magistrates court debts but civil debts and the other hare-brained
schemes that they have come up with, one sees that they are becoming
more and more illiberal. In the Bill, we have secret inquests, and now
the data-sharing proposals, which just go too
far.</div><a name="0902275000085"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000487"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Maria
Eagle):</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman said earlier
that he believes in the use of common sense, not statutory rules. But
he now seems to be arguing that there ought to be a proper framework
against which any Government can be held to account, which we all agree
with. His current argument suggest that the proper way forward is
voluntarism, but I do not follow how that
works.</div><a name="0902275000086"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000488"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> At the moment, a lot of voluntary arrangements
are in place and a huge amount of data are shared between Departments.
What is happening at the moment across Departments leads to the
necessary level of data being shared. It is our proposition that when
the Government make mistakes over how data are handled and stored, they
should be held to account&#151;we argued earlier that the Government
should not have Crown immunity. But we also feel strongly that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column370" />Column number: 370</div>powers under the clause just go too far. It is not just me who is saying
that, because Liberty, which the hon. Member for Cambridge quoted
earlier, said that
it</div><a name="0902275000389"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;strongly
opposes these amendments as the powers it gives are extraordinarily
broad and make a mockery of the safeguards contained in the DPA (Data
Protection Act
1998).&#148;</div><a name="0902275000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Joint Committee on Human Rights, a hugely eminent Committee of
parliamentarians, said in its 14th report:</div>
<a name="0902275000390"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We
fundamentally disagree with the Government&#146;s approach to data
sharing legislation, which is to include very broad enabling provisions
in primary legislation and to leave the data protection safeguards to
be set out later in secondary
legislation.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
heard Dr. Meldrum from the BMA say the other day that the clause could
seriously undermine the confidence that patients have in doctors. It
could lead to patients being reluctant to disclose personal
information, and even making them reluctant to go to a surgery in the
first
place.</div><a name="0902275000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
morning, we received a briefing from the Wellcome Trust, the Medical
Research Council and the Academy of Medical Sciences, which
states:</div><a name="0902275000391"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;However,
we recognise that patient records are both sensitive and personal, and
therefore should be protected by robust safeguards. The research
benefits will only be realised if there are appropriate mechanisms in
place so that the public, patients and doctors are able to trust that
their data will be kept secure and
confidential.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is about trust, and the clause represents the final breakdown of the
privacy contract between the state and individuals. That is why we will
vote against the clause, unless the Minister comes up with serious
concessions. I believe that she is aware of the widespread public
opposition, and Labour Members, who have so far been silent in the
debate, must understand the level of public
concern.</div><a name="0902275000091"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000489"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Gentleman is on a rant that seems to be
designed for press consumption. Labour Members are taking part in a
constructive debate with the Minister, who appears to be listening, so
will he stop
ranting?</div><a name="0902275000092"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000490"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I have been expressing my views forcefully,
but I do not regard that as a rant. Conservative Members take the
clause very seriously. We have co-operated with the Minister on many
parts of the Bill. We started off in a spirit of bipartisanship and
co-operation, and we want to work with the Minister and produce good
legislation. My concern is that tagging on this clause will
substantially undermine a really good
Bill.</div><a name="0902275000093"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000491"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Is the Conservative position that the current
legislation is adequate, that voluntarism where it can sensibly be
arranged is good, and that no additional framework of rules is needed,
or is it that there should be some changes to the statutory framework,
but that the changes are the wrong
ones?</div><a name="0902275000094"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000492"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> It is both. We feel that the current rules are
working well, although there could be improvements. We do not feel that
this is the way to go about it because we feel that&#151;this is my
last point&#151;if one destroys public trust and confidence,
undermining the vital privacy contract between the public and the
Government, it leads to a breakdown in trust and public opposition,
cynicism and apathy, which will undermine the Government&#146;s whole
data protection programme.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000493"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> I had intended to catch your eye before
the hon. Gentleman challenged us to do so, Mr. Gale. I want
to make a few remarks, and I should say at the outset that I am a
member of the Intelligence and Security Committee. What I have to say
on that score will be fairly restricted, but it gives me a particular
vantage point from which to consider data
sharing.</div><a name="0902275000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not want to be unkind to the hon. Gentleman, because I know that he
means well, but there is a world out there and activities taking place
of which he almost failed to take any account. Various general
secretaries of the Security Service have given estimates of how many
plots there are at any given time. I do not intend to go into figures,
but a conservative estimate is that there are more than 100 terrorist
plots at any one time in the UK. That means that there are many
networks of people plotting to carry out some appalling incident that
would result in the loss of many lives. There cannot be any
disagreement between any of us that that is going on. Some of those
plots might overlap but many people are
involved.</div><a name="0902275000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
technologies that those people use move on rapidly, and they become
aware of changes very quickly. They have the resources to access those
technologies and the skills to make use of them. The state and its
agencies cannot broadcast what they are doing and cannot in every case
defend publicly what they are doing; it is the nature of the activity
that prevents them from doing so. They do not have the power to share
data mined from a lot of different places. Are we saying that the civil
liberty issues are greater than the
threat?</div><a name="0902275000098"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000494"></a><b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I understand the
right hon. Gentleman&#146;s argument, but we believe that the power
is far too broad. His argument is about the interests of national
security, but &#147;national security&#148; or the interests
thereof are not mentioned in the clause. Will he explain why such broad
powers are necessary to fulfil the objectives that he has
described?</div>
<a name="0902275000099"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000495"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I thought that I was doing that. The clause is so
drafted&#151;the hon. Member for Cambridge said that it was broadly
drafted&#151;because technologies change so rapidly, as do the
methods used by the groups involved in such activities. If we were to
be so precise in drafting the clause, it might remove the possibility
of data sharing in the future by means that we cannot even imagine. We
must rely on achieving a balance between the two
principles.</div><a name="0902275000100"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000496"></a>David
Howarth:</b> I want to return to the right hon.
Gentleman&#146;s central point, which is that there is a big threat
so such measures should be allowed. No one is denying that there is a
threat, but the problem is that such measures are taken time and again,
whatever is before the House. We are always asked to compare the size
of the threat with a particular loss of freedom or a particular loss of
rights. We should stop doing that and look instead at the whole picture
to see what we have lost in total and ask whether, given the threat, it
is proportionate. The threat is there, but we must bear in mind the
whole picture. We have drifted time and again into accepting the
argument and, at some point, we need to call a halt and look back to
see where we have come from.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000497"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> I understand the hon. Gentleman&#146;s point,
which follows his earlier observations, but he is being myopic. It is
as though there is a static situation and that, consequently, we can
fix a position at a given time in legislation, which will inevitably
cover all eventualities in the future. The position is not like
that.</div><a name="0902275000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not claim to be the world&#146;s greatest expert in such matters,
but I know that agencies have to run very fast to keep up with how
technologies are being used. If the world was as the hon. Gentleman
would like it to be, his argument would hold up. Unfortunately, it is
not and, for that reason, we need to have fairly broad powers, and I
shall explain how such powers should be supervised in a

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000500"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I want to pick up my right hon. Friend&#146;s
point about the speed of change. He is right that the idea of winding
back to see where we were 10 years ago and then looking at how we went
forward is belied by changing technology. Technology changes not only
on an annual basis, but on a monthly or even on a weekly basis. It is
important for police and intelligence services to understand and pick
up the nature of the trends, which may involve money laundering, fraud
or many other activities. I therefore agree with my right hon. Friend
that the picture is not that simple. The complexity challenges us, as
legislators, to introduce simple legislation, but deal with things
flexibly, although the issue is not so simple to deal
with.</div><a name="0902275000110"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000501"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> If I were to be drawn too much on the technology
involved, my office would probably laugh out loud when they read the
<i class="I">H</i><i class="I">ansard</i> report of our  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column373" />Column number: 373</div>proceedings. I am afraid that I am somewhat technologically challenged
when it comes to what my right hon. Friend has referred to, but his
general point is
correct.</div><a name="0902275000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
I want to talk about the powers that would be vested in Ministers in
pursuit of a particular policy, to which the hon. Member for Rugby and
Kenilworth, who intervened on me a moment ago, referred. First, the
agencies that I am referring to are well supervised already. I know
that the Intelligence and Security Committee, of which I am a member,
does not meet universal approval in every quarter, but I can assure the
Committee that we try hard to provide proper
supervision.</div><a name="0902275000112"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000502"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I want to be clear, although it may be irrelevant
to the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s point. Will he confirm that the
committee of which he is a distinguished member is not a Committee of
the House, but one appointed by the Prime Minister and accountable to
him but not to the House generally or, through us, to our
constituents.</div><a name="0902275000113"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000503"></a>Mr.
Howarth:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman knows full well
that that is the case, although I do not intend to get involved in that
argument. The ISC is not a committee accountable to the House; we
rarely meet in public, although there are plans afoot for that to
happen on some occasions. We report to the Prime Minister, and we do so
before our reports are made public. Quite often, for reasons that I am
sure people will understand, sections of those reports have to be
redacted, because we may refer to information that might not be
appropriate in the public
domain.</div><a name="0902275000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our
committee deals with an intercept commissioner, and the directors of
the agencies are subject to higher supervision. There is a whole series
of checks and balances to ensure that the agencies do not abuse their
privileged
position.</div><a name="0902275000115"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000504"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I indicated and meant that if the
Committee wanted a stand part debate now it could do so&#151;we are
certainly getting wider than the amendments. When I said a stand part
debate, however, I meant on the clause and not on the entire
Bill.</div><a name="0902275000116"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000505"></a>David
Howarth:</b> The point made by the right hon. Gentleman, as I
understand it, is that bodies such as the ISC can provide oversight
that is as good as giving people rights in court. The trouble with that
is illustrated by the Binyam Mohamed case, in which the ISC was
dependent on information from the Security Service and the Secret
Intelligence Service&#151;or from the Prime Minister, technically. In
that case, the 42 missing documents were never given to the ISC, so its
original investigation was fundamentally flawed. The only time that the
existence of those documents came into public view, and the only way in
which the ISC could get them, was when there was a court case because
an individual had had their rights violated, which brought the whole
thing out into the
open.</div><a name="0902275000117"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000506"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> The hon. Gentleman&#146;s information is
not quite correct. I am probably straying rather far from the clause
but I mention this for the sake of accuracy. We were asked to look at
the phenomenon of extraordinary rendition&#151;had it occurred, who
was involved 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column374" />Column number: 374</div>and what was known by who? We did not look into that particular case; we
looked at it as one of a number of cases that were allegedly part of
that process, and at whether British agencies had any knowledge of what
was going on. I do not say that we necessarily got it right, nor do I
concede that we got it wrong. It was part of a broader investigation
and not based only on that one case.</div>
<a name="0902275000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am trying to
conclude my point about what Ministers do and do not do. The hon.
Member for North-West Norfolk gave the impression that anything
Ministers do must, by definition, be for grubby reasons. I no longer
have to defend what Ministers do or do not do&#151;I am pleased to
say&#151;but my right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and
Penarth and I, and others at different times, have had to make
decisions about particular cases. I have made that point previously. An
obvious case in point, which my right hon. Friend will remember, is
that of prisoner recall. The police might be concerned about the
activities of someone who is potentially subject to recall. Facts are
put before a Minister, who has to decide what is the right thing to
do.</div>
<a name="0902275000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
convinced&#151;and I am sure that this was equally true of Ministers
in previous Governments&#151;that in such cases, enormous lengths are
gone to so as to ensure that we are being fair and acting in a way that
does not discriminate against somebody just because they are subject to
recall. My right hon. Friend and I&#151;and other Ministers, I am
sure&#151;have laboured for many hours over individual cases to be
sure to get it right.</div>
<a name="0902275000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
point, which I have also made in a previous debate, is that in my
experience, Ministers are always well aware that any decision of this
kind could ultimately be made the subject of a judicial review. Without
going into too much detail, hon. Members might recall a decision that
the then Home Secretary, who now goes under the grand title of Lord
High Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn
(Mr. Straw) had to make over the Pinochet case. The Home
Office built a cordon sanitaire around him because he was making what
was in effect a quasi-judicial decision as a Minister. Whether or not
people agree with the outcome, the process that he went through was
painstaking and exhaustive. I am sure that Ministers in previous
Governments will also have gone to such lengths when undertaking such a
process. It is not something that Labour Ministers do and others do
not. It is a responsibility that Ministers of all parties take
seriously.</div>
<a name="0902275000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">That returns
to the point that the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk made about
trust. We sometimes need to accept that Ministers have to act in the
public interest to the best of their ability, and that they will go to
great pains to ensure the right decision. Without that trust and power
invested in somebody&#146;s hands, we would not be able to protect
the country as we do at the moment.</div>
<a name="0902275000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I realise that
these are difficult issues and that sometimes civil liberties and the
need to protect the public seem to clash. That is an inevitable
consequence of the insecure world in which we now live. If we accept
that, we must also accept that in some circumstances, Ministers must be
trusted to do the right thing.</div>
<a name="0902275000123"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000507"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> It is easy in debates such as this to patronise
from one angle and from another to appear to be underplaying or
undervaluing the concerns that people 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column375" />Column number: 375</div>who take a different view have on the issues that we are describing.
Having heard some of the contributions from Labour members, it is
possible for a reasonable person to comment, &#147;Don&#146;t worry
your pretty little heads. We&#146;ve got everything under control and
we are doing the best that we can for you. We cannot tell you
everything that you need to know, but trust us because we are getting
it right. We are doing our best. Our motives are of the
purest.&#148; And that may well be the
case.</div><a name="0902275000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Equally,
if one looks at the context of the debate&#151;in the room and more
widely&#151;there is plenty of room for suspicion, cynicism and
ridicule. Ridicule is one of the most powerful weapons that the
Opposition have when dealing with a Government who are sure about
themselves and what they do. Whether one has the genius of Kafka or
Laurel and Hardy, both types of genius are apt to be applied when one
considers this type of legislation and clause 152.</div>
<a name="0902275000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">There has been
press comment today about data sharing and Government powers to control
our lives and the information about us. That is placed in the context
of the ridiculous sight of the Secretary of State for Justice, to whom
the right hon. Gentleman referred, complaining that he has been the
victim or the subject of a Nigerian scam. An incompetent impostor in
Lagos tried to pretend that he was the Secretary of State for Justice
who had had his wallet stolen in a restaurant in Lagos and asked the
readers of the e-mail to please send $3,000 to help him get back
home.</div><a name="0902275000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is funny for a number of reasons. It makes the Secretary of State look
ridiculous, and Conservative Members do not object to that. Whether he
is called the Lord High Chancellor or anything else, he has
occasionally allowed himself to look ridiculous. He is made to look
even more
ridiculous&#151;</div><a name="0902275000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000508"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give
way?</div><a name="0902275000128"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000509"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> May I continue to demonstrate how ridiculous the
Secretary of State is by pointing out that he is the man who, when he
was Home Secretary, as the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, set up a
taskforce, or some such body, to interdict or to prevent computer
hacking and the misuse of private information. I am not sure how far
that has taken us, but he is a Secretary of State who is part of a
Government responsible for the loss of millions of items of private
data stored on our behalf by them.</div>
<a name="0902275000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000510"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I wonder whether my hon. and learned Friend would
care to comment on the Lord Chancellor&#146;s remark that at least it
was reassuring that people were not taken in by the scam. Another
possible explanation is that nobody wanted him back from
Lagos.</div><a name="0902275000130"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000511"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The ridicule piles upon the ridicule. My hon.
Friend says that nobody was taken in by the scam, but the Secretary of
State&#146;s staff were taken in&#151;not his ministerial staff,
because I think it went to his private e-mail account. By virtue of
their having replied to the request, it triggered a whole system
of&#151;</div><a name="0902275000131"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000513"></a>Mr.

is some form of insect or a real Secretary of State. I get to the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000515"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I may have done that, but I possibly have cheered
up the Committee. However, I hope that I will also have provoked the
Government and their supporters into standing up and justifying clause
152, as currently
drafted.</div><a name="0902275000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Cambridge and my hon. Friend the Member for North-West
Norfolk have given us a learned dissection of the beast on the slab. We
are grateful for that, but it is important that we use all weapons at
our disposal to expose the ridiculous nature of the Government and what
they are seeking to do&#151;and they are seeking to do it
half-blind.</div>
<a name="0902275000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of the number
of press articles written today, some suggest that we are about to move
into a period of deep darkness, in which personal liberty is put at
risk. However, a number of journalists and commentators have said that
that is unlikely. Let us take two examples. One is written by Andrew
Gilligan. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> Mr. Gale, did
you hear the groan from Government Ministers when I mentioned Andrew
Gilligan, the man who, I suspect, has been proved to have been right
about the Government&#146;s ability to construct
facts.</div>
<a name="0902275000138"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000516"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Russell Brown</b> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab): A man who
once worked for a Back-Bench Member of Parliament and was reported to
have been less than competent.</div>
<a name="0902275000139"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000517"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to
say something interesting, but I am delighted to welcome his first
contribution to debates on the Bill.</div>
<a name="0902275000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I remind the
Committee of what Mr. Gilligan
said:</div><a name="0902275000395"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Britain
will never be Nazi Germany. But in our steady march towards a police
state, this could be something of a Niemöller moment. Until
recently, perhaps even until now, New Labour ministers&#146; mocking
claim that civil liberties were a concern only for the &#145;dinner
party crowd&#146; had some
truth.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">He
then referred to the report mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for
North-West Norfolk, written by Sir David Omand on behalf of the
Institute for Public Policy Research. The report, Andrew Gilligan says,
makes reference to</div>
<a name="0902275000396"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;active
government proposals for &#145;data-mining&#146;, where the private
and personal data of everyone in the country&#151;telephone records,
emails, shop transactions, our very movements as tracked by
number-plate recognition cameras and CCTV&#151;is fed into giant
computer banks to be analysed for &#145;suspicious&#146;
activity...&#145;Such sources have always been accessible to
traditional law enforcement seeking evidence against a named suspect
already justified by reasonable suspicion,&#146; says Omand. However,
&#145;application of modern data mining and processing techniques
does involve examination of the innocent as well as the suspect to
identify patterns of interest for further investigation...Finding out
other people&#146;s secrets is going to involve breaking everyday
moral rules.&#146;&#148;</div>
<a name="0902275000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">That final quotation was
also referred to by my hon. Friend. In short, Sir David said that
privacy is up for grabs. Mr. Gilligan continued:</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column377" />Column number: 377</div><a name="0902275000397"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Privacy,
in short, if Sir David and his colleagues like the Home Secretary
Jacqui Smith have anything to do with it, is over. He even says so
(&#145;modern intelligence access may have to be at the expense of
some aspects of
privacy&#146;).&#148;</div><a name="0902275000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is plenty to read and plenty to be gained from Mr.
Gilligan&#146;s piece. It demonstrates that newspaper commentators
write what they think but that they also reflect what their readers
think. There is growing concern among the public that the Government,
for good measure or for bad, are allowing powers to be taken which
erode unnecessarily the right of the individual to conduct himself
freely within
society.</div><a name="0902275000144"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000518"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> Since the right hon. Gentleman has prayed
in aid Sir David Omand quite extensively, can he share with the
Committee what Sir David&#146;s conclusion
was?</div><a name="0902275000145"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000519"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The hon. Gentleman knows the answer to that as
well as I do. Let me tell the Committee about another commentator, Mary
Riddell, who wrote in <i class="I">The Daily</i> <i class="I">Telegraph</i> today about the
subject. <i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i> If the right hon. Members
for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East and for Cardiff, South and Penarth
would like to make their own speeches, we will be happy to listen to
them.</div><a name="0902275000146"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000520"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. and learned Gentleman&#146;s
contribution seems to draw tremendously on media reports rather than on
direct comments from people. My right hon. Friend the Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East asked him a simple question
about Sir David&#146;s conclusions. Does he agree with them?
Does he know what they are? Would he like to share with us his summary
of
them?</div><a name="0902275000147"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000521"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The important point is not his conclusion. I am
sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has not got the point, which is
about the analysis of the intrusion into the rights and liberties of
the citizen. It may be of no importance and, if I have got it wrong,
the right hon. Gentleman will tell me. I want to provoke the Labour
party and the Government into defending the clause, but I have yet to
hear a good defence. I will continue to provoke them, here or outside,
until the Government and their supporters&#151;such as they
are&#151;advance rational, cogent and sensible reasons for allowing
the Government to garner themselves the powers under the
clause.</div>
<a name="0902275000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mary Riddell,
who I referred to a moment ago, said
that</div><a name="0902275000398"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;even
if we are not heading for dystopia, something strange is happening to
law and
order.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we, as representatives of the public, do not recognise that, we are not
doing our job properly. She continued:</div>
<a name="0902275000399"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;This
suggestion was floated on the day that Binyam Mohamed was flown back to
Britain&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0902275000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">the
suggestion was from the mouth of Sir Ken Macdonald, the former Director
of Public
Prosecutions&#151;</div><a name="0902275000400"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;legislators
have foolishly pursued tough terror laws when we should be locking up
City fraudsters
instead.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">She
commented:</div><a name="0902275000401"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Sir
Ken&#146;s sensible, if wishful, suggestion also had a wider point:
that the &#145;liberty-sapping addictions&#146; of the Home Office
are a useless way to tackle terror. Indeed, they may promote not only
jihadism but insurgency of all kinds. Already, the unease engendered 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column378" />Column number: 378</div>by a collapsing economy risks being fuelled by political paranoia.
Secrecy and suppression are enmeshed with the unrest seeping on to the
streets.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those
are the views of rational people, who are listening to what is going on
outside in the street. If we do not listen ourselves then, as night
follows day, we will pass clauses such as this one, to the disbenefit
of our constituents, and contribute to the general undermining of
confidence in criminal
justice.</div>
<a name="0902275000153"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000522"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> My hon. and learned Friend has touched on a
vital point. The security services and the police already have ample
powers to look at the data of suspects. The clause will lead to data
mining of private data and of the details of many innocent people,
which will lead to the breakdown of trust. It will also hinder the war
against terror, rather than the other way around.</div>
<a name="0902275000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000523"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I agree entirely. The sooner we can get that into
the collective mind of the Government, the sooner we may get a better
clause. Mary Riddell
adds:</div><a name="0902275000402"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As
the former Whitehall security chief, Sir David Omand, implies, the
security services will soon be privy to our every detail, from our
dwindling savings to our taste in shower gel. Most galling is the
imbalance of data-sharing, under which ministers know everything about
us while we know little about them. True, we may discover an
MP&#146;s outlay on Philippe Starck lemon-squeezers, or whether he or
she (legitimately, of course) declares a top bunk in a youth hostel as
a primary
residence.</div><a name="0902275000403"></a><div class="hs_brev">On
the other hand, we can&#146;t know what was in the Iraq war Cabinet
minutes, because Jack Straw has defied two rulings that they should be
released. That veto is as rash as it is disgraceful. Not only does it
suggest an illiberal government&#151;an impression borne out by the
Justice Secretary&#146;s Coroners and Justice Bill, which promotes
secret military inquests and, in Clause 152, a sweeping sanction for
data swapping&#151;it also gives the appearance of a government with
shameful secrets to
hide.&#148;&#151;<i class="I">[</i><i class="I">Interruption.</i><i class="I">]</i></div>
<a name="0902275000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hear a lot
of squawking and squeaking from Labour Benches. If the Government do
not realise that that is what people think and that perceptions are as
important as facts, they are walking themselves up a blind alley to
their detriment. We have now reached the stage at which the Government
are not believed even on those rare occasions when they tell the truth.
They must come to terms with the
matter.</div><a name="0902275000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000524"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> While we all like to have our morning newspapers
read to us, instead of reading them ourselves, how does the extent to
which the hon. and learned Member for Harborough is doing it, including
reading out passages&#151;admittedly not written by him, but by
esteemed members of the journalistic profession&#151;that he knows to
be inaccurate help the Committee to develop his
argument?</div>
<a name="0902275000157"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000525"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> I most certainly do not know the passages to be
inaccurate.</div><a name="0902275000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000526"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Secret military inquests? There are
none.</div><a name="0902275000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000527"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> If the Minister is to base her reputation on the
introduction by Mary Riddell of the word &#147;military&#148; to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000531"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> Having demonstrated with some degree of fairness
and accuracy the dangerous position into which the Government are
leading us, let me briefly pick out one or two of the egregious
provisions under clause 152, which ought to worry Labour Members but
apparently do not. Proposed new section 50A(3) states:</div>
<a name="0902275000404"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
the purposes of this Part a person shares information if the
person&#151;</div><a name="0902275000405"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
discloses the information by transmission, dissemination or otherwise
making it available,
or</div><a name="0902275000406"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b)
consults or uses the information for a purpose other than the purpose
for which the information was
obtained.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000164"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 50A(4) states:</div>
<a name="0902275000407"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A
designated
authority&#148;&#151;</div><a name="0902275000165"></a><div class="hs_Para">shorthand
for a Minister of one sort or
another&#151;</div><a name="0902275000408"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;may
make an information-sharing order only if it is entitled to make the
order by virtue of section 50C and it is
satisfied&#151;</div><a name="0902275000409"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a)
that the sharing of information enabled by the order is necessary to
secure a relevant policy
objective&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
hon. Friend the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth has already drawn
attention to the relevant part in the explanatory notes, but that is
drawn from the interpretation measure under the Bill of
&#147;relevant policy objective&#148;&#151;proposed new section
50F, on page 105, which is not even halfway through
it.</div><a name="0902275000167"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 50F(1) states that a relevant policy objective
means,</div><a name="0902275000410"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in
the case of an information-sharing order made by the Scottish
Ministers, a policy objective which relates
to&#151;</div><a name="0902275000411"></a><div class="hs_brev">(i)
matters within the legislative competence of the Scottish
Parliament&#148;,</div><a name="0902275000168"></a><div class="hs_Para">and
so it goes on for the Welsh, the Northern Irish or British sphere. A
relevant policy objective is as Lewis Carroll might have described
it.</div><a name="0902275000169"></a><div class="hs_Para">Under
proposed new section 50A(4)(b), a designated authority must be
satisfied</div><a name="0902275000412"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;that
the effect of the provision made by the order is proportionate to that
policy
objective&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000170"></a><div class="hs_Para">If
we do not know what that is until the Minister condescends to tell us
and self-certifies it, how can we reach a rational conclusion now or
later about the proportionality of the
order?</div><a name="0902275000171"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 50A(4)(c) requires that</div>
<a name="0902275000413"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the provision
made by the order strikes a fair balance between the public interest
and the interests of any person affected by
it.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000172"></a><div class="hs_Para">Again,
we are talking about wholly undefined concepts. We cannot work out the
balance or the relationship between two concepts about which we are
told nothing.

pm</div><a name="0902275000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">This
is a modification to the law of the land by ministerial fiat, not by
the House of Commons and the other place. It does not stop there, as I
mentioned to the hon. Member for Cambridge. Subsection (2)
states:</div><a name="0902275000423"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
information-sharing order may provide for the creation of offences
triable either
way&#148;</div><a name="0902275000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">either
in a magistrates court or the Crown court. Those offences are
punishable</div><a name="0902275000424"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;on
conviction on indictment, by imprisonment for a term not exceeding the
specified period or to a fine or to
both&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">At
least in the Bill the Government condescend to tell us what the
specified period of imprisonment means. In the case of a summary
conviction it is 12 months, or six months in Northern Ireland&#151;I
do not know what they have done to be favoured by a lesser period of
imprisonment. In the case of conviction on indictment, it is two years.
You could go to prison for two years, Mr. Gale, for a
criminal offence that has so far been left undescribed and was created
by a power that is ill-defined or undefined.</div>
<a name="0902275000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
complain that we are making far too much of clause 152. It is little
wonder that the public are concerned, as are people like Mary Riddell
and Andrew Gilligan and plenty of others. It is little wonder that my
hon. Friends and I, whether we win or not, will stand up and be
counted. We will vote with our words and exercise our rights as MPs to
seek to remove this subsection from the Bill.</div>
<a name="0902275000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Saturday,
in London and across the country, an event called the convention on
modern liberty is being held. It will represent the most concerted
coming together yet of people who are concerned about the destruction
of our democratic way of life. I shall attend that event and contribute
to it, and I hope that I will see members of the Labour party there too
to speak out against this and many other similarly egregious provisions
that the Government see fit to impose on the people of this
country.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000532"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> When Parliament passed the Data Protection Act
1998, it was contemplated that data might be shared after the Act was
passed. There are exemptions and exceptions in the Act to permit data
sharing. The House of Commons research paper for the Bill, number
09/06, says that few of the exemptions and exceptions are blanket in
nature. That suggests that some of them are blanket in nature.
Exceptions are not something new in terms of allowing data sharing.
However, until now, when Parliament has felt the desire to allow data
sharing, it has had to pass specific permission through an Act of
Parliament. That same research paper talks about such provisions in the
Digital Switchover (Disclosure of Information) Act 2007, the Serious
Crime Act 2007, last year&#146;s Education and Skills Bill and the
Pensions Bill.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column381" />Column number: 381</div><a name="0902275000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was at the
annual meeting of the parliamentary warm homes group at the end of last
year, where members of energy companies said to me, &#147;If only we
could have access to information on who gets pension credit, we could
tell them that they could have energy efficiency measures done to their
homes completely free of charge. It would certainly reduce their Bills
and may actually save their lives.&#148; They asked me whether I
thought that that was a desirable policy objective, and I must admit
that it is a tempting aim to want to save people&#146;s lives and cut
elderly people&#146;s fuel bills. Against that, do people in receipt
of pension credit want, without their permission, other people to know
that they are in receipt of it? That one example shows us how difficult
the issue
is.</div><a name="0902275000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
take exception to some of the comments that have just been made and to
some of the newspaper reports about the provision, because of the
complete absence of the Information Commissioner from the debate,
when his report started the entire enterprise.
Recommendation 8(a) of his report was
for</div><a name="0902275000425"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
new statutory fast-track
procedure&#148;</div><a name="0902275000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
allow data sharing. &#147;Primary legislation&#148;&#151;it has
turned out to be the Bill&#151;should
grant</div><a name="0902275000426"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
Secretary of State...a power by Order...to remove or modify
any legal barrier to data sharing...or creating a new power to
share information where that power is currently
absent.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
is an eye-opening recommendation, but it is the recommendation of an
office that the official Opposition find so trustworthy that he alone
among the organisations of this country should have the power, as we
heard this morning, to enter premises without a warrant, and yet so
trustworthy that in the afternoon his opinion is completely disregarded
and trashed. There should be some balance in the debate. The
Information Commissioner&#146;s report and recommendations wrestled
with serious issues such as whether we can save the lives of elderly
pensioners at Christmas
time.</div><a name="0902275000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
commissioner went too far in his recommendations. The Government have
been given an inch and taken a mile&#151;clause 152 is
unsatisfactory. I am happy to be on the record saying that. However,
the intention behind the clause is entirely honourable and probably
desirable. I would like there to be a section 152 in the final Act
after Royal Assent, but not in this
form.</div><a name="0902275000187"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000533"></a>Mr.
George Howarth:</b> I want to identify with the point of my
hon. Friend. I do so with a particular apology to the Committee: having
taken part in the debate, I have a meeting at the Department for
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform with a local firm shortly,
so I may not be able to stay for the entire debate. However, I make it
clear that my hon. Friend&#146;s last point is a good
one.</div><a name="0902275000188"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000534"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> Although I have not had a huge number of
representations from constituents, they have expressed concerns about
the clause as drafted&#151;two in total, although one mentioned the
British Computer Society, which apparently also opposes the clause in
its present form. I assume that the society has a reasonable number of
members whom it is accurately representing in its objections to the
present provision.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column382" />Column number: 382</div><a name="0902275000189"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I became a
member of the Committee, it crossed my mind that I would want to table
amendments to the clause. I e-mailed the Information Commissioner
asking for a briefing to enable me to understand the issues and perhaps
identify what the right amendments would be. I do not criticise his
reply, but it was that, as I was a Member, I would hear his evidence in
Committee and get his memorandum like everyone else. I heard his
evidence and asked him whether he expected the Government&#146;s
provision to enable a Minister to repeal by order the Data Protection
Act or the Human Rights Act. He said no, he had not appreciated that
that might be the consequence. I listened to his evidence and read his
memorandum, but together they did not quite give me the feel for what
the amendments should do to make some sense of the
clause.</div><a name="0902275000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
my exchange with the hon. Member for Cambridge, I asked if he thought
his amendments quite did it, and he said that he did not think that
they did. I have come to the conclusion that there will have to be
nothing less than a rewrite. When completed, the clause will have to
have a less complex definition of data sharing, a more agreed basis for
the weighing of different policy objectives&#151;with the example I
gave about pension credit, one can see how two desirable things come
into conflict with each other&#151;and something about how far the
order-making power can go in repealing primary legislation. Perhaps the
Information Commissioner did not appreciate what he was unleashing when
he made that suggestion in his
report.</div><a name="0902275000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
hope that the Minister will say that she understands the objections,
that she wants a provision such as this in the final Act, but that she
agrees it should be in a different
form.</div><a name="0902275000192"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000535"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> My hon. Friend makes a valid point, and I agree
with a lot of what he is saying. However, he referred, as others have
done, to the capacity for repealing primary legislation, as if somehow
whole swathes of legislation could be removed as a result of the
clause. My reading of the intention is that it would merely remove
obstacles to data sharing where it is necessary to do so. Like him, I
think that there is probably a need for some redrafting, but is it not
right that there should be some capacity for removing unintended
obstacles that may occur in legislation from time to time, as long as
it is done in a manner consistent with data sharing
principles?</div><a name="0902275000193"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000536"></a>Mr.
Kidney:</b> This is my final point. My right hon. Friend is
absolutely right. Certainly, the Information Commissioner thought that
there might be obstructions to data sharing at the margins of Acts of
Parliament that were not contemplated at the time, and that it would be
neat and tidy to put them out of the way now that we see that that is
desirable. He did not anticipate that an entire Act of Parliament such
as the Data Protection Act 1998 itself could be repealed by an order.
Does that mean that on a legal challenge, if the Government ever tried
to do such a thing, the court could say, adopting the purposive
interpretation of the Act, &#147;I don&#146;t think Parliament
intended the Minister to have that power&#148;? Maybe. Of course now,
as a result of Pepper <i class="I">v. </i>Hart, the judge could read the
contributions to our debate and say, &#147;I&#146;m sure
that&#146;s not what was intended,&#148; but it would be better if
the Bill imposed limitations to make it clear that that could not
happen.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column383" />Column number: 383</div><a name="0902275000194"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000537"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I apologise to the Committee for my absence this
morning, which, sadly, resulted in my missing some useful prior
exchanges on this matter and related issues. However, we occasionally
have clashes, as was acknowledged by the right hon. Member for
Knowsley, North and Sefton, East, who is now leaving the Committee. I
do not take an absolutist view. I think that there are, properly,
arguments on both sides of the issue. I have listened to them with some
interest.</div><a name="0902275000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
start by declaring an interest, which I share with the right hon.
Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I am a member of the
Parliamentary Information Technology Committee, PITCOM, and now a
director of EURIM. I hasten to say&#151;I exempt the right hon.
Gentleman from this&#151;that I am not at the high-tech end of the
spectrum. I am at the end that concerns itself with the application of
public policy. When one considers the measures in the round,
one finds areas of concern on both sides, which is why I say that the
issue is one of
balance.</div><a name="0902275000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said powerfully to
the Committee, there may well be national security implications. In
some interesting cases, data mining may be appropriate. I remember
reading a fascinating article that started with what one might call a
conventional appraisal. If someone is accessing jihadist material and
information about self-made explosives on the internet, they might well
be of some interest to the security services. On the other hand, one
can launder such interest by putting oneself down for an awful lot of
pornographic websites, which somehow throws people off the scent. I say
that because I have some idea of the
complexity.</div><a name="0902275000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Stafford, reasonable as ever, made a point about a
cause that I share with him, which is warm homes. It would be nice if
one could just give the various fuel charities access to the pension
credit database so that they could give money to pensioners at
Christmas. At that point, one must realise that it is not always
necessary to break the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 in
order to assess them.</div>
<a name="0902275000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend
the Member for Rugby and Kenilworth will be aware of a controversy
involving constituents of both his and mine and relating to admissions
to schools in his constituency. I have been approached on that case by
a number of parents. As they came from different sources, I have not
thought it proper to say, &#147;Get in touch with Mrs.
X.&#148; I have thought&#151;I am sure that Members have different
practices&#151;that the right way to do it is to say, &#147;If you
wish to get in touch with a number of people who are organising
parents, I will supply that information if you like.&#148; In other
words, the direct approach&#151;&#147;Who&#146;s on pension
credit?&#148; or &#147;Who has said they&#146;re worried about
the Rugby schools&#146; admission policy?&#148;&#151;is not
immediately transferable but passes through the membrane of consent.
That is a first and prior
defence.</div><a name="0902275000440"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div><a name="0902275000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
said that, consent is certainly not a sufficient solution to our
problems. The major area of concern, and why we should condition the
clause, is this. People are not concerned about criminality&#151;we
do not expect the criminal to give consent for information to be
shared&#151;but, on the other hand, in our day-to-day lives, we
implicitly give consent for our information to be shared in ways that
are sometimes a little sinister or even
eerie.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column384" />Column number: 384</div><a name="0902275000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have two
cases in mind. Like many people, I use the online system for renewing
my road tax, which works well. It suddenly occurred to me that the tax
people knew with which insurers I had concluded a contract. I also did
not know that I had given any consent to the Government to know that.
No doubt it was somewhere in the small
print.</div><a name="0902275000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second case is similar. Because of a geographic anomaly&#151;I live
in a different county from my postcode&#151;for years, my wife had
not been able to get a protocol for online internet supermarket
shopping. When she eventually broke through, the supermarket said,
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, we&#146;ll fill in your first
week&#146;s order because we know exactly what you have&#148;. They
knew the exact pattern of her shopping because, like many of us, she
holds a loyalty card from the supermarket. Nothing of that is improper,
and it does not directly involve the Government, but it is the kind of
thing that makes us sit up and
worry.</div><a name="0902275000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
important principle of consent must be balanced against the principle
of fighting crime and terrorism, and other major Government
policies&#151;I agree with what was said on how wide those principles
have been taken. On the other hand, there is the feeling of public
unease and distrust. That is not simply about what data have been lost,
but, overall, that the general public may be losing control of the
situation.</div><a name="0902275000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having
mentioned the right hon. Members for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East,
and for Cardiff, South and Penarth, who are on the Government side, I
should like to mention my colleagues on the Opposition Front Bench. I
was wondering whether it was possible to call my hon. Friend the Member
for North-West Norfolk a Dave Spart-type radical, let alone my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough. I did not detect Dave
Spart-style radicalism in anything that they said, only in the passion
with which they expressed their reservations, which I
share.</div><a name="0902275000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not wish to detain the Committee as many of the issues have been
rehearsed, but I would like to make two or three points. The first is
on the question of discretion, which appears on page 101 of the Bill,
which uses the
words,</div><a name="0902275000427"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide
for a person to exercise a discretion when dealing with any other
matter&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
am anxious not to trespass on your indulgence, Mr. Gale, by
talking about another piece of legislation&#151;my Exercise of
Reasonable Discretion Bill will shortly have its Second
Reading&#151;which the hon. Member for Stafford, who I praised
earlier, has sponsored. The purpose of that Bill is to allow Ministers
to use their common sense. The difficulty is when the conditioning
under which that is done&#151;the fact that Acts can be set aside or
whatever&#151;is so fundamental that it might be considered a power
too far. I will be interested to hear any arguments that Ministers make
against that Bill on Second Reading because they could relate to this
issue.</div><a name="0902275000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">From
what I have seen of it, historically, one of the protections for the
citizen has been what I might loosely call the inefficiency of the
structure of government. Government has been organised in silos, and
substantially remains that way. Information does not readily and
totally flow across departmental boundaries, nor automatically between
Government and public authorities such as local authorities. Although
that is irritating, and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column385" />Column number: 385</div>has given rise to some of the problems in both crime fighting and wider
areas of public policy that Government Members have talked about, it
has stopped the whole thing getting out of
control.</div><a name="0902275000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
technology changes and the information can be transferred quickly and
electronically and perhaps with insufficient safeguards under the
clause and its amendments, so it opens a much wider access to
information. Something that I have banged on about twice before in this
Committee, but I will say again, is that I am concerned about what the
private sector will do when information is passed. Should it be
conditioned to enclose only those fields of information that are
appropriate?</div>
<a name="0902275000208"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
danger, at the moment, that if it is agreed between Department A and
Department B that this information should be passed and that there
should be an information sharing order which overrides legislation, at
that point they get the crown jewels, the whole lot, not the relevant
portion of the
file.</div><a name="0902275000209"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000538"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> The hon. Gentleman referred earlier to membership
of PITCOM and other parliamentary bodies. I am not sure that that is a
declaration of appropriate interest, although I agree that they exist.
Does he agree that there is information that sometimes ought to be
shared across public bodies and does not flow because of the
difficulties of getting that information across? Does he also agree
that there should be a capacity for requiring those bodies to share
appropriate information and to do so in accordance with data sharing
principles?</div><a name="0902275000210"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000539"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I would need to look at the small print, but the
way the hon. Gentleman expressed it&#151;as reasonably as
ever&#151;is acceptable. However, he has conditioned it within the
data sharing principles and not as subverting those principles. One
should not subvert primary legislation unless there is a specific
reason for doing so. I am not an absolutist; there are arguments for
instances where we should share more information, and that is what the
Thomas and Walport review was about. We need to find sensible,
practical conditions, which are not completely set by the
clause.</div>
<a name="0902275000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
suggested one condition that can be dealt with in a data-sharing order.
There should be field protection&#151;not necessarily the whole file
passing, but only those relevant portions. The second point that
concerns me is passing on information. Again, the Bill provides for the
sharing of information, including the private sector, and its being
passed on to third parties. There is no doubt that when people join the
public service and become civil servants they sign the Official Secrets
Act and are conditioned. However, those protections tend to become
attenuated outside the public sector, let alone outside the
jurisdiction and overseas.</div>
<a name="0902275000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">My third
point&#151;I am not sure whether it has already been made and forgive
me if it has&#151;is the question of any financial nexus involved. I
see no reference to finance&#151;I may have missed it&#151;and
whether a designated authority might, in pursuit of its policies,
charge for information and if so, on what basis. Would it be a cost
recovery charge, or would there be an attempt to make a commercial
profit? It could be argued that, if the public expenditure survey had
been particularly tight and the authority was a bit short of money,
securing a relevant policy objective might include raking in some
value. If such commercial purposes were allowed, that would put a
rather different construction on the motives for transferring the
information.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column386" />Column number: 386</div><a name="0902275000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">We all share
some disquiet about the specific drafting, some understanding that
there is probably a need for change in this area, and some wish to
produce a less enabling provision that is better conditioned as to the
type of information, occasion and safeguards. We will all express that
to different effect and we look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response.</div>
<a name="0902275000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">This is not an
issue affecting only the United Kingdom. A number of Committee members
are involved in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. I
have started putting toes into the water as to whether we might try to
press for a European-wide convention on data sharing. We would want it
to be pretty wide, like most Council
conventions.</div><a name="0902275000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
motive in putting it forward is that I have been reading articles on
the French concern about the so-called EDVIGE system, which concern
what information can be kept together. In virtually all Western
countries where liberties are regarded as important, one finds that
these issues are around. In the end, they came back to my wife&#146;s
feeling of unease about the supermarket knowing what she spent her
money on. She understands why that happens, and she certainly
understands that she has implied consent for it. However, if we feel
that people are taking over from us, we lose all
faith.</div><a name="0902275000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
convenience and exigencies of Government, and even the real issues
about terrorism, do not by themselves justify selling civil liberties
lightly. If we have to do it&#151;it is a sad analogy, but I will use
it&#151;I would much rather that we gave ground like a first world
war general, fighting for every inch, making every bit of the case. We
should not have the general enabling powers in clause 152, which might
be used appropriately in some cases by present and future Ministers,
but, sadly, we can be fairly certain that in some cases they will
not.</div><a name="0902275000217"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000540"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):</b> I have a long speech in response to this
passionate debate, but I am minded not to refer too much to it. I
intended to come on to the detail of the amendments and to explain the
background to the provision. I might touch on that background, because
there is common ground as to the fact that some data sharing needs to
be done. It can be done and has a positive aspect in improving not only
the efficiency of public services but enhancing the quality of them for
the people whom we
represent.</div><a name="0902275000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
I do that, let me make it absolutely clear, on the record, that I
acknowledge that the clause as drafted has the potential to be far
wider than it is intended to be. In explaining the background, I want
to establish the principles on which I hope that we agree, and then,
perhaps in asking the hon. Gentlemen not to press their amendments, I
will put a proposal to them as to how we might move
forward.</div><a name="0902275000219"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000541"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister&#146;s comments are extremely
generous and most welcome. Just so that we can understand, as
Government outsiders, the mechanics by which a Bill arrives at Second
Reading in this condition, and bearing in mind what she has just said,
when did she first come to the conclusion that she has just
announced?</div><a name="0902275000220"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000542"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> When she spoke to
me.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column387" />Column number: 387</div><a name="0902275000221"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000543"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I would love to say to the hon. Member for
North-West Norfolk that it was on listening to his cogent comments that
I came to that conclusion. I have considered the matter over the past
few weeks, on Second Reading and in discussion with my fellow Minister.
We feel that, although we are debating the matter now, there is more
work to be done. The work is ongoing, and we are in discussions with
the Information Commissioner. The Thomas and Walport report is
important, and much of this part of the Bill is based on the
Information Commissioner&#146;s recommendations. We will continue to
have discussions with the commissioner, but I want to have further
positive and constructive discussions with members of the
Committee.</div><a name="0902275000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">Richard
Thomas and Sir Mark Walport&#146;s data-sharing review recommended
that where there is a genuine case for removing or modifying an
existing legal barrier to information-sharing, a new statutory
fast-track procedure should be created. They recognised that the
default position in the public sector has been to legislate, creating
large numbers of specific legal gateways for sharing personal data, and
that the legislation itself does not inhibit such sharing in the
majority of
cases.</div><a name="0902275000441"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div><a name="0902275000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to turn to the comments made by the hon. Member for Cambridge,
with which I agree in many respects. He asked how others, including
those elsewhere or outside this Committee, have the view that sharing
data is unprecedented, that it is not part of what happens at the
moment, and that the information-sharing orders are something more than
is currently available. Under the second data protection principle in
the Data Protection Act 1998, data controllers, as a matter of course,
are able to further process the data that they hold for any purpose
that they wish, providing that the further purpose is not incompatible
with the original purpose and other requirements under data protection
law, so there is already some data sharing going on. In saying that, I
hope that we can establish that, in principle, there is nothing wrong
with sharing data in a properly constructed
fashion.</div><a name="0902275000224"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000544"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> Just for the record, will the Minister note that
certainly in my time as a Minister in the Department for Education, I
was aware of a limited data-sharing exercise that was available at that
time, which was in relation to dealing with criminality and fraud? So
it is by no means unprecedented, and it is no part of our arguments to
suggest that it
is.</div><a name="0902275000225"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000545"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I appreciate the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
comments. Richard Thomas and Mark Walport felt that there were
occasions where perfectly beneficial and harmless opportunities for
sharing data were prohibited by the law, and we fully support their
comments.</div><a name="0902275000226"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000546"></a>David
Howarth:</b> There are two separate things here. The first is
whether there is a need for data to be shared, literally with a
different organisation or a different part of the same organisation
beyond the existing authorisation. I thought that I made it clear
before the break that there are genuine problems and inconveniences in
the present
system.</div><a name="0902275000227"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second, separate point concerns using data for a purpose different from
the original one for which they were collected. As I understand it, the
second data 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column388" />Column number: 388</div>protection principle states that data may only be obtained for a lawful
purpose and may not be used for any other purposes apart from the ones
that were authorised. That is the heart of the problem about the
breadth of the clause, which defines data sharing, not as sharing, but
as using data for a different purpose, which is quite a different
problem.</div><a name="0902275000228"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000547"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> That is perhaps the one place where the hon.
Gentleman and I will have to part company. I will give two examples,
the first of which is from the Local Government Association. It
responded to the data-sharing review by
saying:</div><a name="0902275000428"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;a
vulnerable elderly person can benefit where the council&#146;s adult
social care service shares information with the local health service; a
young person&#146;s preparation for employment may be facilitated if
their school liaises with the local Learning and Skills Council to
produce a rounded profile of attainment and training
requirements...Government and citizen alike expect effective
liaison of this sort to
happen.&#148;</div><a name="0902275000229"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second example arose when I was recently discussing the clause with a
local councillor&#151;not from my own borough, but elsewhere in
London. He said that his council had an action plan to get the levels
of violent crime on a particular estate down radically. It was entirely
underpinned by effective partnerships between agencies&#151;the
council, the police, youth workers and a variety of others. That
obviously required effective data sharing. The councillor
said:</div>
<a name="0902275000429"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
inability to share and access relevant information and intelligence can
only hinder the assessment process and the ability to address the needs
of the young person at
risk&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would narrow the situation too much. We need to find another
way to ensure that data can be shared properly and appropriately, even
if they were originally gathered for a different purpose from the one
for which they are being
shared.</div><a name="0902275000231"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
want to put on record that the clause is not meant to allow
indiscriminate information sharing. An order-making power will permit
Ministers in specific circumstances to introduce specific proposals,
subject to robust scrutiny by both the Information Commissioner and
Parliament.</div>
<a name="0902275000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">To respond to
my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East,
one reason why the Bill is drafted so broadly is that it was felt to be
difficult to predict every single instance in which an
information-sharing order would be necessary. That said, the individual
order could be drawn tightly, setting out the classes of information to
be shared, who could share them and for what purposes.</div>
<a name="0902275000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Daventry suggested that the way around the issue is to seek
consent. In many instances, that is certainly true, but
some&#151;usually the poorest and most vulnerable in
society&#151;might not be in a position to provide new consent each
time information needs to be shared. For example, if a husband whose
wife died had to sort out all the different forms, it might be simpler
to allow the authority to do it for
him.</div><a name="0902275000234"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000548"></a>Mr.
Boswell:</b> I would like to record my assent to the
Minister&#146;s point. There will be some cases where it is sensible.
What I do not want is for that practice to override generally the
principle of consent, where it can be
obtained.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column389" />Column number: 389</div><a name="0902275000235"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000549"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Amendments 54 and 56 would mean that an order
could be made only in relation to an existing Government policy and
could not deviate from previously announced policy, requiring a
Government policy to have been clearly signalled or referred to in
speeches or other remarks made during the passage of a Bill through
Parliament, which is entirely unrealistic. The Government make
announcements and speeches on policy issues using a variety of
parliamentary processes. Policy intentions are signalled by
consultations, White Papers and other publications. Parliament now has
and will retain the opportunity to scrutinise and comment on Government
policy, and nothing suggested in the measures would take away from
that.</div><a name="0902275000236"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="0902275000550"></a><b class="B">Jenny
Willott</b> (Cardiff, Central) (LD): On policy objectives, has
the Minister considered the suggestion made by Richard Thomas in his
evidence to us? Rather than just having a broad brush covering any
policy objective, he suggested, highlighting specific areas that he
flagged up, including law enforcement, the improvement of public
services and research and statistics. That would be much more tightly
drawn than the current
wording.</div><a name="0902275000237"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000551"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I can see the merits of what Richard Thomas
said, but that proposal could be too restrictive. There may be
instances in which that list is not comprehensive enough, and I do not
think that he mentioned any mechanism to allow additions to the list. I
want to reflect on the provision and see whether it could be better
defined, but leaving it to the Information Commissioner to determine
such things, as in the amendments tabled by the hon. Lady and the hon.
Member for Cambridge, is not appropriate. It is appropriate for
Ministers to determine policy and for Parliament to determine whether
that policy is suitable. Richard Thomas and Mark Walport certainly
wanted to remove or modify the existing legal barriers that prevent
some important data sharing from taking place.</div>
<a name="0902275000238"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clearly
nonsense to think of striking out the Data Protection Act or the Human
Rights Act, and the clause must be modified so as to ensure that that
does not happen. Nevertheless, as my hon. Friends have said, this is
about sharing information and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford
summed up how we should be taking the clause forward more succinctly
than I have
done.</div><a name="0902275000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
is important that we recognise that the public have a right to
high-quality public services, which is not always met by public
institutions. If we are to deliver those services, we need to share
personal information in a secure and appropriate fashion. We can do
that only if we have the mechanisms to do so within the Bill. In that
way, we will improve opportunities for the most disadvantaged people,
provide more customer-focused public services and reduce burdens on
businesses. We must strengthen the protection of personal data and
restore public confidence in its security. Risks are always attached to
any form of information sharing, and we do not underestimate that, but
that should not blind us to the potential
benefits.</div><a name="0902275000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
would like to offer Opposition Members the opportunity to sit down
outside the Committee, go through the clause again and look at the
general principles that we agree on about where data sharing could be a
useful tool in improving public services. Let us see 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column390" />Column number: 390</div>whether we can come up with a more streamlined version that takes into
account the fact that Parliament has a role in scrutinising the
decisions of Ministers and that in his report the Information
Commissioner sees the benefit of removing the current legal barriers.
As a result, we will give the people whom we represent better public
services.</div>
<a name="0902275000241"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000552"></a>Jeremy
Wright:</b> I want be clear about what the Minister is
suggesting that the Committee does now procedurally. Will she invite
her colleagues to vote for the clause to stand part, given that we both
agree that it is flawed, or does she suggest that the Government
withdraw the clause at this
point?</div><a name="0902275000242"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000553"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I am suggesting that at this stage, colleagues
on both sides of the Committee agree that the clause stand part of the
Bill. I will then be prepared to sit down and discuss it in further
detail. Discussions with the Information Commissioner are taking place,
and I will be meeting people at the British Medical Association next
week to discuss the issues of medical records and so
on.</div>
<a name="0902275000243"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000554"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister has been very generous both in her
remarks just now and when dealing with other provisions in the Bill,
particularly in relation to clause 11. I get the impression that she is
not entirely confident that the Bill as it currently stands is as it
should be. It might be that it has been drawn together from a number of
different departments within her Ministry. If there are any other bits
of the Bill that she is not entirely satisfied with, will she let us
know, so that when we enter into the discussions that she has invited
us to, we can have an agenda of things that the Government have put
into the Bill that they would like to see taken out or amended? In that
way, we will not waste the time of Mr. Gale, Mr.
Cook and Officers of the House during the later stages of the
Committee.</div><a name="0902275000244"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000555"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have gone on the record on more than one
occasion saying that I have never, during my 17 or so years in
Parliament&#151;I suspect that this is also true
historically&#151;seen a Bill that began and ended in the same form.
All Bills, wherever they start from, end up being amended in some way.
That is the purpose of Committee and other parts of the parliamentary
process.</div><a name="0902275000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have made a constructive suggestion to the Committee, which I hope is
taken in good faith. There are already discussions with other
organisations about this part of the Bill, and I am happy to continue
those discussions with Committee
members.</div><a name="0902275000246"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000556"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In view of the Minister&#146;s generosity about
renegotiating the content of the clause, I shall not go through the
debate in any great detail answering the points
raised.</div><a name="0902275000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">It
has been a wide-ranging debate, including questions such as,
&#147;What were Sir David Omand&#146;s conclusions in his Institute
for Public Policy Research paper?&#148; If hon. Members want to come
and talk to him about that later, they are welcome, although I should
mention that they are suspiciously like the remarks made by the right
hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East. I do not want to go
through a competition with Conservative Members as to who is the
greater friend of liberty, except to say that those of us who have been
in Liberal  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column391" />Column number: 391</div>politics all our lives are glad to welcome temporary allies from time to
time, depending on which of the other two parties is in government or
opposition.</div><a name="0902275000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
overall conclusion is similar to that of the hon. Member for Stafford.
We have a small, modest problem that requires a small, modest solution.
At present, we have a modest problem that is being dealt with by a
massively over-broad clause. I do not want to go through the individual
details, but will dwell on the one point on which we still
disagree&#151;I am not sure whether we disagree because we do not
understand one another or because we really disagree. However, I want
to have another go at explaining why it is that the problems of sharing
data and of using it for different purposes are very different, which
is why my amendment 52 is so
important.</div><a name="0902275000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Data
can be moved to different organisations, if they are to be used for the
same purpose as in the first organisation. That is a different problem
from completely changing what the information is used for, whether in
that organisation or a different one. A fanciful but hopefully clear
example might involve people writing to their local council objecting
to a particular planning application. The council collates the
objectors for the purpose of writing a report for the council
committee. Later, however, the same council uses that list of people
for a different purpose, such as trying to persuade them to take a
different view on an entirely different matter, or as a list of people
to investigate for antisocial
behaviour.</div><a name="0902275000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">When
faced with that sort of problem, the fundamental issue is consent. If
we give someone information for one purpose, but they want to use it
for a different purpose, they should come and ask whether they are
allowed to use the information for a different purpose. That relates to
the issue with club cards and so on, which is a similar problem. One of
the worries that a lot of us who do not tend to use club cards have is
that we are not too sure about the purpose to which we are
consenting.</div><a name="0902275000251"></a>

Boswell:</b> Following that argument, will the hon. Gentleman
concede that there may be a problem in defining the purpose for which
the original legislation was introduced? Legislation may simply include
a provision that something should be collected without having an essay
on the purposes for which it should be collected or even for which it
should be
used.</div><a name="0902275000252"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000558"></a>David

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000559"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> To use an example with which the hon. Gentleman
might be more familiar than visiting supermarkets, I draw attention to
the discovery process within civil litigation. Parties to civil
litigation are required to exchange documents at certain stages in the
litigation on the understanding that such a process is to be used only
for the purposes of litigation. The Government will understand that
only too well, because the Leader of the House in her previous
existence as a lawyer was held in contempt for doing the wrong
thing.</div><a name="0902275000254"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000560"></a>David

with that example than that of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column392" />Column number: 392</div>supermarkets&#151;I fear that I am more familiar with
supermarkets&#151;but he has cited a good example. We ought to be
clear that the problems of sharing and of different purposes are so
different that, when the Government rewrite the clause, they should
separate them entirely. In fact, two completely different clauses might
be
needed.</div><a name="0902275000255"></a>

might replace the clause. I am happy to ask the Committee for consent

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000565"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I am grateful for the opportunity to return to
some specifics that were touched on previously. I shall try not to
repeat the matters that have already been covered. I welcome the way in
which the Minister responded to the earlier debate. To accept that
there are problems and to undertake to deal with them is a sign of
maturity, and it is worthy of support and praise. I want to take up her
acceptance that there are problems with the drafting of this part of
the Bill and to make a couple of suggestions that I hope she will take
into account when she redrafts the
provisions.</div><a name="0902275000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
support the capacity of Ministers to require data to be shared and
their ability to be able to remove obstacles to the sharing of
information, as long as they require the public bodies to do so in ways
that are consistent with data management principles. The idea that the
intention of the order is to subvert data protection principles is the
real problem. If it is to require the sharing of data in accordance
with data-sharing principles and to remove some perceived obstacles or
to clarify the situation for Departments or Government
organisations,  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column393" />Column number: 393</div>that seems entirely reasonable. However, I do not believe that it is the
intention of Ministers to subvert the principles, so let us make that
explicit in the Bill.</div>
<a name="0902275000264"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 155
would add the
words</div><a name="0902275000430"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;In
carrying out the requirements of an information-sharing order, a
designated authority must have regard to the code of practice issued in
pursuance of section
52A&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000265"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
considering that, my hon. Friend might even want to strengthen it to
&#147;follow the requirements of&#148; the code of
practice&#151;one Opposition amendment uses the words &#147;comply
with&#148;.</div>
<a name="0902275000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">The important
thing is to make it clear that an order to share data does not mean
that data sharing can be done willy-nilly or that there is a complete
removal of principles. That should be explicit. In my experience, there
is nothing that requires things to be more explicitly stated in a Bill
than data protection, even things that are already the case, as in the
example that I gave earlier of making it clear to local authorities and
the police that they can share information for the purpose of
preventing and reducing crime. I hope that the Minister will say that
it is the intention not for any order to override the central and basic
principles of data management, but to require sharing of that data in
accordance with data-sharing
principles.</div><a name="0902275000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
second amendment that I have tabled is also about trying to get the
message across that there is no nice, comfortable place where either
everything or nothing is shared, although it would be much easier for
people if that were the case. Sadly, on occasion, lawyers and data
protection officers have retreated into that citadel instead of
accepting that judgments must be
made.</div><a name="0902275000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">My
second amendment would insert into the requirements for what should be
in the
guidance</div><a name="0902275000431"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;encouragement
to data controllers to realise the importance of balancing all
appropriate considerations, including all aspects of the public
interest and the protection of personal information, in reaching a
judgement about what data to share, how and when to do so, and what
conditions to apply to shared data&#148;. My hon. Friend might well
respond by saying, &#147;Well, that&#146;s common sense and good
practice.&#148; I agree, but I do not think that there is any harm in
spelling it out that the order requirements would not do away with the
requirements to apply those principles and common sense.</div>
<a name="0902275000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">In accordance
with the comments that you made earlier, Mr. Gale, I want to
mention a couple of points on clause stand part in order to get them
out of the way and, hopefully, to hear a response from the Minister.
There was an exchange between the Minister and the hon. Member for
Cambridge about sharing personal data; indeed, the hon. Member for
Cambridge said that he wanted to press the point to a vote. I honestly
do not think that he has got it right. I do not think that he
understands the overlap between personal data and the sort of
information that is needed, that people expect to be shared and that is
important for the development of public policy, particularly at the
very local
level.</div><a name="0902275000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether the hon. Member for Cambridge shares my experience,
but constituents, in speaking to me about a subject, say, &#147;I
don&#146;t know why they don&#146;t know that piece of
information,&#148;&#151;whether it is age, telephone number,
address or anything else&#151;&#147;I&#146;ve given it to the
council already,&#148; clearly expecting information to be used for
purposes other than the one for which it 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column394" />Column number: 394</div>was originally given. It is important to have clarity about how far we
go beyond the specific purpose for which a piece of information is
being provided by the individual, in order to be clear about how it
might be
shared.</div><a name="0902275000271"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000566"></a>David
Howarth:</b> In my previous existence as a council leader, I
came across exactly that problem. Surely the solution is to ask people
for their consent in advance when they give the information, not just
for it to happen randomly
later.</div><a name="0902275000272"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000567"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I agree entirely that consent should not be given
randomly, but it is sometimes difficult to deal with things
retrospectively. Lots of information is already in the possession of,
for instance, local authorities. A local authority might develop a new
policy to help the elderly or the partially sighted, who are just the
sort of people who often do not make applications. We are going through
the analogue TV switch-off, which is a tremendous opportunity, as we
discussed in the Chamber on Tuesday, because audio description will be
automatically available to people with a digital box. If that sort of
information were not shared to improve people&#146;s quality of life,
they would find it difficult to understand why
not.</div>
<a name="0902275000273"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
we agree that there needs to be clarity, clear policy drivers and an
approach that is not random. There is a point between the rather
extreme position taken by the hon. Gentleman and the more
random-looking provisions in the Bill, and that is the place where we
ought to end
up.</div><a name="0902275000274"></a><div class="hs_Para">Anonymised
data at a very local level are essential to understanding differences
and variations, as I know from my experience as both a councillor and a
community worker. Having that sort of information, right down to the
small enumeration district level, made an enormous difference in
targeting activity to help people in the area where I
worked.</div><a name="0902275000275"></a><div class="hs_Para">Another
point concerns how devolved issues are dealt with in the legislation. I
do not want to detain the Committee long on this point but, sadly, we
have had some illiteracy previously from the Ministry of Justice on the
nature of the devolution settlement. That is a pity considering that it
is the Department responsible for constitutional matters. The Minister
may recall that last year, last-minute amendments had to be made when
requirements to protect NHS staff had been made applicable only to
England rather than to England and
Wales.</div><a name="0902275000443"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.15
pm</div>
<a name="0902275000276"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am concerned
about the phrasing of proposed new section 50C(4) of the Data
Protection Act 1998 on the sharing of information between Welsh
Ministers and central Departments. Proposed new section 50E(4) refers
to an order
that</div><a name="0902275000432"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;authorises
information to be shared by or disclosed to a relevant Welsh body in
connection with any devolved Welsh function of the
body&#148;.</div><a name="0902275000277"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before
doing
so,</div><a name="0902275000433"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;An
appropriate Minister must obtain the consent of the Welsh
Ministers&#148;.</div>
<a name="0902275000278"></a><div class="hs_Para">Ministers in the
Department for Justice should be familiar with the fact that crime
reduction and policing are not devolved matters, but that the Welsh
Assembly is a designated body under the 1998 Act when it comes to using
its capacity to help the reduction of crime. Therefore, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column395" />Column number: 395</div>the line between devolved responsibilities and those held by devolved
organisations and Departments is not that clear. Rather than detain the
Committee, I simply ask the Minister to look at whether the measure is
quite as it is intended. She could look at it with some of us who have
recently been teasing out those issues when dealing with legislative
competence orders or members of the Welsh Affairs
Committee.</div><a name="0902275000279"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
will the Minister, in any redraft, consider the opinions that were
expressed by the Justice Committee? Given the significance of the
proposed data-sharing code of practice in governing the practical
application of policy&#151;as I have said, that should include policy
on which requirements are placed by Government&#151;parliamentary
scrutiny of draft sharing codes of practice should be incorporated.
Secondly, will the Minister say whether the Bill deals with a situation
in which it might be in the public interest for the personal data in
question to be shared but the body holding the data makes no
application to do so? The answer might be that the only way to deal
with that would be with a mandamus order, but if a Department or an
organisation is reluctant to share data, they may not request the
exercise of powers by Ministers. I would be grateful if the Minister
were to clarify what would happen in such
circumstances.</div>
<a name="0902275000280"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000568"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I do not want to trouble the Committee for
more than 20 seconds. This is a sort of back-of-an-envelope stab at the
problem. I looked at clause 152 carefully, but I could not see any
requirement for data-sharing proposals to comply with the data-sharing
code. Can we have that in the Bill please?</div>
<a name="0902275000281"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000569"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I fully accept the points made by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth and the hon. Member
for North-West Norfolk, and I endorse the spirit of the amendments. I
would expect any sharing of information authorised by one of the new
information-sharing orders to be undertaken in the code of practice.
The code of practice is issued under clause 153 and would set out
guidance in relation to sharing personal data. Such guidance would be
applicable in all cases, irrespective of the statutory or other power
under which the data are shared. As such, there is no need for the Bill
to include an express link between the code of practice and
information-sharing orders, because the link is already
there.</div><a name="0902275000282"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000570"></a>Alun
Michael:</b> I made the point that, even when that is the
case, data protection requirements are massively misinterpreted by data
protection controllers and lawyers. Even though she has confirmed that
link, I urge her to put it in the
Bill.</div><a name="0902275000283"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000571"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Over the next week or so, during the course of
the Committee&#146;s discussions on other aspects of the Bill, which
I look forward to, we will no doubt see whether that really is
essential, despite the fact that I have said that the link is there
already. However, I agree with my right hon. Friend that it is central
to any decision on data sharing that the code of practice makes
provision that encourages data controllers to take all factors into
account in reaching a judgment about sharing data. However, I consider
that that is already encompassed in the requirement for the code to
make provision in relation to the requirements of the Data Protection
Act 1998 and good practice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column396" />Column number: 396</div><a name="0902275000284"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have been able to provide some reassurance, although I suspect that I
have not entirely reassured my right hon. Friend. I believe that the
link is already provided for, but if we need to discuss that further
during next week&#146;s debate, we can do
so.</div><a name="0902275000285"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000572"></a>Mr.
Brown:</b> In response to my right hon. Friend the Member for
Cardiff, South and Penarth, the Minister referred to the devolved
Administrations. Keeping in mind that the Scottish Parliament has
different powers from the Welsh Assembly, have she or her officials
spoken to officials or Ministers in the Scottish Parliament about the
changes? Will she share any responses that she might have
received?</div><a name="0902275000286"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000573"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> I have not spoken with Ministers in the Scottish
Parliament, but officials have been in contact with them, and my
understanding is that they are satisfied with the way in which the
provisions have been developed. I ask my right hon. Friend to withdraw
his amendment, and I shall reflect further to see whether it is
necessary to put in the Bill the suggestions made by him and the hon.
Member for North-West
Norfolk.</div><a name="0902275000287"></a>

wish to say to the Committee. It is the duty of those representing the
Speaker, as members of the Chairmen&#146;s Panel, to seek to expedite
and facilitate business, and also to endeavour to ensure that
legislation is thoroughly debated, although that is not entirely in our
gift. I probably have the power to issue an instruction through the

usual channels and Front Benchers.</div>
<a name="0902275000332"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are 135

am perfectly prepared to sit if necessary on Tuesday evening next week,
as I was this week, but even then I question whether it will be
possible to get through all that work within in the time agreed on the

necessary to return to the House to seek additional time or to go

Howarth:</b> I beg to move amendment 108, in
schedule 18, page 177, line 42, leave
out Part
5.</div><a name="0902275000335"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000609"></a>The
Chairman:</b> With this it will be convenient to discuss
amendment 366, in
schedule 18, page 178, leave out line
5.</div><a name="0902275000336"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000610"></a>David
Howarth:</b> This is a short point, although in view of the
Minister&#146;s comments about assessment notices this morning, it is
worth making it more forcefully.</div>
<a name="0902275000337"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 108
seeks to amend a provision of schedule 18 that, in effect,
provides that when the Information Commissioner has issued an
assessment notice and discovers important information about whether the
data controller is complying with the law, or even that there have been
or may have been violations of the law, he is nevertheless not allowed
to use that information when, for example, levying fines against the
data controller.</div>
<a name="0902275000338"></a><div class="hs_Para">That seems
rather odd. It means that the enforcement process using the assessment
notice will always lead to a dead end. I understood the
Government&#146;s case to be that it would encourage data controllers
to comply with 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column398" />Column number: 398</div>assessment notices; they would know that they would not be liable to
fines if they volunteered information, even if that information showed
them to be at fault and in violation of the law. That argument did not
strike me as being particularly powerful, as it seemed to be saying
that voluntary compliance with the law is the only way in which
assessment notices and other measures of that sort should
work.</div>
<a name="0902275000444"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">3.30
pm</div><a name="0902275000339"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
the Minister&#146;s comments this morning have slightly changed the
position. In the discussion about assessment notices, she said that one
reason why there is no enforcement procedure for assessment notices in
the main part of the Bill is that the Information Commissioner has all
those other enforcement powers. The problem is that schedule 18 seems
to be designed&#151;amendment 108 draws attention to a good example
of this&#151;to remove the use of those enforcement powers when an
assessment notice process has been used. The Government are now in a
contradictory position on the relationship between assessment notices
and the commissioner&#146;s other enforcement
options.</div><a name="0902275000340"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000611"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:</b> I was going to take only five minutes, but in
fact I shall take only five seconds, because that well-known law
lecturer from Gonville and Caius has made all the points that I
intended to make, so I shall simply endorse what he
said.</div><a name="0902275000341"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000612"></a>David
Howarth:</b> My college was
Clare.</div><a name="0902275000342"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000613"></a>Bridget
Prentice:</b> Sadly, I may have to take slightly longer than
five seconds. Section 51 of the Data Protection Act 1998 allows the
Information Commissioner to assess the way in which a data controller
processes personal information to see whether good practice is being
followed. However, to conduct a good practice assessment, the
commissioner needs to obtain the consent of, or be invited by, the data
controller. The good practice assessment is largely an educational
tool. It is valuable in encouraging data controllers to seek the
commissioner&#146;s help to ensure that they are meeting standards
and receiving
advice.</div><a name="0902275000343"></a><div class="hs_Para">Proposed
new section 41A, as inserted by clause 151, will allow the commissioner
to issue an assessment notice on any Government Department or other
designated public authorities to assess their compliance with data
protection principles. The consent of those bodies will not be required
to carry out an assessment under an assessment notice, so in effect it
allows for a mandatory inspection by the
commissioner.</div><a name="0902275000344"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
commencement of section 55A of the DPA, the commissioner will be able
to issue a civil monetary penalty for serious breaches of data
protection principles where those breaches are likely to cause
substantial damage or distress. Section 55A will apply in cases of
deliberate breach and where a data controller is aware that there is a
risk of serious breach but fails to take reasonable steps to prevent
it. Part 5 of schedule 18 amends section 55A to prevent the imposition
of a monetary penalty based on information obtained from either a good
practice assessment or the use of an assessment notice.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column399" />Column number: 399</div><a name="0902275000345"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 108
would remove the exemption so that once section 55A came
into force, data controllers could be issued with a civil monetary
penalty on the basis of information
obtained during one of the assessments. The proposal to exempt data
controllers who consent to a good practice assessment from the civil
monetary penalty was explored in the consultation on the Information
Commissioner&#146;s inspection powers and funding arrangements in
2008. There were a large number of responses from public, private and
third sector organisations, of which almost three quarters indicated
their support for that
proposal.</div><a name="0902275000346"></a><div class="hs_Para">In
its response, Experian considered that the proposal would ensure that a
good practice assessment was a joint approach, rather than a punitive
measure. The Association of British Insurers also said that if a data
controller was not immune from the civil monetary penalty, that would
discourage consent for undertaking good practice assessments. Such
assessments are meant to foster an open relationship between the
commissioner and the data controller. They provide an opportunity for
the data controller to seek advice on meeting standards. The
exemption provides a strong incentive to consent to a good practice
assessment and achieves the overall aim of lifting data protection
standards across the board. Removing the link between an assessment and
a monetary penalty, in line with the Hampton principles of adopting
positive incentive schemes, reinforces the drive to improve
standards.</div><a name="0902275000347"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
raft of strong enforcement measures are already available to the
commissioner and they will continue to be available to him should he
find something of concern in the course of a good practice assessment
or an assessment under proposed new section 41A. We do not propose to
provide any protection from prosecution in relation to criminal
offences that might be discovered during a good practice assessment,
nor do we propose to protect data controllers from other enforcement
action. The commissioner can employ the remainder of his
enforcement tools. For example, if he discovered a breach of the Data
Protection Act during an assessment, he would still be able to take
enforcement action. He could issue an enforcement notice under section
40 of the DPA to compel the controller to comply with their
obligations. Failure to comply with an enforcement notice is a criminal
offence. If the commissioner suspects that a controller has requested a
good practice assessment in bad faith so as to escape the possibility
of a monetary penalty, he retains his discretion to decline the
assessment at all
times.</div><a name="0902275000348"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
believe that the Bill as drafted represents a significant incentive for
data controllers to consent to a good practice assessment. It maintains
the balance between education and enforcement roles, and strengthens
the overall effectiveness of the data protection regime. Similar
considerations apply to assessment notices, which are a valuable tool
in raising compliance levels and educating public bodies that are being
assessed. They are not intended to be punishments for the public
sector, but rather a way of establishing and spreading good practice.
In any case, as I have said, the commissioner can still employ his
other enforcement tools where required. I hope that on that basis, the
hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</div>

to the assessment notice regime, especially if that regime applies to
contracted-out public services. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000617"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> We have dealt with those parts of the Bill that
relate to coroners reform and data sharing, and we are now getting on
to criminal law. In any sensibly organised Government, the parts of the
Bill that we have completed would have been parts of two separate
Bills. There should have been a discrete amending data protection Bill,
and a discrete coroners Bill, as promised in 2006. But there we
are&#151;this is how the Government do it, and we must do the best
that we can with what we have.</div>
<a name="0902275000364"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendments
tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends are short to describe
and short to debate. Under clause 39, we are dealing with partial
defence to murder: diminished responsibility. Under current law, that
permits someone who might otherwise be convicted of murder to be
convicted of manslaughter under certain circumstances, by virtue of
diminished responsibility. Our amendment 17, which is allied to our
amendment 18, seeks to clarify as best we can a rather
distressing aspect of the law of homicide which, with the ageing of the
population, may become more apparent.</div>  
<div class="Column"><a name="Column401" />Column number: 401</div><a name="0902275000365"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to say
at the outset that I am not proposing a licence for mercy killing or
for ridding the world of inconvenient elderly people or the terminally
ill. What I ask for&#151;I say this on the basis of representations
from parties outside the House&#151;is a discussion and some
understanding of the issue in relation to amendments 17 and
18.</div>
<a name="0902275000366"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second
raft of amendments deals with those under the age of 18. If the clause
passes unamended, they will not have the same access as those over 18
to the partial defence under clause 39. Amendment 400 would reinsert
the provisions recommended by the Law Commission in its 2004 report
&#147;Partial defences to murder&#148;, which was designed to bring
criminal law into compliance with article 40 of the UN convention on
the rights of the child. Amendment 400 has been brought to my attention
by the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, and I shall discuss it
briefly.</div><a name="0902275000367"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments
19 and 20 and new clause 40 are broadly identical amendments dealing
with clause 40, which covers diminished responsibility under the
criminal law of Northern Ireland. I shall not deal with those in my
discussions, save by implication in my discussion of clause
39.</div>
<a name="0902275000368"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I take the
Committee to the top of page 24 of the Bill and section 2(1) of the
Homicide Act 1957? The Bill seeks to amend the Homicide Act so that a
person&#151;let us call them D, or the defendant&#151;who kills or
is party to the killing of another is not to be convicted of murder if
D was suffering from an abnormality of mental functioning. The Bill
goes on to describe a number of factors that come into play.</div>
<a name="0902275000369"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendments 17
and 18 attempt to permit the law of diminished responsibility to apply
not only to the person who kills while suffering from an abnormality of
mental functioning, as described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and
further described under proposed new subsection (1A) to the
Homicide Act 1957, but to the person killed. That may seem strange, but
I have received representations from a number of people and
organisations who are concerned that D, the person responsible for the
killing, may suffer some disturbance of the mind or loss of
understanding about what he is doing and be driven to a terrible state
that leads to the killing of another by virtue of the recognised
medical condition of his victim.</div>
<a name="0902275000370"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is easy,
but perhaps dangerous, to give too-precise examples. I do not want to
shut myself out from a sympathetic hearing by giving the wrong example,
nor do I want to be too prescriptive. Essentially, I am suggesting the
following. There may be an elderly couple in which one partner is
gravely mentally ill or suffering from Alzheimer&#146;s or some other
form of dementia. That might cause a reaction in D, the person who
kills, that although not medically recognisable is sufficient to lead
him or her to kill out of desperation and a sense of
hopelessness.</div>
<a name="0902275000371"></a><div class="hs_Para">I underline
that I am not suggesting that we should legislate to licence for mercy
killing or to rid the world of the inconvenient, but we need to bear in
mind that there may be people who kill others out of a sense of
hopelessness caused by the medical or other condition of the victim. I
appreciate that that is a controversial thing to try to advance, and I
want to make it clear that I am not requiring it be put to a vote but
to be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column402" />Column number: 402</div>compassionately and sensitively discussed. I ask the Committee to
consider whether clause 39 covers sufficient situations in order that
justice can be done in the cases that I have
described.</div><a name="0902275000372"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000618"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Will the hon. and learned Gentleman articulate for
the Committee precisely how what he has just described&#151;his
intention in drafting the amendments&#151;differs from what he
referred to as a mercy
killing?</div><a name="0902275000373"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000619"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> The Minister is perfectly right to ask that. It
is not an aggressive question but one that I need to be able to answer
or that the Committee needs to discuss. When I opened my remarks, I did
not want to give too many examples or appear to be too prescriptive.
There will be cases when a perfectly sane and undisturbed person
strangles or suffocates their terminally ill partner, which would be a
mercy killing. Clearly the husband, wife or partner is deeply concerned
about the quality of life of that other individual. They do not
necessarily want to see the end of their life, but they can see that
the potential victim has no quality of life, and the only way that they
can see of relieving that other person of their miserable existence is
to kill
them.</div><a name="0902275000374"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Lady will be aware of court cases where, because the facts of
those cases sometimes can only lead to a conviction for murder, and the
court has no discretion other than to give a life sentence, one is left
with the position where a court will give a life sentence with a very
low custodial tariff. That is one way of dealing with
it.</div><a name="0902275000375"></a><div class="hs_Para">However,
I am talking about the sort of case where the husband&#151;it does
not matter which sex we are talking about; let us assume that the
husband is the killer&#151;has been so adversely affected by the
condition of his partner or his wife that he kills her. The recognised
medical condition belongs to the victim under my amendment. The
impairment of the killer&#146;s ability to do one or more of the
things mentioned in proposed new subsection (1A), that is to say, to
understand the nature of his conduct, to form a rational judgment, to
exercise self-control, is imposed from without rather than derived from
within. It is a difficult thing to explain in a sensible way, but I
think that the Minister understands what I am trying to get
across.</div><a name="0902275000376"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000620"></a>Maria
Eagle:</b> Would the husband in that instance not be suffering
from a recognised medical condition that would fall within the clauses
drafted?</div><a name="0902275000377"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="0902275000621"></a>Mr.
Garnier:</b> He may be. I would need to be shown medical or
other expert evidence that would persuade me. It may be that the
condition caused by the victim, which is impacting on the killer, is
not a recognised medical condition under the clause, as currently
directed. I am trying to find a just way forward. I am putting my stick
into the water and walking forward step by step, appreciating that I
may get knocked over by a question such as the one advanced by the
Minister or by other
contributions.</div><a name="0902275000378"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
have probably said enough now to explain what I am attempting to do. I
fully accept that the way in which I have drafted the amendments may
not be apt to deal with the problem that I am describing. I am
reasonably sure that the Minister has an understanding of the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column403" />Column number: 403</div>problem that I have identified, which has been drawn to my attention by
outside
parties.</div><a name="0902275000379"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
400 deals with the anomaly that the clause, in so far as it amends
section 2 of the Homicide Act 1957, will protect those over the age of
18, but will not do so, as I understand it, for those under that age.
So we could get a situation where a man of 40, with the emotional or
intellectual maturity of a 10-year-old, can rely on the clause, because
he has a recognised medical condition or a substantial impairment of
his ability to do one or more of the things mentioned in proposed new
subsection (1A). But a 10-year-old in the same condition, as I
understand from the Standing Committee for Youth Justice&#146;s
briefing, will not have the ability to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column404" />Column number: 404</div>rely on the clause for defence. I see the Minister shaking her head. It
may well be that I have misunderstood the briefing, or that that
committee has misunderstood how the law is to be amended&#151;or
both. But there we are&#151;such things happen from time to time,
even in the best of worlds. I place the two amendments before the
Committee for their consideration, and look forward to other
contributions or a response from the Minister.</div>
