but in the whole of Europe we have the lowest number of councillors per
100,000 people. They will be amazed to know that the second worst
country is Denmark, which has twice as many as we have per 100,000
people. A Danish councillor said sadly that his Government were
following the example of the UK Government and reducing the number of
councillors. It is my view that we need more councillors, not fewer,
and that important point relates particularly to the unitary
proposals.</div>

Councillor. Clause 3 states that the Secretary of State may direct an
authority to make a proposal for a single tier of local government,

effective and convenient local government&#148;. How do you feel
about that and what do you think of the implications of that approach
for district
councils?</div>

								Gordon
Keymer:
							</b>
						</i> The whole exercise for inviting bids for
unitary authorities has been most unfortunate. It has been costly.
There have been no proven records of savings through unitary as opposed
to two-tier authorities. It has caused serious division within the two
tiers of authority, which will take a long time to recover from. It is
a shame because we have just recovered from the experience of Banham
and now we have this. However, it produced a couple of very important
points about
districts.</div>
					<a name="07013157000015"></a><div class="hs_Para">First,
districts possess service provision and run an extremely tight
operation on that. Secondly, districts must be given every
encouragement to get their services from the most cost-effective source
they can. Thatmay be from the upper tier&#151;the county
council&#151;or it may be from their neighbours. In Tandridge, we are

<div class="Column"><a name="Column36" />Column number: 37</div>pioneering a lot of such work and acting jointly with our neighbours
both within Surrey and across the county border. Although I think that
the exercise itself has been unfortunate, there have been some good
things and I should like to see every opportunity in the Bill to
encourage the idea of flexible
working.</div>
					<a name="07013157000016"></a><div class="hs_Para">To take your
specific point, I am concerned about it. We were promised that 25
January would be a deadline for such matters, and that that would be
the end of it. Mr. Woolas assured us of that, and I am sure
that he did so with the best of intentions. However, we must be worried
by the proposal. It suggests that what has not been achieved by
stirring will be achieved by the Secretary of State, which is
regrettable. If you would like me to propose a change to the Bill, I
can say that the first thing I would hoick out of it is that
proposal.</div>

								Gordon

						</i> I would love to. The difficulty is that there
is no evidence of there being savings. It is a difficult situation. I
have discovered no exercise that has shown that a change from a
two-tier to a unitary basis&#151;let us forget about what all the
consultants are suggesting and the huge savings there&#151;has
produced major savings. To me, that is a very important point. I
understand that councils remain that have still not made up the cost of
the Banham
change.</div>

							<b class="B">
								Gordon
Keymer:
							</b>
						</i> You are right in that I have not, no. It is
not just a matter of saving money. We are here to provide services. I
know that we are supposed to be place shaping. I like place shaping as
much as anybody else, but in the end we are here to provide services.
That is what we are elected for. Services do not get improved by
reorganisation. One of my big worries about the whole process is
connected with the fact that, as districts, we are in the forefront of
service provision, of which refuse collection and planning are
examples. A unitary authority&#151;particularly a large
one&#151;causes that front line to be lost, and my fear is that one
is then left with the lowest common denominator for services in that
area.</div>
					<a name="07013157000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">My electorate
believe that weekly refuse collection is important. In Tandridge we
still run refuse collection from the back door, and people value that
too&#151;we have just started a new 14-year contract. However, I can
envisage a nightmare scenario in which, had we become unitary, all that
would have gone.</div>
					<a name="07013157000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government proposed not a referendum but a conversation with the movers
and shakers. So I went off to find the movers and shakers, of whom I
assumed the vicar was one, in Government terminology, and I mentioned
the problem. He was horrified. I thought, 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column37" />Column number: 38</div>
						&#147;Fine&#148;, and we got on in our own way,
as politicians do. But he kept on coming up to me and saying,
&#147;It isn&#146;t going to go ahead is it?&#148;. Then, on 20
January I was able to tell him that no bids would be made in Surrey,
and he was greatly relieved. So there is a real connection between
district councillors and their electorate which I think is very
important&#151;probably the most important aspect of all our
work.</div>

							<a name="07013157000290"></a>Alistair
Burt:
						</b> My last question is whether you or your colleagues
have any evidence of a tremendous pressure for change in district
councils. When the Bill was proposed, were not you and your colleagues
absolutely spitting at the sheer waste of time and effort that it would
involve? You can be
honest.</div>

						<i class="I">
							<b class="B">
								Gordon
Keymer:
							</b>
						</i> The answer is yes, but I should like to say
slightly more than that. Earlier, I mentioned that districts are
incredibly tightly run. I do quite a lot both within and outside my
district, though I am leader of it. I have no support at all, and I am
happy about that because I learn a lot, but the distraction that the
Bill would present was therefore of great
concern.</div>
					<a name="07013157000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">What
particularly bothered us was that the game was unfair. The dice were
loaded such that the counties could put in bids, and the districts had
to wait to see whether they were going to have their heads chopped off.
The alternative, of course, was for districts to get together and make
counter-bids, but that would have meant walking right into the trap,
because it would immediately have been attacked by the county&#151;I
am sorry to use emotional words like &#147;attacked&#148;, but it
shows the damage caused by that type of thing.</div>
					<a name="07013157000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my own county there was a
proposal for three unitary bodies, which copied our current area
working. I stood out against it, and as soon as the invitation was
issued the other districts withdrew, and no bid was put in.
Nevertheless, I felt that it was a particularly damaging operation. We
have to get on with our counties, and the counties have to get on with
the districts, and that sort of approach is not helpful. All in all, I
really do not understand why the Government took that line. I hope that
they keep to their assurance that the number will be limited to eight.
I would prefer none at all, given the unproven benefits of unitary
authorities.</div>

of Surrey&#151;I think that you confirmed it&#151;there is no
proposal? Do you also accept that districts as well as counties can
make proposals? Do you accept that the bid that I understand was
considered by Surrey county council would, according to that council,
have saved it &#163;40 million? That is the council&#146;s figure,
not mine. Given the process, do you accept that the Government do not
have a predilection and that the power to direct cannot and could not
apply in Surrey and in Surrey districts?</div>

						</i> I said that at the beginning, andI
take your assurance that that is right. On the&#163;40
million savings, they would say that, wouldn&#146;t they? I was
concerned that we did not enter a situation in which further council
tax payers&#146; money was wasted in going through the figures that
had been put through by the county. The main point is that the county
decided not to put in a bid&#151;that is very

						</i> I think that it is very important that every
district, county or whatever is free to choose. I can only speak from
my own experience. An authority may wish to change for a number of
reasons. It could be concerned about service delivery, but I do not
want to enter into a debate about the services provided by the two
tiers. However, I know that districts are very worried about it. I
think that certain aspects of that issue are very important, so much so
that I wrote a paper on trying to resolve the famous problem&#151;I
do not think that it exists, but it is often raised&#151;of the
question of public confusion.</div>
					<a name="07013157000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suggested that a way of
resolving the problem was to do, if you like, a telephone test. If a
person had a problem&#151;it could be with refuse, or it might be a
pothole&#151;they would ring a local councillor or, in other
circumstances, a local district councillor. I am sure that we can reach
an excellent way in which to operate. Where problems are more strategic
or technical, such as with education and social services, a person
would ring their county councillor. That problem has caused
difficulties in various areas, and I can understand why some
authorities would want to go down the unitary track. I regret that,
because I take Mr. Burt&#146;s point that authorities are
heading for very serious problems when they go through that
process.</div>
					<a name="07013157000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is
another issue. With some cases, there is a hope that by going unitary
and hoping the bid will be accepted by the Government, all the cards
will be thrown up in the air, and the new stack will be so new that all
the authority&#146;s financial problems will be resolved in a minute.
Of course, they will not. However, the new regime will be able to blame
it on the old one.
</div>
					<a name="07013157000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are various

from the invitation, but it was read&#151;and encouraged&#151;by<b class="B">

to put in an application for enhanced status quo. This was going on
right up to the very last days, running up to 25 January. Thanks to a
helpful presentation to the Local Government Association by somebody
from the Department for Communities and Local Government who, having
been pressed by somebody who wanted to go unitary, said, &#147;No,
that is not the case&#148;, I was able to say, &#147;No, this is

difficulties under the executive system, as opposed to the committee

going on at any particular moment. Advice was given on how they could
tell their back benchers or front benchers, or whatever they are called
now, how they could best handle these particular questions and try to
spread a certain realism. I was getting questions both from county
members&#151;not just from Surrey, but from all over the

There is clearly a trend in the Bill for a movement towards all-out

mayor, which we will come on to in part 3. But at the moment a large
number of the councils that have annual or third, third, third
elections are district councils. Do you see district councils following
that trend or maintaining a third, third, third scheme, which some

						</i> First, the fact that the choice is in there
is excellent. I fully support that. When we got control of our own
council, the first thing we did was have a public referendum and then
write to the Government, saying, &#147;We want to move to all-out
elections; at the moment, we are in thirds.&#148; We were told that
the Government wanted more elections, not fewer. I am very pleased
about that. I think that it is very important. But I would not go
further than that, because I think that it is a classic case of local
choice. There are strong arguments in favour of both. I personally
believe that four-yearly elections are strategically much better. If
you get anything near to a hung council, annual elections are a
nightmare: you never stop campaigning and if one side produces a good
idea, the other side has to show that it is bad because they fear that
it will be used in the next election. I support four-yearly elections.
On the other hand, thirds is much better for running an efficient
election operation. I think that it is very much open to local choice.
In fact, I would have to go back to my own authority again and say,
&#147;In 2000, you wanted to go for all-out elections. Do you still
want to do that?&#148; I welcome the opportunity very
much.</div>

I have mentioned the problems of executives. I regard the committee
system as open and transparent. It involves back benchers fully in the
work and allows scrutiny before the action takes place, rather than
afterwards. So if you are talking about choice offered under the Bill,
I do not think that there should be a prescription on choice. I think
that it should be up to the local authority and the local people to

rehearse it again. You have a modified committee system. It is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column41" />Column number: 42</div>based on population size and so on, which is what allows you to have it.
Do you agree with the Local Government Information Unit&#146;s

more strongly, possibly to the detriment of local democracy? Following
on from that, would you welcome an expansion of access to the modified

						</i> Yes. I really do believe in it. In fact, I am
so convinced that I am rather sad and sometimes go down in the evenings
to watch my committees at work, thinking, &#147;Here are people who,
from the very beginning, can involve themselves in local government,
learn to speak and debate with officers and graduate to the council
chamber and the full council meeting.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013157000055"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is happening too much at
the moment in the executive system is that council meetings are
dominated by two or three people and the rest are spectators. The
figures speak for themselves&#151;note the turnover of people who
stay for only one term and leave because they are frustrated. The
trouble is that we are trying to produce a whole lot of mechanisms to
keep them happy by extending scrutiny and so on. If you look at it
quite cold-bloodedly, all those things could be covered by active
membership in the committee system. It is a great shame. People are not
easily fooled.</div>
					<a name="07013157000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">How do
we involve councillors? I have said that we need more councillors, so
obviously I want to ensure that those who do come stay. I know how many
of mine have come up through the committee system and are now proving
very good chairmen and vice-chairmen of committees. I am thinking in
particular of one excellent young person who is actively involved in
debating for council, whereas when he started he was very taciturn and
did not really contribute. He has changed enormously, and I believe
that that is due to the committee system. I do not think that he would
have changed if we had an executive
system.</div>
					<a name="07013157000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Also, an
executive system unfortunately appeals in some ways&#151;I shall put
this carefully&#151;to the baser elements of human nature. Humans
tend toward secrecy. They want to keep things to themselves and keep
other people out. If we want an example of how that happens, the recent
exercise on the bids for unitary and the way that I have been
approached on it shows how devastating the executive system can be.
People were able to get an incredibly long way down the track toward
the finishing line in preparing a unitary bid before the members
finally realised what was going on&#151;running a group with a
committee system, I cannot understand that&#151;and put the brakes
on. It is quite extraordinary. Perhaps Government money could be well
spent in comparing the two in a case study of authorities where bids
were and were not put in, what the mechanics were to get there and why
the bid looked in some cases as though it were going in but did
not.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column42" />Column number: 43</div>having scrutiny committees in the committee system because the scrutiny
is done beforehand and that it is difficult to grasp why something
should be studied after it is done, when surely it would be better to
study it beforehand. That is what the committee system does. After all,

attempt to deal with the problems of the executive system. As you have
asked for the problems, one huge one is that of raising expectations. I
imagine that Committee members find that with their own electorates.
People hear about the community call for action, and one of the

						</i> I know that questions have been asked about
whether districts can handle standards. From my own experience, I think
that they have coped very well indeed in difficult circumstances. I
laugh when I think back to an early meeting of the Standards Board at
which it was worried that it would not receive any complaints. That
struck me as being a bit like Robespierre worrying about whether anyone
would be denounced in the French revolution. My view&#151;and I think
that of my party&#151;is that we should abolish the Standards Board.
However, taking your particular point about local standards, yes, I
think that it can set local standards. However, there is one particular
issue which I have been looking for in the Bill&#151;and again I hope
that the Minister can help me on this because I have not been able to
find it&#151;and which was in the White Paper. That is the very
important issue of allowing members to be more directly involved with
areas that directly affect them&#151;the old problem of the planning
application for the house down the road.</div>
					<a name="07013157000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the White Paper, the wording
was &#147;unless their interests in the matter are greater than those
of most other people in the ward&#148;. I have looked through the
Bill and I cannot find that reference. However, if it does come up in
discussion, I would just say that I am worried that we will have
another problem because, from my point of view, a member&#146;s
interest will always be greater because of their need to get elected.
That is a very serious issue.</div>
					<a name="07013157000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">I believed that we were heading
towards a situation in which no member could speak about a planning
application in his or her ward, let alone down the road, because they
were under pressure and worried about getting votes. If you have 100
residents complaining about something, you think very carefully about
how you make your representation. I support the idea, although I think
that it needs greater clarity, but I worry that the wording might make
things worse than they are at the

problems that have bedevilled the Standards Board since it was
introduced. From your experience and that of your colleagues, do you
see any way that we could amend the Bill to get to the heart of those
worrisome concerns? It is a matter held in common with us all: we want
to encourage people to stand as councillors and we want the public to
know that there are good standards on the council. But the impression
has been gained somehow that because of the existence of the board,
there is more trouble at local councils than ever before. Has your

						</i>I think that at the moment, you
have proposals for having an independent chairman of the Standards
Board. In the end, I am laissez-faire. Although I accept your concerns,
and in any situation there are going to be problems, there is already
the law. The most serious cases have usually involved the law directly,
and the Standards Board has not made a difference. We therefore have
the problem of how to deal with standards that are not directly to do
with the law, but are just expected to be high standards. I think that
you are on the right track in that the local standards committee is the
way to go. Each council having its own set standards with guidelines is
by far the best course.</div>
					<a name="07013157000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us be quite clear: we are
all politicians and we all have problems of public perception, as I
mentioned earlier, and we all have a responsibility to deal with that.
However, it will be extremely difficult. It is not just a UK problem;
it is a European problem and probably a worldwide problem, I suspect.
Within that, we have to produce guidelines in which people operate. We
will have to see how that works. At the moment, we seem to have
drawbacks that are far greater than the benefits. I do not have a
feeling that people have been coming up to me and saying,
&#147;Councillor Keymer, I have much greater confidence in my council
now because we have the Standards Board.&#148; I would like to see
guidelines. The guidelines are there, so let us give it

standards committees are working well at the moment. Although I have
welcomed cases being submitted to the Standards Board, I have not
encountered any cases&#151;at least locally&#151;that have gone to

their best but they find it difficult to grasp the difficulties under
which a councillor works. The argument is probably one of the oldest
that there is: does the professional body exercise discipline or does
one get outsiders to do the task? Normally there is an element of
outside people, but I should like a majority of councillors on the
committee.</div>

fair, it is hard to say that because someone is in the same party they
will necessarily be much more lenient. The assumption might be an

independent members, because if they are carefully selected they can be
helpful. Ultimately, however, I am keen that, as in Parliament, we

						</i> I think back, Mr. Neill, to
discussions in a different place when we were both on the Commission on
London Governance. We looked at the various options for London&#146;s
government, including urban parishes. After an exhaustive afternoon
spent with various representatives from, I think, Milton Keynes, we
reached the conclusion that this really was not necessary for London. I
am not going to oppose the concept of subsidiarity, because all London
authorities are committed to that in its various forms and all of us
operate those according to our needs. In our memorandum, there is
evidence from Croydon and one council from each of the political
parties giving examples of their current mechanisms, which work
well.</div>
					<a name="07013157000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">We found that
&#147;parish&#148; is a term that covers everything from 71,000 in
Weston-super-Mare, down to tiddly little groupings where no one ever
bothers to stand for elections. Of course, our London wards have
populations of about 10,000 or 11,000, which seems to be the average
for parishes. Our view was that, as a principle, we have already got
that direct connection between directly elected representatives and
their
communities.</div>

						</i> If I could add to that. We were here for the
last evidence session and I was taken by the references to the role of
back-bench councillors in authorities with an executive-scrutiny split.
It seems to us that the danger of having parishes in London is that it
would detract from the representative and local action role of ward
councillors. We should be seeking to build upon that, rather than
creating a new set of arrangements on top of what we have
already.</div>

that.</div>

political parties are in operation in some parts of London with elected
members, even under our current system, whom we might not be happy to
see dominating a parish council if it were based in a particular local
government area. I know that London government is concerned that there
should be pretty rigorous controls to prevent a council that decides
that it would not be in the interests of community cohesion to have a
parish that might be dominated by an extremist element from being taken
to judicial review if it refuses the petition. Is that covered
sufficiently in the Bill or we do we need further safeguards? If so,
what?</div>

detailed in the Bill and we hope that you can
address it. Clearly, we are grateful that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column48" />Column number: 49</div>
						Government have listened at an early stage. We have
accepted that the Bill is a Government manifesto commitment, but they
have listened and given the ability to approve to the local authority.
That is a major step forward. However, as you have said, we need to
ensure that if a local authority concludes that, on the grounds of
community cohesion, it is opposed to the setting up of a local parish
or parishes, it will be able to be safe and secure in that
determination.</div>
					<a name="07013157000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">Your
example of political extremism is the most obvious concern of us all.
We have only to look back to the May elections to see where an
extremist political party could easily have gained control of one
London borough, which would not have been good for the whole process.
The opportunities could easily be seen in London parishing. That is one
side of it.</div>
					<a name="07013157000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
side, which has its dangers as well, is of a particular, probably
geographically based, grouping, perhaps of people who objected to their
local authority trying to apply a policy&#151;it could be a variety
of things from finishing off a parking zone system to include the whole
borough&#151;seeing it as a means to oppose that and to protect or
even advantage. Most London boroughs have areas that are particularly
wealthy and they may wish to separate themselves from the problems and
the wider community by setting up themselves as a parish council, with
the ability to precept, inevitably requiring a bureaucracy and those
other incumbencies that might go with it. There are at least a couple
of risks around community cohesion in the wider
sense.</div>

see in the White Paper that the Government recognised our concern in
two ways&#151;first by devolving the power to create parishes to, in
our case, London borough councils, and secondly by making it clear that
community cohesion would be reasonable grounds for rejecting a parish.
We are still in discussion with Government at ministerial and official
levels about whether the Bill&#146;s present provisions will give us
enough strength to resist parishes on grounds of community cohesion. We
are discussing whether we need probing amendments, and we are talking

willingness to be involved, and it can be tricky, because the voluntary
sector and other sectors inevitably feel themselves to be
second-quality partners to the statutory authorities, which control the
money, officers, mechanisms and those sorts of things. Some of them
have a right to do that through the democratic process, but others can
dominate the process. Therefore, you have to take particularly positive
steps to draw in other groupings that do not have the power of budgets,
or any power.</div>

We have started commissioning and to refocus our priorities. From your

have done that across the parties&#151;the three political

we have worked out those new priorities for London. It is still about

comprehensive performance assessment reviews on other authorities, so I
have seen the way that they operate&#151;there is a commitment from
other organisations and groupings within London boroughs to be part of
that strategic partnership. I do not think that anybody is insisting.
They vary, so in one you might have the local fire commander being on
the body and in other areas that, for a different set of reasons, just
does not make sense. In Kensington and Chelsea. we have an arm&#146;s
length management organisation that has a seat as well as the
residents&#146; association representing other residents. That might
be unusual. Others may not do that. Some have a very small group of
under 10 people who actually lead the strategic partnership and that
seems to work for them. I think the structure in itself, within the
community, has to just feel right for that community. Being hamstrung
by Government or legislation does not help. I would say that it has to
be able to evolve naturally. Anything that requires certain structures

thoughts to our national colleagues in the LGA. My concern with this
part of the Bill would be the extent to which our relationship with the
health service generally is dominated by the immediate issues around
primary care trust budget cuts and how that is being handled within the
health service. To some extent, looking at structures and so on is very
much secondary to the crises that boroughs have to deal with when
coping with rearrangements in the health

						</i> Cost shunting in boroughs such as Brent and
Hillingdon, in particular, involves large amounts. Local councils are
having to put in considerable amounts, which is inevitably being
reflected in the council tax. It is just being announced at the moment.
Overall in London there is a deficit of &#163;135 million in
London&#146;s health service. It is so strongly felt that we have the
chairman and chief executive of NHS London attending our next
leader&#146;s committee next week, having put through a motion at the
last leader&#146;s committee. The issue is of real importance and we
have asked for an emergency meeting with the Secretary of State. We
hope that she will agree to it very
soon.</div>
					<a name="07013157000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Overall,
anything in respect of the proposal that connects the local council
better to primary care trusts, in particular, is very important. In
fact, my authority is considering being one of the pilots should the
proposal go through in its current form. One of the difficulties that
we are trying to assist with at London Councils is how the local health
service in the boroughs is scrutinised. At the moment, there is a gulf
between the local PCT, which the local authority has a statutory
responsibility to scrutinise, and the London-wide health authority. We
support a single health authority for London, but there is a gulf
between the two so London Councils is seeing whether it can provide a
scrutiny role, either sub-regionally or for London as a whole. It is
impossible for both sides to deal with PCT-level scrutiny and the next
level of chairman and chief executive London-wide. Somehow we must help
to deal with that. If it ends up with a great connection, we would be
broadly supportive of the
principle.</div>

there are a considerable number. We have such a high proportion of good

working with greater responsibilities being with
locally elected politicians for all the public services in their area.

When CHCs existed, we operated across London in the way that was

					<a name="07013157000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Health Link was formed in
January 2004. We draw views into policy making and policy
implementation, particularly from hard-to-reach groups. We have a
network of 125 lay patient representatives, all of whom used to be CHC
members in London. They have great expertise in monitoring health
services and are also well connected to their local health services.
That is our core of informed people, and from it we have drawn a number
of the patient reference groups that we have been commissioned to
provide. For example, we run the patient reference group for NHS
Connecting for Health in London, on the London &#147;choose and
book&#148; programme, and we ran another group for the London
patients&#146; charter project board. Sally and I are also involved
in a patient reference group for specialised commissioning in London,

unfortunate that we now face proposals to abolish forums, whereas the
Government previously assured us that they did not intend abolition.
The House of Commons Library research paper 2007/01 remindsus
that, in July 2004, &#147;Melanie Johnson, then Parliamentary Under
Secretary at the Department of Health, said that Forums were the
cornerstone of patient and public involvement&#148; and that she
said, &#147;They will not be abolished, nor will their independence
be undermined.&#148; In the arms length review, which told us that
the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement would be involved, we
were also told that, &#147;Patients&#146; forums will remain the
cornerstone of the arrangements we have put in place to create
opportunities for patients and the public to influence health
services.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013157000166"></a><div class="hs_Para">As
you are aware, it was only in July this year, in &#147;A stronger
local voice&#148;, that we heard that patients forums were indeed to
be abolished. I do not think that abolition is necessary. Perhaps we
cannot return to CHCs, although in some ways I think that that would
not be a bad idea, but there is no need to move to LINKs. We can
achieve the stated aims, which we said we commend in terms of widening
involvement and extending the remit to cover social care as well as
health. We can go forward by modifying, improving and strengthening
patients forums. I do not think that there is any need for us to look

it is a bit of a risk that they will not engage again. That was
difficult enough when I was chair of London Health Link and encouraging
the members of London CHCs to move forward. Many of them did not.
Therefore, if those moved forward again are going to be told that they
are so good that they are being disposed of, it is difficult to
anticipate that they will remain. If there was a provision in the Bill

think part of the problem is that we cannot see from the details given

forums. If we could be assured to some extent that there will be room,
as you said, for existing members of patients forums to transfer to

						</i> That is one of the other very significant
gaps in this Bill because there will be no national voice. Prior to the
establishment of the CPPIH, there was the Association of Community
Health Councils for England and Wales&#151;the Committee must forgive
me for using its acronym, ACHCEW for the rest of the afternoon. ACHCEW
was a bottom-up national organisation, whereas the CPPIH is a top-down
organisation, so its role is to manage performance, which needs to be
done. However, we are now losing the CPPIH and we have nothing in this
Bill. Therefore, there will be LINKs consisting of no particular entity
but a group of organisations. It is not dissimilar from, and actually
it really seems to be a community empowerment network for health. You
will know that better than I. However, we have already got a community
empowerment network in the area, so I am not sure that we need a LINK
as well. What is the difference between the
two?</div>
					<a name="07013157000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">What is more,
forums are capable, because they are statutory entities in their own
right, of setting up their own national organisation. If they wished,
if they had 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 58</div>
						the money, they could do that. That would give them
a bottom-up national organisation able to speak for patients and to do
the sorts of things that ACHCEW used to do, namely pulling together
issues common to a number of CHCs, turning them into a national issue
and getting them addressed.</div>
					<a name="07013157000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">The reason that we have a
four-hour target in NHS accident and emergency units is because of the
work that ACHCEW and community health councils did on waiting times in
A and E. Sally and myself used to go every month and observe the number
of patients lying on trolleys in A and E and how long they were there.
We did that because we knew it was an issue. Hence, we now have an
improvement in service as a result.</div>
					<a name="07013157000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we do not have a bottom-up
national organisation, that sort of activity cannot take place.
However, in addition we do not have, at local level, an entity that can
say, &#147;We have had five complaints this month about waiting times
in accident and emergency. We need to do something about that. What
shall we do? Let&#146;s go and investigate, let&#146;s find out
what best practice is, let&#146;s see what&#146;s happening
locally.&#148; If we do not have the governance, the scale and the
resources to undertake that kind activity, we are in danger of having a
lot of talk between an awful lot of people, but I am not quite clear
what the result will
be.</div>

evidence that more people saying the same thing is of value, when you
have not managed to address what a smaller number of people are saying

be cleaner or that hospital infection rates need to go down? How many
people do we need to say that? I do not understand what the objective

in the original proposals for replacing community health councils there
was not a national body. Indeed, patients forums were not in those
proposals. Patients forums, the national body and the independent
complaints advocacy service were hard won during the passage of the
legislation to abolish community health councils. We seem to have gone
back to square one, in throwing away what was so hard won the first
time around, when CHCs were
abolished.</div>

						</i> They would include a small entity, of the
right size to represent the relevant geographical area, of people who
were trained and supported, who were accountable and who had a code of
conduct that they had signed and had to keep to. There would be a
complaints process, so that any deviations from the code could be dealt
with. We need proper governance&#151;stuff that does not need to be
invented because it has been going on for so long, such as elected
chairs, and rules and regulations. It is dull, but you do need that to
have a core activity that works.
</div>
					<a name="07013157000182"></a><div class="hs_Para">That would be the
core of a new system, but beyond that would be links out to a wider
network of organisations. We do a lot of work with organisations such
as Thames Reach Bondway and Groundswell, which work with homeless
people. Those organisations do not know anything about health, but we
can go to them because we do know about the health service. We can
engage with them and find out what the health issues for their client
group are. That means that those 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 59</div>
						organisations can be experts in what they do and we
can be experts in what we do, and together we can add a lot
value.</div>
					<a name="07013157000183"></a><div class="hs_Para">To translate
that model to what we are talking about, if you have a local
organisation with clear powers&#151;one that can go out and engage
with perhaps even organisations in the community empowerment networks
or others&#151;which represents people who suffer health inequality
in the local area, the views of those people can be brought in to
influence the way that services are provided.</div>
					<a name="07013157000184"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just to give one example of
that from our work with homeless people, we involved homeless people as
advisers on patients forums&#146; statutory visits to A and E, so
that we could hear what the issues were for homeless people using it.
One thing that came up was the fact that if a homeless person with drug
or alcohol dependency goes into A and E with a broken leg or whatever,
they get their treatment, but they cannot be referred for
detoxification, even if they decide that they want it. They are told to
go and speak to their GP about it, but they probably do not have a GP.
There is no means of referring someone who has come voluntarily into
the health service&#151;no way of exploiting that opportunity and
providing them with a service that they have decided they want, so they
go off. There is a waiting time, but what are they doing during the
waiting time? That is the end of
that.</div>
					<a name="07013157000185"></a><div class="hs_Para">That issue came
out of our visits with homeless people. We were able to go to the
hospital concerned and say, &#147;Right, we need to set up a system
for this&#148;. We have got funding and we are now developing a
system like that, to ensure that when homeless people get into the
health service, all their needs are dealt with. That cannot happen
unless you have us knowing about the way A and E works&#151;having
context in the health service, governance and all the rest of
it&#151;and those organisations that can support people who are
totally on the edge, so that you can bring the two together and add
some
value.</div>

are to involve more people and to extend the remit to social care, and
also relate to the changing area, so that it can follow the patient

bodies. The elements of what we need to deliver that are absolutely in
place. They are patients forums, and PCT patients forums in particular.
In the existing primary and secondary legislation, there is a duty on
PCT patients forums to work together where they share interests. There
are also additional powers that PCT patients forums have, which could
enable them to be the key bodies in extending involvement and in
changing the remit to health and social care, as well as consultation.

						</b> I have been listening carefully and it struck me how
much common ground there is between what we have just heard from Health
Link and what Ministers are saying about what is needed for patient and
public investment. But again, there are clearly some strong
disagreements about the mechanism and the process, which is obviously
what we need to understand in this Committee.</div>
					<a name="07013157000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government make the
observation, as I understand it, that PPI goes well beyond patients
forums. Possibly you would agree with that because there are many

thousands, millions even, of individual human beings&#151;members of
the public who sometimes access health care or social care.</div>
					<a name="07013157000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government have an
ambition, which I think you might share, but not necessarily through
LINKs. The ambition is to reach out, past people who volunteer to serve
on community health councils and forums&#151;I am not denigrating
that at all&#151;to those hard-to-reach groups of the more needy,
vulnerable and alienated people. The Bill proposes that the way to do
that is not through patients forums but through LINKs. I am interested
in how you think that can be achieved, either through patient forums or
through LINKs. It is clear that Health Link supports that ambition. We
have before us a proposal that LINKs can and should do the job. How do
you think LINKs could do that job? What powers and what resources would
be
necessary?</div>

						</i>There is reference in the Bill
to authorised representatives for the purposes of entering, viewing and
observing NHS premises. I am not clear how many of those authorised
representatives there will be and in what way they would differ from
the rest of the members of the LINKs, but possibly there is a route
there to developing the core that I have been describing of people who
are supported and trained and have governance and so on.</div>
					<a name="07013157000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like to add one point.
We talk a lot about involving people. Well, there is not much point in
involving them if there is no result. In my experience, which is now
about 15 years of patient and public involvement in the health service,
the relationship that you have with the health service, which takes a
long time to build, is a sort of balance. You have to have enough
powers to make it listen to you, because otherwise it will not, but not
so much power that it is disproportionate to the fact that you are not
elected, and therefore should not have that amount of power.</div>
					<a name="07013157000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">In my experience in Barnet,
where we had many stormy times, you started off and had to really
demonstrate that you were prepared to exercise considerable amounts of
power and make quite a lot of difficulty for a health service trust
before it would listen to you, but once you had done that, you then
found that you had a very good relationship with it. People used to
ring me at home and say, &#147;We&#146;re thinking of doing
this&#151;what do you think? How can you get some people in so we can
discuss it?&#148;</div>
					<a name="07013157000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">That kind of relationship takes
a very long time to build. It is not seen, and the work that we did to
inform our response to the Government&#146;s proposals was to survey
members of patients forums and CHCs on their experience of visiting the
health service. What came through was very interesting, and I can send
this to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 61</div>Committee as evidence. What was clear was that people who are on forums
and CHCs did not go into the health service to pick holes in
everything, criticise and get straight into the local paper. They went
in there because they cared deeply about things being better. They
managed in many, many cases to secure improvements, and they
established a grown-up relationship with their local health
service.</div>
					<a name="07013157000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
relationship between any public service, but particularly the health
service, and the local community is what all these networks and so on
are trying to forge, but you cannot see that relationship. I think that
the people who have been working on developing that relationship up
until now&#151;the patients forum members&#151;need to remain. That
would be one criterion for this working. There has to be an
identifiable successor core to the patients forum in the LINKs set-up.
Just having arrangements, means and so on in the Bill will not do it.
They are the edges, they are the frame, but there is no picture in the
middle.</div>
					<a name="07013157000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">Unless we can
have that core, I do not think that there will be anything to get hold
of, anything to work or, indeed, anything to attract people. Again, I
do not know as much as perhaps I should about community empowerment
networks, but how easy is it to get organisations actively to
participate in them? However easy it is or is not, the fact that at one
end of the local authority corridor someone is doing that and that at
the other end someone is procuring another organisation to do precisely
that with another load of organisations through the health involvement
team does not make any sense to me, I am afraid. It is bureaucratic and
expensive.</div>
					<a name="07013157000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">In order
to achieve the objective that we all share of wider patient
involvement, that must be part of a grown-up and effective
relationship. You cannot have that relationship without powers and
without knowledgeable, well-supported people. You cannot have
appropriate involvement without the wider input that we are talking
about from the groups that support harder-to-reach
groups.</div>

about what is needed. If we were to embrace social care, too, which is
a good thing and very ambitious, what sort of resources do you think

provide the right kind of support to the secretariat and to meetings
and so on, and that knows about the health service. You have to have
member expenses and member training. Member training has never had the
attention it should have had throughout the 34-year history of this
saga. People need to be adequately trained to understand not only the
health service but the needs of people who are not there. That is
important. Those are the elements that you would need, but I cannot put

						</i> I can perhaps give you a comparable figure,
but it dates back to 2000. A previous chief officer of a community
health council in north-west London told me that the CHC budget, which
would have covered a London borough, was approximately &#163;130,000.
That included the office, three staff and member expenses. Those are
the figures for 2000. We are now talking about extending the provision
to social care and for 2007 or 2008, so my feeling is that it would
have to be significantly more. One of the worrying things about the
proposals is that we are not told what the budget will be to support
LINKs. We understand that it depends on the comprehensive spending
review, and perhaps we cannot know the exact figure, but it would be
useful to have an indicative figure.</div>
					<a name="07013157000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must not forget section 11,
which I believe is now section 242 under the National Health Service
Act 2006 and places an obligation on the NHS to consult patients and
the public. We do not want LINKs to duplicate that. The PCT patients
forum has a duty to monitor the NHS&#146;s performance of section 11.
That is another way in which patients forums ensure that the NHS
actively involves its users. It is quite right, of course, that they
do.</div>

Government response that &#147;there are several fundamental
differences between PPI forums and LINKs, for example LINKs will cover
social care services as well as health, they will be established for a

respect of the statutory duty to inspect, which is being downgraded. We

						</i> We have done a lot of thinking about that. We
are so used to the idea of an inspection right that we were horrified
when the proposal came up to remove it. We lobbied extremely hard to
get what is now in the Bill. To me, &#147;inspection&#148; means
the Healthcare Commission, the social care inspection provision and
national regulatory bodies such as the Audit Commission, which is
mentioned in the Bill, but I referred earlier to the relationship
between the health service and its local community. It is that
interface where inspection&#151;if we cannot find another
word&#151;comes into play for forums. Those people speak on behalf of
local communities of taxpayers who fund the health service and are
totally dependent on it when they are at their most vulnerable. It is
therefore appropriate for them, on behalf of patients, to see inside
the health service and talk about the things that matter.</div>
					<a name="07013157000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">I gave the example earlier of
homeless people. If you are lying on a trolley in A and E, you cannot
climb off it and go to another A and E where you think you will get
quicker service. Someone else has to perform a role for you, so entry
and dialogue with NHS management and practitioners about the way that
services are provided are
essential.</div>
					<a name="07013157000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is no
right in the Bill to go in, as there was under the two previous
reforms, because there is nothing to have a right&#151;there is no
entity, which is one of the key weaknesses. LINKs are merely objects of
the duty of NHS organisations and so on to let them in. They are weak
because there is no entity. If I were in a LINK, I would not be able to
write to my NHS organisation and say that I was concerned because I had
had complaints about its chiropody service, or whatever service, and
that I would like to go in and talk to the staff. That is invaluable
when you are doing visits&#151;you get all sorts of intelligence from
the staff that you would not otherwise get. You find out whether they
are short of money, resources or staff. It involves a relationship, and
entering and observing is to do with furthering the relationship and
making it more robust, and procuring dialogue about changes and
improvements. It is not inspection in the way that the Healthcare
Commission might inspect. It will go in with a list and ask,
&#147;Have you got this and this?&#148; It is not the same as
that.</div>

fact that we have had, as forum members, letters saying that we are
valued. What I would like, however, is an assurance&#151;if the
Minister or one of her colleagues can give it during the progress of
the Bill&#151;that existing patient forum members can transfer
automatically to LINKs. As Elizabeth said, actions speak louder than
words. I would also like to mention that existing patient forum members
have been checked by the Criminal Records Bureau, which is a costly and
time-consuming process. To take on those members who have already been
through that process so that they would be able straight away to
deliver the inspection role would be great. Therefore, an assurance
that patient forum members can transfer would do a lot to answer our

						</i> The role of overview, scrutiny and health is
developing very well in many areas. Unfortunately, however, it sits at
the town hall. If there were better practical links&#151;the links
are there legislatively speaking&#151;between patients forums, the
patients forums could be the eyes and ears of elected councils inside
the health service. They could also help to bring in health issues that
might be relevant to the well-being power and other functions of local
government that are relevant to health. They could assist with bringing
in the views and perspectives of people with health inequalities to
that work. So, I think it is twofold really. They could be the eyes and
ears of the scrutiny committee inside the health service. That would
then act as a counterweight to the NHS. In the scrutiny committee, the
NHS gives evidence and it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column66" />Column number: 67</div>
						quite difficult to get anyone else of similar
weight, so that would work very well with that. On the role in health,
they would have a contribution to make as
well.</div>

						</i> I think so, yes, because there is the link
between LINKs and scrutiny committees when it comes to making
referrals. There is a plan to match the social care referral power in
the Bill with the existing health power to make them the same. I think
that that is very welcome. That opens up that channel of communication.
On the health side, I am not so sure, because the LINKs relate
exclusively to social and health care services, and their providers.
Their role in health is less distinct than the current situation with
patients forums, so I think that that is a weakness.</div>

						</i> The majority of the local authority
scrutiny committees to which I have spoken in the course of my work
were worried about the proposals to abolish patients forums, because
they regard them as their eyes and ears. The fact that patients forums
have the power to enter and inspect, and that they are often aware of
the issues concerning patients in their area, has been extremely
valuable to scrutiny committees. Patients forums give the committees
the information that they need to decide which services they are going
to scrutinise, and the confidence that they are picking up the views of
the population. Patients forums have been very welcome.</div>
					<a name="07013157000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">Scrutiny committees were
slightly reassured when we were told that LINKs would have the power to
enter and inspect, but they are worried about the potential gap between
the abolition of patients forums and the setting up of LINKs. That
seems to be the case from what we have been told about the transition
process.</div>

						</i> Yes, these are confusing times. It is a
testimony to patients forum members that so many of them have been
prepared to go on, and are hanging on in there. The timetable of
transition depends on the legislation, so it is inevitable that there
is some uncertainty. As patients forum members, we may get subsequent
letters that again alter the timetable. The Department of Health tells
us that the plan is for forums to be abolished in December 2007 if the
legislation goes through this Session, for CPPIH to continue until
March 2008, and for LINKs to be set up sometime from January 2008
onwards. There seems to be a gap, so I am sure that we will get further
letters about our membership.</div>

the great losses was the loss of CHC staff. The Minister at the time
gave assurances to Parliament that there would be a role for CHC staff
in the new structures. Unfortunately, it was not within his remit to
deliver that&#151;it was up to the CPPIH which, as we know, went with
a different method of providing support, which was to contract it out
to forum support organisations. There was a big gap, in which time any
remaining CHC staff would have been few and far between, even if they
had wanted to seek employment with the forum support organisations.
There was a big gap in the support being offered. As Elizabeth said,
there was also a big gap in terms of getting in place basic things such
as governance arrangements and standing orders for how forums should
operate. Many of the new recruits to patients forums, people who came
in very keen to work in patients forums, left because it was such a
shambles in the early months. We need a carefully managed transition.
It was sad that in the transition from CHCs to patients forums we lost
so much that was good about CHCs.</div>

						</i> May I answer as well by giving an example?
Your previous witnesses referred to the level of deficit in the health
service in London and cuts in services. Without patients forums, how
will any of us know the day-to-day effect of those cuts? How will a
debate about whether or not those cuts were advisable be informed with
a patient&#146;s perspective? With the wholesale removal of patients
forums in London which, as we speak, are monitoring the health service
on our behalf and getting evidence on our behalf of the effects of
those cuts, those services will be gone. The particular situation in
the health service now with cuts happening is more serious than it was
when CHCs went. That significant risk must be
considered.</div>

will establish the LINKs. We do not know who the hosts will be. What
will they know about establishing a LINK? Who will they choose to be
the LINK? Will they do it by virtual means, as the provision outlines
under the Bill? It states that it may be a person or persons or it may
be done by &#147;any other means&#148;. So it will not necessarily
be a body, even when it is established. I have worries about the host
