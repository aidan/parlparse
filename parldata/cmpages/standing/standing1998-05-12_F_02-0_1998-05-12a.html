</P>

<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan (Chesham and Amersham):</B> On a 
point of order, Miss Widdecombe. This morning we had 
great pleasure in welcoming Mrs. Roe to the Chair and I 
am sure that the Minister will agree, we had some 
excellent debates. Although you were mentioned in 
dispatches, Miss Widdecombe, Conservative Members 
wish to extend a warm welcome to you. We hope that we 
will not cause you too much trouble. We did not give 
Mrs. Roe too much trouble this morning, but things may 
change in the afternoon sitting. None the less, I hope that 
you enjoy your stay in the Chair. We will be guided by 
your wise words and your long experience in the House.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady: Indeed, 
this Committee will not give me any trouble.
<P>
<B>Mr. Eric Forth (Bromley and Chislehurst):</B> I wish to 
echo my hon. Friend's words.
<P>
In this morning's sitting, I asked my hon. Friend the 
Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) whether 
he was aware that the European Union is introducing a 
directive that, among other things, will seek to give 
consumers direct redress against the manufacturer of 
consumer goods. Does he not think that that could blur 
the relationship between consumers, retailers, wholesalers 
and manufacturers? Might that not cause considerable 
difficulty in identifying the contractual relationships 
between the different parties and give rise to difficulty in 
implementing the aims of the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Page (South-West Hertfordshire):</B> I add 
my welcome to you, Miss Widdecombe. I find it a little 
difficult to respond to my right hon. Friend the Member 
for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) without 
providing a little background. I doubt whether a transcript 
of this morning's sitting is ready for your attention.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman does not 
need to repeat himself. I am capable of picking up the 
issues very quickly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am delighted to hear that, so I will not 
repeat the fact that I was asking whether qualifying debt 
would be subject to a different interpretation when the 
European directive comes into force. My right hon. Friend 
the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst will remember 
that I said that the directive might lead to member states 
introducing in their legislation a provision allowing the 
seller to retain the title of goods. Unless a contract 
specifically contains such a clause, the directive is 
contrary to existing English law. That might present 
problems when the Bill reaches the statute book and the 
European directive comes into force.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst described what would happen if the European 
Union went one stage further. At present, if a product 
goes wrong, a claim is made against the retailer. He will 
join the manufacturer or the distributor to defend any 
possible action and the whole chain is drawn in.
<P>
The European Union is considering changing the 
position so that quality and fitness for purpose is a matter 
directly for the manufacturer. It is a matter for thought 
and consideration whether that change will give the 
consumer a better chance of redress.

<P>
<B>Mr. John M. Taylor (Solihull):</B> Would my hon. Friend 
take a moment to reflect on my intervention? Is it not 
absurd for pressure in favour of trading standards 
enforcement against other countries and across boundaries 
to be coming from countries within the European Union 
that do not even have trading standards enforcement 
within their own borders?
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> You may find this hard to believe,
Miss Widdecombe, but I was desperately trying to bring 
my remarks to a close before the 1 o'clock witching hour 
struck. My hon. Friends have managed to keep me going 
on a subject into which I am usually reluctant to be drawn.
<P>
I mentioned earlier that I had a penchant for unified 
legislation throughout the EC to avoid precisely the 
problems mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for 
Solihull (Mr. Taylor). Different legislation applying in 
different places makes it difficult for small businesses to 
operate across borders and it also makes it more difficult 
to claim debt or recover money. That is why so many 
businesses are forced to undertake expensive insurance to 
protect themselves against such difficulties, particularly 
when certain companies use legislation to delay the 
necessary payments or to avoid them altogether.
<P>
I bring my remarks to a close with the hope that when 
the Minister responds, she will explain how moves to 
change the title of goods at present, it remains with the 
seller until the buyer has paid the full price will take 
effect. Additional requirements are relevant: it will 
depend on the period of time and on whether a complaint 
about the fitness of purpose or quality of the goods has 
been registered.
<P>
We are all looking for some assurance that we will 
enact the Bill only to return a few years later and 
apologise for having to work it out all over again.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan </B>(Chesham and Amersham): Does 
my hon. Friend agree that it is surprising that although we 
have been talking about international harmonisation, the 
hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale), who used to 
be a lecturer in European studies in another life, has failed 
to intervene or make any comment? Surely it would have 
benefited the wider audience that studies the proceedings 
of this Committee and indeed the Committee itself if the 
hon. Member for Wimbledon and provided us with some 
of the wisdom stemming from his undoubted knowledge 
of European matters.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Government Back Benchers have 
maintained a Trappist silence throughout. I was originally 
under the impression that it was brought about by the 
co-ordinating voice from Millbank Tower insisting that 
silence be maintained. As we know from the Committee 
so far, that has indeed been the case.
<P>
In the brief time between 1 o'clock and now, however, 
I took the opportunity of examining the composition of 
Government Back Benchers and realised that their silence 
is probably due to their singular lack of any small business 
experience. It would have been nice to report that the 
Government appointed to the Committee people with 
experience of small businesses. That would have enabled 
Government Back Benchers to make some contribution to 
debating a Bill that we all want to work as effectively 
as possible.



<P>
<B>The Minister for Small Firms, Trade and Industry (Mrs. Barbara Roche):</b> May I, on behalf of all members 
of the Committee, take the opportunity to welcome you, 
Miss Widdecombe, to the chairmanship of the 
Committee? On a personal basis, it is a particular pleasure 
for me to appear before you. We have known each other 
for more than 20 years. You are well known for your 
fairness and your firmness. I shall take it no further than 
that, but we look forward to having a constructive 
discussion under your chairmanship.
<P>
We have had a wide-ranging debate on clause 1 stand 
part. That is perhaps the best way to describe it. It was 
almost like a Second Reading debate. A rather elegant 
smoke screen was drawn over our proceedings by the hon. 
Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) to 
mask her embarrassment about originally being a 
supporter of statutory rights to interest and then being 
constrained by the shadow Secretary of State for Trade 
and Industry into adopting an opposing position.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I say again for the record that I have no 
embarrassment at having subscribed to the EDM. I have 
explained to the Minister and to the Committee that it is 
a woman's prerogative to change her mind. I think that 
this is a smoke screen for the Minister, who is 
embarrassed by an issue of network, which says that 
although she admits that almost 60 per cent. of the lobby 
groups representing the smaller businesses are opposed to 
statutory rights to interest on late payment she is 
determined to take the legislation through. The Minister 
is putting up a smoke screen to hide her own 
embarrassment and her admission that her Bill is not 
universally welcome, contrary to the impression she has 
forcefully been trying to give us throughout the 
proceedings.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Roche: I have no knowledge of any such 
quotation. The only thing I know about that publication is 
that it has gone out of print, but that might have escaped 
the hon. Lady's attention. She is doing pretty well.
I admire her tremendously for saying what she does with 
a straight face. She ignored all the surveys: the Institute 
of Directors' response to the Green Paper, the National 
Opinion Poll survey and the latest survey, the Graydon 
survey, which shows that 65 per cent. of respondents were 
in favour of the Government's proposals. As I said earlier, 
71 per cent. of the finance directors of large companies 
were found to be in favour.
<P>
I should like to deal with some of the points of detail 
that were raised during the debate. The question of league 
tables for Government Departments was mentioned.
As I said on Second Reading, I will publish those details. 
There will be a league table of Government Departments 
and we will publish it before the summer recess. The hon. 
Lady was a little churlish to ask why we were waiting 
until the summer recess. I remind her that the financial 
year to which the tables relate has just ended. She quite 
rightly asked how we would monitor the success of the 
Bill. We will use the payment observatory at Bradford 
university to look at the whole package of measures 
dealing with late payment. That observatory debates and 
reaches its conclusions independently. We have made it 
clear that this is part of an overall package and that it is 
essential to an understanding of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Brian Cotter (Weston-super-Mare):</B> We look 
forward very much to the Government's league table 
report. I may have missed the point, but will it be an 
annual report? On the issue of monitoring how the Bill 
affects the future, it might help if companies were 
required to print in their annual reports their record on 
payment.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Certainly, I can assure the hon. 
Gentleman that it will be annual. We clearly want to make 
comparisons between Government Departments. The hon. 
Gentleman was also right to mention the statutory 
requirement for large companies to include in their annual 
reports not only their payment policy but their payment 
practice. That is essential, but until now small companies 
have not been able to see those payment practices. That is 
why we welcome the decision of the Federation of Small 
Businesses to publish leagues tables.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</b> Can the Minister give us some idea of the sort of analysis or breakdown that we can expect to see? 
Will it distinguish between public sector and private 
sector payment practices? Will it distinguish one sector
from another, so that we can get a better idea of payment 
performance? Will it be able to distinguish, as the 
Minister seems to think it should, between different sizes 
of business, so that we can get a better feel of what is 
going on?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Information on the private sector will 
obviously be published by the Federation of Small 
Businesses. I note what the right hon. Gentleman said his 
remarks were helpful and I shall certainly pass them on 
to the federation. It is useful to consider different sizes 
of business; we talk of all small businesses or all large 
businesses as if they were the same. The hon. Member for 
Solihull also mentioned that, and I accept what has been 
said. There can also be differences between sectors. The 
right hon. Gentlemen's comments are helpful and I shall 
certainly bear them in mind.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> How will the Minister judge the success 
with which Government Departments have increased their 
payment record? For example, the latest figures showed 
that the National Investment and Loans Office and the 
Privy Council had a 100 per cent. record; the Scottish 
Office's record was the worst at 83.6 per cent. Will the 
Minister monitor the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh 
assembly? Will she set targets for those Departments, and 
if so, will she share those targets with us, or whether she 
will simply let those Departments run themselves? The 
bottom line is how that policy will affect other 
Government Departments, how the Minister can help 
them improve their payment record, and how she will 
judge her success.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady raises an important point. 
We shall clearly be considering past payment 
performance, and we shall expect an improvement. As I 
said in answer to the hon. Lady's question on the Ministry 
of Defence, I regard it as my role, as did my predecessor 
the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, to chivvy 
not only the private sector on tardy payment, but 
Government Departments too. We shall be looking for 
stringent targets, and we shall want to be sure that 
everyone is not only improving performance, but also that 
the measures necessary to deliver the right performance 
are in place.
<P>
I was about to speak about other countries in the 
European Union. The majority of those countries have 
some right to interest on late payment, the exceptions 
being Ireland, Greece and, for the moment, the United 
Kingdom. The latest times show that the average time for 
overdue domestic payments is 14 days in the European 
Union and 18 days in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> While I accept those figures, they all start 
at a different base line. That is an aspect of what worries 
the Opposition that the provisions will result in longer 
credit terms than exist now being established in this 
country.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I do not accept that, and I hope to reassure 
the hon. Gentleman, as we study the Bill closely, that it 
is not true. An interesting article in The Times today 
examines recent Intrum Justitia research claiming that 
small companies wait 50 per cent. longer than larger 
companies for their money. That throws an interesting 
light on our discussions about late payment and its 
disproportionate effect on small companies.



<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I am sorry to keep bobbing up and down, 
but as I mentioned, some of the figures produced are, if 
not suspect, then potentially misleading. If several large 
companies supply small companies and hit them with 
direct debits, a distorting effect is introduced to the 
statistics. I do not think that that is properly taken into 
consideration.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The Bill does not, I assure the hon. 
Gentleman, alter the existing trade customs that are well 
understood by customers and suppliers in commerce. The 
Bill mitigates late payment. I shall try to assist the hon. 
Gentleman later when we reach the relevant amendments.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I want to pursue the European statistics 
that the Minister gave. Incidentally, I had a meeting with 
Intrum Justitia and found its information useful and 
helpful. However, is the Minister aware that in Spain 
monthly invoices are commonly covered by bills of 
exchange, whereby, as the Library paper says, the right to 
claim payment of a future debt is sold in advance? As I 
have mentioned before, in France the standard terms of 
business are 90 days. The comparisons that the hon. Lady 
draws are superficial and, on examination of the statistics 
and the details of common practice in European countries, 
they prove not to be entirely accurate.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> There is a misunderstanding on the part 
of the hon. Lady. We are concerned with late payment. Of 
course different contract terms apply, not only as between 
countries but as between different sectors. The right hon. 
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was right to 
mention sectoral variations relating to payment 
considerations. One example from this country concerns 
the Christmas card industry which I almost hate to 
mention, as it stirs memories of those cards that we take 
pleasure in sending out. In that industry very long 
payment times are established by custom. We, however, 
are concerned with late payment, not payment periods.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> While I appreciate that the hon. Lady is 
defining a legal position, would not it be better for a small 
business to be paid in 56 days in the United Kingdom and 
be well over the contract period than to be paid in
105 days in Italy or France and be only 15 days over the 
contract period? As someone with a little responsibility 
for maintaining cash flow in a small business context, I 
would rather be paid a certain number of days late in the 
United Kingdom than late in Italy.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the hon. Gentlemen's point, 
but first I do not accept that longer payment periods will 
result from the measure; and secondly, small businesses 
want certainty. They want to know when they will be 
paid, and an end to late payment.
<P>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked 
what else the Government are doing. I have already 
mentioned league tables. The Department of Trade and 
Industry is publishing a free credit management guide to 
ensure that small businesses have access to the best 
possible advice. We are supporting a national vocational 
qualification in credit management and are using the 
newly created enterprise zone, comprising new 
technology and the business network, to ensure that we 
get our message through.
<P>
Mention was made earlier of the Better Payment 
Practice Group, which comprises business representative 
organisations. I am proud of its establishment. It is 
playing an invaluable part in dealing with the culture of 
late payment and is providing practical solutions. The 
right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked 
whether businesses would be too worried about losing a 
customer to exercise their right to claim interest. That is 
a fair point. The right is automatic, but whether to go 
to court to enforce it is purely at the discretion of the 
small business.



<P>
It does not make commercial sense for a business to 
drop a supplier because it had made a claim for interest. 
Businesses understand the value of good suppliers. They 
know that it is administratively time-consuming and 
expensive to replace suppliers. Rather than drop their 
suppliers, I think that they will make sure that their 
accounting procedures are right to ensure that their bills 
are paid on time. The relationship between small and large 
firms is interesting. Large firms are coming round to the 
idea that a statutory right to interest is importance, hence 
the value of the banking survey from which I quoted 
earlier. It showed that finance directors in large companies 
support the Bill. It is in the interests of such businesses to 
make sure that they have a good and effective supply 
chain.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst 
mentioned variation of terms. Clauses 8 and 9 deal with 
substantial remedies. He referred also to disputes about 
quality, quantity and times of delivery. Discussions will 
not prevent time running against the debtor if the creditor 
had substantially performed his side of the contract.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> That is the case, but the key issue is who 
makes the judgment. Traditionally, the customer makes a 
judgment about whether the goods or services supplied 
are fit for the purpose and are of the appropriate quality. 
therein has always lain the problem, as the customer 
decides when the payment should be made. There is a link 
between that and any pronouncement on fitness of quality. 
there could be a temptation I put it no more strongly 
than that for people to start judging more harshly if they 
believe that the mechanisms under the Bill are being used 
to excess.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I understand the right hon. Gentleman's 
point. If the creditor is at fault, that is why interest can be 
remitted under clause 5. We have thought of such issues. 
At times, there are disputes between the parties. One hopes 
that they can be resolved in the normal course of business 
dealings, but if not, as ever there is the remedy of the 
courts. During our discussions we have talked and 
rightly so about court procedure. I understand the issues 
that have been raised by members of the Committee about 
the court process. As I am sure the Committee is aware, 
the Lord Chancellor is undertaking a major reform of 
access to justice. I understand that part of the intention of 
those reforms is to expedite judgments through, for 
example, fast-track and multi-track procedures. Such 
developments will be important for this Bill.

<p>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire asked 
about the proposed European directive on late payment. I 
understand that the Commission has made a presentation 
to Ministers, but the recently published directive has not 
yet been discussed by member states. At this stage, we 
do not believe that a second tranche of legislation will 
prove necessary.
<P>
<H5>5 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire also 
mentioned retention of title. I understand his argument 
that the harmonisation of retention of title clauses will be 
difficult. That said, the Bill can apply to retention of title 
clauses. That will have to be discussed as the process 
continues.
<P>
The Bill provides a statutory right to claim interest on 
late payment; clause 1 is important in that and is an 
essential part of the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I was waiting until the Minister was 
closing, because I should like to make another point. I 
should like to take the Minister back to the listings of 
Government Departments, and crave her indulgence while 
I ask her about them. When she publishes tables of 
Government Departments' performance, will she also 
publish details of contracts in which invoices have been 
cancelled and re-issued, thereby obfuscating the late 
payment of a debt? I understand from my inquiries that 
in some Government Departments and agencies, in order 
to avoid the appearance of a late payment invoices are 
cancelled for one reason or another and re-issued. Will 
she assure the Committee that she will examine the 
practice and ensure that it is either prohibited or clearly 
shown in the records of Government agencies and 
Departments? It would be some comfort to know that 
there was no danger of late payment being obfuscated by 
Government Departments or agencies.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady's allegation is serious. If 
she has any evidence, I urge her to send it to me. I assure 
the Committee that I shall examine the matter in detail.
<P>
The clause provides that it be an implied term of any 
contract to which the Bill applies that any qualifying debt 
created by the contract carries simple interest on late 
payment. The remainder of the Bill details the application 
and extent of the right to interest.

<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page </B><P>
1, leave out from the beginning of line 21 to the end of 
line 10 on page 2 and insert 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(2) In this Act "contract for the supply of goods or services"	 
means 
<P>
(a) a contract of sale of goods; or
<P>
(b) a contract (other than a contract of sale of goods) by which 
a person does any, or any combination, of the things 
mentioned in subsection (3) for a consideration that is (or 
includes) a money consideration.
<P>
(3) Those things are 
<P>
(a) transferring or agreeing to transfer to another the property 
in goods;
<P>
(b) bailing or agreeing to bail goods to another by way of hire 
or, in Scotland, hiring or agreeing to hire goods to 
another; and
<P>
(c) agreeing to carry out a service.
<P>
(4) For the avoidance of doubt a contract of service or 
apprenticeship is not a contract for the supply of goods or services.
<P>
(5) The following are excepted contracts 
<P>
(a) a consumer credit agreement;
<P>
(b) a contract intended to operate by way of mortgage, pledge, 
charge or other security; and
<P>
(c) a contract of a description specified in an order made by 
the Secretary of State.
<P>
(6) An order under subsection (5)(c) may specify a description 
of contract by reference to any feature of the contract (including 
the parties).
<P>
(7) In this section 
<P>
"business"	 includes a profession and the activities of any 
government department or local or public authority;
<P>
"consumer credit agreement"	 has the same meaning as in the 
Consumer Credit Act 1974;
<P>
"contract of sale of goods"	 and "goods"	 have the same meaning 
as in the Sale of Goods Act 1979;
<P>
"property in goods"	 means the general property in them and 
not merely a special property'.
<P>
</UL></FONT><B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take 
Government amendments Nos. 10 to 12.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> Amendment No. 8 is a technical 
amendment; the others in the group are consequential. The 
changes ensure that the Bill covers contracts that are part 
service provision and part supply of goods. We had relied 
on the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 for our 
definition of "contract for the transfer of goods"	 and 
"contract for the hire of goods"	. After further 
consideration, we concluded that the 1982 Act did not 
foresee the possibility that a contract might be for the 
supply of a good and the provision of a service. It is easy 
for me with the hindsight of 1998 to look back on 1982 
although the Government whom I have the honour to 
represent were not in power then. We considered that as 
the definition in that Act was not fit for our purpose, we 
would use a phrase from other legislation.
{**fc<p4**}The amendment makes it clear that the Bill will cover  such contracts. It also makes it clear that the Bill will  cover contracts where the consideration is part money and  part something else. Of course, only the money element  of the consideration will bear the interest. That principle  is already enshrined in clause 2(3)(a), but it is important  that the Bill should be as transparent as we can make it,  and we have seized the opportunity to do so. <P>
Amendment No. 12 will revise clause 16, which 
provides definitions of terms used in the Bill, in the light 
of the other amendments to clause 2. The definitions will 
be more free standing and less dependent on other Acts, 
which makes for clarity. Amendment No. 10 to clause 4 
and amendment No. 11 to clause 11 reflect the fact that 
the term "a contract for hire of goods"	 is no longer 
defined in the Bill. Although the amendments are lengthy, 
their effect is technical; they help to clarify the extent of 
the Bill, and I hope that I have persuaded the Committee 
to accept them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I must express great surprise that, after 
12 months in government, the Minister is moving such 
amendments at this late stage. The Bill has been through 
the hoop it has been consulted on, it has been through 
the House of Lords and the Minister has trumpeted it from 
pillar to post, yet the Government are now moving 
substantial amendments to it in Committee.



<P>
As the Minister's noble Friend, Lord Clinton-Davies, 
went to some pains to point out in the other place, the 
Government have at their disposal drafting facilities that 
far exceed anything available to the Opposition, yet four 
Government amendments have been moved at the 11th 
hour.
<P>
The Minister says that these are technical amendments, 
so we need not bother our little heads about them. She is 
suggesting that this major re-writing of a major part of 
the clause is merely technical. In fact, the Government 
had to go back to the drawing board because the difficulty 
of relying on the 1982 Act had been pointed out to them. 
The history of this raft of amendments is that the detail 
has not been given due care and attention in the 
Department.
<P>
I shall not oppose the amendments because I 
understand the difficulties that the Minister has faced; it 
is tricky to consider all the circumstances that such 
definitions must cover. However, it is not unreasonable to 
expect the Bill to be more accurately drafted after such a 
long gestation.
<P>
The Forum for Private Business, which has been 
mentioned many times, agrees that the amendments are 
intended to clarify the definitions and to make the 
necessary consequential drafting changes and that, 
therefore, they should be supported. Who am I to disagree 
with the forum on this subject?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The hon. Lady is not agreeing with the 
forum.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister suggests that I am 
disagreeing with the forum, but I am not; I am merely 
saying that it is rather dilatory of the Minister and the 
Department to move such a large raft of amendments at 
such a late stage.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mr. John M. Taylor: They have almost rewritten it.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> As my hon. Friend says, the Government 
have almost written the clause. However, I shall ask the 
Minister a few questions because I want to hear her 
opinion of how a couple of examples will be treated under 
the Bill. I know that the Minister was a barrister in another 
life before she came to the House. She was very 
successful.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> A very distinguished barrister.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> As my right hon. Friend says, she was a 
very distinguished barrister. However, I am sure that she 
did not get her hands dirty I hope that she will forgive 
the expression by working out invoices that were sent 
to the solicitors' firms and individuals for whom she 
acted. A clerk would have done that for her. Therefore, I 
think that it would be fair to say and I would not cast 
aspersions on the Minister's expertise that she has 
limited experience of business.
<P>
By contrast, I have spent most of my career working in 
business. I have an understanding of the complexity of 
commerce and what can arise. I wish to draw on two areas 
of my life before I entered the House for examples, and 
to ask the Minister's opinion on those examples.
<P>
For many years I had the privilege of working for the 
International Management Group, a company run by 
Mark McCormack. It provided services to tennis players 
and to golfers. It arranged golf tournaments and tennis 
tournaments and initiated the Gatcombe horse trials.
<P>
When I joined the company, only 18 people worked in 
its London office. IMG went on to expand, and eight years 
after I joined more than 100 people worked in the London 
office. The operation extended beyond the United States 
into Japan, Australia and many other areas. However, it 
began as a very small business.



<P>
The Minister may appreciate that sponsorship deals are 
involved in golf tournaments, tennis and other sporting 
events. Those deals do not always involve money. I am 
thinking of a commercial contract in which sponsorship 
of a golf or tennis tournament was paid for by a barter 
arrangement. The arrangement was to provide a number 
of airline tickets in return for sponsorship and to provide 
a certain number of airline staff to work at the tournament. 
That is fairly common practice: it is not unique.
<P>
I draw on my own experience because I was keenly 
aware of such contracts. The Minister knows that similar 
contracts are prevalent in dealing with eastern European 
countries. Some money may change hands, but bartering 
arrangements may also be made. Indeed, I know of a 
company that was paid in tins of pilchards for work that 
it did in an eastern European country.
<P>
Let us suppose that an airline fails to provide the 
necessary number of staff to look after a golf or tennis 
tournament. Alternatively, let us suppose that the airline 
provides the staff, but that they do not work at the rate or 
for the hours expected of them, and so do not fulfil the 
anticipated value of the contract. What would happen if 
airline tickets are unavailable when IMG wants to use 
them?
<P>
How does the Minister interpret the remedy that she 
proposes to extend to business in the Bill? Will the Bill 
ban the transactions that I have described, or will it be 
possible to work out the equivalent financial values of 
such arrangements so that they fall within the ambit of the 
Bill? Hybrid commercial contracts permit airline tickets to 
be passed on to other parties. The Minister looks puzzled, 
but I can assure her that such deals happen in the 
commercial world.
<P>
The Bill deals with commercial debt. The Library has 
defined commercial debt as any debt incurred by business, 
in return for the provision of goods and/or services, where 
both the creditor and the debtor are acting in the course 
of their business. The scenario that I have outlined 
certainly falls within the ambit of that definition: if 
companies or individuals are contracting, they fall within 
the meaning of commercial debt.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I was reminding hon. Members of a fairly 
complex commercial transaction that was not uncommon 
in the company that I used to work for the International 
Management Group albeit several years ago.
<P>
I believe that I had covered the definition of 
commercial debt, as outlined in the Library research 
paper. We were going on to discuss the details in the 
amendment proposed by the Minister at the 11th hour. 
Amendment No. 8, subsection (2) (b), states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a contract (other than a contract of sale of goods) by which a person 
does any, or any combination, of the things mentioned in subsection 
(3) for a consideration that is (or includes) a money consideration."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, subsection (3) (a) mentions the
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"transferring or agreeing to transfer to another the property in 
goods"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and (c) deals with
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"agreeing to carry out a service."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In the case that I outlined, there would appear to be a 
failure of the first test because there is no money 
consideration. However, the provision of airline tickets, 
which are worth money and the barter arrangements under 
which the tickets are set against a sum of money, are very 
ambiguous. The staff who were provided by the 
sponsorship company may or may not have performed to 
the level that was expected by the other contracting 
company. I appreciate that that is complicated, but I 
would welcome the Ministers's interruption, because real 
life is more complicated than those drafting legislation 
would expect.
<P>
Firms are relying increasingly on freelance contracts 
and not employing permanent members of staff. They 
bring in staff from time to time and the consideration need 
not necessarily be money based; the staff could receive 
services in kind or a reduced rate for the arrangement. 
That applies especially in places such as livery stables. If 
a livery stable wanted to take on a young person to help 
with the grooming and maintenance of its horses, the 
young person may be paid in free livery for her horse or 
in free hay, but she may also receive a small amount of 
money for travelling expenses to and from the stables. I 
would welcome the Minister's opinion of what would be 
the situation under the Bill if there were a failure of part 
of that contract.
<P>
I have been given an operational flow chart on the 
application of the Act. It is an extremely interesting 
document; to decide whether the Act applies one must ask 
a number of questions. First, one must ask whether the 
contract predates the coming into force of the Act. 
Obviously, if the answer is yes, the Act does not apply 
and if its is no, one can work one's way through it. One 
must ask whether the contract is of a type to which the Act 
applies. If the contract is for the supply of goods either by 
transfer or hire or for services the answer is no, the Act 
does not apply; if the answer is yes, we move on. If the 
answer to the question are the parties each acting in the 
Course of business is no, the Act does not apply; if it is 
yes the act does apply. In both examples, the parties 
would be acting in the course of business. If there is a 
monetary price, the Act does not apply. I am interested in 
one interpretation of that monetary price, and I hope that 
the Minister will explain.
<P>

<P>
I shall continue with the flow chart, for the sake of 
obtaining a complete picture. If the contract is a consumer 
credit agreement, conditional sale agreement or a hire 
purchase agreement as defined under the Consumer Credit 
Act 1974, the Act does not apply; if it is not, one should 
ask whether the contract is intended to operate by way of 
a security, such as a mortgage pledge, charge or other 
security. If the answer is yes the Act does not apply. 
However, if the answer is no, we come to the final 
question on the operational flow chart, which is whether 
the contract is an accepted contract by virtue of section 
2? If the answer is no, the Act applies; if the answer is 
yes, the Act does not apply.
<P>
I am grateful to you, Miss Widdecombe, for allowing 
me to give those examples. I have no intention of 
opposing the Government amendments, but I would like 
the Minister to consider those examples and perhaps 
suggest others, and to explain how those definitions will 
operate in the real commercial world.



<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> I share my hon. Friend's shock and horror 
at the raft of definition changes, which have been 
produced at such a late stage. It is a worry to the 
Opposition it should be a worry to Labour Members 
that the Bill may not have been given the thorough 
scrutiny that it deserved when it was drafted.
<P>
It could be a tremendous temptation for an innocent 
such as myself to spend a considerable amount of time 
delving into those changes and speculating what their 
effect might be, and how they would operate. It would be 
well within the rules of order to investigate thoroughly 
the possible effects of every one of those definitions. 
However, that would not only stretch the Committee's and 
your patience, Miss Widdecombe, but also my ingenuity, 
so I do not propose to do so. However, it seems a sensible 
way to cut through a series of corners, to come directly 
to the heart of the matter and to question the Minister.
<P>
As the Minister knows, certain legal rights affect the 
purchase of goods by credit cards. If a purchaser defaults 
or decides not to pay because the fitness of purpose of the 
goods is queried, or if it is believed that the goods are 
otherwise unsatisfactory, the obligation to pay falls on the 
credit card company. Those definitions include
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a contract of a sale of goods"	,
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"agreeing to transfer to another the property in goods"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Do any of those definitions have any effect on how credit 
cards operate?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> My admiration for the hon. Member for 
Chesham and Amersham is now absolutely boundless. I 
came here today, innocently proposing some technical 
amendments to assist the Committee; I am astonished at 
the hon. Lady's reaction. If I was going to be facetious 
I should not want to be, Miss Widdecombe, under your 
fair but firm chairmanship I would say that the hon. 
Lady has not put up a smoke screen but thrown up a red 
herring.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillian:</B> Pilchards?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> As a Roche, I feel quite able to speak 
about red herrings, but I am shocked and astounded that 
my officials have not briefed me fully on pilchards. The 
Committee may rest assured that I will take every effort 
to remedy that.



<P>
It also astonished me that the hon. Lady appears to have 
suffered a deep memory loss concerning the record of the 
previous Government. I am sure that the committee will 
offer her our deepest condolences. I remember that even 
during my short period in opposition, we were presented 
by the then Government with raft after raft of legislation.
<P>
I return to the amendments, which are narrow and 
technical. They have nothing to do with consumer credit; 
they are about the definition of which contracts are 
covered. In law, interest runs on money considerations; it 
does not operate on non-cash items for a good reason. 
If we consider the example of airline tickets given by the 
hon. Lady, given the consideration that they are not 
money, they may be valueless after a time for example, 
after the plane has taken off.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister has not fully understood my 
example. Perhaps, because we were interrupted by a 
Division in the House, I was remiss in not giving her a 
full explanation. I was outlining a scenario in which a 
cash sum of, say £10,000 was set up, against which one 
could run airline tickets, knocking the total off the 
£10,000. Therefore there is a cash consideration per se, 
though it is taken in airline tickets. If it is not fully taken 
up, the balance may be remitted in money. that is a hybrid 
situation, which is why I am asking for the Minister's 
opinion so that the Committee's proceedings can be 
examined and taken into account when interpreting the 
Bill, so that the matter is quite clear.
<P>
Let me make it clear that a cash sum is involved the 
amount against which the tickets are run, or any amount 
that may be left over. If there were a default on payment 
of that sum, would interest be chargeable on the full 
£10,000, or on part of the £10,000?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> That depends on the consideration. As I 
said earlier, we have taken the opportunity of the
amendment to make it clear that contracts in which the 
consideration is part money and part something else will 
be covered by the Bill. Of course, only the money element 
of the consideration will bear the interest whatever the 
money element is.
<P>
The hon. Lady gave another example of a young person 
in a livery stable. The Bill does not apply to contracts of 
service or of apprenticeship. For the Bill to apply, it must 
be shown that the young man or woman supplies the 
service in the course of running a business.
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire raised 
the question of credit cards. Of course, purchasers have 
rights under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to enforce 
damage against suppliers against credit card 
companies but consumer credit is not covered under the 
Bill, as you will know, Miss Widdecombe, and I will not 
be tempted down that path.
<P>
The amendments are technical, and I urge the 
Committee to support them.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am not satisfied with the Minister's 
response: She has not taken on board the commercial 
examples that I set out. She has sought to hide behind the 
obvious nature of the Bill that it does not apply to 
contracts of apprenticeship. It is really rather sad that 
because I talked about a young person the Minister 
assumed that I was talking about an apprentice. A young 
person may be fully qualified and working in a situation 
at a livery stables. She has failed to address the question 
of travelling expenses that I raised.
<P>
The Opposition have scrutinised the technical 
amendments that the Minister introduced in an almost 
derisory fashion. We have not yet heard from the serried 
ranks of the Labour party; they remain as mute as ever. 
The Minister failed to provide the necessary answers. 
People outside the Committee who examine the Minister's 
performance will realise that she did not fully understand 
the amendments and that she is not prepared to make the 
judgments for which I asked. That is rather sad. People in 
the commercial world expect to operate in an environment 
of certainty The Minister used similar words. But from 
her failure to respond to two simple examples, business 
will realise that she has not fully understood the Bill's 
impact.



<P>
<H5>5.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I said that I would not vote against the amendments. 
However, I am thinking hard about it. We are in a sorry 
state when a Minister comes to a Committee at the 11th 
hour to present some fundamental changes to a measure, 
but is unable to interpret them when she is asked what 
they mean. That is also surprising, because the Minister 
has flogged the Bill to death. Yet there is a lack of 
understanding about the measure, and business will be 
unsure of the effect of the new amendments on business 
transactions.

<P>

<B>Mr. Page:</B> May I make the minor point that the 
Minister is beginning to back down from her initial 
enthusiasm for the Bill as the cure-all for late payment 
and bad debt? She now rightly accepts that it is a small 
part in a raft of measures that are necessary to help the 
small business man or woman pay debts on time. It is 
dangerous for the Committee to send a message that the 
statutory right of interest will ensure that all late payments 
and bad practices will suddenly be swept away. The 
Minister appreciates that as she examines the detail of 
the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> My hon. Friend is right. It has been 
obvious to Conservative Members for a long time that the 
measure is part of a charm offensive the Minister is very 
charming. As I said on Second Reading, many prawns 
were culled 
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> Pilchards.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> My right hon. Friend has stolen my line. 
Pilchards are now on the table.
<P>
The way in which the Minister's tone has changed in 
the past few days is amazing. She now claims that the Bill 
is not a panacea, that it is part of a raft of measures and 
that it is not the be all and end all. By the end of our 
proceedings, I am sure, the Minister will have had second 
thoughts about the Bill. Back pedalling is occurring at an 
accelerated rate.
<P>
I am worried by the Minister's failure to give an 
opinion on two live commercial examples. The business 
world is a complex place, in which the Minister has not 
lived. Her lack of experience means that she may not have 
probed or asked the right questions. Many other 
commercial arrangements may fall within the ambit of the 
new set of qualifications that the amendments contains. 
The Bill may be found wanting.
<P>
I have been thinking while speaking; I shall not oppose 
the amendments because I am not churlish. However, I 
hope that the Minister will take seriously the matters that 
I raised, and that she will consider the examples that I 
gave and at least show the business world that she has 
done some modelling of scenes and circumstances in 
business that the Bill might affect.



<P>
Now that we have seen this raft of Government 
amendments, I expect that we shall see more later. The 
Government have amended the Bill throughout its passage 
through both Houses, so we can expect further 
Government amendments. It has been a one-sided 
discussion. I hope that the Minister will return to her 
Department to do some homework.

2, line 39, at the end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or may be otherwise agreed in accordance with the provisions of 
section 16(2) of this Act."</UL></FONT>	
<P>
We have just made rapid progress. The amendment 
would ensure that the Bill's concept of a default credit 
period accurately reflects sector practice in the real 
business world. After our last debate, the Minister will 
understand why I keep dragging her back to the real world 
of business.
<P>
I am sure that the Minister is aware that it is common 
practice in some sectors for the terms to be 30 days from 
the end of the month rather than 30 days from the date of 
the invoice. I hope that she will consider my arguments 
sympathetically, particularly as some of the examples to 
which I shall refer are in the manufacturing sector. We all 
feel sorry for manufacturing industry because it feels that 
it is under attack from the Government and has officially 
entered recession this week. Conservative Members regret 
that greatly, but it does not appear to concern the 
Government.
<P>
A few weeks ago I was in Birmingham for MAC 98, 
the machine tools exhibition, but the Minister's colleague 
in the Department of Trade and Industry failed to turn in 
an appearance. He arrived in a car, took one stop out of 
the car and was called back by the Chief Whip. Without 
so much as a by your leave, he returned to the House 
without making an appearance at an important 
manufacturing exhibition that was held not far from the 
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I might be wrong, but I think that my hon. 
Friend the Minister of State was called back to answer a 
private notice question in the House. I am sure that the 
hon. Lady will agree that Ministers have a duty to the 
House.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister has pre-empted what I was 
about to say. The Minister of State was recalled to the 
House. Sadly, four ex-Ministers are on the Opposition 
Benches 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I remind the Committee that 
we are debating amendment No. 2. Will the hon. Lady 
direct her remarks to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I appreciate your admonition,
Miss Widdecombe, and I will try to keep my remarks in 
order. I am sure that you will pull me up if I stray a 
little far.
<P>
My remarks were particularly pertinent to amendment 
No. 2, as it applies to the manufacturing industry. 
However, as the Minister intervened with specific 
reference to the part of manufacturing industry that I was 
discussing, I felt duty bound to agree about the reasons 
that her colleague had been called back, despite our 
knowledge that another Minister would usually be sent.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> To ensure that my hon. Friend gives 
acknowledgement where it is due, I should mention that 
the Minister did have a stand in; the hon. Member for 
Ochil (Mr. O'Neill) delivered the Minister's speech to the 
assembled manufacturers, and it was also received.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for his 
intervention. On the day that I attended the manufacturing 
conference, we received a visit from the Paymaster 
General, who was two hours late.
<P>
<B></B><P>
The Chairman: Order. The peregrinations of Ministers 
are not the concern of the Committee. I must ask the hon. 
Lady to address her remarks to her amendment.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I feel that I am incurring your wrath, miss 
Widdecombe, and I should not want to do that, so I turn 
back to the subject of the manufacturing industry.
<P>
That industry feels that it is under attack from the 
Government, not least because of the strength of the 
pound, which is affecting exports. Companies have been 
hurting badly, as the manufacturing industry has gone into 
recession. I hope that the amendment will avert another 
problem for the industry.



<P>
In some areas of manufacturing, contracts do not 
include written terms, on the assumption that those will 
be determined by the sector custom of 30 days from the 
end of the month. I am grateful to Matthew Farrow, the 
head of the SME unit at the Confederation of British 
Industry, who has done some research for me on the 
subject. He wrote to me:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Further to our conversation this morning you may find useful 
some figures from a CBI survey on late payment which asked about 
standard payment terms. Although the figures are now a little 
dated"	 
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
but I think that that is fair enough 
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"we find in a 1994 survey of our SME members that 68 per cent. 
of manufacturing SMEs had `30 days from the end of the month' 
as their standard terms. This proportion had not changed markedly 
over time."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Mr. Farrow also made some inquiries of real businesses 
on a real-time basis. One member a small company 
making equipment for the mining industry confirmed 
that in its sector 30 days from the end of the month was 
the standard term.
<P>
Many companies feel strongly about the issue, since if 
an invoice is dated the 10th of the month and is paid on 
the 20th of the following month, the customer, in 
accordance with normal practice, assumes that payment is 
being made on time. If I had set up an arrangement with 
my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and 
Chislehurst and he had sent me an invoice on 6 April, he 
would know that he would not be paid until the end of 
May. He would assume that he would be paid on time, 
and I would assume that he would pay me on time. I hope 
that the Minister would endorse that state of affairs.
<P>
From a superficial reading of the Bill it appears that 
under that arrangement the customer would be paying 
late. I am sure that the Minister does not want to 
encourage a flurry of court cases over the matter. The Bill 
could have counterproductive effects if that route were 
followed. The amendment seeks to make it crystal clear 
that trade customs will take precedence.



<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
While I am on my feet, I am quite keen to explore some 
other scenarios. In order to bring this matter closer to 
home so that the Minister is not so bemused, I have 
decided to ask her about payment practices in the House 
of Commons. That is something that I feel she will 
understand. If I put in a bill after the 11th of the month 
for payment to my staff, they are not paid until the end 
of the following month. I am sure that she is familiar with 
this. I have not checked with my hon. Friends because I 
did my own research, but that is what happens in the 
House of Commons.
<P>
Does the Minister condone that? Will she support this 
payment practice or will she condemn it? She has a 
dilemma with the Bill as it stands if she agrees that 
commercial payment practices should take precedence. If 
I pay a member of my staff in cash so that they do not 
have to wait for the payment, am I entitled to charge 
interest of the Fees Office? What happens if I

<B>Ms Hewitt:</B> The hon. Member for Chesham and 
Amersham will be aware that the she chose a bad example 
because the Fees Office will not reimburse cash payments 
from a Member of the House to a member of his or her 
staff. I also wondered whether the hon. Lady had read 
subsection (3), which clearly states:
<P>
"Where the supplier and the purchaser agree a date for 
payment of the debtthat is the relevant day"	 for the 
calculation of interest on the late payment of any debt. In 
the case of most contracts of employment, including the 
contracts of Members of Parliament, a date is specified 
for the payment of salary. In the case of my staff and the 
staff of most Members of the House, the date is at the end 
of the month and it is clear that although payments may 
be in arrears, the date laid down in the contract is the 
relevant date for the purposes of the clause.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Well, what a joy to have an intervention 
from a Labour Back Bencher! It has taken us several 
hours to reach this point and I congratulate the hon. 
Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt). I am surprised 
that she did not contribute to the Committee's debate 
earlier, not least because she was once head of research 
at Andersen Consulting: if she bothered to read my 
biography, she would know that I spent part of my career 
with Ernst and Young the opposition.
<P>
I apologise for my slip of the tongue in using the word 
"cash"	 but it is perfectly in order for a Member of 
Parliament to pay a bill with a cheque and to submit that 
bill for reimbursement by the Fees Office. I was using the 
vernacular, Miss Widdecombe, which is unfortunate. The 
hon. Member for Leicester, West was hot on the trail, but, 
sadly, she only endorsed late payment to people who 
supply goods and services to Members of Parliament. 
That is effectively what the hon. Lady was arguing and it 
is a sorry day [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order on the Government Benches.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I have finally got them going. For one 
moment I thought that they were bored to death but now 
I know that they are alive and are starting to take an 
interest in our proceedings.
<P>
The Minister is on the horns of a dilemma. It is 
important to observe normal commercial payment 
practices in industry. However, in the House of 
Commons, for example, it often transpires that suppliers 
of goods and services to Members of Parliament are paid 
outwith the 30 days. We all know that the Fees Office 
takes some time to get round to paying bills.
<P>
Let me provide another example. We know that some 
members of the Committee have not been here for long 
and that many on the Government Benches are sitting on 
their first Committee considering a Bill. That may account 
for their shyness and for the fact that they are not 
forthcoming with comments. They may use a good 
company, as I do, called Palace Computing, a first-class 
supplier of computer services to Members of Parliament. 
It is a small business comprising, now that if has 
employed another member of staff, three people.






<P>
I lost in the computer some notes that I was typing 
up about a later amendment. I can see that Government 
Members are pleased about me losing my notes on a 
forthcoming amendment. Yet Palace Computing sent 
someone to investigate my computer within 10 minutes. 
That is first class. The person who was sent asked me 
what the notes were and I replied, "They were notes on 
the late payment of debts Bill."	 He said, "Well, sometimes 
we find our bills to the Fees Office are overdue. From 
time to time there are big delays."	 The Minister will admit 
that for a business that has only three people it was two 
people until a third member of staff was taken on 
recently that can make a great difference to its cash 
flow.
<P>
The Minister is in a dilemma: I am sure she will be 
sympathetic to the manufacturing examples that I will 
give later, but if so, what will she do about the situation 
in the House of Commons? Will she be sympathetic to 
that situation or will she consider that late payment to 
people who provide services to Members is unacceptable. 
I shall be interested in the Minister's reply.
<P>
In the course of preparation for the Bill, hon. Members 
on both sides of the House, and the Minister, have readily 
acknowledged the help given to us by outside 
organisations. The Small Business Bureau is a first-class 
organisation; the director of policy also gave some advice. 
I want the Minister to consider some thoughts from the 
SBB about what is happening in the business world, 
because too often we follow our esoteric arguments in the 
House and forget what happens to real businesses. Most 
sizeable businesses are now computerised; I am sure that 
the hon. Lady's private office is computerised, as mine is. 
Usually, suppliers' invoices will bear the same date as the 
delivery note; the invoice and the delivery note will then 
be checked against orders and married up before being 
entered on to the computerised system. Some systems will 
enter invoices and delivery notes separately, but they will 
ensure that they are married up with one another and with 
the order before payment is made.
<P>
Accounting departments' procedures, as every member 
of the Committee who has worked in a real business 
knows, have to be regimented. For example, invoice A, 
dated 15 December is posted to a purchase ledger by
30 December. Invoice B, dated 30 December, is posted to 
a purchase ledger by 8 January. The client purchase ledger 
closed for December, therefore both invoices were 
included. But due to the work load, an accounts 
department payment is normally made in week three of a 
working month. The consequence is that invoice A is paid 
at least a week late, and invoice B is paid one week early 
or, as it is not due under the 30-day rule, is ultimately 
paid late in the third week of February. Purchasers 
therefore arrange contractual terms with suppliers to suit 
accounting procedures. That is most likely to be 60 days, 
which does nothing to improve payment the very 
argument that we advanced in earlier amendments. 
Purchasers will only view small suppliers who agree to 
the said terms 
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I ask the hon. Member for 
Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) if his reading material 
is relevant to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Hutton (Barrow and Furness):</B> Some of it is 
relevant, Miss Widdecombe.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> On the understanding that it is 
relevant, the hon. Member may continue to read it. Hon. 
Members may not normally read books or newspapers in 
the Committee unless they are directly relevant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Forth:</B> We want to see it later!
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I mentioned earlier that it was the first 
Committee for the majority of Back Bench Members, who 
would thus have an excuse for reading. But the hon. 
Gentleman has been in the House as long as I have. I was 
not aware that I was boring everyone so rigid that they 
needed to resort to reading material that is not relevant to 
the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I indicated to the Chairman that what I 
am reading is relevant to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> Part of what the hon. Gentleman is 
reading is relevant.
<P>
These accounting procedures, which are common 
practice in business, will cause a shift to, perhaps, 60 
days, to accommodate the Bill. What I really want from 
the Minister is an assurance that she has thought through 
the accounting procedures. She had three examples; I 
know that she will argue that the legal advisers have told 
her that the Bill as drafted will prevent some of the 
scenarios that I have discussed from happening.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Janet Dean (Burton):</B> Is the hon. Lady aware that 
the Forum of Private Business believes that the Bill is 
already sufficiently clear on that point? Earlier, she quoted 
what the forum has said.
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Gillan: I am delighted that there is more life on 
the Government Back Benches. The hon. Lady must 
remember that I must take advice from all the 
organisations that represent small businesses I do not 
wish to be accused of being in the pocket of one 
organisation. While I will use examples from the forum, 
I shall use examples from the SBB, the FSB, the IOD or 
the CBI. I am an open, fair-minded individual and my 
role in Committee is to advance the arguments of such 
organisations and to probe the Minister's thinking before 
the Bill reaches the statute book.
<P>
<H5>6.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
The legal experts who advise the CBI are not satisfied 
with the Government's assurances and believe that it 
would be wise to strengthen the Bill to make the matter 
clear beyond doubt. That is why we tabled the amendment 
and why I have spoken to it at length. Many issues under 
the clause need to be addressed by the Minister and I shall 
listen carefully to her reply before I decide whether to 
push the amendment to a Division.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> My hon. Friend started her speech on the 
amendment by saying that she wanted the Bill to reflect 
business practice; hence, my wish to clarify the position 
and we could all say "Amen to that"	. Invoicing, the 
issuing of statements and credit control is a variable 
science; it is flexible operation. I shall not describe such 
matters as chaos, although some people may think that 
that is a more apt word to use. Companies do not present a 
uniform way in which their credit control system operates.
<P>
On Second Reading. I cited several examples of 
companies and quoted the famous issue of 30 days. 
Recently, however, I have been paying more attention to 
it and I noticed that I received an invoice that stated: 
"Payment within 30 days"	. The other day I received one 
stating: "Invoice/statement, payment within 30 days"	. A 
few weeks later I purchased more goods from that 
company and I received a notification that stated: 
"Invoice/statement within 30 days"	 and it did not carry 
forward the original item that I had purchased. Such 
events make me wonder how the system will operate.
<P>
My hon. Friend used the Fees Office as a particular 
example. By chance, my account from the Refreshment 
Department arrived this morning. I shall not make 
members of the Committee jealous by running through 
the details of the delicacies that I have consumed in the 
House of Commons at vast expense, but I draw to their 
attention the unusual notification that stated: "14 days 
from the statement due"	. That is another variation.
<P>
The statutory right of interest will not apply to the 
individual bills of Members of Parliament because their 
debts will not be commercial. How will the system 
operate when we allow an event to be sponsored and the 
debt is incurred by a commercial organisation? It would 
be interesting to know what the Government's policy will 
be. Will they chase matters up rigorously and ensure that 
the statutory right of interest applies to every contract that 
runs over time?
<P>
Clause 4(5) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any other case, the relevant day is the last day of the period 
of 30 days"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to list the two alternatives for when that period 
would begin, but the amendment would add the words:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"or may be otherwise agreed in accordance with the provisions of 
section 16(2) of this Act."	
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
As I have said before, I believe that the introduction of a 
statutory right of interest will make credit period 
agreements longer.



<P>
In her intervention, the hon. Member for Leicester, 
West put her finger on the main point when she said that 
the relevant part was when a date was agreed. When they 
send out their invoices and statements, companies in 
effect accept current working practices, which cannot deal 
with the 30-day period.
<P>
The Forum of Private Business has been prayed in aid 
by the Minister, and by the hon. Member for Burton
(Mrs. Dean), as the Department's guru about life in the 
real world. However, no other organisation representing 
small firms that has been consulted wants this provision.
<P>
One can understand why the forum's members might 
think that the clause might benefit them. All hon. 
Members accept that small firms face a problem with late 
payment That is not a bone of contention; but on Second 
Reading, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley 
and Chislehurst described the process by which everyone, 
when asked the right questions, would naturally decide 
that there must be some form of redress for late payment. 
From there, it is only a short leap to the proposal of a 
statutory right of interest.
<P>
Yet the devil is in the detail. How will the proposal 
work? First, we must see how a small or medium-sized 
company nowadays uses computer control for its 
accounts. I have studied some of the members of the 
Forum of Private Business and can say that they fall 
neatly into a category. Their businesses employ between 
10 and about 50 people, and they use computer control to 
run their accounts and send out debt statements at the end 
of the month for goods purchased.



<P>
I apologise for repeating what I said on Second 
Reading, but I only skated over the subject then and I 
want to go into it in a little more detail. If goods are 
supplied to a company at the beginning of the month, the 
company's goods inwards tick the box and say, "Yes, they 
have been received and they are in good order."	 The 
document goes up to the accounts department, which 
enters it into the computer records. When the department 
runs the accounts at the end of the month, the remittance 
advice will point up the item that came in at the beginning 
of the month, and will say that it is due for payment.
<P>
Most companies that I know will have the remittance 
in their hot little accounts hand when the statement from 
the company that supplied them comes in. Companies will 
put the two together and say, "Yes, these people are 
requesting moneys in their statement that relate to the 
invoice."	 They tick the box, and the money goes off.
<P>
The person who sends in 30 days from receipt of 
invoice is immediately in desperate trouble. Six weeks 
could easily have gone by the time that the accounts 
department has run the computer programme, had the 
shut-off, made sure that all the bits of paper are through, 
and the cheque has hit the post let alone any form of 
electric redress or methods of e-mail payment.
<P>
There need not have been any deliberate prevarication 
or attempts to slow payment. None the less, we are 
immediately a couple of weeks over the so-called agreed 
period.
<P>
The Committee can readily see that when goods come 
in later in the month and we get to 20, 21 and 22 days, 
the period will drop below the 30 days. One might say 
that it is a case of swings and roundabouts and that things 
will balance out at the end of the month. The reality of 
business is, however, that goods that are ordered in the 
last four or five days of the month particularly if a 
weekend intervenes or if matters are made a little worse 
by a bank holiday will miss the computer cut-off. The 
company will run its remittance advice and the items in 
question will not be on it for payment. The accounts 
department will sit there and say, "There is the remittance 
advice and here is the statement. They are claiming a 
number of items that are not on our remittance advice. 
Therefore, we will pay only what we think we owe."	 Off 
goes the appropriate check.
<P>
Next month, the items will be passed and they will be 
paid for. The Committee will rapidly appreciate that that 
delay was not 30 days or six weeks, but that it could easily 
be seven or even eight weeks. If we consider that case 
against the magical 30 days about which everybody talks, 
we immediately say, "Gosh, we have gone over the 
particular period of time."	 To return to what I said earlier, 
a debt collection or factoring agency that was involved 
would enthusiastically say, "They have gone over the 
period of time, so we want a statutory right of interest."	 
The company that receives the goods will then 
immediately say, "Stop. We will not accept 30 days. We 
want to make sure that we are covered right through the 
piece. If payment for any items is legitimately late we 
are not talking about delayed payment, prevarication or 
drawing out the payment by as much as seven or eight 
weeks, that should be the period that is put into our 
agreement."	 Once that has happened, the Committee can 
easily see how an accounts department that has, increased 
the period to 56 days or a little higher will look at the 
debt and say, "We can manoeuvre those items that could 
have been delayed by three weeks and get ourselves 
another three or four weeks' credit."	



<P>
I am concerned that, despite all the best intentions, the 
Bill can move the baseline up to produce a contract period 
that will be to the detriment of small businesses' time 
scales for getting their money in.
<P>
That is why I intervened on the hon. Member for 
Leicester, West when she was quoting statistics and 
comparisons with other EU countries. their baselines of 
contractual terms are higher, so although the time 
available for payment may appear shorter, it is in fact 
considerably longer. I appreciate her point about a need 
for certainty. Small firms like certainty. they also need 
their cash flow to operate so as to enable them to recycle 
and re-use money; otherwise, they will not prosper.
<P>
<H5>6.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Everybody in business knows that the velocity of 
money moving around the system is vital. The more 
businesses can get that money to go round, the more times 
it can be used and the more profit can be made on the 
base capital sum.
<P>
I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the 
Member for Chesham and Amersham, who is obviously 
doing some high-level negotiations behind my back. I 
look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> The debate has been interesting. I assure 
you, Miss Widdecombe, that I shall not venture as far as 
the debate initiated by the hon. Member for Chesham and 
Amersham. I shall resist the temptation to say that we will 
avoid commenting on manufacturing industry, when the 
boom and bust that prevailed under the previous 
Government did not provide any certainty at all.
<P>
I should say to the hon. Members for Chesham and 
Amersham and for South-West Hertfordshire that I 
understand the issues that werr raised. The Government 
considered them very carefully, both in the Green Paper 
and during preparation of the Bill. During consultation, 
many respondents noted that it was very important for the 
legislation not to prevent the use of administratively 
simple systems such as net monthly accounting, about 
which the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire 
spoke.
<P>
The Government share that view, which is why clause 
16(2) was drafted. Clause 16(2) provides that any 
reference to an agreement or to contract terms includes 
implied terms such as trade, custom and practice. As my 
hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West rightly 
pointed out, clause 4(3) refers to an agreed date payment. 
It follows that clause 16(2) already bites on clause 4(3).
<P>
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire spoke 
about net monthly accounting, and rightly raised the issue 
on Second reading. Clause 16 allows such systems to 
stand, and deals with their establishment by a course of 
dealing or by such usage as binds the parties. The 
provision has been welcomed by many businesses and by 
the CBI. Such systems would also be allowed to operate, 
where they do not fall into clause 16(2), if both parties to 
a contract accept them. The interest would run from the 
end of the agreed payment period.
<P>
I hope that I have said enough to reassure the hon. 
Member for Chesham and Amersham and to deal with the 
points raised by the hon. Member for South-West 
Hertfordshire. The Government have thought about these 
matters, and I urge the hon. Lady to withdraw her 
amendments.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The hon. Lady sat down before I had a 
chance to intervene. I am deeply disappointed by her 
response, because she has not dealt with any of the issues 
that I or my hon. Friend raised about the Refreshment 
Department and the Fees Office to my satisfaction. [Hon. 
Members: "Oh!"	] Labour Members are so sharp.
<P>
There is still a difficulty with clause 4(3). If someone 
renders an invoice after providing services to me in my 
capacity as a Member of Parliament, I pass it on to the 
Fees Office for it to pay on my behalf. It is not 
unreasonable to believe that the payment would be due at 
the end of the month, as with wages. In fact, when one 
contracts with staff who are not permanent and the invoice 
is sent in after, say, the 11th of the month, the payment does not take place until the end of the following month 
because of the payment systems and the computerisation 
of the Fees Office. The Minister did not address that in 
what I have to say was a fairly trivial response. By failing 
to do so, I believe that she was tacitly condoning late 
payment to people who provide services to Members of 
Parliament. If she is not going to condone that, I shall 
give way to her.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> What I am not condoning is tautology. 
The hon. Lady's amendment merely repeats what is 
already in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> That, with respect, does not deal with my 
point. Can the Minister tell me whether she thinks it right 
that someone who works for a Member of Parliament and 
puts in an invoice towards the middle of the month does 
not get paid until the end of the following month? I shall 
resume my place if the Minister will tell me what she 
thinks. There is no intervention from her, so I think that
I am right: there is a real possibility that she condones a 
late-payment practice in her place of work.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> It is nothing to do with that.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The Minister says that it is nothing to do 
with the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> In a moment. In fact, the Minister did not 
try to intervene on me when I was moving the amendment 
to tell me that she thought that it was irrelevant to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving 
way. She describes payments under a contract of 
employment, but she will be aware that the Bill does not 
apply to contracts of employment.



<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> The hon. Gentleman must have been 
reading the Bill when he was mentioned earlier on. At 
least he was not doing his ironing. Someone who is 
providing services on an interim basis is not necessarily 
under a contract of employment. I am not talking about a 
permanent member of staff; I am talking about someone 
who provides services from time to time. I do not believe 
that there is a contract of employment between me and 
Palace Computing, and I therefore think that the hon. 
Gentleman is wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> Can my hon. Friend provide an answer to a 
particular worry of mine? She will know that I have asked 
the Minister more than once to talk about the effect of the 
directive in any particular area. As I said, and shall 
continue to say, I am concerned that we get it right first 
time and that we do not have to plough it all up when the 
EU directive comes through.
<P>
My hon. Friend's amendment deals with clause 4(5), 
which states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"In any other case, the relevant day is the last day of the period 
of 30 days"	.
<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We come back to the magic 30 days. My concern is that 
the draft directive states that, unless specified otherwise, 
the due date for payment shall not exceed 21 calendar 
days from the date of invoice.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Page:</B> The EU directive appears to suggest 
something different from that which we are debating. I 
wonder whether the Government will bring forward an 
amendment changing 30 days to 21 days.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Gillan:</B> I am willing to allow the Minister to 
intervene on me to deal with that directly.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Roche:</B> I am very grateful to the hon. Lady.
<P>
I should like to point out to the hon. Member for 
South-West Hertfordshire that when we refer to 30 days, 
we are talking about a default period. In essence, the Bill 
will allow parties to agree such periods. Has the hon. 
Gentleman understood that point?
<P>
<B></B><P>
Mrs. Gillan: Fortunately, my hon. Friend will not be 
replying, unless I allow him to intervene on me. I am sure 
that he can catch your eye at a later stage,
Miss Widdecombe, if he wishes to pursue that debate.
<P>
In the course of his intervention, my hon. Friend made 
a powerful point that I should like to reiterate that is, 
that we hope that the Bill has not been brought forward 
prematurely, and that when we are faced with the rolling 
tide of European legislation we shall not have to readjust, 
reshape and reform British legislation to roll over to the 
wishes of the rest of the European Union.
<P>
I have given consideration to the Minister's short and 
rather sparse reply. We have heard only two major 
contributions to the debate on this amendment. The 
interventions from Labour Members were red herrings of 
no great substance, and once again we have not been 
blessed with any words from Liberal Democrat Members. 
We have not even been honoured with the presence of the 
hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey), who has 
missed the afternoon sitting as well as the morning sitting. 
I hope that I can bring the matter forward again at a later 
stage of the Committee's proceedings, but for the moment 
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

Further consideration adjourned. [Mr. Betts.]
