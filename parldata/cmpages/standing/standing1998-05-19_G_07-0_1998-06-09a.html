<H4><center>Clause 19</center></H4>
<H4><center>Abuse of dominant position by national newspaper</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. David Chidgey </B>(Eastleigh): Good morning, Mr. Maxton. 
<P>
This clause has caused considerable debate both in and outside Parliament. It deals with fair competition in the newspaper market and it is worth our reflecting on the importance of maintaining that. The market generates &#163;700 million worth of revenue per year, but it is currently making an annual loss of &#163;50 million. Many people believe that that is a direct result of the predatory pricing policy of The Times. Over the past five years, it has been argued that that policy has turned profitable quality daily newspapers into loss-making operations.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Redwood </B>(Wokingham): The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Is he saying that the Liberal Democrat party believes that The Times is guilty of predatory pricing?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The specific answer is that that is the case that is being put. To answer the question of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood) more fully, the whole basis of my argument is to demonstrate the uncertainty that exists within that area of trade and the reason why the Bill needs to be precise to overcome it.
<P>
<B>Mr. John Bercow </B>(Buckingham): The hon. Gentleman referred to the uncertainty that exists. Although there may be uncertainty about outcomes and effects, will the hon. Gentleman confirm that it is his contention that The Times' intent is to engage in predatory pricing--in other words, that that is its motive?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> It is my contention that the Bill does not provide a sufficient guarantee that such an intention can be restrained.
<P>
The pricing of The Times seems to vary greatly. For example, it retails on a Monday at 20p, while it costs 40p on Saturdays--
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It is 30p on a Monday.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> It is now 30p. I shall continue on the theme of how the price varies. I know that the right hon. Member for Wokingham has a specific interest in the matter, but I want to continue with my arguement. The cost of The Times whether it be 20p on Monday or 30p on Monday, is still far below the production costs that most people in the industry believe to be the average.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Again, the hon. Gentleman is making some interesting assertions. Will he tell us what it costs to produce The Times on a Monday and what costs on a Saturday? To make his case, he must know the answer to that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> That is not the case. The industry has a good idea of the average costs of newspaper production. The right hon. Gentleman must know that the cover-sheet cost charged by The Times is consistently below the costs of production.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I really must get on. I shall take interventions later when I have reached the substance of my argument. I want to say something before I answer questions. I appreciate the enthusiasm of members of the Committee, but perhaps they could temper it for a few minutes while I make some points, to which I hope the Minister will respond.
<P>
Under current legislation, it is unlawful for an enterprise to price its goods below cost only if it is the dominant undertaking in the market where the below-cost pricing occurs and if it is done to force a rival out of the market. Those conditions apparently do not apply to the national daily broadsheet market, which is why The Times has survived two recent Office of Fair Trading investigations.
<P>
The Competition Bill, particularly clause 19, offers a window of opportunity. The Bill presents the Government with the perfect chance to honour their pledge to tackle anti-competitive behaviour in the newspaper market. Clause 19 is necessary; without it, the Bill would not significantly change the test of predatory pricing. I know that the Minister will want to speak about that, but I want first to develop my theme.
<P>
Before clause 19 was added, the Bill would not have prevented a firm in the national daily broadsheet market with a substantial degree of market power from behaving anti-competitively. There is a precedent for having a more vigorous competition regime for newspapers in the Fair Trading Act 1973, which provides that the separate, tougher merger and acquisition rules for newspapers should be applied in other sectors.
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading is again looking at the behaviour of The Times and News International. Indeed, the director general is considering a case brought by The Independent, The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph. The fear is that the director general will be forced to reach the same conclusion as his predecessor did in 1993 and 1994, when it was found that there was no case to answer. The only comment that could be made then was that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``there is a fine line between aggressive price competition and predatory pricing.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Without clause 19, the Bill would not provide a tight enough definition for the director general to reach any other conclusion. One of the reasons why previous complaints were rejected was that News International was said to have been engaging in a temporary promotional activity. That temporary activity has now been going on for five years.
<P>
We have already said that The Times seems to change its price from day to day. It is interesting, perhaps significant, that the price changes seem to occur just before Parliament debates the matter. I understand that the price of The Times was upped on the Monday before the amendment was moved in another place, and--surprise, surprise--it was upped again just before the Bill received its Second Reading in the House of Commons. That may be a coincidence; perhaps I am being cynical, but The Times can hardly be breaking even at a price of 30p a day. It must be losing money, especially as the industry reckons that the price on Saturday barely covers half the production costs. Without a change in the law, nothing prevents The Times--or any other newspaper--slashing its price as soon as Parliament takes the heat off it. The Bill may not be an ideal vehicle to deal with the problem, but it is the only legislative opportunity that we have. It is the only game in town.
<P>
We constantly hear that the consequences of the price war in the broadsheet newspaper market, which everyone seems to accept was instigated by News International, is that it threatens the diversity and plurality of opinion, not only in the quality newspaper market but, through repercussions, lower down.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important assertion. He must either justify it or withdraw it. He spoke of a reduction in diversity and plurality having resulted from News International's behaviour. How does he square that assertion with the fact that there has been a 14 per cent. expansion of the broadsheet newspaper market since 1992?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I can satisfy the hon. Gentleman. As I was about to say, since the price war began five years ago there has already been one casualty in the mid-market sector--the Today newspaper. I am sure that there have been others. There has also been an effect on The Independent, in that it is no longer independently controlled. Hon. Members may recall that when The Independent was established, it was intended to be a completely independently owned newspaper, but predatory pricing has led to an acceleration of the reduction of choice in the newspaper industry. It was only when Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd., along with independent newspapers, took 46 per cent. of the shares of The Independent that it was saved from going out of business. I believe that it is now a healthy newspaper, but if that grouping had not saved the paper, it is unlikely that it would still be being produced.
<P>
Having set the scene, I shall not return to what I understand to be the Government's primary objections to clause 19. No doubt the Minister will be able to set those out in more detail, but I should like to refer to them now so that I can offer an alternative view. The Government appear to object to the clause on four grounds--although there may well be others.
<P>
The Government's view is that the Bill requires European jurisprudence to be followed and that, under European law, predatory pricing is illegal. The Government argue that the so-called Tetra Pak 2 judgment, which has been referred to many times in previous debates, extends article 86 of European law to apply to behaviour in a market other than one in which the defendant holds a dominant position. By implication, the Government claim that that would cover the anti-competitive behaviour of The Times in the newspaper market.
<P>
It has never been in doubt that European law outlaws predatory pricing, nor that the Tetra Pak judgment extends the scope of the law. However, the European Court of Justice held that the Tetra Pak judgment applied only in certain circumstances. Opinion has recently been sought from a leading competition expert in this country on whether the pricing policies of The Times would be unlawful under the Bill, in the light of the Tetra Pak judgment. Those extremely expert competition lawyers concluded that, in their opinion--in relation to the question of abuse, as well as that of dominance--the chapter II prohibition proposed by the Government will need modification if it is to be of assistance in dealing with newspaper pricing. The Government appear to have contrary advice.
<P>
At the very least, there is no settled legal opinion. Consequently, competition law needs to be clarified--if only in the form of a belt-and-braces clause, which clause 19 represents.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew Lansley </B>(South Cambridgeshire): If a competition lawyer has offered an opinion such as the hon. Gentleman suggests, that competition lawyer must have had an opportunity to assess whether The Times--presumably including its advertising returns--is pricing itself below average variable cost, or above average variable cost but below total average cost. Can the hon. Gentleman tell us at what point The Times is pricing itself?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Can anyone offer such an opinion? It is well understood that as the financial accounting of that group is less than transparent, and consists of many holdings in many countries, it is not easy to provide a specific numerical answer on the exact costs. However, I believe that certain assumptions, based on the industry's own trends and figures, are valid in forming that opinion. As I am sure that the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) will know, leading lawyers and Queen's counsels do not come to such opinions lightly, and take such factors well into account before giving advice.
<P>
The Government's second claim is that clause 19 is unworkable. They say that the clause is drafted too widely and would make entrepreneurial behaviour such as special promotions unlawful. In particular, they argue that subsection (2)(b), which covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``other action which may reduce the diversity and independence of the national newspaper press''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
contains a catch-all phrase.
<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
I do not pretend to be a lawyer of any rank, whether expert or otherwise. However, legal advice, supported by the noble Lord Borrie, a former Director General of the Office of Fair Trading, is that recognised legal doctrine requires subsection (2)(b) to be taken in the context of the other actions in the list of which it forms a part, and not in isolation. That allows the competition authorities the discretion to decide what behaviour would be unlawful. Therefore, legitimate marketing initiatives would not be caught by subsection (2)(b), but anti-competitive practices that reduce the diversity and independence of the press would be caught.
<P>
The Government have argued that it is not our responsibility to deal with such matters and that they are the responsibility of the OFT, or whatever. In opposition, Labour Members, including the Ministers responsible for taking the Bill through Committee, were--in all good faith and quite sincerely, I am sure--vociferous in their support for the then Government's action against anti-competitive behaviour in the newspaper industry. I strongly support that. It is a legitimate role of Parliament to take a view on what sort of action should be deemed unlawful.
<P>
One of the Government's major objections to clause 19 is that it is too specific. The Government have argued that competition law should apply to industry as a whole, and not to specific sectors. They argue that the clause would make the newspaper industry a special case, and would introduce a separate competition regime for that industry. Existing competition law, such as the Fair Trading Act 1973, which sets out tougher merger and acquisition rules for newspapers than for other sectors, acknowledges that newspapers are a special case. In her consultation document, which preceded the Bill, the President of the Board of Trade said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We do not propose to use the Bill to amend the FTA newspaper merger provisions. The original rationale for these provisions was that increasing concentration of newspaper ownership could threaten freedom and variety of expression of opinion in the press. We consider that this rationale remains valid.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I could not agree more.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The hon. Gentleman is being courteous. It might help the Committee if he could explain another issue. Subsection (2)(c) states that it would be an abuse if the newspaper were
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``imposing selling prices below marginal cost of production on a presistent basis''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A newspaper has two main sources of revenue--advertising and cover prices. Why is no allowance made for advertising revenue? Freesheets have a selling price of zero, so they are clearly sold well below the marginal cost of production, but might none the less be profitable. It is not a problem that the clause does not recognise advertising revenue?
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes an interesting intervention. I think that he is aware of my view on the matter. It has never been argued that clause 19 is the panacea to stamp out predatory pricing. We are arguing that it is the only game in town. If the Bill does not contain such a provision--which may be improved--we will not have the necessary belt and braces and will be missing our only opportunity to try to control such anti-competitive behaviour.
<P>
I shall now summarise the case for clause 19. On Second Reading, the Government claimed that the clause was unnecessary because European jurisprudence would have to be followed in line with clause 60. That requirement has never been in doubt. The real point is whether the relevant European case law--the Tetra Pak judgment--extends far enough to cover the type of anti-competitive abuse that we have witnessed in the daily broadsheet market; only then could we be sure that clause 19 is unnecessary.
<P>
As I have said, in the view of some experts in competition law the Tetra Pak judgment does not cover the broadsheet issue. In summary, the advice is based on the assumption that The Times can sell below cost only because it is supported by other activities--The Sunday Times, BSkyB, or whatever. It is not clear where that subsidy comes from because we do not have enough information on the accounting procedures operated by News International.
<P>
I understand that the Government's legal advice has been contrary to the expert advice that I have mentioned. Apart from asserting that the Government have taken such advice, they have not revealed its details--let alone published them. I understand that Ministers do not reveal confidential information, but the issue is important and is causing much concern in Parliament and elsewhere.
<P>
If the Minister is able to tell us today, I should like him to say whether the Government have asked a specific question: would the pricing policies of The Times be unlawful under the Bill given the Tetra Pak judgment? Given that the Government have not been able, or have refused, to answer that specific question, we must assume that is it unlikely that they have asked it. However, we must know the answer because, dependent on it, there might be one of three scenarios.
<P>
First, if the question has not been asked, it is hard to understand how the Government can expect Parliament, or even their own Back Benchers, to be reassured that the Bill covers such abuse. Therefore, the law must be amended, and clause 19 is the only option available. Secondly, if the question has been asked and the answer is that the Bill does not cover such abuse, clearly the clause is necessary, as both sets of legal advice--the Government's and the other experts--reach the same conclusion. Thirdly, if the question has been asked and the answer is that the Bill covers such abuse, the clause is still necessary because there is conflicting legal advice on the matter. That means that the only people who can gain from such uncertainty will be organisations such as News International and their lawyers.
<P>
Those are serious questions about the possible failure of competition law to control anti-competitive excesses, especially in the broadsheet market. The Government would be doing a great service if they placed the legal advice that they have obtained in the Library. That would clearly show whether such activities would be outlawed under the Bill. If the Government do not publish that advice, obviously the pressure on them will grow to accept a specific amendment containing similar provisions to those in clause 19. The Government claim that the clause is unworkable. If that is so, hon. Members from both sides of the Committee will be happy to assist in formulating a workable amendment along similar lines.
<P>
<B>Mr. Peter Brooke </B>(Cities of London and Westminster): There was a time when Fleet Street and the newspaper industry was essentially in my constituency. It has, of course, departed, so I cannot claim a constituency interest. The industry was founded by Wynkyn de Worde, the apprentice to William Caxton, who on Caxton's death, moved the business from a shop outside Westminster Abbey to where Fleet Street now is, and, in the process, effectively privatised the industry.
<P>
I declare a very antique interest as someone who was a consultant to the International Publishing Corporation in the late 1960s, when Cecil King--scion of a great family--was chairman and Hugh Cudlipp its managing director. I also declare an interest as a reader of The Independent. I think that I am right in saying that only 16 per cent. of its readers are Tories, or vote Tory. I have some doubt whether The Independent wishes to retain me as a reader, as one of its columnists described me during my time as a Minister in Northern Ireland as a patrician buffoon. I have no objection to the word ``buffoon'', but patrician is a descriptive term. One of my grandparents was a parson, the other was an artist, and my father was a politican. There is no money in any of those professions and it is difficult to be patrician if one has no money.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To elucidate, I am sure that my right hon. Friend would want to share with the Committee the observation that the alternative if he is not a patrician is that he must be a plebeian--a term that also seems to sit rather uncomfortably with him.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I was about to say that we owe the term ``patrician'' to the classical era. During the absence of the Minister of State--we are delighted to see him back--his colleague, the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs rapped the knuckles of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and myself for referring to Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator and said that the Government were living now, whereas the Tories were living 21 centuries ago. I thought that that was a little disloyal to Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator as he was responsible for creating the Fabian Society, which because it was evolutionary rather than revolutionary is rather more new Labour than old. However, it is not for me to intrude on private grief. It is a little surprising that the Under Secretary should want to disown the classical era, given how the Government go on about Britannia--a title that goes back to the 1st century BC, and further still in its Greek form.
<P>
Before you rule me out of order, Mr. Maxton, I am coming to my point. One of the reasons why I also read The Times is because it is edited by a classical scholar and is all the better for it. The Times is being cited--not least by the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey)--as the target of the debate, but everyone acknowledges that the debate is about the press generally; it is not simply about The Times and predatory pricing, because predatory pricing could be carried out by anyone.
<P>
There is a central debate on whether an industry should receive special treatment and the circumstances surrounding that industry, and it is the circumstances issue that has filled most of the debate. Of course, I acknowledge, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh will be quick to remind me, that the newspaper industry was singled out in the 1973 Act as requiring special notice, but that does not mean that new and more general legislation is not perfectly capable of taking the newspaper industry and its circumstances in its stride in exactly the same way that, under resale price maintenance, the net book agreement survived because people argued that it was appropriate for it to do so.
<P>
When I had media responsibilities, I diligently read ``Dangerous Estate'' by Francis Williams, who was press adviser to Mr. Attlee. He enjoys a notable place in history because of his introduction to No. 10 of a Reuters tape machine. He did that by the technique of advising Mr. Attlee that having the machine in No. 10 would make it possible for him to verify the county cricket scores at any time of the day during the summer. Mr. Attlee accepted that advice. A fortnight later he arrived in Francis Williams' office after lunch on a day when the Cabinet had been sitting, and said, ``Francis, Francis, the most terrible thing has happened. My cricket machine is reporting what we said in Cabinet this morning.''
<P>
The reason I revisited ``Dangerous Estate'' for the purposes of this debate is because of the events relating to The Times between the years 1836 and 1856. The significance of that period is that The Times entered it in a position of great strength for a variety of reasons, which I shall not go into, but it had both technical and journalistic strength at the time. The Government--not a Tory Government--reduced the stamp tax on newspapers from 4d--old pennies--to 1d. They failed to realise that that would make life easier for The Times, not more difficult. It seems as though there was some collusive pricing by the newspapers, because each of them brought down the price by only 2d rather than 3d. That gave The Times the opportunity to double its sales between 1836 and 1842. It doubled them again between 1842 and 1850, and the then manager of The Times said that the sales could have been doubled again in the following two years had he chosen to do so.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
During that time, the sales of the Morning Herald fell by one third and the sales of the Morning Post and the Morning Chronicle fell by a half. It was only in 1856 that the then Government changed the stamp tax, so that it militated against The Times rather than in its favour. Their action was hypocritical and discriminatory. In the interests of the Conservative Front Bench, I hasten to say that that was not a Tory Government although, in the long term, it was good that such action was taken. In those days, the stamp tax meant that there was free postage and that gave The Times an enormous advantage, given the scale of the newspaper. I cited that example to make the point that when Governments start interfering in particular industries and change their arrangements, there are likely to be unforeseeable consequences, which may be the exact opposite of the initial intention.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh was cross-examined about cost. Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) alluded to cost in its various economic guises. Such distinctions were familiar in the 1980s, when we said that all overseas students would be charged full costs if they attended British universities. I remember the scale of our economic debate on what form of cost that was.
<P>
Having read the debates in another place and our debate on Second Reading, I know that a precise definition of cost was not given. That is absolutely critical to the argument. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham intervened in the speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh when he referred to the costs in the Tetra Pak judgment, given that that affects the outcome in relation to European treatment.
<P>
I hope that I have made it apparent that I support the Government and want the clause deleted from the Bill. The management of News International gave assurances that the pricing policy of The Times is subsidised from within the newspaper division, not from elsewhere. Furthermore, categorical assurances were given in another place that the proceeds of satellite broadcasting were not being used to fund the subsidy. Are the Government confident that the OFT, when investigating the matter as it has been encouraged to do, will be able to find out exactly where the subsidy is coming from and, thus, go behind the assurances that are being given by the owners of News International?
<P>
I conclude my remarks with a tiny footnote to history. I asked the former chief exective of News International about his views of the 1836 to 1856 episode. He confessed that he did not have the faintest idea of what I was talking about. I hope that he found out subsequently--but it suggests that, if conspiracy were afoot, it would be sensible for people to carry out more historical research and not rely simply on their own imagination.

<P>

<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> We have had an interesting debate so far. I begin by paying a compliment to the broadsheet newspaper market. We are well served by the range and diversity of national newspapers that is available to us every day at breakfast time. The Conservative party's view is, the more the better. We want that diversity to be maintained.
<P>
From time to time, I enjoy reading articles in each of the leading broadsheets--even The Guardian occasionally warms my heart when it is making a sensible attack on the Government. I enjoy the presence in the marketplace of The Independent, and The Daily Telegraph and The Times have great strengths. I write occasionally for each of them, but I have no contractual relationship with any of them and I am happy to see them all thrive and survive in the marketplace.
<P>
The Conservative party has always accepted that there should be some differences in the competition regime for newspapers as opposed to the regime that applies to the broad mass of industry. In that respect, I accept the argument of the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Eastleigh, that newspapers should be treated differently. In some cases, the Conservative party has agreed with such differences. For example, under Conservative Governments special arrangements were always in place to deal with possible bids and mergers in the newspaper industry. We were worried that there could be too much concentration by means of a takeover. I believe that Ministers have some sympathy with that approach.
<P>
I am less convinced of the desirability or need for a special clause such as clause 19. The hon. Member for Eastleigh drew extensively this morning on a briefing from The Independent. It would have been better if he had told us that that was the source of his remarks. I, too, have studied that briefing carefully, and I am grateful to The Independent for sending it to hon. Members. I have some sympathy with that briefing. I agree with it in its first critique of the Government's position, when it says that competition law needs to be clarified. The burden of most of our comments is that the Bill is muddled and badly drafted. However, I urge the Minister to clarify the law in general rather than through the mechanism of clause 19, which relates to only one industry.
<P>
The criticism that the Bill is unworkable is rebutted in The Independent briefing. However, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh pointed out, the briefing states that the drafting of clause 19 is not a perfect solution and that the newspaper is willing to assist in formulating a workable alternative. It is right. Clause 19 is not a perfect solution, and I hope to demonstrate some of the difficulties that it could cause.
<P>
In their third critique of the Government, The Independent and the hon. Member for Eastleigh say that Parliament should decide, rather than delegating everything to the courts and the OFT. Again, I agree. We must ensure that, as legislators, we can answer the obvious questions about the likely impact of the Bill, and not simply transfer all the difficult and dangerous problems to the OFT and the courts--or to the new competition authority--because the Government find it too difficult or embarrassing to tackle them.
<P>
My worry is not only that clause 19 is badly drafted, but that it could capture many practices that are of benefit to customers and that are pursued by a range of newspapers and not only by The Times, which seems to be the target of this attack.
<P>
At the start of our debate, I asked the hon. Member for Eastleigh to clarify whether he thought the pricing policy of The Times was predatory. It is the Conservative party's view that a newspaper, like everyone else, is innocent until proved guilty. The Times has been investigated twice and found innocent of the charge; we therefore regard it, in normal British practice, as innocent. If people think that that judgment was wrong or that circumstances have changed, it is up to them to bring new evidence before the competition authorities. I contend that predatory pricing is illegal today and that it will remain illegal under the Bill--with or without clause 19.
<P>
When answering my intervention, the hon. Member for Eastleigh was not prepared to say that The Times was definitely indulging in predatory pricing. However, as the record will show, he went on to make that very charge. He called the pricing strategy of The Times an abuse. He clearly implied that the current pricing strategy of The Times should fall foul of anti-predatory pricing measures. His main case was that, because he thought that The Times was engaged in predatory pricing and had not been captured by the old law, he wanted to make absolutely sure that it was captured by the new law, and that the clause was needed to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the views that I expressd were not merely mine but those of a number of eminent people who have been involved in trying to enforce existing legislation that covers anti-competitive behaviour--in particular, a past Director General of the Office of Fair Trading? The views that I expressed have been put forward by people who have tried to eliminate such practices--or to judge them fairly. I expressed not my personal opinion but that of people who have been involved at the sharp end.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It may well be the case that a noble Lord holds the view expressed by the hon. Member for Eastleigh. I have not asked the noble Lord concerned if that is his view, but it may well be.
<P>
What interests me, and what will interest the Committee and the wider public is that as the official Liberal Democrat spokesman on the issue, the hon. Gentleman is saying that he believes that the current price of The Times is too low. He goes further: he says that that is an abuse; he is very unhappy that it is not captured by the current regime; he does not think that it would be captured by the Government's proposed regime, and he therefore sponsors the clause. We have now clarified that, and by remaining in a sedentary position, the hon. Gentleman agrees that it is the official Liberal Democrat position that the price of The Times should be forced up by legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Bercow:</B> My right hon. Friend will have noted that the hon. Member for Eastleigh has judged The Times to be an abuser; but he does not appear to have identified who is the abused. Would it not help the hon. Gentleman's case if he were able to identify a specific broadsheet newspaper that could claim to have been illegitimately damaged by the predation of The Times?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend has made a helpful intervention. He is quite right. When I said that it was incumbent on the hon. Member for Eastleigh and those who feel as he does to bring forward new evidence, that is exactly the sort of the evidence that I had in mind.
<P>
If people believe that a newspaper or newspaper group is indulging in predatory pricing, they must bring forward evidence of intent and of likely result. We must be shown that one or more important broadsheet newspapers will be driven out of business by such practice. If I thought that a newspaper group had targeted another newspaper, adopted a pricing strategy to drive it out of business and succeeded, I should be very worried. Of course, that would be disgraceful, but the case must be made by producing evidence.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Does my right hon. Friend agree that, as we followed the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, the nature of the abuse appeared to inhere in pricing below cost on a systematic basis, and that, on the hon. Gentleman's own analysis, that would be the practice not solely of The Times but of the majority of national newspapers, because they are currently loss-making? The hon. Gentleman was also concerned about abuse of a dominant position, but The Times is not the dominant player even in the broadsheet market in terms of its number of daily readers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My hon. Friend has foreseen one of my problems with the clause. He is quite right; the clause tries to define ``dominant position'' in special circumstances. It defines it as
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a substantial degree of market power in the national newspaper market in the United Kingdom.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is extremely vague. The Times could argue that it was not sufficiently dominant in the sector that mattered; and that argument might be upheld.
<P>
Other newspaper groups that also offer their customers attractive deals--the Telegraph Group Ltd., for example, offers some of us as customers an attractive deal, for which we are grateful--might fall under the scope of the clause. I do not think that the hon. Member for Eastleigh intends to capture newspapers other than The Times, but he must see that the clause could have that unwarranted side effect, given the looseness of its drafting and the difficulty of defining ``dominant position''. He must also realise the illogicality of being worried about one broadsheet's position in a broadsheet market, but returning to a more general definition of a national newspaper marketplace for those purposes.
<P>
I have a further difficulty, which I gave the hon. Member for Eastleigh the chance to answer. I had to explain that newspapers traditionally receive revenue from two important sources. Some may receive more revenue from advertising than from their selling prices. All hon. Members would agree that advertising revenue is an extremely important source of revenue for a large national newspaper. The clause does not seem to understand that when considering the overall balance between revenue and cost, an analyst or a competition authority expert must consider the advertising revenue stream and the impact on advertising of going for a larger market share, as well as the selling price.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
All that goes to show that the issues are extremely complicated and need proper exposure in a court of law. Trying to draft special clauses that give only a half or a quarter of the story could conspire to make the position far worse. I am sure that the hon. Member for Eastleigh and those who drafted the clause did not want to cause trouble for The Daily Telegraph, but that could be the result. I am sure that they have the best intentions towards The Independent, but who knows what the consequences of the clause might be, given that it is imperfectly drafted?
<P>
Conservative Members are unhappy with the drafting of the Bill and think that it could be improved to make it crystal clear that predatory pricing generally, in newspapers and elsewhere, is an offence and will remain an offence. Perhaps the drafting could be improved so as to give us a clearer understanding of what constitutes predatory pricing. In other debates in Committee, we have had cause to say that the President of the Board of Trade's new doctrine about the relationship between revenue and cost is half-baked and may be dangerous. We hope that she and her right hon. Friends might use the Bill as an opportunity to remove that rather clumsy doctrine from the record by replacing it with something clearer and better in the Bill.
<P>
Conservative Members would be happy to support a general amendment to the Bill that made hostility to predatory pricing crystal clear and gave the courts and the competition authority better guidance on what constitutes predatory pricing. We do not support the retention of clause 19; we did not do so in the other place and will not do so today. However, because we think that clause 19 and the rest of the Bill is so incompetently drafted, I advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to abstain on this vote and to let the Government fight it out with their Back Benchers and the Liberal Democrat party.

<P>

<B>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney):</B> Good morning, Mr. Maxton. I welcome the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) to the Opposition Front Bench. I look forward to a long and happy working relationship, although I hope that it remains with him in opposition and me in government.
<P>
We had an interesting discussion--clash is not the word--during consideration of the National Minimum Wage Bill, when he asked for an exemption from the national minimum wage for Westmorland in the event of a national security alert that affected Cumbria and Westmorland. It was an interesting discussion at 4 o'clock in the morning. I hope that we shall not have any discussions in this Committee at 4 o'clock in the morning. Perhaps he will get out some of his speeches just in case.
<P>
This is a bit of a first: I welcome the suport of the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke). In fact, this is the second occasion that the right hon. Gentleman has offered me support. However, on the first occasion, he later intervened on me, saying that, having heard my argument, he had decided to withdraw his support. I hope that this morning I shall adopt a better tone to retain his support, although I understand from the right hon. Member for Wokingham that Conservative Members will abstain in the vote, if not in the debate.
<P>
There are four key elements to fair competition. We are providing a legal framework and a process of investigation to determine such issues on fact, not on supposition. We are providing remedies and an appeals process for those instances in which a decision is made.
<P>
No legislation can provide evidence for a particular case or generality of cases--that is not the role of the legislative programme. Our role is to provide a framework so that, if anti-competitive behaviour takes place or is alleged to have taken place, people can use a specific formula and, if the case is proven, to provide them with a remedy so that the action ceases and any detrimental effects can be put right. That is what we are attempting to do.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham suggested that the Government's position on ensuring the plurality of the press and the diversity of ownership is similar to that of the previous Government. That is the case. Indeed, between 2 May 1997 and 11 May 1998, Ministers took decisions on nine proposed newspaper transfers, one mandatory reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission--Mirror Group and Midland Independent Newspapers, which was cleared on 21 October 1997--and one discretionary reference, involving Johnston Press and Home Counties Newspapers, the report on which was due to be delivered on 15 May 1998. On 11 May 1998, consent to transfer was given in seven cases. So the process in place under the previous Administration continues. We are prepared to take such matters very seriously, ensuring that decisions on the ownership of the press in the United Kingdom are looked at effectively.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade announced the Government's intention to oppose the question that the clause stand part of the Bill, and that is still the case. A great deal has been written and spoken about the clause, much of it by people with only a passing interest or understanding of the aims and principles of the Bill. The real merits of the argument about the Bill's effectiveness in dealing with predatory pricing have not seemed to matter to those people.
<P>
As a result, many of the assertions that have been made are wrong. Understandably, such claims have worried those who are genuinely interested in ensuring that the House passes sound and effective legislation. They have been led to wonder whether the Bill favours a certain individual, or whether it shies away from strengthening the law against abuses of dominance, such as predatory pricing. The answer to both counts is that it does not. Can anyone imagine me wearing a ``Sun lover'' tee-shirt? It is absolute nonsense.
<P>
The Government are not in the business of seeking or giving favours to individual companies, organisations or parts or sectors of the economy. If abuse takes place, there will be effective processes to deal with it and provide remedies for those who have suffered from that abuse.
<P>
My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade addressed the concerns head on at Second Reading. She made it absolutely clear that the Bill strengthens competition law, especially the law against predatory pricing and other abuses of dominance, across the board.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh began with the premise that The Times is basically guilty, regardless of what the Independent Office of Fair Trading has concluded. That was the basis of his argument. The hon. Gentleman's argument was that The Times was guilty, whether under current or future arrangements, and, therefore, we must alter the legislation to get our man. Frankly, even if there was agreement about getting the man, legislation must not be used in that way; it would bring the legislative process into disrepute and undermine the concept of having a Bill to regulate competition in the marketplace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> The Minister makes a strong statement--it is possibly too strong. My argument, in which I cited News International as an example, was not based on the premise that The Times is guilty. Perhaps it is, perhaps it is not--that is not the issue. The basis of my argument is the concerns, uncertainty and misgivings of previous senior officials in the Office of Fair Trading who felt unable adequately to pursue the cases brought to them. That is not prejudging the issue, but setting the point at which they felt unable to judge it properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The hon. Gentleman's comments demonstrate the importance of separating political considerations from the assessment of competition law under the Bill. As we proceed, the hon. Gentleman will see that the Government propose a rigorous regime. Clause 18 provides for that, but I understand from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that that is not good enough and he wants a guarantee in all circumstances that a company, or newspaper, will be caught. Our job is to provide a framework and we believe that the competition authorities will have strong powers to deal with the issue.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> In the light of that exchange, has it struck the Minister as ironic that it is the Liberal Democrat party, which is more favourable to the European Union than any other in the House, that is finding fault with the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> Any port in a storm--as has been said about the Liberal Democrat party on occasion. I shall not make a partisan point, because whatever side of the argument we are on, in general, we all want to protect the freedom and diversity of the press. We want investment in the press, in terms of its technology, news delivery and jobs, as both a domestic and foreign earner. The nature of the industry is important to the UK economy. There is common agreement about that and I am not saying it in a negative or partisan way. It is important for me to say it in view of the remarks of the hon. Member for Eastleigh.
<P>
The Competition Bill is not about ownership. It is about dealing with abuses of dominance and other anti-competitive behaviour. The Government are clear about the importance of a strong, diverse and independent press. That is why the Fair Trading Act 1973 has special merger provisions for newspapers to protect the plurality of ownership and diversity of content. There are specific public interest issues, such as accurate presentation of news and free expression that need to be considered in merger cases. That is why we are keeping the special FTA provisions. The Bill deals with anti-competitive practices which are wrong wherever they occur. The Government believe that abuses of dominance such as predatory pricing should be stamped out whatever the market. The right hon. Member for Wokingham disagrees that we are doing that effectively, but I shall return to his comments later.
<P>
Clause 18 covers firms that abuse their dominance by predatory pricing and the case law shows that beyond doubt. In the case of Tetra Pak, the ECJ followed its earlier decision in the AKZO case that, when prices are below the average variable cost of production, predation should be presumed. In other words, proof of intent is not required. That is an objective test, to which the right hon. Gentleman objected. I got the impression that he felt that it was either insufficient or too woolly. But the test has been determined through jurisprudence and the mechanisms of determining anti-competitive behaviour. The test has been set down, rightly and clearly, by an effective, legal regime.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> My main criticism was about the impact of the President of the Board of Trade's statement to the House about the relationship between costs and revenues and how she would deem something to be predatory. I think that she might like to withdraw her statement. The Bill offers an opportunity for the Minister and his colleagues to provide better and clearer guidance on how a predatory pricing case should be judged. Otherwise, the combination of the clause and the President of the Board of Trade's statement is muddling.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is incorrect. These are matters for the competition authorities, which will have to determine them by taking evidence and investigating whether the alleged abuse is taking place. It is also clear that the Bill, including the secondary legislation, will set down the way in which the competition authorities will work. I refer to the gathering of information, the arrangements for dealing with the evidence and the capacity for all the parties to have a relationship with the competition authorities when determining whether the evidence shows predatory pricing or other anti-competitiveness behaviour.
<P>
The hon. Member for Eastleigh focused his argument too narrowly. The Government have presented in the Bill, as they will do in secondary legislation, a clear set of principles within which the competition authorities will operate when determining how to handle complaints or inquiries.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I wish to make two points. The Minister cited the Tetra Pak judgment as an example of European jurisprudence. He is obviously aware of the different legal opinions concerned with whether that judgment would apply in the case of predatory pricing in the newspaper market. What does he think about the two distinct views on the matter and how they may lead to cases being argued in the courts--no doubt at great length and great expense?
<P>
The Tetra Pak judgment referred to a company that was in a dominant position within the market place and which was using that in a competitive way. That is not the same as a newspaper that is not in a dominant position. There is a distinct difference between those cases. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> On Second Reading and, more generally, we stressed carefully that the definition of predatory pricing in the Tetra Pak judgment was relevant to alleged predatory pricing by The Times. We were not talking about the associated market points. The Tetra Pak judgment dealt with a range of issues and, as a consequence, we have been careful to separate the issues that deal technically with the alleged issues in respect of The Times or other predatory pricing activities.
<P>
I have not made claims about the application of other elements of European jurisprudence to The Times nor would I do so. That is not my role, nor would I, despite the seductive attempts of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, fall into that trap. We have clearly set out the impact of the Tetra Pak judgment on such matters.
<P>
The European Court of Justice held that, if prices were above the average variable costs, but below total average costs, conduct is to be regarded as predatory when it can be established that its purpose was to eliminate a competitor. That is significant. Such principles that were established in European case law will apply under the Bill by virtue of clause 60, subsection (2) of which makes it clear that there must be no inconsistency in the principles applied by the courts in applying the domestic prohibition and those laid down by the European Court and any relevant decision of the court. Therefore, the principles of predatory pricing established in AKZO and Tetra Pak cases will apply under the Competition Bill.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wokingham and other Conservative Members continue to express arguments that fly in the face not only of opinions of the legal fraternity, but in the face of how the Bill has been constructed. The prohibition under clause 18 against the abusive dominance is tough. The right hon. Gentleman believes that it is too tough, although he has to support the Government and took a stance of neutrality on the issue for a few seconds. Occasionally, he has said that the proposals go too far, yet today he has said we are not tough enough. Perhaps when we discuss other clauses, the right hon. Gentleman will explain what he meant.
<P>
Conservative Members seem to prefer the current system that allows abuses to continue unchecked and undeterred. It allows also for long investigations, as a result of which consumers and competitors suffer. That is not acceptable either, because at the end of it a competitor may have gone out of business and the consumer will have been left with less choice. The Bill will address those issues.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> I am grateful again. The Minister is right that we have sometimes argued that the Bill is not tough enough and sometimes that it will capture too many things. The Minister will see from the record that we have noted all sorts of drafting difficulties. We shall speak of more difficulties, on both sides of the argument, in future debates.
<P>
I suggest to the Minister--not only to help the Committee but to help the competition authority and the courts--that he and his officials should peruse all the statements made by Ministers, as well as what is stated in the Bill, on what constitutes predatory pricing. If he does so, he might conclude, as I do, that the statement made by the President of the Board of Trade fits uneasily with some of those statements and the Bill itself.
<P>
The Minister knows that the Bill establishes a new British jurisprudence and jurisdiction; it is not only a European one, it is a British one, established by an Act of Parliament. All that the President of the Board of Trade and the Under-Secretary have said will be taken into account by the courts when construing the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes the same point that he made a few moments ago, but with a few additions. I can add nothing to what I said then, except to say that, compared with the right hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster, the right hon. Gentleman is a wee bit short on history. British companies have had to operate under much of the European jurisprudence to be found in the Bill since the previous Conservative Government signed up to the European Communities legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> No.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I know that the right hon. Gentleman finds it difficult to accept history. Indeed, he finds it difficult to accept the concept in principle. He cannot use his prejudices as a red herring when speaking about the position of Ministers. We are clear about the principle of the Bill. Predatory pricing is caught by clause 18, which prohibits it. We have provided the framework. We have provided the system. However, it is not our role to provide the evidence. That is for others to do.
<P>
European jurisprudence is clear: dominance means a position of economic strength which enables an undertaking to act independently of competition. The hon. Member for Eastleigh said that The Times was not dominant. I shall not enter into that debate, because it is not for us to decide. Our job is to provide the legal framework to deal with such matters. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will clarify whether he believes that The Times is not dominant.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> In the context of the application of the Tetra Pak judgment, I was bringing to the Minister's attention the fact that, as I understand it, the judgment referred to a company that was already dominant in the marketplace that subsequently indulged in anti-competitive practices. I made the distinction--for interest as well as for information--that, as we understand the term, The Times is not a dominant player in the broadsheet market. I therefore questioned the Minister on whether he felt that the Tetra Pak judgment should apply, or whether he agreed with others that special circumstances applied?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I was not trying to say that, because it makes irrelevant what I want to say next.
<P>
Market share is not a determinant of dominance but it is an important factor. The Commission has made it clear that, although companies with a market share of less than 40 per cent. are unlikely to be regarded as dominant undertakings, a market share as low as 20 per cent. may none the less be dominant if the nature and structure of the market enables a company to act independently of competition. That was stated in the Commission's ninth and 10th annual competition reports.
<P>
Clause 60(3) requires our courts to have regard to the relevant statements of the Commission in applying the domestic prohibitions. The assessment of dominance will follow the EC approach, an important factor in respect of what the hon. Member for Eastleigh said about the determinant of dominance. It is an effective proposal. Clause 18 and clause 60(3) will align the United Kingdom's competition proposals with the prohibition arrangements in the European format. Clause 18 will be a genuinely effective weapon against abuses of dominance, including predatory pricing, but clause 19 will not. Worse, clause 19 would have a serious detrimental effect on the newspaper industry. As my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade said on Second Reading:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``There has seldom been a better example of the danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water.''--[Official Report, 11 May 1998; Vol. 312, c. 31.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
We have seen that in spades this morning in the way in which the hon. Member for Eastleigh has approached the issue.
<P>
Unlike clause 18, which is intended to prohibit illegitimate behaviour by dominant players, clause 19 would apply to any conduct--legitimate or illegitimate--that may reduce the diversity of national newspapers by reducing competition. Therefore, strong newspapers that had established a good circulation by good journalism, and as a result had threatened the survival of poorer papers, would fall foul of the proposed prohibition. As practically any established national newspaper will hold a substantial degree of market power, that provison would give the regulator practically unlimited power to intervene to regulate the national newspaper market.
<P>
The clause is unworkable, because each aspect of it is undefined. In truth, it is based not on anti-competitive behaviour, but on the desire to give the state power to control how national newspapers behave. In short, it is hopelessly unclear how the prohibition would operate in practice, or what sort of editorial commercial behaviour would be prohibited. The result would be that genuine competition and innovation in the newspaper industry would be inhibited. On that basis, we oppose the question that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister's response. He has addressed the issue in some detail and sensibly--which is refreshing, and, if I may say so, not universally the case among Opposition members of the Committee. Nevertheless, while the Minister has put his case clearly, he has not addressed a number of the key issues that I raised. The Minister says that the clause is unworkable; but I made the point that legal advice is that the clause is not exclusive of fair competition practices, and would give discretion to the competition authorities to take due account of legal marketing initiatives.
<P>
Although the Minister referred to European jurisprudence, he has not been able to reassure me that the Government have obtained specific advice concerning the case that we have used as an example of possible predatory behaviour to be examined. I am sure that the Minister would accept that this is an important issue which concerns all members of the Committee, and all those who are involved in communicating opinions to the public and who value the diversity of opinion available in our broadsheet newspaper market. Consequently, I shall press the question that the clause stand part of the Bill to a Division.

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 11, line 24, leave out from `exclusions' to end of line 26.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 135, in page 11, line 26, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`except that the Secretary of State shall not remove the provision expressed in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 1.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To change gear slightly, this is a probing amendment into the Government's intentions. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire will wish to speak to his amendment No. 135, the effect of which would be to stabilise the exclusion of mergers from the chapter II prohibition--a proposal with which I am broadly sympathetic. I have no doubt that the attitude of my hon. Friend and myself is likely to depend on further elucidation from the Minister.
<P>
It is important that, whenever possible, the Government should clarify their intentions when they propose to extend exclusions. I notice that the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs is, to use the language of actors, resting from his efforts at our previous sitting. They are not always to good effect because, when I asked about the Government's intentions in respect of exclusions by order under clause 3, I received no substantial answer. However, I charitably let that pass by at the time. It is important--not least in their own interests--for Ministers to focus on why they are taking powers to provide for exclusions and the remedies or circumstances in which they might need to apply them by order.
<P>
The matter is serious. The ``Financial Times Business Law Europe'' analysis of the Bill is a trenchant document from which I have quoted before. It cites an example of what it regards as excessive powers and states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``along with the power to add exclusions, there is the inevitable counterbalancing power to `amend or remove any provision whether or not it has been added by an order.'''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is what my amendment would do. The document continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The statute itself will therefore be open to change by statutory instrument. Though not unprecedented, this is highly undesirable and could further undermine respect for the statute-book.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is a worthwhile comment. If there is a reason for providing for the power to amend, the Minister must explain it to the Committee. There is a case for extending exclusions in the conduct of business if a problem arises. That would broadly be regarded as beneficial to the conduct of business when, for example, the act, by accident, turns out to have had a penal effect.
<P>
The amendment relates to the counterbalancing powers for the withdrawal of exisiting exclusions or the amendment of exclusions in one direction or another. That would be more likely to be potentially penal than its counterpart. It could well affect an industry in which there was subtle practice, where there had been no problem in the past and where, what had previously been sanctioned, would suddenly be overturned and subverted by the decisions of Ministers--Ministers alone, effectively, albeit acting through the order procedure that we do not regard as too easy or effective. If Ministers are to take powers to rewrite the statute and tell businesses up to the point of its rewriting that it is all right, but tell them after the statute has been rewritten that it is not all right, we must know why.
<P>
My only other point about what are, despite my tone, probing amendments relates to the other powers in the schedule. It is not easy to legislate by reference to other legislation. As I understand it, the exclusions are all keyed to schedule 1. The only reference to chapter II prohibitions in schedule 1 is in paragraph 2, which is headed:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Enterprises ceasing to be distinct: the Chapter II prohibition''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
In contrast, paragraph 4 of schedule 1, which concerns individual exclusions to be made by the Director General of Fair Trading, relates only to paragraph 1 exclusions. That is an oddity.
<P>
It appears to me possible in principle, under the drafting to which we take exception, for the Secretary of State to go around adding references to the chapter II prohibition elsewhere. That could hardly logically happen in paragraph 1, because that is specifically keyed to the chapter I prohibition. I am not sure whether such a reference may be inserted in the powers of the director general in particular cases under paragraph 4, which concerns agreements--of course, the chapter II prohibition concerns practices, not agreements. As we discovered earlier, there may well be procedure under both chapter prohibitions in parallel.
<P>
I raise those issues in a genuine state of perplexity. I am not clear what the Government intend to provide for or what contingency they are worried about. I very much doubt whether in practice they intend to make wholesale exclusions; they may just be worried about the odd individual case in which they would like to make an exclusion because the law would otherwise present an undesirable consequence that could not be dealt with elsewhere. In any case, it would be helpful for the Minister to explain a little more precisely what is in his mind.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> I am grateful for the opportunity to support my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry's probing amendment, No. 62, and also to speak to amendment No. 135, which stands in my name, and which is intended not as a probing but as a substantive amendment.
<P>
Under paragraph 2(1) of schedule 1, mergers and concentrations--or, to use the phrase in schedule 1,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``enterprises ceasing to be distinct''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
are, to the extent that they are examined under the Fair Trading Act 1973, to be excluded from the prohibition applied under clause 18. If clause 20 is designed to allow the Secretary of State to provide additional exclusions, that is understood. Amendment No. 62 is probing rather than substantive because, if the Secretary of State were to provide for additional exclusions--perhaps the Minister will explain what they might be--it may also be proper for them to be amended or removed at some point.
<P>
However, when we consider schedule 1, I hope that we will agree that it would be wrong and undesirable for mergers and concentrations that are to be considered under the Fair Trading Act 1973 also to be considered under the Bill to decide whether they constitute abuse of a dominant position. I imagine that all members of the Committee would agree we must aim to avoid double jeopardy under the Bill. That is especially true in the case of mergers and concentrations. If we are to retain the Fair Trading Act provisions, and companies are to proceed under them, we must not leave any doubt about whether mergers and concentrations are dealt with under the Act or whether they fall outside it and become subject to the Bill's provisions, otherwise we will give rise to many precautionary notifications to the director general.
<P>
I am reminded of some of the evidence given to the Department on an earlier draft of the Bill. The problem arose then, and it was one of the reasons why the Government quite properly redrafted a later clause to ensure that mergers and concentrations were covered by regulation 4064/89 of the Community mergers and concentrations regulations, so that no doubt remained. As that evidence made clear, when the Irish Government introduced their own competition legislation they left some doubt about the exclusion of mergers and concentrations, which then gave rise to just such difficulties as we are attempting to avoid.
<P>
My proposition is essentially straightforward. If it is right to make a distinction between the Fair Trading Act mergers and concentration provisions and the Bill's provisions, as I agree it is, I cannot envisage circumstances in which it would be right to tamper with that exclusion, to remove it or to qualify it in a way that would lead inexorably to just the sort of double jeopardy that we want to avoid.
<P>
The amendment is designed to elicit an explanation from the Minister of whether he can envisage any circumstances in which he or his successors would attempt to bring mergers and concentrations within the chapter II prohibition. If he cannot envisage such circumstances, will he accept the amendment to make it absolutely clear that that is the position under the Bill now, and that the Bill will make it clear that that will not be tampered with in future?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I admit that the power to amend the provisions in schedule 1 is significant. I also accept the tone and the presentation of the arguments of the hon. Members for Daventry and for South Cambridgeshire. I shall try to deal with the issues fairly, although I am not sure that ultimately they will accept my explanation, especially because the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire approaches the matter from a slightly different perspective. However, I hope that I shall be able to explain the reasons for the proposals.
<P>
Although the power is significant, we provide appropriate safeguards in clause 70, which makes the exercise of the power subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of both Houses. That is important. Schedule 1 excludes from the prohibitions agreements and conduct that constitute a merger, in order to ensure that they are not subject both to domestic prohibitions and to existing merger control regimes in UK domestic law and at EC level.
<P>
It is good for business that the exclusion is there to avoid overlap between the two regimes and that there is a power to adjust the schedule to avoid problems arising in future. The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire made that point slightly differently. Changes must take account of potential problems. He referred to the Irish case. I do not have details of that, so I am not trying to use it against him. I am merely saying that the power to adjust the schedule is there so that if problems arise we can be sufficiently flexible to deal with them.
<P>
The power to amend or remove any provision of the exclusion is intended to ensure that the line drawn between the chapter II prohibition--and, indeed, the chapter I prohibition--and the merger regimes can be adjusted, if necessary, in the light of experience of its operation, or perhaps changes in the EC mergers regime.
<P>
Amendment No. 62 would remove the power of the Secretary of State by order to amend or remove a provision of schedule 1 with respect to the chapter II prohibition. We cannot say in advance how the power might be used; we believe that the exclusion, as drafted, works effectively and that it is adequate, as confirmed by the Law Society of Scotland. However, it is important to retain the power to adjust it. To give an example of a time when it may be necessary, I draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 6 of schedule 1, which excludes from both prohibitions concentrations--the European terminology for a merger--to the extent that they are subject to exclusive EC jurisdiction under the European Community merger regulation. That provision might need amending if the European regime for mergers were to change.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
It is not the Government's intention to make mergers subject to both the prohibitions and mergers control. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that adjustment to the exclusion could involve replacing part of what is there with a new provision. That gives the opportunity and the flexibility to take account of any changes in respect of the European regime. In such a case, it will be necessary for the power to extend to removing the provision that gives the existing exclusion en bloc so that it can be replaced with new provisions. That is why amendment No. 135, which would prevent removal of paragraph 2(1) of the schedule, is unacceptable.
<P>
Mergers are achieved through agreements. The key exclusion for merger agreements and for ancillary restrictions is therefore from the chapter I prohibition. However, there is European case law--the Continental Can case--to the effect that article 86 can apply to a merger when a dominant undertaking strengthens that dominant position through the merger. Hence, schedule 1 provides for merger agreements and ancillary restrictions to be excluded from chapter II prohibitions.
<P>
The Government have already shown their willingness to be flexible on schedule 1. The extension of the exclusion from the chapter II prohibition to cover ancillary restrictions was included in response to a request from the Opposition Benches in another place. We consider that the wider powers in clauses 3 and 20 are needed to ensure that we can adjust the schedule in the light of experience and deal with future developments.
<P>
We have taken into account the concerns expressed, but we believe that the Bill, as it stands, will give us the opportunity to ensure our proposals will not act as a detriment in the marketplace in the light of changing circumstances. It is a reasonable way in which to approach the matter. I do not believe that anyone could conceive that the Government are trying to take upon themselves draconian powers for the purpose of interfering at a later date in an unacceptable way. We are putting the Competition Bill in place and have considered the interface between it and European legislation, which we do only once every two decades or so. Changes in that other jurisdiction could impact on this legislation, so we need the capacity to deal with such adjustments. I hope that that explanation will persuade the hon. Member for Daventry to withdraw his amendment.

<P>

<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I thank the Minister for that explanation, which obviously supplements, complements and, to some extent, strengthens remarks made in another place. It is right that all members of the Committee should be concerned about these issues and the possible extension of Government powers. We realise that in current parliamentary circumstances it is not easy to regard even the existence of an affirmative resolution procedure as being a definitive way of safeguarding our concerns. Nevertheless, given the Minister's assurances, which we may need to refer to in the future, with a little reluctance I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Clause 20 ordered to stand part of the Bill.
<H4><center>Schedule 1</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusions: Mergers and Concentrations</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 43, line 10, leave out `before' and insert `at'.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 24 to 28.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Daventry and for South Cambridgeshire for their remarks. An issue raised by the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire may require a note from me after I have checked Hansard.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 relate to provisions on clawback in the exclusion for mergers from the chapter I prohibition in schedule 1. Amendments Nos. 25, 26, 27 and 28 relate similarly to exclusions in schedule 3 for agreements that have received directions under section 21(2) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 and for agreements relating to agricultural products.
<P>
Under certain circumstances, if the director general is giving a power to withdraw the benefit of an exclusion from the chapter I prohibition, he must first obtain relevant information. Therefore, he is to have the power to require information from any party to the agreement. Failure to provide it without reasonable excuse would enable the director general to end the exclusion.
<P>
The provisions in the Bill describing the test of failure to provide information are not quite accurate enough. Our amendments change the wording from
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If before the end of such a period . . . a person fails . . . to comply''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``If at the end of such a period . . . a person has failed . . . to comply''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The existing wording might be said to refer to someone failing before the end of the period in which information is required by the director general to comply with that requirement. Our amendments make it clear that the test is whether someone has failed to comply at the end of the period, which is an important distinction. It is not our intention for action to be taken before the end of the process. We want to make the drafting clear by changing the word ``before'' to ``at''.
<P>
These are technical amendments, which I hope the Committee will accept.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To avoid any doubt, I refer to my interest in agricultural agreements, although I cannot imagine that that has any relevance to the amendment, which the Minister explained well and helpfully clarified to the Committee. I rise to ask the Minister about the nature of the information that the director general will request. Given that the director general is a public official, that he is suitable for the job and, presumably conducts himself professionally, it would nevertheless be helpful if the Minister would clarify that the information will be relevant and proportionate to the objective. I do not anticipate that the director general will ask trade associations and others for information that will be difficult to find, but clearly it needs to be in the form of a relatively sensible set of questions and a doable set of answers that can be used to reach informed conclusions.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> This is a highly technical subject, so I hope that the Committee will bear with me. Under the terms of the clawback criteria, the director general has to decide whether an agreement will, if not excluded, infringe the chapter I prohibition and whether to grant it an unconditional exemption. He will, therefore, be looking for information that is relevant to that decision. Later in the Bill, processes are laid down about how the competition authority can seek information and the rights of the individuals from whom information is sought. The competition authority must decide what information is required to make a determination on whether the exemption should continue or be excluded. Once that decision is made, the OFT will have to abide by the rules of the competition authority in seeking that information and in respecting people's rights in the process.
<P>
There is a range of processes and we have put safeguards in place at each stage. The processes will be put in place only after the publication of draft proposals and consultation. In each case, the system will ensure that individuals are not only dealt with fairly, but that they can make a positive input into the system. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts my explanation.
<P>
Amendment agreed to.
<P>
Amendment made: No. 24, in page 43, line 11, leave out `fails' and insert `has failed'.--[Mr. Ian McCartney.]
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Lansley:</B> One point arises on the drafting of schedule 1. Paragraph 1(2), at line 13, states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``directly related and necessary to the implementation''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>The same wording is used at line 40 in paragraph 3(2)(b) in relation to newspapers. Rightly or wrongly, the Government are trying to ensure maximum consistency with EU jurisprudence and terminology. Certainly it is the case in those clauses that incorporate articles 85 and 86 of the treaty of Rome, that is done in language as close to the original as could be achieved.
<P>
I believe that EC terminology would use the phrase ``directly related and ancillary to''. If courts are offered different phrases, it is possible that they may seek to construe the language differently, arriving at a doctrine either of what is necessary to the achievement of a merger or of what is ancillary to such an agreement. Will the Minister explain why different terminology is used?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> In schedule 1, we are trying to provide an effective system of merger control, with relatively quick decisions being made in those cases--the majority--that do not raise significant competition concerns. The Government therefore value the approach of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and intend that the current framework of considering such matters should continue essentially unchanged under the new Competition Commission.
<P>
During the passage of the Bill in another place, and subsequently, individuals and organisations gave us their views on schedule 1. Some were in favour, some against, but in general they helped to develop our proposals, and the reasons for them were clearly understood. If I am wrong, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman, but I believe that no significant inquiries were made about the wording. Indeed, doubts about the wording would undermine people's capacity to understand the proposal, and would act to its detriment. I take the hon. Gentleman's point in the spirit in which it was made, but the wording is the result of consultation between organisations and individuals. The proposals are adequate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Schedule 1, as amended, agreed to.
<H4><center>Schedule 2</center></H4>
<H4><center>Exclusions: Other Competition Scrutiny</center></H4>
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule be the Second schedule to the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> A schedule of this length deserves a moment's consideration, although, to be honest, some of us find our eyes glazing over especially when the provisions refer to other legislation with which we may not be entirely au fait.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
To use the phrase that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire used, although in a different context, the purpose of the schedule might be to avoid a double jeopardy arrangement and to provide for a competition filter on the activities of various companies under other legislation, where appropriate. Moreover, the schedule provides that a monopoly that discharges public interest functions, albeit through privately owned and managed activities in relation to other pieces of legislation, should be allowed to continue. Will the Minister clarify the position?
<P>
There is a second point to be made about changes that may or may not take place in the future if, for example, there are changes to the Financial Services Act 1986. The Minister may have anticipated my mentioning that, given that there will be a new raft of complicated legislation on such matters from which, thankfully, I have escaped by transferring from shadow Treasury responsibilities to those of the Department of Trade and Industry. If such changes are made, it must be ensured that the dialogue is conducted sensibly so that the amended pieces of legislation fit together. That is much in the spirit of what the Minister was saying vis-a-vis European changes in relation to the chapter II prohibition.
<P>
My third and final point concerns recognised self-regulatory organisations or protected agreements. Let us consider something that seems sensible, seems to be advancing public policy and has stood the test of time, such as a recognised stock exchange or a banker's clearing house. There is not much sense in having more than one, but circumstances can change. Often, technology will change cases and provide new opportunities. There may be cases where there has been disagreement between various parties in the private sector and a rival organisation is set up.
<P>
Given our exchanges about the dangers of disaffected persons trying to use the Bill as a lever to attack other organisations that are trying to act in good faith, I should like the Minister to explain how such action will be filtered out. We want a simple assurance that in each case, whether it be the Financial Services Act 1986 or the Environmental Act 1995, the two pieces of legislation can fit together not only now but in their dynamic path as they evolve over time. We also want an assurance that this extremely complex schedule will not provide a charter for disaffected people to blast apart arrangements that are clearly in the public interest and in the interest of players in the private sector.

<br>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I will not try to explain what is a complex arrangement in detail. The hon. Member for Daventry was right to use the financial services sector as an example. We are not in the business of ensuring that the provision is a nark's charter--to use vernacular language. We are trying to establish effective legislation that would provide effective remedies where there were clear abuses of competition in the market place.
<P>
The schedule provides a desirable exclusion for certain matters that are the subject of separate competition scrutiny, thereby avoiding unnecessary overlap with the chapter I prohibition. A number of existing enactments provide that the regulatory regimes that they set up are to be subject to particular competition scrutiny arrangements. We consider that those arrangements provide an equivalent level of competition scrutiny to chapter I of the Bill, but they are specifically tailored to the circumstances of each regulatory regime.
<P>
To some extent, we touched on that issue during the passage of a previous Bill, when we were trying to produce an interface between different, complex pieces of legislation. As I shall demonstrate, we went to a great deal of effort to ensure that in each area where another piece of legislation may be used, there is a clear interface so that it is clear how the pieces of legislation are related and which is to be used in the event of a potential abuse.
<P>
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 is disapplied or modified in respect of the matters that are the subject of such scrutiny arrangements. We consider that similar treatment should be applied to the chapter I prohibition in respect of matters that are the subject of such scrutiny arrangements, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication. The schedule therefore provides for the chapter I prohibition to be disapplied or its enforcement limited in respect of certain agreements that are subject to separate competition scrutiny under those enactments.
<P>
The schedule falls into four parts, each of which deals with a particular competiton scrutiny regime. The Financial Services Act 1986 deals with the regulation of investment businesses. Part II of the Companies Act 1989 and its equivalent in Northern Ireland deal with the supervision and qualification of company auditors. The Broadcasting Act 1990 deals with, among other things, Channel 3 news provision and networking arrangements, and the Environment Act 1995 deals with, among other things, producer responsibility schemes. Schedule 2 in general amends those enactments so that they make similar provision in respect of the chapter I prohibition to that which they make at present for the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which will be repealed by clause 1.
<P>
It may be helpful to the Committee if I say a little about how the processes of competition scrutiny in those enactments operate. It will be best to take as an example the Act mentioned by the hon. Member for Daventry--the Financial Services Act 1986, which was the earliest of those enactments--as its arrangements for competition scrutiny have to a greater or lesser extent been followed by later legislation.
<P>
The Act provides for certain financial services bodies that make rules binding their members to submit those rules to competition scrutiny when they apply for recognition for the purposes of the Act. Those bodies include the self-regulating organisations that regulate people who carry on investment businesses, the recognised investment exchanges, which makes rules about the conduct of the investment markets, and recognised clearing houses, which make rules about the settlement of investment transactions.
<P>
It is worth noting that the rules of the Financial Services Authority are also subject to competition scrutiny under the Act, but as those rules are statutory, rather than enforced by agreement, they will not be caught by the chapter I prohibition, which concerns only agreements. As the chapter I prohibition does not apply, there is no need to disapply it to the rules themselves--though it must be disapplied to any agreements made by authorised persons with others that contain restrictions required by the authority's rules. That is very plain. The rules of the other bodies may constitute an agreement that is caught by the chapter I prohibition, but as the Act's competition scrutiny arrangements apply, there is no need for the prohibition to apply.
<P>
The Act provides that a recognition order cannot be made in respect of a self-regulating organisation, investment exchange or clearing house unless the Treasury is satisfied that the rules and guidance of those organisations and their arrangements
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``do not have, and are not intended or likely to have, to any significant extent, the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing competition''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or, if they
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``have, or are intended or likely to have''--<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
such an effect to a significant extent, that effect
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``is not greater than is necessary for the protection of investors''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
or for compliance with certain European Community directives. The directives concerned are the second banking co-ordination directive, the investment services directive and the third insurance directive. Those directives harmonise the procedures for exercising the free movement of service rights. In effect, therefore, the test assesses agreements for their effects on competition and whether the effects are necessary to carry out the purpose of the regulatory regime.
<P>
The special competition regime does not apply only in the initial recognition process: the Treasury is given a continuing role and may take appropriate action if the test that I have described is not met or is no longer met.
<P>
The competition regime provides a role for the Director General of Fair Trading in scrutinising the rules, regulations and arrangements, and for reporting to the Treasury on their effects on competition, both prior to recognition and on an on-going basis. He is also given powers for investigating matters that he will consider in his report.
<P>
Similar arrangements apply in respect of the recognition of professional bodies, with some minor differences arising out of the fact that, unlike other bodies, professional bodies have a wider regulatory role than the regulation of investment business. That competition scrutiny regime, like the others covered by the schedule, provides a tough and tested competition regime, which there is no need to duplicate by applying the chapter I prohibition. I hope that schedule 2 will stand part of the Bill.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`an agreement to the extent to which it is made in order to comply with a legal requirement.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 121.
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> The purpose of the legal requirements exclusion is to ensure that no one can be required to do something, for example, by a regulation or by a licence condition, and at the same time be prohibited from doing it under the Bill.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 120 and 121 add the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the extent to which''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to the exclusion from both prohibitions, for compliance with legal requirements. They are technical amendments. Their purpose is to ensure consistency and clarity in the way that exclusions operate. We want the exclusion in paragraph 5 of the schedule to apply clearly and unambiguously in cases in which parts of an agreement or conduct go beyond matters that are legally required. We want to make it clear that the agreement or conduct should be excluded only to the extent that it was made or undertaken to comply with a legal requirement.
<P>
When a legal requirement leaves a company discretion in how it complies, as, for example, in the terms of an agreement, we want the exercise of that discretion to be capable of being considered under the prohibitions. When a company has a choice about how to comply with a legal requirement, we want to be sure that, if it does so, it does so in a way that is not anti-competitive, and that if it does so in a way that is anti-competitive, that it is caught by the prohibition.
<P>
Furthermore, if a company puts provisions in an agreement, we want to be sure that what goes beyond the legal requirement falls to be considered under the prohibitions. For example, companies in the telecoms sector are often legally required to enter into agreements governing the connection of their networks. However, the terms of the agreement are subject to commercial negotiation, and could be used to try to obtain a competitive advantage over a smaller rival. It would clearly be wrong for anti-competitive terms in an agreement to be excluded merely because the agreement itself was legally required. It is important that a legal requirement in the agreement does not offer a defence to those who want to include something in the agreement that would undermine competition and give them a competitive advantage, especially over small and emerging companies in the sector.
<P>
The courts may interpret the existing wording in that way. However, the amendments provide certainty and clarity from the outset. The wording
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``to the extent to which''
<P>
</UL></FONT>is already used in a number of other exclusions, for example in the exclusion for mergers in schedule 1. We should be consistent in the use of those words in the Bill.

<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 56, line 17, at end insert--
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`Recommendations by trade associations The Chapter I prohibition shall not apply to recommendations made by trade associations to their members where those recommendations reflect the terms of an agreement negotiated in good faith between the relevant trade association and an independent third party to whom such recommendations shall be applied, whether such recommendations relate to the fixing of prices or to any other trading conditions.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendment deals with trade associations, but I want to refer particularly to the music business. I believe that the Minister has already received advice from interested parties--the Music Publishers Association and the British Phonographic Industry--but it is important that he should have the opportunity to reply in a little more detail to some of the matters that have been raised.
<P>
Trade associations, which are frequently asked by organisations such as broadcasters and orchestras that wish to use music, often agree tariffs for the use of their members' works; and such organisations, or their members, generally use musical works frequently and on a large scale. Those organisations may be using the works through the hire or printed music for the purposes of performing or recording them, or through the licensing of the copyright in the work for the purpose of the reproduction of live performances or broadcasts.
<P>
Agreed tariffs with such trade associations save publishers the expense of negotiating individual licences, and enable those parties to organise their affairs more constructively. The practice encourages a wider use of musical repertoire, which ultimately results in greater consumer choice.
<P>
I shall be brief because the Minister is probably well versed in the matter. The key point is that such recommendations are not imposed unilaterally by trade associations but are made only on request, and more often by the user of the music rather than the members. They are not binding on either party, and the rates can be amended, but they provide a useful starting point for negotiations. They therefore ease the burdens on small businesses.
<P>
It is wrong to place an unreasonable burden on trade associations, whose recommendations were not exempted under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. The amendment is a probing amendment, but I would welcome the Minister's response.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> In the same spirit as the hon. Member for Eastleigh, I shall speak briefly. It is an interesting question, but it is a subject on which I confess to be an amendment sceptic. I await the Minister's response.
<P>
We all agree that trade associations have an important role. They are particularly useful in relation to a rather fragmented industry, which may deal with one or two, or a limited number of major customers, for which they can get matters into order and to which they represent a degree of countervailing power--a wider issue than the amendment allows for.
<P>
However, in some cases trade associations will clearly want to negotiate on behalf of their members and produce guidelines. The hon. Member for Eastleigh suggested one in relation to music publishing. We had some exchanges on that matter earlier, and the hon. Gentleman elicited a good deal of sympathy for the music business.
<P>
As the hon. Gentleman was speaking I was reminded of a folk memory and of the days when I was associated with the National Farmers Union, of which I am still a member. In those days, farmers offered services to neighbours, probably on an irregular and informal basis. For instance, if a farmer had finished his ploughing he could help a neighbour finish his, and one could apply to the local NFU secretariat to obtain a recommended list of prices for such work. It was not done often, but one always wanted to be fair to the other person.
<P>
As I recall it, but I have not had time to check, such arrangements fell foul of the difficulties on recommendations for markets that arose with the NFU and its membership, to which I referred in an earlier debate. I am sure that there are many such cases, some of which are not obviously inimical to competition and might be helpful to those involved. However, I am sceptical because I am unsure whether the wording will create difficulties. The Minister should give us a response; we would then have at least rehearsed the matter properly.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I, too, rise to speak to amendment No. 107 for the same reason that I spoke to a previous amendment: the music industry's involvement in my constituency. I shall not repeat the speech of the hon. Member for Eastleigh, who cited the case of the Music Publishers Association, which involves 3,000 members. The association is a member of British Music Rights, as is the Performing Rights Society.
<P>
If you will allow me, Mr. Maxton, I shall briefly digress. When I served on Camden borough council, one of my colleagues, an elderly alderman, bore the name of Luigi Denza. He was the son of the author of ``Funiculi, Funicula''--a great song composed to celebrate the first venture of Thomas Cook, which was to build a funicular railway up Mount Vesuvius in the 19th century. Luigi Denza always told me how proud he was, given the world in which we live, that countries as poor as Ghana would send him a cheque for &#163;13, &#163;17 or &#163;21 for the royalty on performances of ``Funiculi, Funicula'' during the previous year. When a system across the world is as honourable as that, it is important that it should be able to work smoothly. Therefore, I support the probing amendment moved by the hon. Member for Eastleigh.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I call Mr. McCartney.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Sing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian McCartney:</B> I must rebuff that request on this occasion. The ability to sing, even for my supper, is not one of my qualities. If the hon. Gentleman has any other request, I shall consider it carefully. However, I shall side step that request--to the relief of all concerned.
<P>
I understand that, last Thursday, when I was not in Committee, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said that 183 trade association agreements had been found subject to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, 133 of which--more than 70 per cent.--had been found not significant in competition terms. That is an example of how the formalisation of the existing regime results in too many harmless agreements being caught.
<P>
We must find a new way to deal with such matters that provides protection or remedy where required, but does not catch obviously fair and reasonable arrangements or involve small and medium-sized enterprises in a bureaucratic paper chase, which allows those acting anti-competitively to get away with it. All of us in Committee are at one on that principle.
<P>
The mechanism in the Bill will provide a fair basis for the assessment of trade association activity. European Union jurisprudence is not the only way to guide trade associations in assessing the application of prohibitions to their activities. I understand that the director general will also issue guidelines specifically on trade associations to explain the application of the prohibition in practice to their activities. I shall ensure that the director general receives a copy of the report of what has been said about trade associations during this debate. That will assist him in the preparation of the guidelines. I hope that that is helpful to the Committee.
<P>
In case of doubt about the application of the prohibitions, it will be possible to seek guidance or formal decision from the Director General of Fair Trading under clauses 12 and 13. If trade association agreements or practices are found to have an appreciable affect on competition, it will be possible to seek an exemption under the chapter I prohibition. The exemption criteria, which are modelled on article 85(3) of the European treaty, will provide a fair assessment of any countervailing benefits.
<P>
Article 85 has applied to the United Kingdom for more than 25 years. Trade associations have lived with EU competition law for that period without special treatment. Therefore, no such special treatment is warranted at the domestic level. At present, a trade association must consider the application of article 85 even if its activities were confined to United Kingdom territory and it dealt only with UK companies and organisations. On several occasions, the Commission and the court have held that article 85 applies to agreements between companies in the same member state.
<P>
For example, in the Dutch case, the members of a cement price-fixing cartel argued that their agreement could not affect trade between member states because it was a national cartel, limited to the territory of the Netherlands, which did not apply to imports and exports. Such action would have been severely detrimental to other countries whose companies wanted to get into the cement market in the Netherlands. What was a national cartel sought to put unacceptable barriers in the way of free trade and competition in that sector, and the court rightly applied article 85 in those circumstances.
<P>
The European Court of Justice held that the agreement satisfied the effect on inter-state trade tests and it was, therefore, subject to article 85(1). Such agreement between parties in a single state can affect inter-state trade for the purposes of article 85.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> It is self-evidently true that that would happen in small countries, such as the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Belgium, and that article 85, governing inter-state trade, would deal with intra-state trade. Does the Minister agree that that does not apply to the cement industry in the United Kingdom because it would not be feasible to transport cement by different modes, including a sea crossing, before it entered the market?
<P>
<B>Mr. McCartney:</B> It would depend on the nature of the business and the contractual arrangements. The company may want to provide access to that market via a contractual arrangement, for example. That arrangement would be undermined because of the cartel. If a United Kingdom company wanted to get into the cement market or any other market by a relationship with a company in the Netherlands that was outside the cartel, it could not do so. It is important that in those circumstances companies that want to form contractual arrangmeents are not prevented from doing so because of the effects of a cartel.
<P>
	The cartel was set up to prevent other companies operating in the Netherlands from being free standing, or for companies outside that country to be able to make approaches. I am not talking about just the United Kingdom; the Netherlands have borders with countries that are a minute's drive away and they would be excluded. We must consider the provisions in terms of the European legislation to ensure that, at a national level, no one acts anti-competitively to the detriment of other individuals.
<P>
	We must be wary about a blanket exclusion as proposed in the amendment. For example, if the third party was a competitor of the trade association members, it would give a blank cheque for competing companies to carve up the market and that would be unacceptable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment on the basis that we are trying to provide a balanced framework to allow trade associations and their members to operate legitimately. If other members operate differently, we will have the capacity to remedy the situation. If an organisation operates in a way that is detrimental to a trade association, the association would have the capacity to seek a remedy. There must be a balance.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Chidgey:</B> I listened carefully to the Minister. I dare say that the devil, as always, is in the detail, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, That this schedule, as amended, be the Third schedule in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> The Minister will have noticed that we have been relatively gentle with him, but he should not regard that as a sign that we are entirely happy with all that is contained in the scheudles.
<P>
When we looked at the mess and muddle in the drafting of the schedules, we decided to handle them in two ways. The first was by holding extensive debates on the two central prohibitions, when, with your permission, Mr. Maxton, we introduced material from the schedules. Secondly, we decided to test some of our biggest fears about the provisions for exclusions in schedule 3 by tabling new clauses--in particular, a new clause testing how the Bill will apply to the water industry, which is one area in which there needs to be considerably more competition, and in which we have some worries about the meaning and implication of some of the let-outs and exclusions contained in the schedule.
<P>
I should like to take a few minutes to ask the Minister some questions about why schedule 3 is drafted as it is, and what impact he imagines some of the exclusions will have. It will be useful for us and others to have more idea why so many exclusions are needed from a Bill that was intended, we are told, to be tougher than what has gone before.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
The style of the schedule is muddled; it mixes general and specific suppositions within the same rather bedraggled structure. It singles out certain industries--such as coal, steel and agriculture--for special mention by name, without mentioning other industries that face special problems. We have had a lengthy debate this morning and at other times about the newspaper industry, and yet there is nothing in the schedule about the newspaper industry, although the special circumstances of agriculture, coal and steel are recognised. That is curious, and it would be interesting to know what other industries were considered for specific exclusions for some of their practices, and why it was decided to light upon only two--agriculture and coal and steel.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will my right hon. Friend concede that in any case, while those specified areas no doubt to some extent reflect treaty obligations and lobbying, there is an overall filter on the grounds of public policy, which appears not to have been used in relation to those industries?
<P>
<B>Mr. Redwood:</B> Indeed, once again my hon. Friend is ahead of me, as my next query was to be just that: why does some of the schedule contain general exemptions by theme, when elsewhere it contains specific exemptions relating to particular legislation and particular industries? For example, why is there both a general public policy exemption and a specific exemption for the planning system? I agree that there is a danger that the planning system represents an anti-competitive practice, and that it needs to be excluded, but it is by no means the only thing that local government and central Government do that is anti-competitive. Why does it merit a specific exemption or exclusion, while other activities are covered by the catch-all of general public policy?
<P>
It would be helpful if the Minister would tell us what scope he and his colleagues intend to make of the general public policy exclusion. We are afraid that if they apply too generous an interpretation to that exemption of public policies, it could become a major coach and horses driven through the anti-competitive intent of the Bill.
<P>
Even more worrying is paragraph 4 of schedule 3, which covers
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Services of general economic interest.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the most worrying and perplexing exclusion of all. To remind the Committee, it states that neither prohibition
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``applies to an undertaking entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That covers an awful lot of nasty practices, which we are told that the prohibition will not stop. The only limitation of that provision is:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``in so far as the prohibition would obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to that undertaking.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Minister owes the Committee an explanation of why the Bill contains such a wide-ranging exclusion. He should tell us what type of revenue-producing monopolies or services of general economic interest--an even wider category--he wants to be exempted. We are not persuaded that it is a good idea to exempt such wide-ranging areas of interest. We hope that the Minister, on reflection, will table an amendment that will either narrow its scope or remove it altogether. What he seeks to capture by paragraph 4 of schedule 3 would more than adequately be covered by the equally comprehensive public policy exemption under paragraph 7.
<P>
I repeat my example of the water industry. We in the Conservative party feel that the changes in the water industry are far from complete. It was sensible to transfer ownership to the private sector and I note that the Government are not about to change that, but in order to deliver a proper service and lower prices for customers, we need to go further and introduce competition.
<P>
This is relevant to our debate on schedule 3. Does the Minister intend to use either paragraphs 4 or 7 of the schedule to prevent the build-up of more competition in the water industry? We would regard that as foolish and we would worry further about the Bill's scope and the exclusions to it under schedule 3. It would be possible to deem the water industry to be a revenue-producing monopoly; it certainly operates a service of general economic interest. Is it the Minister's intention to shelter the water industry from competition that might improve its standards of service? Does he intend to use the public policy paragraph and say that, because the water industry is an agent of general environmental policies pursued by both European and British levels of government, it should be exempt? Another example of problems with the schedule and the water industry comes in paragraph 6, referring to the avoidance of conflict with international obligations. Perhaps the Minister has in mind to deem the requirements placed on the water industry for environmental improvement as evidence of an international obligation. Is he using paragraph 6 to exempt the water industry on the ground that our international obligations through the EC and elsewhere require us to meet certain improved standards of water hygiene and that those standards require protection against monopoly or pricing?
<P>
I hope that I have illustrated in my brief analysis that by taking only one industry, such as water, there are several ways in which the Minister could stifle at birth the competition that we want, or prevent the conception of any such competition. We want to know whether that is the Minister's intention and which of the routes that I have suggested he would be prepared to use. He owes the Committee an explanation as to why there are such huge loopholes in the legislation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Brooke:</B> I hope on this occasion that I shall not test the limits of your patience, Mr. Maxton. I am happy that the debate on modernisation of the House last Thursday evening allows me, and the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, to quote direct from verbatim text in the House of Lords. It is just possible that I shall go down in the history of Parliament as the last Member to have offended against that law, as I did in Committee last Thursday morning--less than 12 hours before it became legal. You may go down as the last Chairman to issue a rebuke on that subject, Mr. Maxton.
<P>
I apologise for the lateness in tabling amendment No. 163, which is starred on the amendment paper. The amendment refers to the Committee of Advertising Practice and the Advertising Standards Authority, and reflects their concern about the serious impact that the Bill will have on the United Kingdom's effective system for the self-regulation of advertising.
<P>
In contrast to the position throughout much of Europe, the regulation of non-broadcast advertising is not the subject of significant Government intervention and statutory control, but rather compliance with strict self-imposed rules by those who commission, prepare and publish advertising. The CAP, set up in 1961, is the body that devises and enforces the British codes of advertising and sales promotion. Its members include organisations that represent the advertising and sales promotion industries as well as most non-broadcast media business.
<P>
The ASA, with which the CAP shares a joint secretariat, was set up in 1962. It operates independently of both the Government and the industry and is responsible for ensuring that the self-regulatory system works in the public interest. Its activities include investigating complaints and conducting research. The self-regulatory system restricts the ability of advertisers to say what they want in their advertising, through both the codes and the implementation of ASA decisions by CAP members. To that extent, the system acts to stop, restrict or distort competition.
<P>
However, the need for such a system in the absence of, and in preference to, full statutory control has not been challenged seriously in public by the advertising industry or consumer bodies. Broadly speaking, the system was accepted and blessed by the Director General of Fair Trading after an exhaustive inquiry in 1978 and it has been accepted and praised by Governments ever since, including the present Government and their predecessor. The decisions of the ASA are subject to judicial review by the courts.
<P>
Particulars of the codes have been furnished to the Director General of Fair Trading as required by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. Particulars of the underlying arrangements made by individual members to ensure compliance with the codes have also been furnished, although that is being checked. I believe that in most, if not all, cases directions have been given under section 21(2) of the Act.
<P>
The relatively secure legal position will be undermined in several ways when the Bill is enacted. Although the CAP has no reason to doubt that the OFT will continue to take a favourable view of the position under chapters I and II prohibitions, it is worried that parties who are aggrieved at the way in which the codes impact on their activities will, in future, be able to take legal proceedings against it for both injunctive relief and damages for breach of statutory duty.
<P>
At present, the activities of the ASA are capable of being reviewed judicially but, of course, judicial proceedings can be brought only with the leave of the court. No such filtering process will exist under the Competition Bill. Even the threat of litigation may have a significant chilling effect on the ability of the self-regulatory system properly to control advertising to the detriment of consumers and responsible advertisers.
<P>
The fact that section 21(2) directions have been given means that chapter I prohibition will not apply to the CAP's activities. However, that will be true only until there is a ``material variation'' to the arrangements. It is not clear to the CAP exactly what is meant by that phrase. In any event, it is both inevitable and desirable that the codes and their impact should be reviewed regularly and adapted, as necessary, to meet changing circumstances. It is likely therefore that, within a relatively short time after the Bill is in force, a material variation will occur and the exclusion in paragraph 2 of schedule 3 will no longer apply.
<P>
When that happens, it will be necessary for the CAP to apply for an individual exemption. Unless that is widely drawn, it is likely that the CAP will need to revert to the OFT each time that there is a variation to the codes or to its membership. In any event, an exemption can be granted only for a finite period. The net result will be an enormous administrative burden for the CAP, its members and the OFT. The chapter II prohibition will apply potentially to their activities as the Bill comes into force. Although they will be able to seek a decision from the Director General of Fair Trading that it does not apply, they will remain vulnerable to third party action.
<P>
	I appreciate that the OFT has said that it does not expect to take many formal decisions and that the majority of cases will be settled by means of an administrative letter. Even if the CAP were to apply for a decision granting an individual exemption from the chapter I prohibition and a decision that the chapter II prohibition did not apply, it is not certain that the OFT will formally grant such decisions and that it will achieve the legal security that it needs to carry out its functions effectively.
<P>
	The ASA is likely to be--the CAP may be--a public authority under the Human Rights Bill. Both may be exposed to judicial review in respect of any action infringing an advertiser's freedom of expression, which includes potentially all the ASA rulings that uphold complaints about advertisements. The advertiser will have the right, as under the Competition Bill, to claim damages. There is no requirement to show bad faith as is presently the case for a damages claim in judicial review proceedings.
<P>
	The chairman of the ASA has sought clarification from the Lord Chancellor--
<P>
	It being One o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.
<P>
	Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.
