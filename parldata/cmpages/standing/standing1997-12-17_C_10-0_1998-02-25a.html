<P>
<H5>4.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster </B>(Worcester): On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. We made relatively slow progress this morning, so I intend to move a new sittings motion later this evening.
<H4><center>New clause 21</center></H4>
<H4><center>Stalking, and flushing from cover</center></H4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`._(1) A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.)(1) if he uses a dog to stalk a wild mammal, or to flush it from cover, for the purpose_
<P>
(a) of obtaining food for human consumption, or
<P>
(b) of controlling the number of a particular species in a particular area, in order to safeguard the welfare of that species in that area, or
<P>
(c) of protecting sheep or other livestock, fowl or game birds from attack by wild mammals.
<P>
(2) Subsection (1) applies to a person only if he takes reasonable steps to ensure that the wild mammal is shot as soon as possible after it is located or emerges from cover.
<P>
(3) In this section "cover" does not include cover below ground level.'._[Mr. Michael J. Foster.]</UL></FONT>
<P>

<P>
Brought up, and read the First time.
<P>
Question proposed [this day], That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
Question again proposed.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I remind the Committee that with 
this it will be convenient to take the following: 
New clause 17_Terrier work_
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `._A person does not commit an offence under section (Prohibition of hunting, &c.)(1) if he uses a terrier for the purposes of digging out and shooting a wild mammal for the necessary management and control of the wild mammal or of wild mammals of that species.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
New clause 8_Exemption in respect of certain places used by wild mammals_<P>

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> `A person shall not be guilty of an offence under this Act if he causes or permits a dog to enter any structure or place, whether subterranean or not, used or likely to be used by a wild mammal for shelter or protection.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Garnier </B>(Harborough): That is the most useful information that we have had from the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster) for some time.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire 
(Mr. Paterson) asked earlier about the meaning of the word "species" and the phrase "a wild mammal". "Species" normally means the genus or type of animal, and the phrase "a wild mammal" needs no explanation_
there are, of course, many types of wild mammal, which can be divided into various categories or species.
<P>
The new clause would apply to red deer, foxes, sheep and other livestock, which are wild mammals, but not to fowl and game birds, which are not mammals. I presume that humans are mammals_"human consumption" is mentioned in paragraph (a)_but I do not know whether the hon. Member for Worcester has any scientific knowledge about that. Dogs, of course, are mammals. Beyond that, my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire can use his own powers of investigation and an English dictionary. I hope that that answers his question about the meaning of those words.
<P>
More important is the legal meaning of the words in the new clause. I await with interest the reply of the hon. Member for Worcester to my questions. I hope that he will treat the committee with greater candour than he did earlier, when we discussed new clause 10. Over the past two or three weeks, the hon. Gentleman has produced a radically different Bill, although in November he presented us with what he said was a reasonably perfect Bill. It ill behoves the hon. Gentleman not to respond to our concerns.

<P>
<B>Mr. James Gray </B>(North Wiltshire): Like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier), I am deeply concerned about the new clause, which is extraordinarily badly drafted and massively illogical. In fact, I should be rather pleased if the new clause became law, because it would give supporters of fox hunting many worthwhile loopholes by which we could perfectly happily defend our legitimate sport of fox control.
<P>
Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are the worst-drafted and most illogical paragraphs that I have ever come across. For example, they would allow
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"a dog to stalk a wild mammal, or to flush it from cover for the purpose ... of obtaining food for human consumption".</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have reflected briefly on the meaning of that proposal_it would, for example, permit the use of dogs to flush out game birds. Opponents of the Bill are glad to learn that the hon. Member for Worcester wants to prevent the removal of game shooting from the litany of English country life, although I suspect that he and his advisers might try to do so subsequently. None the less, we welcome the preservation of grouse shooting and pheasant shooting in the Bill. That may be reflected in discussions elsewhere in the House on the right to roam consultation paper, in which the Government have specifically excluded grouse moors in Scotland, where the methods have changed since the driven shooting that Sir Alec Douglas-Home, that great Prime Minister of the grouse moors, and others took part in.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) is the son of a bishop, so he may know that in the early 19th or late 18th century the Bishop of Durham initiated driven grouse shooting across the moors of Durham in the constituency of, I believe, the right hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Foster). I gather that when the bishop became too large to walk, he got the choir of Durham cathedral to drive grouse across the moor so that he could shoot at them as he sat in or near his carriage.
<P>
Not only Conservative Prime Ministers but members of the Church of England have engaged in field sports. We have seen the tolerant attitude taken by bishops in a letter in The Daily Telegraph today.
<p><b>Mr. Gray:</b> I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for referring to the letter in The Daily Telegraph  today from the six rural bishops who spoke in favour of field sports. However, he was incorrect in referring to my father as a bishop. He would turn in his grave if he heard himself described as such, because he was the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, to whom bishops are anathema. He would not necessarily have approved of my field sports activities because, regrettably, he was not a field sportsman. Paragraph 
(a) of new clause 21(1) allows grouse shooting, and we welcome that.
<P>
Most deer that are hunted by hounds are eaten and all deer that are hunted by hounds are shot, contrary to the rather cheap publicity that is often put about by supporters of the Bill who describe deer being torn to pieces by hounds_an image of which they are so fond in another context. Deer that are hunted by hounds are shot and eaten and fit very neatly into paragraph (a). If that was not the intention of the hon. Member for Worcester, perhaps he will clarify the matter.
<P>
Like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, I hope that when the hon. Gentleman replies he will not repeat his performance on clause 10, when he ignored all the points that were legitimately made by hon. Members, barnstormed through his speech, refused to take any interventions or to respond to legitimate points raised and tried to get it over and done with in the shortest possible time. I am unclear whether he did so because of ignorance, inability to respond to our points, terror that our points would overturn his arguments or for some peculiar parliamentary procedural reason. I hope that on this occasion he will be able to respond to our points with more care.
<P>
Paragraph (a) is designed to abolish field sports, yet it provides a number of windows through which they would continue to be permitted.
<P>
Paragraph (b) is equally peculiar because it would allow fox hunting to continue in many parts of England. I shall give an example from my own experience because I am proud of the fact that I take part in fox hunting and I am keen to allow that experience, over many years, to be used for the benefit of the Committee's information. Those of us who are interested in such matters know that in the middle of Salisbury plain there is a colony of stone curlews, one of the rarest birds in Britain. The Royal Artillery hunt, of which I am a member, specifically hunts in and around the area surrounding the stone curlews and the Royal Society of the Protection of Birds and others are clear that it is only because foxes are hunted in that area that the stone curlews continue to exist there. Were it not for us hunting there, the foxes would proliferate and the stone curlews' continued existence would be in doubt.

<P>
As evidence of that I refer the Committee to the two or three years in the mid 1980s when the Ministry of Defence banned fox hunting over the impact area of Salisbury plain, after which local farmers petitioned the Ministry of Defence to allow fox hunting in that area for the very reason that depredations to their chickens, piglets and lambs in the area surrounding the north of Salisbury plain had become so appalling. So the continuing existence of that colony of stone curlews in the north of Salisbury plain is a specific result of fox hunting in the impact area of Salisbury plain.
<P>
<B>Mr. Owen Paterson </B>(North Shropshire): In another recent case, wonderful wild birds called avocets used to live on the coast in Holland, but when hunting was stopped, sadly the foxes took over and all the avocets were eaten. Now there is only a grim, sterile desert, inhabited by foxes and magpies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> That is precisely the likely outcome if fox hunting is abandoned here.
<P>
This paragraph would be welcomed by those of us who are concerned about the stone curlews on Salisbury plain, because it would allow us to continue to stalk and flush out foxes using hounds in order to protect stone curlews.
<P>
We were talking about poor drafting; the paragraph is badly drafted because it is unclear whether using dogs to flush out mammals would be permitted if it promoted the existence of the mammals themselves or the prey of those mammals. In other words, one can interpret the paragraph to mean that if chickens, lambs and piglets in the area are in danger, fox hunting with hounds should be allowed to continue in order to protect them, although the next subsection dictates that the fox would then be shot rather than killed by hounds. The flaw in paragraph (c) is that the whole purpose of fox hunting is to protect livestock, fowl and game birds from attack by wild mammals. That is what fox hunting is all about: so under the new clause, fox hunting would be allowed to continue. We welcome that because it would allow us to continue the pastime that we believe is a sensible and useful part of rural life. However, it sits uneasily in a Bill, the ostensible purpose of which is to ban fox hunting.
<P>
The poor drafting extends to subsection (2), which says that the wild mammal must be,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"shot as soon as possible after it is located or emerges from cover."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am worried about the lack of education about how the countryside works among those who support the Bill. Anyone who has been to see a hunt flushing game out of cover knows perfectly well that, when game emerges from cover, it does so at speed. It is entirely unclear how hon. Members expect game, hunted by a pack of hounds, to be caught and dispatched with a rifle as soon as possible. That is a massive loophole, which I am happy to bring to the Committee's attention because if by some awfulness the Bill becomes law, I would not want the Bill to be a laughing stock, as it would be if the new clause were accepted.
<P>
Equally, subsection (3) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"`cover' does not include cover below ground level."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Will it be necessary for those in control of the pack of dogs being used to flush out game to have surveyed the cover in advance to know whether there are runnels, drains or ditches in which the fox or other game may be hiding, or will they have to survey the cover after flushing the mammals out, or will the police have to survey the cover and decide whether it is below ground level?
<P>
The new clause shows ignorance of the ways of the countryside and of flushing out game, which the hon. Member for Worcester claims to favour, and is so badly drafted that even hon. Members who support the Bill should argue in favour of it being withdrawn. The new clause would bring the Bill and, once again, our deliberations into disrepute. I hope that the hon. Member for Worcester will answer my serious and valid points more fully than he did when replying to the debate on new clause 10.

<P>

<B>Mr. Lembit &Ouml;pik </B>(Montgomeryshire): I was rather shocked by the unprecedented attack on me by the hon. Member for Worcester. Fortunately, I have had a few hours to recover. He implied that I was playing a game. I should briefly like to discuss amendment No. 39, which I tabled, without digressing too far from this debate. I have tried to comment constructively, to make useful interventions and, in particular, to raise core issues. The discussion on new clause 10 was one such example.
<P>
Surely the hon. Member for Worcester realises that the issues matter to me, to the people in Montgomeryshire who elected me and to residents of the countryside who will be directly affected by the Bill. The issues should matter to him. If he wants to be proud of his work, he should be able to justify the philosophical concept that underpins the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester mentioned amendment No. 39, which I believe is connected to new clause 21.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): We are on new clause 17.
<P>
<B>Mr. &Ouml;pik:</B> My amendment has some relevance to new clauses 17 and 18.

<P>
I sent the hon. Member for Worcester a note during our last sitting_it was a private note but as he mentioned it, so shall I. I asked whether there was a prospect of him accepting the amendment. I was not especially optimistic, but I thought that I might as well ask. He made it clear that he would not, and I resolved not to waste the Committee's time by having a pointless debate when I already knew the outcome. But he has issued a challenge, and I think that at some time it will be appropriate to debate the contents of amendment No. 39. I do not want to go in to that now because I have other points to make on new clause 21, so you can relax, Mr. O'Hara_I am not going to deviate too far.
<P>
<H5>4.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I take it that the hon. Gentleman is going to discuss the contents of new clause 21.
<P>
<B>Mr &Ouml;pik:</B> Not only are you an excellent Chairman, 
Mr. O'Hara, but you are also a mind reader because I was about to do that in my next sentence.
<P>
I have a number of concerns about the new clause, but I shall not reiterate all the points already made. My concerns relate, first, to the difference between old clause 5 and new clause 21 and, secondly, to assumptions about terrier work_a matter that I have raised several times.
<P>
The new clause says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if he uses a dog to stalk a wild mammal".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
"A dog"_that is singular. At the very least, the drafting is not clear; at the very worst, by stipulating "a dog", it seeks to ban the process of using hounds to flush from cover. If that is the correct interpretation_I stress that I am not a lawyer_it represents a serious withdrawal from a commitment made when we debated clause 5, which had no such single-dog commitment. It is impossible for one dog to flush an animal from cover efficiently.
<P>
I seek guidance from the Bill's sponsors. What is the justification for that change? I have praised the hon. Member for Worcester many times for his insight and willingness to listen to issues that are of great importance to my constituents and to those in other areas of the United Kingdom where that process is regarded by those in the business as the most effective way to control fox numbers.
<P>
If, indeed, the new clause means "a dog", it will be a serious betrayal of trust. It will be a great shame if that exclusion is not accepted by the Bill's sponsors.
<P>
My hon. Friends have already made point about the definition of "cover". I am not a lawyer, but there seem to be all kinds of problems in limiting flushing out to what is defined in the new clause as any area that does not include cover "below ground level". Aside from the problem of foxes running in and out from under cover, that is a legal quagmire that does not serve the interests of, or clarify, either side of the argument.
<P>
By implication, I am still led to believe that hon. Members who support the Bill do not believe that it is possible to train a terrier to work underground without either the terrier or the animal after which it has been sent sustaining injury. I refute that. Plenty of evidence suggests that some trainers at least have shown themselves capable of training animals not to attack. Consider the logic: in evolutionary terms, where would the self-destructive gene in terriers come from repeatedly to attack animals, which they could merely bark at and contain? I do not doubt that there are occasional skirmishes underground and that those can lead to the injury of one or both of the animals participating in the skirmish. however, that alone is not sufficient justification to ban the many practitioners who have succeed in training their dogs to behave int eh much more common-sense way of controlling the fox until it has been dug out and shot.

<P>
I challenge hon. Members who support the Bill to provide evidence to prove that terriers will necessarily attempt a physical attack. Anyone who has studied the activity in any detail knows that to be false. I mentioned a chap called Barry Wade, who is one of the best in the business. He is not a killer; he does not revel in sending his animals in to suffer. The animals are not mere tools with which he works. They are also his friends_not quite pets, but close, in the same way as any of us have pets. He would not send his animal in to be attacked or to attack knowing that it is likely to sustain serious injury, any more than hon. Members would their cat, dog, or any other pet. I implore hon. Members who support the Bill to think hard about the accusations that they have made about terrier work, and moreover, to present justifications beyond the simple, emotional rhetoric that we have heard many times.
<P>
We must be sensible about exclusions such as those specified in new clause 21, the examination of which leads me to refer to my earlier contribution. This morning, I raised several philosophical questions, which apply rather less directly to new clause 21 than they did to new clause 10, but they remain unanswered. I suspect that they remain unanswered because we have uncovered the deepest contradiction and weakness in logic that the Bill manifests. The Bill is neither logical, consistent or founded on sound principle, so the hon. Member for Worcester did not attempt to answer my questions. Within the bounds of new clause 21, he has the opportunity to do so again. I shall not repeat the questions in detail, but I ask him again: how does he justify the current state of the Bill and simultaneously convince us that a consistency of thought lies beneath its formulation? I do not see such consistency of thought and that is becoming increasingly apparent as we fail to obtain answers to my simple questions. Old clause 5 had a genuine exemption for flushing out; new clause 21 seems to have at least one fatal inconsistency. I appeal to the hon. Member for Worcester to explain the inconsistencies in and the philosophy behind the Bill, or to accept an Opposition amendment to acknowledge that the phrase
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"if he uses a dog to stalk a wild mammal"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
is tantamount to banning flushing.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> In some ways, the hon. Member for Worcester should be congratulated. Fox hunting is one of the grand old traditions of our country and in a matter of weeks the hon. Gentleman has created a new tradition_
the muddle. There is more muddle and confusion every week in the Committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester set out the principles of the Bill in a press release in July, which appears to be totally refuted by new clause 21. In that press release the hon. Gentleman said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The purpose of the Bill is to enhance the protection of wild animals from cruelty by outlawing `sports' that involve hunting with dogs in the UK."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>New clause 21 appears to permit acts that many in favour of the Bill would consider to be cruel to wild animals. In that press release, the hon. Gentleman went on to say:
<ul><font size=-1>"The sponsors and supporters of the Bill believe that the hunting and killing of wild animals by dogs inflicts `unnecessary suffering'."</ul></font>

<P>
New clause 21 refers to only one dog, but I submit that the cruelty is similar if a wild animal is killed by one dog or by two. The press release set out a third principle:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "The Bill's supporters accept that the populations of some wild mammals must be controlled, but believe that in all cases there are more selective and humane solutions than setting dogs on to wild mammals for the primary purpose of pleasure."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, new clause 21(1)(a) permits the setting of a dog on wild animals to obtain food for human consumption, which is a pleasure. The Bill is riddled with inconsistency, but one of the fatal flaws lies in the fact that none of us need to eat meat. There is no necessity to put any bullock, pig or chicken through the misery of going to an abattoir, which must be a frightening death in the last moments. I 
submit that that is an act of cruelty and that hon. Members who support the Bill enjoy their steaks and may even have a chop if they go to the Tea Room later.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> They are all veggies.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I do not think that they are all veggies, but the idea of cruelty has not been thought through. 
Hon. Members who support the Bill have a well-meaning and sentimental idea of the death an animal should have. They have not thought that issue through; all our debates have shown that. There is a muddle about what is a cruel act and what is not.

<P>
That is clear in new clause 21, which shows those hon. members lack of experience of the countryside. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) has spoken about Salisbury plain, which is a vast area, and it is inconceivable that someone could take one dog and expect it to keep track of the animal that it is pursuing. In the area represented by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. &Ouml;pik), there are large wooded areas, hills and valleys, and it is simply unrealistic to think that one dog would be enough for the job. One dog would rapidly get lost and farmers_certainly those in his constituency and in mine_all have more than one dog.
<P>
I hope that the hon. Member for Worcester will deal with that issue. What will happen to people with more than one dog? What if a person goes into a wood with more than one dog and the dogs split? If a person is with a couple of friends as well as his dog when the animal appears, will those friends be implicated in what might occur?
<p>The Bill has been thoroughly badly drafted by the hon. Gentleman's expensive lawyers. I hope that he is working on the principle of no foal, no fee, to which we adhere in the horse industry. The famously expensive Mr. Scrivener really should not be paid for the work that he has done. I hope that Home Office lawyers will be recompensed for the work that he has put on to them. If the hon. Gentleman does pay Mr. Scrivener, I suggest that he gets the cash back later. Every week we come here to find muddle after muddle and more confusion.
<p><b>Mr. Gray:</b> Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a bizarre notion that a householder who owns, for example, two spaniels and who habitually takes them for a walk may put one spaniel to chase a rabbit out of his woodland without breaking the law while putting both spaniels would break the law? The use of "a dog" must be changed if the Bill is to become law.

<P>

<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am grateful for that sensible intervention. The hon. Member for Worcester seems to have been inspired by old prints showing a man with a gun and a pointer next to one little bush. The hon. Gentleman fails to understand what many parts of the British countryside are like. He ought to go to Shropshire, Montgomery and Salisbury plain to see for himself the reality of trying to flush out the permitted animals with just one dog. It is not on, but the hon. Gentleman is making illegal the practical alternative of using two or more dogs_as farmers do every day.
<P>
The Bill will send people to gaol if it becomes an Act. Magistrates in Market Drayton and Oswestry will have to work matters out. As my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) has repeatedly said, we are creating a law that will have drastic consequences for many constituents in wild rural places.
<P>
New clause 21(1)(a) typifies the inconsistencies. It mentions
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"obtaining food for human consumption".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Jugged hare is traditional in many parts of the country, particularly in Shropshire. I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Worcester could manage to listen to this point. If a dog picks up a hare and pursues it for human consumption, would the owner of the dog not be prosecuted? Have I misunderstood that?
<P>
Is the same true of deer? It is most unlikely that a dog could pick up a small deer, such as a fallow deer, but would that be permitted? It is ludicrous that using more than one dog would not be allowed?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The particular absurdity of my hon. Friend's example is that a policeman would have to accompany the hunter to his home where the hunter would have to demonstrate that he had put the hare into a jug, made it into jugged hare and eaten it. No doubt he would have to demonstrate the dirty plates, knives and forks to prove that he had killed the hare for food, not fun. That is absurd.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend who has led towards my next point. Who will commit the offence? I was brought up on a farm and used to go out on a pony with my parents' dogs after rabbits. I will not go into the identity of leverets and hares, as I would have done this morning. However, there were clearly times when dogs_plural_would change from chasing a rabbit to a hare. I would have been culpable for that. Would a farm labourer on a tractor in the same field be culpable if he had stopped the engine to watch? The Bill has not been thought through.
<P>
What would happen if it had occurred near a road and passers-by had stopped to see what was going on? Would they have been culpable? Would they have been participating in my activity? The hon. Member for Worcester looks bewildered.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Bored.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> He may be bored, but people will go to gaol because he is bored by detail which he does not understand. I am trying, perhaps inadequately, to bring home to him the boring reality of what life is like in the countryside.
<P>
The Bill has not been thought through. Who is culpable? Is it the person who owns the dog, the 12year
old boy_as I used to be_who went out with the dog, the passer-by or the man on the tractor? How on earth will a policeman enforce the measure? That has hardly been mentioned. How will the police know whether the jugged hare was from that particular hare? There are DNA tests, of course_the hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) is keen on science. Will there be some sort of public analysis? The proposal is utterly ludicrous and impractical and it has not been thought through. The hon. Gentleman must address those matters when he replies to the debate.
<P>
I am still not clear about an issue that I raised earlier with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough. The second line of the new clause would permit the use of a dog to stalk a wild mammal, if, as stated in paragraph (b), it is to safeguard the welfare of a particular species.

<P>
My entry in "Who's Who" gives my interests as hunting and poultry. That is now a bit of a con because, sadly, the foxes in my wood have eaten all my chickens this winter. I breed cochins and it is not a laughing matter as they are extremely expensive_about £15 a pop. On that basis, would I be allowed to take a dog into my wood to hunt foxes? That happens all the time in Shropshire. A couple of months ago I went to a constituency do and when I returned I heard squawks in the henhouse but I was too late to do anything. All the hens had been killed by a fox. How on earth do I identify which fox was responsible and how do I know whether I can pursue it with a dog? The measure has not been rough through.
<P>
We have discussed terrier work underground to pursue foxes; what about people who go ferreting for rabbits on Sundays? We established earlier that that would be legal, although it is completely contradictory. Ferret men often have terriers, which go down the hole. Will that be allowed The terrier man may not have control of the terrier, but it may go down a hole. it may find other animals underground and pursue them, has that been though through? Will innocent people going about a traditional harmless activity keeping farmers' fields clear of rabbits on a Sunday afternoon go to gaol for six months?
<P>
I mentioned the mole man who catches most of my moles with traps, but he often brings a dog. What happens if a dog, or two dogs, catch a live mole? Has the mole man broken the law? What will the policeman do who looks over the fence? How will he enforce the law?
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester is consulting his hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela Smith) from the League Against Cruel Sports. They have had long enough, and spent enough money but they have still not thought through the details. There has been no definition of the word "hunt" yet. It is all being cast back on the magistrates. That is the Bill's flaw; in my part of the country, magistrates might interpret the word "hunt" in this and other hopelessly woolly measures in a different manner from that of magistrates in other, urban, parts of the country, That, too, has not been tough thoughts. The consequences will be grim; in some parts of the country, people will go to gaol for six months for an offence which elsewhere will be ignored. The hon. Member for Worcester must answer my questions.
<P>
The matter of "cover" is not clearly defined. What happens if an animal runs from a wood into the open and goes back in again? That has not been thought out. What happens if a policeman is watching? What will he do? How will that be defined? Are culverts, drains and banks in a brook cover? How big does a gorse bush have to be before it can be called cover? Some poor magistrate will have to sit down and think up an answer to those questions. I submit that it was for the hon. Member for Worcester to think about those points to begin with, rather than leaving them to be interpreted by magistrates. I urge the Committee to vote against new clause 21, which should be redrafted again in the fine old tradition of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> Perhaps not all members of the Committee know, as not everyone on the Opposition Benches is a lawyer, that under the Interpretation Act 1978 the singular term "a dog" also refers to the plural. Originally we referred in the Bill to a single dog with reference to stalking. We accept that with respect to flushing the practice is to use more than one dog. That will continue under the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. OÏpik:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman. He has no idea how much relief he has provided for me and, no doubt, the good people of mid-Wales, by that reassurance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The term "flushing out" was originally included in the Bill in acknowledgement of current practice_particularly in wales. there was never a question of using a single dog for flushing out. It would be impractical.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I, too, am grateful for the clarification provided by the hon. Gentleman. Do I take it from that that the Royal Artillery fox hounds will continue to be allowed to flush foxes out from deep cover on Salisbury plain as long as the foxes are then shot?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> If the fox hounds are used to flush out a fox from cover to be shot with reasonable speed, as set out in the new clause, that, of course, will be covered. Continued pursuit of a fox by the hounds, will the result that they eat it alive or tear it apart, will not be acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Could the hon. Gentleman define "reasonable steps"?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It would be up to the court to evaluate whether actions amounted to "reasonable steps". It is difficult, if not impossible, to define every word in every item of legislation. It would be impractical to attempt to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ian Cawsey </B>(Brigg and Goole): Does my hon. Friend accept that the term "reasonable" is already in many Acts of Parliament, and is commonly used in court?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B>  Of course, it is a common term, but the hon. Member for North Shropshire, who admitted that he is not a lawyer, may have been unaware of that.<P>

<P>
The hon. Member for North Wiltshire raised the matter of the stone curlew. He should read new clause 21(1)(b) carefully. The idea of the provision is not to allow hunting to protect stone curlews from occasional attack by foxes. It is intended to protect the species. For example, paragraph (b) would permit deer population control. Using a dog to stalk a deer, so that it can be shot as part of control of deer population, is in the interests of deer_
not the piece of grass, for example. Foxes could be shot if that was a way of enabling the fox population to survive. It has nothing to do with the stone curlew population.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> I am grateful for that clarification. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it brings the new clause into even more disrepute? It would be sensible to permit hounds to flush out foxes to protect, in the case of Salisbury plain, the stone curlew. However, to argue that hounds can flush out foxes to protect foxes, but go hang the stone curlew, brings the clause into complete disrepute.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Paragraph (c) covers livestock, sheep, fowl or game birds. The stone curlew may not be covered, but in the countryside_about which I apparently know nothing, but the Bill's opponents know a lot,_foxes prey on wildlife. It would be wrong for human beings to decide to kill every fox because foxes occasionally scavenge.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> rose_<p>
<b>Mr. Foster:</b> I shall give way when I have finished the point. It would be wrong for us to interfere simply because foxes sometimes scavenge or eat a live animal.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The new clause does not protect the stone curlew, or many other rare breeds that are currently protected by the activities of fox hunters. The stone curlew does not fall into the category of fowl, game bird or livestock. It is curious that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to protect grouse, so that they can be saved in the highlands of Scotland, but not the nearly extinct stone curlew on Salisbury plain. That inconsistency brings the clause into disrepute.
<P>
<H5>5.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The Bill prevents farmers, landowners or others from hunting with dogs; it does not prevent them from shooting a fox that attacks a stone curlew.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> That is what they do, anyway.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Of course they do. It is the most humane method of killing a fox that is being a pest.
<P>
<B>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett </B>(Denton and Reddish): The group of amendments includes new clauses 17 and 8. I hope that my hon. Friend will comment on them.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> New clauses 17 and 8 cover terrier work. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is not present, but I will comment on the new clauses.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> he hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is absent because he is attending the debate on the Bill that is being considered on the Floor of the House.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I cast no aspersions on hon. Members who are absent. I am sure that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will read what was said in Hansard.
<p>I shall quote from a magazine called Earth Dog_
Running Dog, which is published in Dyfed. The editor is David Harcombe. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said that terriers could bark underground, avoid underground fights and, therefore, come to no harm. David Harcombe says_
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Was the article written in the past 
200 years?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> It was written in April 1992. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I had lost, in one brief month, my three best terriers, the backbone of my kennels. The same fine shale, heavy and able to pack tight, suffocatingly tight, had claimed them all."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>The terriers had died, not through fighting with another animal but through suffocation. The animals suffered because they had been sent underground in pursuit of a fox.

<p>In the same publication in August 1992, Tony Young wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "I continued to dig, and very hard digging at that. It was early evening and nearly dark when I broke through to two limp and lifeless terriers. The dogs had suffocated digging onto their quarry, receiving a large number of bites in the process."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is another example of dogs suffocating during terrier work. I want the Bill to ban terrier work. Therefore, I cannot accept new clauses 17 and 8.
<P>
In July 1995, David Harcombe wrote:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The fox can punish and his attentions can cause a terrier's head and muzzle to swell like a pumpkin though in this day and age antibiotics control the worst effects."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>The farmer may send a terrier underground without intending to harm a fox, but will a fox know that? Will a fox try to protect the young that may be underground with it? Of course it will. Pain and terror can be inflicted on a terrier. I have more examples of suffocation, but I shall give way.
<P>Mr. Paterson: While we are on the subject of terriers, will the hon. Gentleman deal with the point that I made earlier? What about the ferret man's terrier, which is allowed, under the Bill, to go after a rabbit? What happens if an innocent ferret man, who is enjoying his Sunday afternoon pastime, finds that his terrier has run into a fox?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> New clause 3, which we debated in a previous sitting, states that it is the intention to hunt that is important. By definition, hunting implies intent to hunt a wild mammal that is not a rabbit. If an animal accidentally goes underground chasing a fox, there is clearly no intention to hunt that fox. The scenario that the hon. Gentleman paints would not lead to a prosecution.
<P>
Research has been done into the suffering experienced by terriers in terrier work. In May 1996, Lisa Jenkins said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> "Working terriers are particularly susceptible to fluid loss, they use up a lot of energy while in an environment where there is a shortage of oxygen and where confined space rapidly produces a degree of overheating."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is clear evidence that the dogs suffer, as well as foxes might, in terrier work. That is why I should like it to be banned.
<P>
The hon. Member for North Shropshire asked some questions about jug of hare_I believe that is the expression. [Hon Members: "Jugged hare."] Jugged hare. That is an example of a misunderstanding of whether a dog picks up a hare, or a deer. Under new clause 21, the quarry must be shot. It is not up to the dogs to catch the hare alive, or to catch accidentally the young deer. Under new clause 21, the exemption is that shooting should take place as soon as is reasonable. As a countrydweller, the hon. Member for North Shropshire, should realise and accept that gorse bushes generally_although I may yet be proven wrong_grow above, not below, ground. Gorse bushes would therefore not necessarily be covered under subsection (3).
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. Gentleman has entirely missed the point. We understand that the purpose of the clause is to allow dogs to flush game from cover for that game to be shot, on condition that it is then eaten. In the scenario that has been described, dogs are used to flush game from cover. The game is shot and the carcase is usually thrown in the ditch, and is not eaten. To avoid prosecution under the clause, people would have to prove that they had flushed the animal using dogs, shot it, and eaten it. It is the eating that would enable people to avoid prosecution.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> But clearly paragraphs (b) and (c) contradict that. It is not merely for obtaining food for human consumption that stalking and flushing out will be allowed, as those paragraphs make clear.
<P>
I have attempted to address most of the sensible questions that hon. Members have raised. I ask the Committee to accept new clause 21, but to reject new clauses 17 and 8.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman address the point that I raised this morning?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I understand that one of the central anxieties that the hon. and learned Gentleman expressed this morning about new clause 21 was about the number of dogs.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> And about the burden and standard of proof.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The burden of proof will be placed on the prosecution, as is typical under normal criminal legislation.

New clause 12 was contained in old clause 5(2)(d). It allows the use of a dog to retrieve a hare or rabbit that has been shot. It is accepted that shooters may use a pair of dogs for that purpose. Shooters have no need to fear the Bill. This is not the thin end of the wedge.

<P>
Will the hon. Member for Worcester tell us why the clause is necessary? New clause 3_the first clause of the new Bill as revised_sets out how a person would commit the offence of hunting and who could commit that offence. New clauses 10, 21 and 12 provide exceptions to its rules. The hon. Gentleman's revised, revised, revised, revised Bill means that it is not an offence to hunt game if it is a rabbit_rodents are not game_or to hunt, in the American sense of the word, game birds such as pheasant, grouse, partridge and so on. That is why I think new clause 12 is wholly otiose.

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> We heard a good example this afternoon of not knowing when a jugged hare is a jugged hare. In one sentence, that example encapsulates the great rift in the countryside debate. Will Harlow magistrates know what "game" means? My hon. and learned Friend knows what it means because he represents a rural constituency, but I suspect that magistrates in urban areas where there is not much game will not necessarily know. Are hares or rabbits game?
<P>
<H5>5.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> rose_
<P><b>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</b> Will my hon. and learned Friend give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> Hon. and learned Friend? Things are getting very cosy and cuddly!
<P>
To answer the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury, subsection (2) defines "game" for the purposes of this new, revised, revised, revised, revised Bill, but that definition is inaccurate and confusing. I do not accept that only rural residents know that game is_
plenty of urban butchers and game dealers attempt to make a living selling game.
<P>
My simple point_I do not want to prolong our discussion unnecessarily_is that we do not need to make exemptions for the shooting of game or the retrieval of game because they are not, in themselves, offences. I hope that I have expressed myself in a way that the hon. Member for Worcester understands and that he will respond to my argument. He must review the new clause, marry it_if he can_with new clause 10 and marry them both with new clause 3.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> By trade I am a tanner, and in the course of my career I have seen tens of thousands of hides and skins. It gives me no pleasure to recall the fact that many hides and skins have shot in them_it is quite extraordinary how many people take a pot at the odd bullock or calf.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Banbury asked for a definition of "game", but I want a definition of "shot". Would the new clause permit the hunting of a fox that had been lightly shot but which could still run? Once again, the Bill involves an ill-thought-out muddle_
muddle has become one of its fine traditions_and the hon. Member for Worcester obviously does not understand practical reality. Ludicrous examples occur to me_if the skin of a fox is penetrated by a few pellets, would that count as a shot fox for the purposes of the Bill and would the person be exempt? It is typical that the problem has not been thought through.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I wondered whether any more opponents of the Bill wanted to discuss the new clause, but obviously they do not, so I shall respond to the points that have been made.
<P>
The hon. and learned Member for Harborough asked whether the new clause was necessary. Yes it is, partly for the reason that was discussed by the hon. Member for North Shropshire_the meaning of the word "shot". It is conceivable that a hare, having been shot may not have been killed. Dogs would be allowed to retrieve that hare, which might be trying to escape. The provisions will not apply to stalking, which is a specified activity, or to people who are trying to flush out a wild mammal. They will apply to the shooting of game for human consumption or for other purposes. We must ensure that people who participate in shooting will not fall foul of the Bill.
<P>
When defining "shot" one would consider the everyday interpretation of the word_for example, if there was an entry wound from pellets, it would be a fair assumption that the game has been shot.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> There are occasions when people shoot at a rabbit or hare and, believing that they have hit it, send their dog to retrieve it. It sometimes happens, as with fishermen, that the shooter is optimistic about what he managed to do. The dog may recover not a shot hare or rabbit but an unwounded hare or rabbit. Does that help the hon. Gentleman in responding to my hon. Friend?
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I can certainly deal with the point concerning fishing because very rarely do people shoot fish. It is very difficult.
<P>
Concerning the optimism of people in pursuit of a quarry, if a rabbit had been shot and missed, the person whose fault it was would not be found guilty of an offence under the Bill because the Committee has agreed that rabbits are exempted. With hares, if the shooter thought that the hare had been hit and the dog was sent only to retrieve the wounded hare, there would be no intention of hunting. It is the word "hunt" that is so important. The prosecution would be hard pressed to pursue a case on that point.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Is the hon. Gentleman aware that when gamekeepers or farmers are shooting foxes and know that they have wounded one, it is common practice to call in the local hunt to catch the fox because it would be cruel to leave it.? One of our greatest concerns is that if the only means of controlling foxes is by shooting, that would be much more cruel. On many occasions local hunts are called into hunt and catch foxes that are known to have been wounded because farmers do not want them to die in agony or perhaps of gangrene. Will the new clause allow a hunt to trace a fox if the master knows that the fox has been wounded by a local farmer?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The new clause refers specifically to retrieval of game and subsection (2) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"in this section `game' means hares and rabbits".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>There is no mention of the word "fox" so the question is superfluous.
<P>Mr. Garnier: In the light of new clause 10 does the hon. Gentleman not think that the words "and rabbits" at the end of new clause 12(2) are otiose?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The committee has accepted new 
clause 10.

<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> I am discussing new clause 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to new clause 10. We are discussing new clause 12, not amendments to it, and I urge the Committee to vote for it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Garnier:</B> The point I am trying to get across to the hon. Gentleman is that new clause 10 exempts the catching of rabbits in certain circumstances from being a criminal offence under new clause 3. Therefore, why does the hon. Gentleman want a reference to rabbits in new clause 12? New clause 12 provides yet another exemption from the criminal trap of new clause 3. As rabbits are already outside the criminal law under new clause 10, they do not need to be further exempted under new clause 12.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Subsection (2) clarifies the meaning of the word "game" so that no one can be in any doubt.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The hon. Member for Worcester said in his July statement that he wanted to outlaw cruel sports. As I understand it, he has just said that the Bill will make it legal for a dog to pursue a wounded rabbit or hare, but not a poor old wounded fox. Why has he got it in for foxes? What is so special about foxes that they are to be left shot and wounded in the countryside to die from gangrene, when rabbits and hares will not? have I been very stupid, or have I spotted yet another muddle, in the tradition of this Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I am afraid that the former is the case. If the hon. Gentleman reads new clause 22, he will see that it caters for injured animals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. The Bill originally had seven clauses. The difficulty is that new clauses appear on the amendment paper in a non-chronological order, and it makes our proceedings hard to follow. Is it possible for the Table Office, or whoever is responsible, to print as an aide memoir for the Committee those new clauses on which we have voted, in the order in which they should appear in the Bill, and those which still have to be debated, in the order in which they should appear if we accept them? It is difficult to jump backwards and forwards from new clauses to the Bill. Am I making myself clear?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> The hon. Gentleman is making sense. I am not sure whether it is a point of order, but it is a legitimate question. The simple answer is that such a service is not offered by the Public Bill Office

<P><b>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</b> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause caters for escaped animals and adds some flexibility to deal with circumstances that may arise. It gives exemptions to the offence created in new clause 3. For example, new clause 13 will cover a dog being used to hunt an animal, including fierce animals that may have escaped from captivity, such as a tiger from a zoo or even the infamous Bodmin beast_or is it the beast of Bodmin?
<P>
Subsection (2) implies that reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that the escaped animal is recaptured or shot once located. It does not provide an excuse for dogs to continue the chase and tear an animal apart. Recapture is possible. Hon. Members opposed to the Bill may mock, but it is preferable to shoot an escaped animal with a drug to put it to sleep and to return it to captivity, if suitable. That is a better option for those who care about animal welfare than having it shot and killed. The new clause does not give people an excuse to continue the chase with a pack of dogs to catch the quarry and tear it apart, limb from limb, as happens with mink hunting.
<P>
Subsection (3) is fairly clear. It ensures that the exemption does not apply to the hunting of foxes and hares that have escaped from captivity. We want to prevent fox and hare hunting, even when foxes or hares escape from captivity.
<P>
Subsection (4) provides exemptions for situations that may arise in everyday circumstances. The Bill will not apply to deer, boar or mink, unless an animal has escaped from a zoo or farm. However, I refer Committee members back to subsection (2), which provides that the animal should be recaptured or shot once it has been located. The new clause will not excuse the hunt of a carted deer that has been taken to a location, where the lock has accidentally come off, and the deer may be deemed to have escaped. Such accidental release leading to a hunt would not be permitted under the legislation.

<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> What appears to have happened is that the hon. Member for Worcester introduced the Bill and then Home Office lawyers have run amok and started adding all sorts of provisos, including escape clauses, which they believe are necessary. Of those provisos, this new clause_which might be called the escaping wild boar clause_is the most bizarre. Whoever drafted it should reconsider it.
<P>
Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A person does not commit an offence under section (1) if he uses a dog to hunt an animal which has escaped from captivity."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What does subsection (4) add to that? By definition, zoo or farm denotes captivity, so subsection (4) in otiose. Any animal, whether it is a deer, boar, mink, hyena or jackal, will be in captivity.<P>

<P>
More important, we have spent a long time discussing the definition of hunting. I think that the right 
hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald 
(Miss Widdecombe) said that hunting involved an element of chasing. Other hon. Members who support the Bill have said that it involves an element of pleasure. We were told that there was a normal parlance of the verb "to hunt". So are we to understand that if a boar escapes from Whipsnade zoo and people try to recapture it, they will be deemed to be hunting for it? I am not sure why they would want to hunt it with dogs, but that is another matter. If, in those circumstances, people will be deemed to be hunting, what does that say about the definition of hunting in new clause 3? What fertile brains in the Home Office suddenly thought, "Oh, Minister, we need to include the escaping-jackal defence because if an animal escapes from a zoo, people could be prosecuted for trying to recapture it."
<P>
The hon. Member for Worcester is in danger of making his Bill look stupid if he includes the new clause because it does not add anything to the Bill. If, in the circumstances described in the new clause, someone will be considered to be hunting, how will that help magistrates to construe new clause 3? If seeking any animal is deemed to be hunting, where are the elements of hunting, such as chasing, that were mentioned in relation to previous new clauses?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Does my hon. Friend agree that the animals most likely to escape from a zoo are dog-like animals, such as wolves and jackals, and that if under the new clause we are permitted to hunt them with hounds_
wolves and jackals go much faster than fox hounds_a scene exactly like a fox hunt is likely to ensue? Under this clause, however, foxes and hares are the only animals that cannot be hunted in that way.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> My hon. Friend is right_the whole clause is bizarre.
<P>
What does "escaped" mean in this clause? It is not a word that is often used in criminal law. If an animal is captivity leaves captivity, it has escaped voluntarily. If I owned a farm on which I reared deer, and every Wednesday and Saturday I left the gate open, the deer would escape. As far as the deer are concerned, they have escaped voluntarily; the clause does not say that an animal has only escaped from a zoo or a farm if it is contrary to the wishes of those running the zoo or farm.
<P>
Animals kept in captivity in zoos or farms_mink or deer, for instance_could regularly escape through holes in the fence. The clause would permit a dog_I am not sure why it says "a dog" rather dogs_to be used to hunt an escaped animal, which would have to be shot once located. The clause is bizarre, and if it is agreed I am convinced that people will test it to its limits.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> My hon. Friend is right to think that some fine sport will be available in the 17 or 18 areas surrounding the United Kingdom's mink farms. The clause is peculiar because, by definition, all the mink in the wild in the United Kingdom have escaped from captivity, although perhaps not in the current generation. How would a huntsman know whether a particular mink had recently escaped or was the offspring of a previously escaped mink?
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I suggest that the hon. Member for Worcester invites the Minister_who is neutral and has the benefit of notes on clauses from his officials_to explain why the new clauses, which have effectively been imposed on the hon. Gentleman by the Home Office, are necessary. A seven-clause Bill has already become a 22-clause Bill, and it will appear even more laughable and ridiculous once this provision to deal with boars escaping from zoos is more widely known to the public.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> The new clause is another fine adornment to the Bill_it is chaotic, badly thought out and shows that the Bill's promoters are not only ignorant of our countryside but of what goes on in other countries.
<P>
I will explain why I burst out laughing when the hon. Member for Worcester introduced the clause. I laughed at the idea that the large animals that he was discussing would co-operate. The hon. Gentleman spoke as if they were going to stand and wait to be shot, either with a nice, friendly drug dart or something more lethal. Large cats cause some quite serious problems_my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) spoke recently about large cats in Norfolk_and the one thing that they do not do is co-operate with people who try to capture or shoot them.
<P>
The Bill has so far concentrated on fox hunting in this country, but in other countries other animals are hunted successfully with packs of hounds. When the British moved to India, several hunts were set up to hunt jackals. There is still a pack at the old hill station in Ootacamund. I know several people who regularly go to America to hunt red foxes, grey foxes and coyotes, which are known to go, like dingbats, dead slow for 20 miles.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Does the clause cover dingbats? If a dingbat escaped from a zoo, would the clause cover it?
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I am coming to exactly that point. The clause invites people to set up_
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Dingbat zoos!
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> Yes, dingbat zoos. It invites people to set up little farms to breed coyotes. As my hon. Friend has suggested, it would coincidentally happen that on Saturday mornings the latch would be left off, or there would be a rusty nail in the fence or a hole, and the dingbat would be away and the coyote out of the fence and going like stink. Anyone who hunted the animal would not be breaking the law.
<P>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Worcester has even thought about that. The new clause has not been thought through, like much of the Bill. The new clause is within the fine tradition of all that the hon. Gentleman has said. If he replies, will he tell us whether he has considered that point? It is an open invitation to people all over the country to breed small exotic canine species such as jackals, coyotes and dingbats.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I paused before speaking to make sure that I had heard all that the other side had to say. Comparing the pursuit of jackals with everyday fox hunting is not valid. The new clause covers the intention to capture or shoot a quarry, which is not the intention of fox hunting. I dismiss the example raised by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire.
<P>
On the point about an escape, a farmer who deliberately left off the latch of the gate to his deer every Friday, so that there were always some deer wild and enjoying a bit of freedom on Saturday, would be hunting. There is no doubt of that. If the deer had escaped by themselves, perhaps by jumping the fence, that would be significantly different.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Where is escape defined in the Bill?
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We would rely on the courts to interpret whether the animal had escaped or had been aided and abetted in doing so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Surely, by any definition under English law, an animal that is at one moment in captivity and at the next moment out of it has escaped. The method by which it transforms itself from one way of life to another has nothing to do with the definition of escape. An animal has escaped if it is no longer in captivity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> If I understand the hon. Member for North Wiltshire, he is saying that a prisoner who is released on finishing a prison sentence has escaped. That is simply not true. Escape happens when someone or an animal that should be in captivity has made his or its own way out.

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I thank my hon. Friend for that valid point. There is a clear difference between the definition of escape offered by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire and the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey). The courts are there to test whether an animal has escaped or been released for the purpose of hunting.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
This is another exemption to the offence of hunting. New clause 22 replaces clause 5(2)(d). It makes some technical changes to the definitions of certain words_for example, the words "track, locate or retrieve" have been replaced with the words "to search for". Someone who is in pursuit of an animal to put it out of its misery is certainly not retrieving it, although he may be tracking or locating it; he is searching for it to enable a humane act to take place.
<P>
<H5>6 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
During our previous deliberations on clause 21, I referred to a single dog and more than one dog. The new clause does not refer to a single dog, as the original draft did, because stalking and flushing out use more than one dog and earlier provisions allow the plural interpretation to apply.
<P>
In the draft of clause 5(2)(d), the wild mammal had to be seriously disabled. Following advice, we decided that that test was too high to place before a court. It may be that, once located, there is no visible sign of injury. Therefore, new clause 22 introduces the new test of belief that the mammal is injured. It includes the words,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"search for a wild mammal which he believes to be seriously injured".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>During last week's sitting, we discussed the concept of close control of a dog. The discussion deteriorated somewhat when we moved on to talk about the length of leads that may be necessary to exert close control. The term "close control" is not included in the new clause. I recommend the new clause to the Committee because it introduces a humane exception to the offence of hunting.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
New clause 14 would enable the Secretary of State by statutory instrument to remove, amend or add exceptions to the offences under new clause 3. The statutory instrument would have to be approved by both Houses. The new clause would provide flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances. However, I want to give a word of warning to any Home Secretary, current or future, who tries to abuse the new clause to counter the principle of the Bill. Were a Home Secretary to do that, he or she would face the wrath not only of the House but of the whole country.

<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how new clause 14 fits in with new clause 3? What are the exceptions that a Home Secretary may amend, because there is not an exceptions section in new clause 3?

<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I had finished speaking.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> I know. I am asking a question. There is no provision in new clause 3 for the Home Secretary to do what is suggested.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> New clause 14 would give a Secretary of State the power to alter exceptions. We dealt with those exceptions today. I cannot predict unforeseen circumstances.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baldry:</B> The new clause is a Home Office lawyers' catch-all clause. If Home Office lawyers and draftsmen have made mistakes in drafting the Bill, the Home Secretary will be able to amend it. That is a bizarre way of going about things. The hon. Gentleman should understand that. If the Bill is in order, the Home Office does not need the new clause. It demonstrates a lack of confidence in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> I shall clarify the situation in case the hon. Gentleman has not had time to read the clause in full. It would not be up to the whim of a Home Secretary suddenly to decide to change a particular exception. A statutory instrument must be made before both Houses of Parliament for that to happen. It will not rely on mere whim or fancy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I must repeat what my hon. Friend said. The hon. Member for Worcester should reconsider the matter because he has gone to enormous effort to bring the Bill so far. Statutory instruments are laid before the House all the time. It is a criticism of all of us that they are not properly scrutinised. The hon. Gentleman's original purpose may be perverted by that system. He has no control over what the Home Secretaries will do. The nonsense drafted by Mr. Scrivener is getting out of hand. The Bill is becoming a Home Office Bill. The new clause is a cover-all in case the Bill runs into problems.
<P>
We discussed the problems that I foresee when the Bill is put into practice in the magistrates court. We are debating a vacuum-cleaner clause to hoover up all the hassle and put control in the hands of the Home Secretary when things begin to go wrong. The hon. Gentleman should consider whether he has been correctly advised by the Home Office.
<P>
<B>Mr. Foster:</B> The decision would not be up to the whim and fancy of a Home Secretary. Members of both Houses would have to agree to a statutory instrument. The onus would be on all of us collectively as elected or non^
elected members of the Houses of Parliament to allow a statutory instrument pertaining to the Bill to be made. It would not be done on a whim or fancy.

<B>Mr. Bennett:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

Having sat here most of the day, I had hoped to reach new clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 a little earlier because I have to leave the Committee for about 20 minutes at 6.15 pm to discuss a problem with a constituent. I apologise for that, but I hope that I will be able to deal with new clause 4 and that one of my colleagues will deal with the others.
<P>
New clause 4 simply suggests that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester should add another exception to cover scientific experiments. Anyone who has heard the evidence produced in the Committee on the stress that hunting causes deer may believe that the same evidence could be produced on the stress that I believe is caused to foxes during a hunt. That would be valuable information to help to win the argument and would increase support for the Bill among people outside.
<P>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester to consider the resumption in the new clause because in time it might enhance the acceptability of the Bill when it reaches, as I hope it will, the statute book.

<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
New Clause 5 is a probing measure that many hon. Members will want to consider: whether they will want to contribute to its consideration is a matter for them. During the Committee's discussions of the rights and wrongs of the Bill and what is needed to make it good legislation, one of the issues raised was whether there should be an exemption for
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"the purpose of preventing serious damage to land, crops, poultry or any other form of property."<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I have referred to my constituency being the pig capital of Britain, but it also includes some very large poultry units. We do not have problems with foxes, but that may be because the poultry are kept in very large sheds_much larger than the Committee Room. I am not sure whether that is a better example, but it can be debated on another day.
<P>
<B>Miss Ann Widdecombe </B>(Maidstone and The Weald): I find the new clause amazing because it would undermine the entire purpose of the Bill. The excuse that is consistently given for hunting is that it is necessary because farmers will otherwise suffer huge deprivation, particularly to their poultry. That is the main justification for hunting, but it is a justification that supporters of the Bill have resolutely rejected throughout. I see no purpose in the new clause, except to enshrine that false doctrine in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I had hoped that during the weeks that we have been together my right hon. and temporary Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald might have become a permanent friend, but I fear that her rejection of the clause has damaged our relationship forever. The purpose of the clause is to allow hon. Members to make their views known. The right hon. Lady has done so very forcefully, and I so do.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> I want to reiterate briefly the point made by my temporary and right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald. The new clause is unnecessary because all the evidence suggests that foxes do not do the sort of damage to livestock that those who hunt profess. If livestock is damaged by rogue animals, that would be covered under new clause 21, which the Committee has accepted.

</UL></FONT><B>Mr. Cawsey:</B> I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time.
<P>
The new clause covers an issue that has come up many times in our debates: whether hunting with dogs should be allowed to continue if it is licensed and regulated and, if so, whether it should be self-regulated. The hon. member for Montgomeryshire_who, fortunately, is attending another Committee_believes that the Bill could accommodate such a proposal. Committee members should consider the matter, and the new clause gives them an opportunity to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Michael J. Foster:</B> It would be a nonsense if the new clause were adopted. The question is not whether an action is registered but whether it is immoral, barbaric and cruel. Hunting clearly is, and I urge Committee members to reject the new clause.

It falls to me to continue to play a helpful role in the Committee. I have done my best over the past few weeks to be helpful and to ensure that we return good legislation to the House, for which it will thank us.
<P>
The new clause appears in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish, who is visiting his constituency at a very appropriate time. He is most concerned about the new clause, which relates to common land and national parks. An area of the Lake district was discussed earlier. If the new clause is rejected, it will not be possible to hunt foxes with hounds in that area. The normal alternative to hunting on farmland is for the farmer to go out and shoot the fox_that is how most foxes are dispatched, despite assertions to the contrary by the Bill's opponents_but there are no farmers on common land. We do not want lots of people who cannot hunt with dogs wandering around with shotguns in national parks, which have hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. The Committee should discuss the matter and reach a conclusion.

<P>

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> We partially discussed this matter when we considered an amendment that would exempt certain geographical areas from the offence of hunting. I see no reason why an exemption should be made for hunting in national parks.
<P>
We are told that sheep farming suffers from fox predation. If there is a local problem, farmers should use the most effective, efficient and humane method to control fox predation, which, all the evidence suggests, is by shooting. Concerns have been expressed about national parks because tourists flock to them, and rightly so. It is interesting to note that hunting with fell packs in those areas does not take place in July and August. If one relied solely on hunting with dogs, there would be, in effect, no pest control in those areas during those months. Clearly, however, that is not realistic. If there is a problem during those months a farmer will rightly deal with it as quickly as possible by shooting the fox. It is common practice to ignore tourists who happen to be in the area.
<P>
More important, evidence has been brought to my attention that explains why people go fell pack hunting, which is different from following a hunt on a horse. I want to quote an opinion from 1987_I must apologise that it is from the previous decade, but it is still topical. In a television programme called "Face the public", Chris Ogilvie, a huntsman of the Coniston Foxhounds, was asked about his fox hunting activities. He stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"I don't hunt foxes to control them and neither does any hunting person".<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>The host then asked:<w4>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"So what do you hunt them for?"<P>
</UL></FONT>
<p>Chris Ogilvie replied:
<p>"We hunt them for sport."<P>

<p>The host asked, "For enjoyment?" Chris Ogilvie replied, "Yes." The host asked, "For pleasure?" Chris Ogilvie replied, "Yes...for pleasure."
<p>That is what happens with the current fell packs in the national parks. I do not believe that the Committee, or the House, can allow that to continue. I therefore urge that we reject new clause 7.

<B>Mr. Foster:</B> Thank you, Mr. O'Hara, for your good-natured chairing of the Committee. I am sure that I speak on behalf of all Committee members. Similarly, I thank your two able deputies, Mr. Wells and Mrs. Michie. I also thank the Committee Clerk and staff who have been present during our proceedings, who have served us well. I am extremely grateful for the technical guidance that I have sought; I have always been well received. I would like to thank hon. Members on both sides of the Committee_we have not fallen out too much, despite the fact that we fundamentally disagree over the policy and principles of the Bill. I would also like to thank personally those hon. Members who have supported the Bill in Committee, for working so hard to enable the legislation to progress to its next stage.
<P>
<B>Mr. Paterson:</B> I echo the gracious way in which the proposer of the Bill has thanked you, Mr. O'Hara, your co-Chairmen and the staff who work with you, for the manner in which the Committee has been conducted. I also thank hon. Members who supported the Bill for the reasonably humourous and good-natured way in which the Committee has been conducted.
<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department </B>(Mr. George Howarth): I shall be brief. As I have remained neutral throughout the Committee's proceedings, I am pleased to be able to be partisan and to congratulate you, Mr. O'Hara, on the way in which you and your co-Chairmen have conducted the Committee. You and I have sat through many long Committees, in this House and elsewhere, and on one notable occasion you were somewhat bored with the proceedings. I asked you later what you were doing, and you said that you had spent the entire time translating 
"O' My Darling Clementine" into Latin. Your wits have been tested to such an extent on this occasion that I suspect that you have done no such thing during these proceedings. I know that you have your own ways, 
Mr. O'Hara, of entertaining yourself when bored. The Committee's debates have been well-argued and good humoured, and you have set much of that tone yourself.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> It falls to me to make the final remarks of the Committee. I speak on behalf of my co-Chairmen, Mr. Wells and Mrs. Michie, who I thank for standing in for me in particularly difficult circumstances. I thank the Clerk sitting on my left, who is always an invaluable pillar of support to the Chairman and has been no less of a support during this Committee. I also thank the attendants and the staff of the Official Report, and all those who have helped to keep the general ambience of the Committee in order. For the most part those sitting on my right are not heard.
<p>The Committee has not been boring; it has been fascinating and technically difficult. Although there has been frustration on both sides on different occasions, all the proceedings have been in order. I have not been bored_I have enjoyed the experience_and I thank hon. Members for the way in which they have conducted themselves. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is not here_I am thinking of the humour of the debate, and we needed the young philosopher with his technical terminology. The humour was always good in quality, but in terms of moral goodness and_dare I say_the tension between the opposing sides, I was not sure how good the humour was. Nevertheless, although the Committee has been technically difficult, it has not been difficult to keep in order, for which I thank all hon. Members.
