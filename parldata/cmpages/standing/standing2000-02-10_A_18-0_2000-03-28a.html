<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clause 47, for electricity, and clause 75, for the gas industry, relate to the financial penalties that the authority can impose on licence holders for failing to deliver in accordance with licence conditions or the standards of service under the clauses that we discussed at our previous sitting. They are the most controversial clauses in the Bill. The Electricity Association, the Confederation of British Industry and others are greatly concerned about the absence of a cap on the fines that can be imposed by the regulatory authority. Concern is felt also about the circumstances in which a fine can be imposed and the appeals procedure.
<P>
The first set of amendments relates to the limitless nature of the fine and the circumstances in which it can be imposed. Amendments Nos. 318 and 319 cover the electricity industry, while amendments Nos. 324 and 325 relate to the gas industry. The four amendments would remove an unfairness from clauses 47 and 75. At present, when or if a licence holder contravenes a licence condition, the regulator informs the licence holder of the breach through a provisional order, which states what is wrong and how to put it right. Such communication takes place solely between the regulator and the licence holder. The objective is for the utility to rectify the error. If the licence holder fails to do so, the regulator issues a further order requiring the utility to remedy the situation. Such an approach is sensible because many of the issues are subjective and often depend on the interpretation of a licence condition by the regulator. It makes sense to give the company a chance to put the matter right before coming down on it like a tonne of bricks with a range of punishments.
<P>
Under the arrangements in clauses 47 and 75, a fine can be imposed if the regulator is satisfied that a licence holder
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has contravened or is contravening<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
a licence condition or
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>has failed or is failing<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to reach a certain standard. The key points are ``has contravened'' and ``has failed'', meaning that something has happened previously. Fines can be imposed for past transgressions without giving the utilities the chance to remedy matters. Given the subjective nature of the standards of service requirements and some licence conditions, not only is the provision unfair, it will have the damaging consequence of making the utility companies extremely cautious when introducing innovations to their services or operations in case, by mistake, they are not to the regulator's liking and the companies therefore run the risk of attracting a limitless fine.
<P>
As a result, British electricity and gas suppliers and distributors will become less innovative and responsive to consumer demands. The provision will, in effect, make them seek advance clearance from the regulator about new management procedures, new efficiency measures, new products or services. The industry will not be able to risk a fine that could wipe out a company. It will not be able to turn forward, sideways or backwards without keeping an eye on the regulator and clearing its reforms in advance.
<P>
As well as slowing down innovation, the provision will add to costs, which will be passed to the consumer. The regulator will be forced into the invidious position of second-guessing management decisions—a role for which the regulator is totally unsuitable. Such an impediment to swift change will harm the British industry as gas and electricity companies worldwide begin to consolidate. The Government's actions are again damaging British industry to the benefit of overseas conglomerates.
<P>
The amendments would remedy the problem. The provision would read:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where Authority is satisfied that a licence holder—<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) has contravened or is contravening and is likely again to contravene any relevant condition or requirement.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the regulator has informed the licence holder of the problem and the licence holder is clearly taking appropriate action to deal with it, that should be the end of the matter. The amendment would clarify the position; if appropriate action has clearly been taken, it is unlikely that such requirements will be contravened again. That makes perfect sense.
<P>
The rules in the clause ought to ensure compliance with licence conditions and the standards of service provisions. However, if the provisions result in the fining of a company for a breach that will not or cannot be repeated, their purpose must be to punish. That will discourage innovation.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells):</B> Is the hon. Gentleman saying—I assume that he is not—that a company that has operated a scam for a year or two should not be punished for making disproportionate profits from it, against the interests of ordinary consumers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That reveals the Government's approach. They always feel that business is engaged only in running scams and making a quick buck. In fact, British industry is very responsible.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that the Government were wrong to ban 2,800 directors last year for involvement in nefarious activities that jeopardised fair trading by honest companies and were against the best interests of consumers?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The Minister makes the point himself; those directors were banned under current legislation. The Bill introduces a regime that assumes that business is up to no good, when the industry is doing its best to perform well. It is important to inform companies that they are not conforming properly to their licence conditions or that they are not fulfilling their obligations under the Bill to maintain standards of service. That will allow them to remedy the problem. To bash them first and ask questions later is draconian, and not how a responsible Government should behave.
<P>
<B>The Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe (Mrs. Helen Liddell):</B> I am interested in, but rather surprised by, the hon. Gentleman's point. One could draw the obvious conclusion that he feels that there is nothing wrong with the doorstep mis-selling of gas and electricity that the clause attempts to stop.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That could be dealt with under the current regime. Companies need to be told that they are transgressing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Linda Gilroy </B>(Plymouth, Sutton): Will the hon. Gentleman give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I will give way when I have finished responding to the Minister.
<P>
Companies must be told that they are offending against standards of service contracts or breaching a tightly drafted condition of licence agreements, and they must be given a chance to remedy that. Often, a breach is caused not by the deliberate and malicious behaviour of companies out for a quick profit, but by misinterpretation of subjectively phrased requirements. Companies simply need to be told to change their behaviour, and they will do so. If their behaviour does not change after that, heavy fines could be imposed. The amendments would not remove the fining provisions; they would merely make it clear that there should be no need to fine companies if the activities are not repeated.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Gilroy:</B> My right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe mentioned doorstep mis-selling. It is three years since the office that I ran before entering Parliament was swamped with doorstep-selling problems. If people react as the hon. Gentleman says, why are problems still reported every day to the gas consumers council?
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I am sure that there are problems, because we are dealing with human nature. How should we respond to bad behaviour? Should everybody be fined, regardless of whether they breached a licence condition deliberately? Should people who deliberately breach a licence condition be treated the same as those who do so inadvertently because they misinterpret the subjective wording of the requirement? The Bill does not distinguish between the two. The amendments, including some that we will discuss later, would allow us to distinguish between deliberate or negligent behaviour and inadvertent behaviour that was due to a wrong or new interpretation of a condition imposed by the regulator. It is important to make that distinction.
<P>
The Opposition are not saying that companies that commit on-going breaches of conditions should not be fined when there is clear evidence that they should be. However, the amendments would ensure that we did not fine companies that inadvertently breached a condition, put the matter right as soon as it was brought to their attention and were unlikely to repeat the breach.
<P>
The other serious consequence relates to third parties. Under the current regime, the provisional order is purely a matter for the regulator and the utility company. Provided that the breach is put right, the company will not incur third party liabilities. The fact that a fine may be imposed will be sufficient to result in third party action—a further significant disincentive to innovation. That covers the reasoning behind amendments Nos. 318, 319, 322 and 324.
<P>
 Amendments Nos. 320 and 326 deal with what amounts to strict liability. Under the clause, it will not matter whether a company intended to breach the conditions, as I said in response to the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy). The fact that a breach has occurred—intentionally or not—will be sufficient to trigger financial penalties. That notion of no-fault liability is regarded as a strict liability. The CBI says in its briefing to the Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This appears to impose de facto strict liability, as there is no need for the authority to prove fault, just that a breach occurred.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The Electricity Association shares that concern about strict liability. It says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The electricity industry would wish to see a specific requirement for the Authority to take account of the intent of the licensee in cases where contraventions or failures have been made. It is the view of the industry that penalties should only be imposed in cases where the contravention or failure is found to be intentional or the company is found to be acting negligently.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would remedy the problem by requiring, before a fine could be imposed, that the contravention or failure had been, or was being, committed intentionally or negligently.
<P>
The amendments would make the Bill consistent with other legislation, in particular the Competition Act 1998. Section 36(3) of that Act, which was passed by this Government, says that the Director General of Fair Trading must be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>satisfied that an infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I cannot understand why that Act states that there must be an intention to breach competition rules, whereas, under the Bill, it is simply a matter of whether the rules are breached. It does not matter whether the breach is permanent, intentional, negligent or otherwise—the company will be fined. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point. It seems inconsistent, as regards strict liability, to have an unfair, draconian regime under the Bill, but a much fairer regime under the Competition Act.
<P>
The Electricity Association is also concerned about the issue of triple jeopardy.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Section 39 and the proposed section 39A already allow for the payment of compensation to affected parties in cases where the company has failed to meet the prescribed standard. Double jeopardy arises by virtue of sections 39 and 39A stating that compensation payment is without prejudice to any other available remedy in respect of the failure in question. The power of the Authority to take further enforcement action through the imposition of a financial penalty for the same event amounts to triple jeopardy.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The concern is that the Bill will result in not double but triple jeopardy for one offence. The Minister must respond to the fact that companies will be liable for three layers of fines and compensation.
<P>

</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 321 and 327 would deal with the absence of a cap on the fine that the regulator can impose, which is probably the industry's biggest concern about the Bill. A theoretically limitless fine could wipe out a company. It would increase the electricity and gas sectors' regulatory risks, which would increase the return demanded by investors when lending to or investing in utilities companies. Given the capital-intensive nature of those industries, that higher interest rate would translate into significantly higher interest charges and costs, which would have to be passed to the consumer in some way. The CBI stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>over stringent methods may increase regulatory risk, costing industry more in borrowing, and ultimately increasing the burden on the end consumer.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Throughout industry, the provision is seen as the most damaging aspect of the Bill.
<P>
The Electricity Association expressed its concern in a briefing to the Committee. It said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Bill does not set an upper limit for the financial penalty. It is the policy intention that any penalty imposed will be reasonable and proportionate to the contravention or failure. However, in the absence of firm legal provision the Authority has considerable discretion, the very element that the Bill aims to eradicate. The electricity industry finds the Bill to be lacking in this respect and would wish to see a cap on the penalty the Authority is able to impose included in the Bill.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
PowerGen too is concerned about the lack of a limit. It has said that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Companies are already subject to a variety of financial sanctions under the Competition Act 2000, under price controls imposed by the regulator, and the compensation requirements to customers where services standards are not met . . . companies should not be exposed to the multiple risk of incurring financial penalties from a number of different sources, each determined in isolation. The level of any fine should take into account other financial sanctions on companies and the Bill should impose an upper limit on the level of fine that can be imposed.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Utilities companies are especially alarmed by the precedent in the Competition Act. The maximum fine that it set was 10 per cent. of the annual turnover—significant in itself—but that has become 30 per cent. due to a statutory instrument to define the meaning of turnover. That was not mentioned during the passage of the Competition Act, and has enabled the Director General of Fair Trading effectively to fine three years' worth of annual turnover. Ten per cent. has been turned into 30 per cent., so the precedent has been set for large fines.
<P>
The Bill does not even set the same limits as the Competition Act, which raises the spectre of even higher fines. I recall the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry intimating six-figure fines, but I suspect that they could go beyond that. If the Government do not accept the amendments, the Bill will change the character of the industry. The fining provisions and the burdensome requirements elsewhere in it will foster an atmosphere of state control and intervention. The ever-present threat of unlimited and possibly catastrophic fines would give the regulator unprecedented power and leave the private sector in a new and dangerous quasi-state-controlled environment. That would damage the industry. I see that the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs does not agree. It is clear that there is a total lack of understanding of the effect that the measure will have on the industry. One cannot set down in legislation a theoretically unlimited fine because of the effect that that would have on risk.
<P>
The Minister knows that all other financial penalties set out in criminal or civil law are limited. The fine that we are dealing with is unlimited; but according to the precedents, 10 per cent., or 30 per cent., of turnover could be set as a minimum fine for the sector. I hope that the Ministers will take those points seriously and will respond to them thoroughly.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 322 and 328 ensure that the regulator has regard to his own policy statement on penalties before proceeding and that his intention in imposing a fine is to deter future, rather than punish past, breaches. If it is clear to the regulator that the breach was unintentional and that no future breaches are likely because the matter has been put right, that fact should be taken into account in assessing the level of a fine. The points that I have made need a full response from the Minister because the clause elicits the most serious concerns from industry.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I start by apologising for the quality of my voice, particularly to the Hansard staff, who might find it even more difficult than usual to make me out.
<P>
Like the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), I shall respond to the amendments in groups because they cover a wide range of areas. To make it easier, when looking at the circumstances in which a financial penalty can be imposed—for contraventions of licence conditions and other specified statutory requirements and standards of performance—I shall use the shorthand of ``obligations on the company''.
<P>
The people who need to worry about the clauses are those who are not honouring their obligations; there are many who do honour their obligations, and they have nothing to worry about. In fact, they have a great deal to gain because companies that fail to honour their obligations are undercutting those that operate fairly and appropriately in the marketplace. The amendments to which I shall come shortly deal more with the level of the penalty.
<P>
Before addressing the first group of amendments, we need to look at the overall context for the proposed financial penalties. We seek to ensure that companies that meet all their obligations punctiliously do not operate in an environment in which others that are more lackadaisical about their obligations can steal a march on them. In our debate in Committee and on Second Reading, we have often heard about the danger of increasing regulatory risk. The clause seeks to ensure that companies that honour their obligations enjoy a much more transparent system of regulation. Indeed, those who seek to justify companies that do not honour their obligations thereby deprive good and honourable companies of the credit that they deserve.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Does the right hon. Lady accept that, although obligations might subsequently be narrowed down, the drafting of the description of some of them is subjective? For example, under the social action plan, utility companies have an obligation to improve people's health. How far does it go? Later clauses in that plan may have narrowed it down, but the phrasing is subjective. However sincerely and earnestly companies wish to fulfil their obligations, they may not do so—inadvertently—because they fail to interpret the widely drafted phrases in the same way as the regulator. They are not at fault; it is just a different interpretation. Because of that, such fines for an innocent misinterpretation of a widely drafted obligation seem draconian.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> Any fine must be reasonable and should meet the criteria of reasonableness. If a company believes that the regulatory authority has not been reasonable, it can seek redress. That is its protection. Indeed, the regulator has to make a policy statement about the nature of any penalty that he seeks to enforce, and that is a protection.
<P>
I turn first to amendments Nos. 318, 319, 324 and 325. The Government propose that the authority should have a power to impose a financial penalty in relation to a current or a past—that is, a completed—contravention. The amendments would reduce significantly the impact of the Bill. They would restrict the imposition of financial penalties to current and likely future breaches. A penalty could be imposed in relation to a future breach only if such a breach had occurred once and was likely to be repeated. The amendments go to the heart of why the powers are necessary.
<P>
It might help the Committee—the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wanted a full response—if I outline how the existing enforcement system operates. At present, the regulator has a duty to ``make orders'' to secure compliance with licence conditions and specified statutory obligations. The regulator must issue an order if it appears that a supplier is contravening, or is likely to contravene, a licence condition or a specified statutory requirement. In certain circumstances, the regulator is not permitted to take action, such as when his general duties preclude him from doing so, and he is satisfied that the Competition Act 1998 is the most appropriate way of proceeding. In the case of gas, the regulator can impose a financial penalty as part of an enforcement order. Again, that relates only to current and future breaches, not to past breaches.
<P>
The crucial weakness of the enforcement regime is that it applies only to current and future breaches of obligations, so a company that breaches its obligations, but ceases to do so when challenged by the regulator, cannot face further action regardless of the duration of the contravention, of the harm that may have been done to the interests of consumers, or indeed of the damage that that may have done to its competitors. If that company contravenes the same licence condition a fortnight later, the regulator will be compelled to start enforcement action again. Each time a company is challenged, it has only to desist from the act or omission to avoid the consequences of its non-compliance.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Has not the right hon. Lady just given an example of a company that is likely to continue to breach the conditions? She gave the example of its intending to do so in two weeks' time. That would be precisely covered by the amendments because there is a likelihood of the breach continuing.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is seeking to enshrine in the Bill an existing weakness, which is that the regulator is always one step behind the company. There is little to prevent a company from repeatedly breaching its obligations. As long as it ceases to contravene those obligations when challenged, the regulator cannot take further action, and is left chasing shadows. That is a serious flaw in the current enforcement system. The inadequacy of the current arrangements in the energy sector was highlighted during the roll-out of gas competition, when, as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton so ably pointed out, the gas regulator could not deal with companies that had been guilty of unacceptable doorstep selling tactics. The defects in the current system illustrate why we need to introduce new powers to impose penalties for past as well as current breaches of obligation. The new powers will ensure that the authority can ensure compliance and deter future breaches rather than constantly being left running one step behind.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Of course, the powers must be properly circumscribed and couched in due process, and, to answer the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, I shall explain what those limitations and due process requirements will be. The power will apply only to contraventions committed after it comes into effect. The Bill is not retrospective. Past contraventions are breaches of obligations that begin and end after the powers take effect and that are subsequently brought to the authority's attention, not contraventions that are taking place now.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton expressed anxiety about the lack of a specific monetary figure. However, the Gas Act 1986, which the Administration whom he supported were responsible for introducing, also provided for unlimited penalties. Although the provisions do not specify a figure, we must damp down some of the wilder speculation about likely financial penalties. The matter hinges on the use of the word ``reasonable''. The penalty must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The penalty might be very large, but only if the breach in question was extremely serious and had done enough harm to warrant it. When the breach is less serious, the amount involved will be smaller. The regulatory authority must answer for its decision about the level of the penalty.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned the read-across to the Competition Act 1998. I emphasise the reasonableness tied into the Bill. We expect the regulatory authority to take into account a penalty imposed under the Competition Act for an act that contravenes a licence condition and infringes the Competition Act prohibitions. However, there are not many circumstances in which a contravention would have an impact on competition.
<P>
Transparency is critical. The provision is a prescribing element on the authority. The authority is required to publish its policies for calculating penalties and to consider those policies when imposing penalties. The authority will determine the precise content of the policy statement, but we envisage that the policy might include considering the need to secure compliance, the consequences of the breach on individual consumers, or a group of consumers, and the need to deter future breaches so that we do not return to circumstances in which companies start the action again.
<P>
The authority will have to consult on its policy statement, which will always be in the public domain, and revisions of the policy statement will require further consultation. The policy statement itself and the consultation that will surround it will provide an important element of certainty for companies and a means whereby the authority's activities are made transparent and are constrained by the reasonableness provided for under the clause.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> The right hon. Lady says that the authority will decide the maximum fine. Does she not believe that Parliament should decide a matter of such importance as the level of fining, and especially the maximum? I can understand why the Government would want the decision about the details of the precise fine in a particular set of circumstances to be left to the regulatory authority, but the maximum fine should be decided by Parliament. What does she believe should be the level of fine? Should it be the same as that under the Competition Act or should it be more or less than that?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman is a little confused. Not 10 minutes ago he was talking about state control of energy companies, yet he is now referring to Parliament intervening on a regulatory authority that we are establishing deliberately to be at arm's length from the parliamentary process. I take him back to reasonableness: the level of the fine must be reasonable. If a significant and repeated breach has taken place, a significant fine should be imposed—as the Conservative Government recognised when they introduced the Gas Acts. The authority will be under a responsibility to be transparent, but also to take into account the damage that has taken place.
<P>
Such detailed procedural requirements mean that the authority must publicise its intentions, give notice with prescribed information and receive and consider comments from interested parties. There will be procedures for modifying the penalty and for notifying the company concerned and interested parties of the final decision on the imposition of a penalty. If the company wants to do so, it can pay its penalty in instalments—as some of us pay for our television sets. Everything is being done to ensure transparency and a sense of responsibility on the part of the regulator.
<P>
The company will continue to have a right to challenge in the court the imposition and the amount of the penalty as well as the paying schedule imposed by the authority. During the consultation process, the requirement to pay a penalty will be suspended until the case is determined. The court may then quash or reduce the penalty, or extend the time scale for payment.
<P>
I have given a fairly lengthy explanation of why the powers are necessary and how they will operate. The amendments go to the heart of the matter, but not in a helpful way. I hope that the Committee recognises the proper constraints and limitations on the operation of the powers. We must not let the complaints of a few blind us to the fairness of such a measure. Such powers are genuinely needed to protect the interests of consumers and those companies that strive to fulfil their obligations and do not take short cuts for their own advantage.

<P>

<B>Mr. Norman Baker </B>(Lewes): If a penalty was levied and subsequently appealed in court and then suspended pending the court's decision, that process could take a considerable time, given the slowness of our judiciary system. If the penalty were upheld by the court, would interest be payable?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I had not reflected on that interesting point, but I understand that interest would be payable. The hon. Gentleman made an important point, because we all know that it is possible, not for malicious reasons, for such actions to take a considerable time.
<P>
Regulated companies that abide by their licence conditions and fulfil the obligations that they have accepted have nothing to fear, but it is not good enough for the authority to be left permanently running behind companies that have much to gain from such contraventions and repeatedly undercut not only consumers but competitors.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 320 and 326 would restrict the imposition of financial penalties for breaches of licence conditions, specified obligations and standards of performance in cases of negligence and intent. The Government do not accept that the amendments are the right way forward, although they may hold a superficial attraction for those who want to limit the powers available to the authority. I have already described the checks and balances on those powers. The amendments ignore the context in which the powers will be exercised as well as the nature of the powers themselves.
<P>
The current regulatory system makes no concessions in that respect. Companies operating in energy markets supply important services that are required for the maintenance of human life. Any contravention of licence conditions or specified statutory obligations to which they are subject may have serious consequences. Consumers have a right to expect that companies will make their best efforts to achieve standards of performance, particularly when they have little choice over who provides the service, as with electricity distribution companies. Whether failures were intended is of little interest to those affected by them. We all know that from our constituency work.
<P>
Companies that enter the energy sector are aware that they must operate within a clearly defined framework of obligations and that they must strive to fulfil those obligations. The onus should be on the company to do so. The authority needs appropriate powers to ensure that companies that do not fulfil their obligations, for whatever reason, can be brought back into line.
<P>
If the authority decides that it is appropriate to impose a financial penalty in respect of a contravention—it has a power, not a duty, to do so—that penalty must be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. I mentioned earlier the requirement to consult on, publish and have regard to a statement of policy. Without wanting to pre-empt the contents of that policy statement, it seems likely that negligence and intent would be factors that the authority might take into account in determining the level of any penalty. If an infringement was genuinely accidental, the authority could take that into account and conclude that it should not impose a penalty. Any company that felt aggrieved by the imposition of a penalty could challenge it in court.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 322 and 328 would impose a requirement that the authority should have regard to its statement of policy in deciding whether to impose a penalty and that, in those circumstances, it should also have regard to the principle that the purpose of penalties is to deter similar contraventions or failures in future.
<P>
I am puzzled by the first part of the amendments. I have described the provision relating to the authority's statement of policy and mentioned the fact that it also requires the authority to have regard to that statement in deciding whether to impose a penalty and how severe the penalty should be. That part of the amendments is therefore already present in the Bill. As it would simply introduce repetition, I shall talk about it no further.
<P>
On the second part of the amendments, the Government are clear that a key purpose of the penalties is to ensure compliance both when they are imposed and into the future. The statement of policy will allow the authority to provide further detail on the relevant factors that it weighs up in determining whether, and at what level, to impose a penalty. The key factor is that the financial penalty must be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. That will enable a regulator to take into account matters such as the need to secure compliance and deter future breaches; the amount of loss or damage caused by the breach; its frequency and duration; and any other matter or circumstance. There is no need to specify purposes as proposed in the amendments—unless they are a way of limiting penalties to something less than is reasonable in all the circumstances.
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Amendments Nos. 321 and 327 are designed to ensure that certain conditions and qualifications apply to the imposition of financial penalties, and to impose a cap on the amount of any penalty. To put a bit of flesh on the bones, they are designed to ensure that penalties are
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>proportionate having regard to the nature and specificity of the condition or prescribed standard in question.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
They would require that the level of any penalty should take into account the seriousness and duration of a contravention, and would impose a limit of 10 per cent. of annual turnover on the amount of any penalty.
<P>
The amendments are well intentioned and our discussion on them has been useful, but I shall spell out why I believe that they are unnecessary. The provisions will give the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority powers to impose penalties for current and past breaches of licence conditions. All penalties must be reasonable. That specification is vital. ``Reasonable'', unlike ``proportionate'', is a definition recognised in English law. ``Reasonable'' is also less limiting than ``proportionate``. The provisions of the amendments are already covered in the legislation, which builds factors into the requirement for a penalty to be
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That means that proportionality comes within the definition of reasonableness. I remind the Committee of the provision requiring the authority to publish a statement of its policies and of why it has come to its decisions. That would assist any subsequent court action that a company might take. The statement may also include explicit reference to the seriousness and duration of, and the harm caused by, the contravention or failure.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the role of Parliament. The authority has the expertise to impose a penalty that is reasonable in all the circumstances and to set out for public inspection the factors that it will take into account in determining the appropriate level of penalty. The Government do not want to prejudice or skew that process by giving undue prominence to particular factors in the Bill. There could be technical, one-off instances that the authority would have to take into account; or a company might not have devoted sufficient investment to certain aspects of its activity, leading to a contravention.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman talked about the proposal for a 10 per cent. of turnover cap on the level of a financial penalty. I am forced to point again to the requirement for reasonableness in all the circumstances of the case. That is the most important limit that could be imposed. A minor contravention of licence conditions could not attract a penalty of anything like 10 per cent. of turnover. Such a penalty would have to be justified in court.
<P>
As I said, the hon. Gentleman is well intentioned, but the amendments are at best unnecessary and at worst could prejudice the content of the authority's statement of policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Baker:</B> I tend to agree with the Minister's point about reasonableness, which is a principle that can be applied indefinitely whereas a specific figure can become out of date. Does she envisage circumstances in which a penalty of more than 10 per cent. would be levied?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I suppose that a serious contravention could attract a penalty of more than 10 per cent. Perhaps it would be helpful if I gave a for instance about the levels of penalty. I do not want to second-guess the authority so it must be clear that I am not seeking to do that by giving some examples of contraventions that might occur and what the authority might take into account. I would like to be helpful in this. One example might be if there were instances of widespread, repeated and serious malpractice—doorstep selling tactics, perhaps—by a company, and the company has been told to correct its behaviour and has repeatedly refused to take into account what has been said by the authority and, indeed, by consumers. That behaviour might attract a larger penalty because of the size of the contravention and the fact that the company ignored the enforcement action by the authority and the harm has had a significant impact on the interests of consumers as well as on the operation of a liberalised power market. In that situation, there might be a very stiff penalty indeed.
<P>
Another example of what might attract a stiff penalty is the persistent failure to restore supplies after predictable power outages in winter. That could attract a larger penalty if it were clear that the company had not invested enough in its distribution network to minimise the risk of such failures. However, a marginal failure to meet an overall standard in relation to power outages in a year when there were mitigating circumstances, although still important, might attract a much lesser penalty.
<P>
I am speculating to try to give an idea of the kind of scale of issues that the authority might have to take into account when taking a decision on the level of penalty. We envisage that the authority will impose a larger penalty only when significant harm has been done to the interests of consumers and there is a significant effect on the market, or when there is a persistent and deliberate contravention by companies. As constituency Members, we have experience of persistent doorstep mis-selling. I am talking about something that is widespread and serious, but that might have been nipped in the bud and resulted in a lower penalty had the authority had powers to deal with it.
<P>
I do not accept that the powers will have a negative effect on innovation. They will be set in the context of the general duty to protect the interests of consumers—I stress the following phrase—wherever appropriate, through promoting competition; innovation is often an important factor in promoting competition. The authority is not interested in preventing innovation but when a company has contravened its licence conditions, the authority has a power—not a duty, in contrast to enforcement orders—to enforce a penalty that is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case. As part of its general duties, the regulatory authority has to take into account also the proper functioning of a company. 
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised a point about the companies contravening their licences unintentionally. Again, the issue of reasonableness comes into play. It is for the regulatory authority, with its ability—not duty—to levy a penalty, to take into account whether there has been a genuine inadvertent issue of contravention.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman raised the matter of multiple jeopardy on behalf of the Electricity Association. The Government do not accept that the power to impose financial penalties will cause the triple jeopardy or the multiple jeopardy to which he referred. It is important to remember that the financial penalty has to be reasonable in all the circumstances of the case and the authority would have to take into account, as I mentioned earlier, whether compensation has already been paid to consumers, or if penalties have already been imposed under the Competition Act 1998, in respect of the same conduct. Any penalty that did not take proper account of those factors could be deemed not to be reasonable.
<P>
Another point that is often made in discussing the possibility of multiple jeopardy is that consumers may sue for damages in a separate action. Such circumstances may arise when a company breaches an enforcement order, as opposed to a licence condition or a statutory obligation. Such actions relate to personal loss or damage suffered by the consumer, rather than the enforcement of regulatory rules applicable to a licence holder. The authority should be able to impose a financial penalty to ensure compliance with a licence that has been breached and to deter future contraventions. However, consumers, too, should be able to take legal action against a company that breaches the terms of an enforcement order that the authority has imposed on it when they have suffered loss or damage. The two aims are entirely compatible.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned the new price cap. The authority must review the performance of regulated companies over a set period whenever it sets a new price cap, which must reflect the performance and efficiency gains expected in the following period. As part of that price review, the regulator may want to take into account the extent to which the company fulfils its obligations, but that does not obviate the need for mechanisms to secure compliance between price reviews. Compliance and contravention issues often arise between price reviews. The powers to impose financial penalties are a tool for the authority to ensure compliance and deter future breaches between price reviews.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that we import from the Competition Act 1998 the need to prove an intention to contravene obligations, or at least negligence in doing so, before imposing a penalty. As I said earlier, utility companies that enter the sector are aware of the conditions of doing business in regulated markets. They can elect to leave those markets if they are not prepared to play by the rules laid down by GEMA. The position is different under the Competition Act, which applies to all companies. The anti-competitive effect of an action may not become apparent until after the event. Failure to meet relevant requirements inconveniences consumers, regardless of the reasons for that failure. Moreover, utility companies that play by the rules themselves need protection from competitors that take unfair shortcuts. In applying the reasonableness test in setting penalties, GEMA must consider whether intention or negligence was involved on the part of the company in question.
<P>
I hope that that deals with the points that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made. Amendment No. 318 relates to aspects that are already included in the Bill. I urge him not to press the amendments to a vote, but if he decides to do so, I shall ask the Committee to oppose them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That was a useful debate. We had a full response from the Minister, and I am grateful. Industry will go through her words with a fine-toothed comb to ascertain precisely what she said. My instant reaction to her statement is that industry will be alarmed, especially by some of her responses about the price cap. She could not rule out fines of more than 10 per cent. of annual turnover, which is alarming. It is also alarming that she is not prepared to allow Parliament to set a limit to the fine. Regardless of the figure specified—even if it were more than 10 per cent. of annual turnover—it would have been helpful to industry to have specified a cap. The absence of a limit, and some of the Minister's responses, will alarm industry and, therefore, increase regulatory risk. The higher the level of regulatory risk, the higher the cost of capital, which will be passed on to the consumer.
<P>
The Bill is another example of a measure that is designed ostensibly to aid consumers but will cause enormous damage to their interests in the long term. The Minister said that consumers are concerned about the effect of breaches, which is why she wants a draconian regime to deal with past breaches. Consumers are not interested in how much punishment is inflicted on the utility companies after a breach. They want breaches remedied. Under the current regime, the regulator works with utility companies to ensure that breaches are remedied as soon as possible.
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Government are setting up a far more adversarial system. The regulator will have powerful tools at his disposal that will enable him to impose limitless fines on companies that could wipe out their whole existence. The Minister said that the only people who will have to worry about such draconian measures are those who are not honouring their obligations. That is not true. All companies will be concerned about the measures. They will be worried about inadvertently not honouring their obligations. They could be the most assiduously conscientious companies, but they will still worry because of the wide-ranging provisions and their obligations under statute and the licence conditions. Such provisions are subjective. Companies will inevitably transgress their obligations, even if they seek not to do so.
<P>
The limitless nature of the fines will worry companies, even those that honour all their obligations. Such provisions will result in a higher cost of capital for those companies because of the higher regulatory risk. The right hon. Lady said repeatedly that that does not matter because, under statute, the fines must be reasonable and an appeals procedure will be in place to deal with unreasonable fines. When we debate the third set of amendments under this clause, we shall see that the appeals procedure does not enable people to appeal to the courts if the fines are not reasonable. Only judicial review will be available.
<P>
The Minister said that the amendments would have enshrined the current weaknesses and that we cannot punish past transgression. She said that the current system is weak, but she exaggerated its weakness. I am talking about balance. The Utilities Bill tilts the balance too much towards an over-punitive arrangement. The system must be balanced. We do not want companies to be too worried and too risk-averse. I believe strongly that the Bill pushes the balance far too much towards worry and looking over one's shoulder. It will result in lack of innovation and in the higher cost of capital.
<P>
The Minister said that the Gas Acts set the precedent of limitless fines. However, the difference between that regime and that being implemented under the Bill is that the Gas Acts did not enable fines to be imposed for past transgressions, but only if breaches of standards and conditions are likely to continue. That is a different regime and it is the problem of past transgressions that is the worry. Even if the companies try to correct a transgression within minutes of its occurring, there will theoretically be a threat of a limitless fine for that short breach of the licence conditions. To expect industry to function in that way is unreasonable. Dealing with such difficulties will certainly add to costs.
<P>
The Minister said that she expected the regulator to take into account fines imposed under the Competition Act. I am grateful to her for that. She talked about transparency and said that it will be for the authority to decide the level of the fines through the policy statement. However, setting the parameters for fines is a matter for Parliament. Yes, it is important for the authority to set the detailed fines in each circumstance. The Bill cannot, as the Minister tried to do, set out a range of examples to which particular fines would apply, because inevitably some transgressions will not fit into any categories. Legislation can never provide for an exhaustive list.
<P>
However, the Bill can set the parameters of the fine. For instance, will the fines be similar to parking fines, at rates from £40 to £100? Will they be fixed at the same level as those in the Competition Act, or even higher? The Bill should set broad parameters. The Minister's statement—that penalties will be reasonable—is not sufficient to dispel all the concerns, because the meaning of the word ``reasonable'' is subjective. I do not know how the courts will interpret it in the context of the Bill.
<P>
The Minister said that the authority had the expertise to set the fines. That does not mean that it should be allowed to decide what is reasonable, without parameters. She accused me of being inconsistent for wanting less state intervention while demanding that Parliament intervenes to set the rates of the fines, but that is a philosophical confusion on her part. The state and Parliament are separate organisations. Parliament was set up to protect the individual from the powers of the state, and it represents the difference between the legislature and the Executive.
<P>
The regulator is part and parcel of the state, so Parliament, which protects people's freedoms, should decide the level of the fines that it can impose on individuals or companies. It is for Parliament, not the regulator, to decide those parameters. Although the regulator is slightly more independent of the state than a Whitehall Department is, he or she remains part of the Executive. The Committee has a duty to protect people's freedoms and to prevent people from having to pay limitless fines.
<P>
The Minister intimated that negligence and intent are likely to be factors in the authority's policy statement. I must make one point on that issue, which we will discuss again on the next set of amendments. The authority is not obliged to obtain the Secretary of State's approval for that statement, so Parliament has no control over the policy behind the fines. Perhaps the Minister has had quiet discussions with Callum McCarthy, because I do not know how else she could expect negligence and intent to be factors in the policy statement that determines whether a fine is imposed. I hope that she is right, but why does she not put those elements into the Bill? As the policy statement will achieve what I sought to do with the amendments, why does she not accept them or table Government amendments to the same end? I see no problem with that. It is proper for the Committee, rather than an unelected regulator appointed by the Secretary of State, to make such decisions. She said that it would prejudice the authority's statement if the amendments were made, but so what? We in Parliament should be allowed to prejudice policy statements by regulatory authorities.
<P>
The Minister said that increased competition in the industry would be the mechanism that provided innovation, and that she did not believe that this draconian penalty regime would limit innovation. However, the Bill demotes the promotion of competition from its previous position. We have had long debates about that. Even if competition increases, different levels of innovation may still exist. If all companies in a competitive market are subject to the same external influences that reduce the level of innovation, there will be less innovation. Much innovation might come from only one or two companies, if the environment encourages it. A competitive environment might discourage that, if external factors act equally on all companies.
<P>
I do not believe that the Minister has dealt effectively with the issues that have been raised. They are serious, and she has not responded satisfactorily. Apart from saying that she expected the regulator to take into account fines imposed under the Competition Act, she has not dispelled my concerns. I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.

</UL></FONT>
<P>
on the imposition of fines. That is a sensible way to approach fines, and we discussed the policy under the previous set of amendments. However, it is important that GEMA not only consults before and after publishing the guidelines, which the clause provides for, but seeks the Secretary of State's approval for the guidelines, which the clause does not provide for. Those principles should have been incorporated into the primary legislation, together with a limit on the maximum fine. Given that the Government refused to accept the previous set of amendments, it is incumbent on the regulatory authority to seek the approval of the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament for his decisions. The imposition of large fines is an important matter, which Parliament should have a role in scrutinising. Ensuring that the Secretary of State approves the guidelines is not the perfect solution, but at least it goes some way beyond the Bill, towards providing an element of parliamentary accountability.
<P>
Clauses 47 and 75 are silent on the important principles of how and when a fine should be imposed. As we have said, those clauses are silent on culpability and on quantum—the maximum level of a fine. They also say nothing about the seriousness of the harm caused by a breach or its duration. Those are important issues, which should have been dealt with in the Bill. At the very least, they should be mentioned in the Ofgem or rather, GEMA—policy statement. The clauses do not require those issues to be dealt with in the statement, so a requirement for the authority to seek the Secretary of State's approval will enable him or her to respond to such concerns.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The hon. Gentleman outlined the intentions behind the amendments, and I get the impression that he seeks to insert safeguards into the financial penalties provisions. I believe that the amendments are mistaken. As we have said several times, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority will be responsible for economic regulation of the gas and electricity industries. One key element that underpins the Bill is that GEMA will operate at arm's length from Ministers, within a statutory framework set out by the Government. A requirement for the Secretary of State to approve the policy statement, as in amendments Nos. 703 and 704, would appear to cut across the commitment to arm's-length regulation. Furthermore, the authority is the regulatory expert on the gas and electricity sectors. It has the sectoral knowledge and expertise to determine which factors it should consider in relation to the imposition of financial penalties. Against that backdrop, it is unclear what the requirement for the Secretary of State to approve the statement of policy would add to the work of GEMA.
<P>
Much the same arguments apply to amendments Nos. 705 and 706, which would require the authority to consult the Secretary of State when drawing up and revising the statement of policy. The authority is the expert on the relevant sectors. The wording of the provision is intended to avoid over-prescription and to allow the authority flexibility according to the circumstances.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The statement of policy will be important in ensuring transparency in the operation of the authority's powers. It is clearly in the authority's interests to consult widely, as that will reduce the likelihood of a legal challenge to any penalty. Consequently, the Government do not believe that the hon. Gentleman's amendment adds anything to the Bill. It could be damaging, as it appears to cut across the principle of arm's-length regulation, so I urge the Committee to resist it.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> To claim that the Bill is full of arm's-length regulation is nonsense. It is packed solid with powers for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to the regulatory authority. Even if what the Minister said was true and the Bill tries to keep the regulator at arm's length, there are philosophical principles at stake. She said that GEMA would have better expertise and sectoral knowledge than the Secretary of State or the Department about determining policy over whether and when to impose fines, and of how much. However, technical difficulty should never be the reason to take crucial philosophical decisions outside Parliament. Those arguments could be used for many subjects, such as food safety, the building and design of roads, the running of the health service and general agricultural policy.
<P>
We live in an increasingly technical and demanding world, but Parliament must get to grips with such issues if it is to retain its role in society. One could say that the Finance Bill should not be debated in Committee because few hon. Members are experts in taxation, and that some worthies from the accountancy profession should debate it. The subject of whether those in Parliament feel that they have the competence and ability to legislate on technically demanding issues will arise increasingly in the next 50 years.
<P>
There is nothing especially technically demanding in the regulation of the utility industry. It is good to take advice from experts and worth while that the authority will present the draft to the Secretary of State, but those are ultimately issues for Parliament. It is a pity that the policy statement will not go through Parliament. The Secretary of State, with all his advisers, should at least take responsibility. He should approve—or not—the policy statement, as within its technical difficulties will be issues of philosophical importance that we as Members of Parliament have the responsibility to distil and debate in Parliament, the nation's public forum. It is dangerous to say that, because a subject is technically demanding, decisions on policy should be taken outside the House by an unelected individual.

<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We touched on the issue of the appeal procedure when discussing the level of the fine. The Minister's response was that the fine can be limitless in the legislation because it is required to be reasonable and that, if it is not, the utility company or whoever can appeal to the courts. However, the appeal procedure is extremely limited. In proposed new section 27E(4) of the Electricity Act 1989—and in clause 75, which would insert the equivalent proposed new section 30E(4) into the Gas Act 1986—three grounds for appeal are set out.
<P>
The first, in proposed new paragraph (a) is
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the imposition of the penalty was not within the power of the Authority under section 27A.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
All that that means is that the regulatory authority must be satisfied that a licence holder has contravened or breached a condition or standard and that that, in the regulator's opinion, is reasonable. So, provided that the regulator has taken all the factors into account, that judgment is up to him. In other words, the first ground of appeal is similar to the provision for judicial review, with which it is difficult to succeed, and does not enable any appeal on the basis of the actual fine or actual facts. An appeal can be made only on the basis of whether the authority acted in a quasi-judicial and fair manner, regardless of the decision made. The fine could therefore be unreasonable, under any objective assessment, but provided that the authority regarded it as reasonable—and the regulator had taken all steps to enable him to take that view—there could be no appeal. The Government may take a different view, but having consulted with lawyers outside the House, I believe that that is the view that the courts will take. They will not wish to second-guess any decision made by the regulatory authority.
<P>
The second ground for appeal is where the procedures in subsections (2) to (4) and (6) of proposed new section 27A have not been complied with. Those include purely procedural matters, such as the terms of the notice to be issued to the licence holders by the authority and the specification of a period in which they can object—within 21 days. Provided that the regulatory authority has conformed to the letter of the procedures, there will be no grounds for appeal, even if the fine is absurdly excessive.
<P>
The third, even more limited, ground for appeal is if it were not reasonable to expect the fine to be paid within the time scale set by the authority. There are no grounds for appeal on the quantum or reasonableness of the fine, just the timing of it. That goes back to what the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe said about being able to pay the fine in instalments. It is a tiny issue—nothing to do with the level of a fine or whether it is reasonable. In effect, the appeal procedure against fines under the clauses 47 and 75 is limited to judicial review. However, even that review is limited because proposed new subsection 27E(8) states that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Except as provided by this section, the validity of a penalty shall not be questioned by any legal proceedings whatever.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
A judicial review is therefore limited to the narrow grounds specified in proposed new section 27E or proposed new section 30E. If there were more general judicial review grounds for appealing against the decision, they would—because of subsection (8)—be struck down by the courts.
<P>
The absence of a proper appeal procedure is of enormous concern to industry. The CBI said in its briefing to members of the Committee:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There should be full rights of appeal including scrutiny of the legal and/or factual basis and level of the fine.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
PowerGen has said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is . . . no adequate independent route of appeal. The available route is through the courts on a basis similar to that available in judicial review. There is no provision for independent review of the facts—whether or not the regulator was right in concluding that there was a breach of licence condition and whether the level of fine is proportionate to the nature of the breach.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This should be remedied by providing for the licence holder to be able to appeal to the court against the substantive decision, a material error of fact, or on the basis that the fine was unreasonable.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The amendments would provide a remedy for those concern. Amendments Nos. 323 and 329 respectively insert into proposed new section 27E(4), for electricity, and proposed new section 30E(3), for gas, a new ground for appeal that, given all the circumstances, the authority was unreasonable to impose such a penalty. That would provide a proper appeal procedure and would enable the court to examine all the facts and assess both the reasonableness of the fine and the decision to impose it. The Government are beholden to accept the amendments, or at least to promise to table on Report their own amendments reflect the same points.
<P>
The Minister's defence in the previous debate on the absence of a limit to fines included several times, in response to several anxieties, the phrase that the fact that the fine must be reasonable in the circumstances was sufficient to comfort those operating in the industry that they will not be lumbered with unreasonable and excessive fines. Given the limited appeal procedure, the defence against those anxieties is inadequate.
<P>
Amendments Nos. 707 and 708 would achieve the same objective in a slightly different way. Amendments Nos. 709 and 710 would remove the rather offensive subsection that will prevent a legal challenge unless it is covered by the strict criteria in proposed new sections 27E and 30E. The anxieties are serious, and I should be interested to hear the right hon. Lady's response and her interpretation of the three grounds for appeal—especially the first.

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> The Government believe that the amendments are unnecessary. I shall give the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton the reasons for that belief, and refer in particular to his point about ultra vires.
<H4><center>[Mrs. LINDA GILROY in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
Proposed new section 27E(3) of the Electricity Act 1989 and proposed new section 30E(3) of the Gas Act 1986 explicitly provide that, once the authority has imposed a financial penalty on a company, the court, following an application from the company involved, may quash the penalty or substitute a penalty of such lesser amount as the court considers appropriate given all the circumstances of the case. I am sure that the Committee would acknowledge that it would be odd to insert those provisions if the Government did not intend companies to have the right to challenge the authority's decisions.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman noted that I repeatedly referred to reasonableness in the previous debate on the procedure used in setting penalties, and said that he had taken legal advice. We have all done that, and have heard different views, depending on the approach involved. However, an inherent power of the judiciary is to ensure that the Executive comply with the will of Parliament as expressed in statute. The Official Report is increasingly used to support the interpretation of legislation in establishing the Government's intention. The Bill is explicit that the reasonableness criteria should apply. The term ``reasonableness'' is recognised in the United Kingdom courts.
<P>
A financial penalty that is reasonable given all the circumstances might take into account any factors that it was relevant for the authority to consider, including whether the company has complied with a licence condition. As the authority's power relates only to imposing a penalty that is reasonable given all the circumstances, the court has the right to consider whether the penalty is truly reasonable. It is therefore essential for the court to consider whether the breach to which the penalty relates took place and whether the authority was reasonable in imposing such a penalty. It is therefore important that the appeal procedure is transparent and easy, which it is under the Bill.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman may believe that the gateway for challenging the imposition of the amount of penalty is too narrow to allow the provisions to operate properly, in that the grounds for challenge must be explicit, the imposition of the penalty must have been outside the powers of the authority and the procedural requirements must not have been complied with. Anyone who has ever been involved in litigation knows that procedural requirements are often an important means of pursuing such litigation.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
The hon. Gentleman referred also to the level of the penalty. The authority has power only to impose a financial penalty if it is reasonable in all circumstances. A penalty that was not reasonable would fall within the grounds set out in the proposed new section 27E(4)(a) of the 1989 Act and the proposed new section 30E(4)(a) of the 1986 Act. As the imposition of the penalty was not within the power of the authority, the company would be permitted to challenge both its imposition and the amount. The hon. Gentleman's amendments are superfluous. His arguments are confusing in that they restate what is already in the Bill. They take a narrow view of the ultra vires, procedural and reasonableness powers.
<H4><center>[MR. JIMMY HOOD in the Chair]</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I understand the right hon. Lady's point, which I expected her to make. The view outside the House is that the power under proposed new subsection (4)(a) will not enable the courts to second-guess the judgment of a regulatory authority on whether the fine is reasonable and whether it should be imposed. The proposed new section 27A states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the Authority is satisfied that a licence holder . . . has contravened or failed . . . the Authority may . . . impose on the licence holder a penalty of such amount as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case,<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
whereas, subsection (4)(a) of proposed section 30E states that there are grounds for appeal if the authority does not have the power to impose the penalty. The right hon. Lady is saying that the authority will not have the power if it is unreasonable to set the fine.
<P>
The view of industry and legal experts outside the House is that the courts would be reluctant to second-guess the decision whether something is reasonable, particularly concerning whether the authority has a power. Clearly, the authority has the power to set the fine and, generally, the courts will take the view that the decision whether the fine is reasonable is up to the authority itself. It will not be for the courts to second-guess the authority's view provided that it took all reasonable steps to take into account all the facts. That is the problem. Such matters may be a grey area in the law and some cases may go that way, while others go the way described by the right hon. Lady. That would explain our difference of view.
<P>
Given the level of uncertainty, it would make sense to wipe it out by accepting the amendments, which would deliver precisely what the Minister claims for the Bill. Why not do so?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I disagree with the hon. Gentleman. The amendment would create confusion where none exists. I repeat that it is one of the inherent powers of the judiciary to interpret the will of statute. In considering all the circumstances, however, the court would have to take into account whether there was a dispute and whether there had been a breach of an obligation. The court would have to do that when deciding whether the authority had imposed a reasonable penalty. The amendments would confuse the issue and make the measure much less clear cut. I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the lead amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Earlier, the Minister spoke about a statement in Committee by Ministers as clarifying the intention of Government. What she meant to say, of course, was that such statements clarify the intention of Parliament. There is a distinction between the two, as I have tried to explain to her countless times. Parliament and Government are not synonymous even under this Government. In view of the Minister's statement, which will be useful in clarifying what is an ambiguous clause, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Question proposed, that the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I believe we have been through all the concerns and have had the response to those concerns from the Government, but I am disappointed in the response that we have had from the Minister, particularly with regard to the limitless fines. It appears that we may have made the position slightly more concerning than it was before the Committee stage started. Under the Bill, it seems likely that fines could exceed 10 per cent. of turnover. The fines would involve large sums and the clause goes over the top in its approach to the utility companies. The Minister refused to accept amendments from the Opposition on past transgressions, stating that the provision should be about remedying only and should depend on the likelihood of future transgressions. She refuses to accept amendments on negligence or intent, despite the fact that she hopes that such a requirement will exist in the policy statement issued by the authority. In view of all those concerns and the fact that the amendments have not been accepted, I would urge the Committee to reject clause 47.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Clauses 48 and 76 introduce a new subsection (5A) to the Electricity Act 1989 and a new subsection (5A) into the Gas Act 1986. These clauses were hinted at by the Minister when she was talking about the grounds for resisting one or two of the Opposition amendments to clauses 47 and 75.
<P>
The Bill states that the authority is not required to make a final order if it is satisfied that the licence holder has agreed or is taking steps to remedy the breach, or if the breach is trivial. The clauses use the phrase ``not required to'', not the words ``shall not'', which means that the regulatory authority will still have the power to fine. If the clause achieved what the Minister hinted at earlier, it would state that the authority shall not impose the fine if
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the licence holder has agreed to take and is taking all such steps<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
to remedy the breach. As it stands, the clause provides no assistance or comfort to the concerns of industry. Nor does it reduce the regulatory risk that will be of concern to consumers.<P>

<P>

<B>Mr. Andrew Stunell </B>(Hazel Grove): Broadly speaking, the provisions are right, so perhaps the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton were a little misplaced. We are talking about a quasi-judicial process and the need for large commercial players to be regulated adequately by the regulatory system. We need a strong and firm regulatory system, not one that can be bluffed and kidded. If a loophole of the sort implied by the hon. Gentleman were left in the regulations, it could be so treated—and I would be most unhappy if that happened.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> In urging that clause 48 stand part of the Bill, I would take the criticisms of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton more seriously if he had tabled an amendment. The clause introduces minor amendments to the licence enforcement provisions in the Electricity Act 1989. Its purpose, and that of clause 76, is to streamline enforcement procedures and to increase consistency between the utility sectors in respect of licence enforcement. It is a minor change and would give the authority greater flexibility at the margins without fundamentally altering the basis of enforcement action. The authority will not be compelled to impose an order in the circumstances described, but it should not be precluded from doing so if the circumstances are appropriate.
<P>
The clause reduces the minimum time for representation to be made in the notices on the issuing, modification and revocation of enforcement orders from 28 to 21 days. The proposal streamlines the enforcement procedures and aligns the time period for representations in respect of enforcement orders in the electricity sector with that for representations on notices in respect of financial penalties in that sector. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> It is interesting that when the Opposition do not table an amendment, but raise their concerns in a clause stand part debate—which we are entitled to do—we do not receive a response to our arguments. I did not receive an answer to my question why the clause does not include the words ``shall not'' instead of ``not required to''. Instead, I was given details of the civil service brief on the clause.
<P>
When the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs was present, I asked whether Ministers were involved in drafting and policy development or whether this was purely an official-led Bill. That goes some way towards explaining our problems throughout our deliberations. I have given the Minister a chance to receive some briefing from her officials. It would help the Committee if she said why the clause did not use the words ``shall not''. If it had, it would have helped her case because she was relying on it to defend herself and the Government against criticism of the previous clause. Will she explain why the words ``shall not'' were not used?

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> We have dealt with clauses 47 and 75, which are the most controversial clauses, and we have now reached the most extraordinary clauses, although they are harmless. Each runs to 91 or 92 lines over several pages and relates to the remuneration of directors of utility companies. In the run-up to the Bill's publication, we read press stories, spun by the Government, about how the Bill would directly link directors' pay to the charges payable by customers, and about how any pay rise that Ministers decided was excessive would result in the regulator punishing the company through the price cap under the RPI-X formula. Had the Government introduced such a measure, it would have been the most interventionist since those of the 1970s and would have amounted to a national pay policy for directors. Therefore, the Government wisely backed off, which is slightly surprising, given their rhetoric in opposition.
<P>
Instead, we have this damp squib of a couple of clauses that say merely that companies that link an element of a director's pay to the standard of service that they provide should publish details of the arrangement. If no such arrangement exists, that fact should be published too. I am sure that the left of the Labour party is deeply disappointed by the clause. I see that the Government Whip, the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)—[Interruption.] Well, I do not see him, but I can well believe that he has performed his task with draconian aplomb, in that no amendments have been tabled to the clauses. Who knows what may happen on Report, when the Government have less control over who tables amendments?
<P>
The clauses achieve little, if anything. They take up four pages of the Bill and impose a burden on companies that establish a link between pay and the level of service that they provide, in that whole hosts of publications and dealings with the regulator are required. They constitute an unnecessary burden, which has been put in the Bill to deal solely with the politics of directors' pay.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> I thought that the left had been purged a long time ago; I did not know that any of its members were left.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Eleanor Laing </B>(Epping Forest): They are all behind you.
<P>
<B>Dr. Howells:</B> First, I will clarify the purpose of clause 49. As the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said, it is not about curbing boardroom pay levels—that is not the job of Government. Setting boardroom pay is a corporate matter for companies and their shareholders. What is a matter for Government is ensuring that the overarching regulatory framework in sub-competitive markets provides adequate protection for consumers.
<P>
Where competition is fully developed, consumers' purchasing power will provide the impetus for companies to improve their customer service standards. Companies know that if they do not, consumers will vote with their feet and change supplier.
<P>
Where companies and customer choice are insufficiently developed, and prices are regulated as a result, it is important that companies should be given every incentive to attain higher standards of customer service. That is why the clause is important. It will oblige companies to make public any links between directors' pay and the company's performance in terms of the customer service standards achieved in price-regulated activities. In turn, that will encourage companies to strengthen those links and focus on performance in respect of service standards.
<P>
The clause will achieve those aims by obliging price-regulated gas and electricity companies to inform the authority as soon as is practicable after the end of each financial year whether their directors' remuneration levels are linked to the attainment of service standards in price-regulated activities.
<P>
If there are no links between directors' pay and customer service standards, the company is simply required to say so, and to state whether there are any plans to establish such links in the next financial year. If a company plans to introduce links, it is required to describe what they might entail. If, by contrast, directors' pay is linked to the company's performance on service standards, companies will be required to disclose certain information such as when the arrangements were made, to which service standards directors' pay is linked, how performance on service standards is assessed and what effect it has on the calculation of directors' remuneration.
<P>
The clause also gives the authority the power to publish that information, and acts as a safeguard to ensure that the information is placed in the public domain and adequately publicised. The publication of links between price-regulated gas and electricity companies' directors' pay and companies' performance on service standards provided for under the clause will ensure that consumer service standards are firmly at the forefront of boardroom agendas. It will put pressure on companies to strengthen links between directors' pay and service standards, thereby improving overall service standards as a result. I commend the clause to the Committee.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
