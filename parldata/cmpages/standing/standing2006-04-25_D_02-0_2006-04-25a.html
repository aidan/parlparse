Having chatted to my hon. Friend the Whip, I shall be evenbriefer than Ithought.</div><a name="060425125000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">The point ofthe amendments is to sort out the issue of the possible exchange ofland. Amendment No. 71 would ensure that there is no de minimis size ofland resulting in land being nibbled away. It would also impose a timeconstraint restricting the degree to which land can be released insuccessive periods, so that we do not see it gone beforelong.</div> <a name="060425125000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.72 is straightforward. It would make it clear that it is wrong toprovide a piece of so-called open space as an alternative to theconstituted village green or common land. I am sure that that ruse hasbeen played on all hon. Members: someone offers the village what wasalready a piece of open space on the grounds that it is secured forever and a day, when the village is losing a piece of common land thatis just as valuable or even more valuable. I hope that that amendmentis clear.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column45" />Column number: 45</div><a name="060425125000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want theMinister to respond to amendment No. 70. It would guarantee that avoluntary exchange of common land or a village green would be subjectto the same test as compulsorily purchased land. Section 19(1)(a) ofthe Acquisition of Land Act 1981 requires that land given in exchangemust be no less in area than the other land and must be &#147;equallyadvantageous&#148; to anypersons</div><a name="060425125000173"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;entitled torights of common or other rights, and to thepublic,&#148;</div><a name="060425125000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">who now have aright to walk on all commons under the Countryside and Rights of WayAct 2000.</div> <a name="060425125000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">Theamendment would ensure that what is received is no worse than what isgiven, provide a clear yardstick for exchanges as well as compulsorypurchase and obtain a subsequent guarantee from the Minister that itwould apply to the de-registration, exchange and registration of landtaking the place of the land being lost. It is very clear, and I knowthat the Minister will be dying to accept theamendments.</div><a name="060425125000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000209"></a><b class="B">Mr.Roger Williams</b> (Brecon and Radnorshire) (LD): We, too,support the amendments. Village and town greens are precious to thosecommunities able to enjoy them. We know of many towns and villages thatwould like to have a village green for all the benefits that accruefrom them but do not have one. We often see encroachment on thoseprecious areas of land, sometimes in small bites. Theamendments&#146; strength is that they address that. The loss of avery small piece of a green is an important matter for thecommunity.</div> <a name="060425125000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.Members who tabled the amendments have made their points, so I will notrepeat them, but it is up to the Minister to respond to the amendmentsas positively as he can. The communities affected by such problemswould hold him in the highest esteem if he let his defences down ashade and let somebody slip the quicker ball through and get aresult.</div><a name="060425125000030"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000210"></a>TheParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and RuralAffairs (Jim Knight):</b> I recall that during debates on theNatural Environment and Rural Communities Bill the hon. Gentlemanpromised that I would be held in the highest esteem in respect of somerace between horses, men and all sorts of things&#151;it got himnowhere theneither.</div><a name="060425125000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">I listenedcarefully to my hon. Friends. I said that I always pay close attentionto my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping); I try to dothe same for my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew) as well,although sometimes he does not make that as easy. My hon. Friends makeimportant points and I support the intentions behind their amendments.</div><a name="060425125000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">However, I shallresist the amendments. Clause 16 strikes the right balance forflexibility, and I shall take time to persuade my hon. Friends and thehon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) that we have gotit right. If the proposed release land has an area of more than 200 sqm, replacement land must be offered&#151;no ifs or buts. That isclear. It would apply whenever release land had an area greater than,say, 20 m by 10 m. However, I know that my hon. Friends and the hon.Gentleman are concerned that small areas of land would be eaten away.They want to prevent nibbling, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stroudput it.</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column46" />Column number: 46</div><a name="060425125000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">Could the status of smaller areas of land be swept away as unimportant? Far from it. Unless the applicant proposes replacement land, there is an absolute duty on the national authority, under subsection (7), to have particular regard to the extent to which the absence of replacement land would be prejudicial to any of the interests in the land. The authority must think about the property rights of the commoners or others, the interestsof the neighbourhood and the public interest in all senses of thephrase, including nature conservation, landscape conservation,protection of public rights of access and protection of archaeological remains or other historic features.</div><a name="060425125000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">That list is prettyformidable. In the vast majority of cases, when the area of proposedrelease land is less than 200 sq m, replacement land of a comparablesize or quality will need to be provided if the proposal is to beapproved. A case of deregistration without exchange being approvedwould be truly exceptional, but we do not want to rule out thepossibility.</div><a name="060425125000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">I shallgive an example. Suppose an area of common or green were landlocked byhouses and no land nearby could be used as replacement land. Let ussuppose that there was a proposal to take a very small proportion ofthe land to facilitate, shall we say, disabled access to some adjoiningcommunity facility, and that that proposal was supported overwhelminglyby local people because it really made sense. Although such a casewould be exceptional, we would not want it to be impossible for us toapprove that application because of what was instatute.</div><a name="060425125000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">What of theother issues raised by the amendments? Should there be a requirement orstatutory expectation that replacement land should be at least as largeas the release land, or equally advantageous to the various users ofit? We do not think so, for the same reason. Of course, it would beexceptional for the replacement land to be smaller, but we do not wantto rule out the possibility altogether. Such a proposal could provide abetter deal for the commoners and the public. Perhaps the release landwould be inaccessible and remote, while the slightly smallerreplacement land was on people&#146;s doorstep, but had not hithertobeen available to them. In such circumstances, we should not be forcedto turn down an application because ofstatutes.</div><a name="060425125000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We resistthe &#147;equally advantageous&#148; formulation simply because itcould well be interpreted as meaning that the replacement land had tobe equally advantageous in respect of every one of the interests setout in clause 16(6), which is a much extended list of the issues towhich the national authority must have regard when an exchange isproposed. Currently, the national authority is concerned only withwhether an exchange is fair to the private interests involved;subsection (6) would also include the public interest.</div><a name="060425125000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member forStroud mentioned the Acquisition of Land Act 1981. He was right to saythat in the case he mentioned replacement land due to a compulsorypurchase order would have to be equally advantageous to any commoners,other legal right holders and the public. This is the closestcomparable example. However, the deregistration and exchange provisionsin clause 16 involve considering the impact of proposals on a far widerset of interests than even those in that legislation, includingthe</div> <div class="Column"><a name="Column47" />Column number: 47</div><a name="060425125000174"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;interests of theneighbourhood...nature conservation...the conservation of thelandscape...the protection of public rights of access...andthe protection of archeological remains and features of historicinterest.&#148;</div> <a name="060425125000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is adifference, and there would be a potential legal problem if we were toopen up the possibility that all those interests must be equally servedby the exchange land.</div><a name="060425125000040"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000211"></a>Mr.Drew:</b> I am very pleased that subsection (8) defines thepublic interest. The problem is that we do not define what we mean bythe &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148; and how that wouldbe reflected. With the best will in the world, that is where theconflict is most likely to occur. For example, a group of people mightsee the exchange as somewhat less advantageous, but the landowner andperhaps a larger authority, which could have already granted planningpermission, might say, &#147;We think this should take place&#148;.How do we measure those conflicting interests? Perhaps that issueshould be taken on board.</div><a name="060425125000041"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000212"></a>JimKnight:</b> My hon.

As things stand, it will have todefine the &#147;interests of the neighbourhood&#148;. I shallreflect on whether we need to flesh that out a little in some form forhim.

It goes across the heads of thevalleys and has been a dangerous road for some time. It has been athree-lane road and has been subject to many accidents. Now, thankgoodness, as a result of the intervention of the Welsh Assembly, it isbecoming a dualled road, but land has been taken up to achieve that.Commoners are not happy that some of the land offered to them has beendistant from where they exercise their rights at the moment; indeed,sometimes it has been on the wrong side of the road, so tospeak.</div><a name="060425125000050"></a><div class="hs_Para">We would like,in clause 16 or clause 17, a commitment that when that exchange ismade, people with rights on the common can continue to exercise thoserights easily, and do not have to go to exceptional lengths to do so.

Mr. Pumfrey, who isobviously a learned gentleman, has corresponded with us all at greatlength, and he has been challenging officials about the situation. <div class="Column"><a name="Column50" />Column number: 50</div>Therefore, I have tabled amendment No. 64, which has been drafted by Mr.Pumfrey. After reading it a few times, one realises that it does meansomething. It is, I am afraid, the language of law as we used tounderstand it, rather than the rather simple language in which I tendto draft my own amendments so that I can understand them.</div><a name="060425125000065"></a><div class="hs_Para">The principle of the amendmentapplies where there is a piece of common land created by some otherstatute prior to 1965 and someone, in the phrase of the amendment, byinadvertent non-compliance forgot or omitted to register it under theCommons Registration Act 1965. There is a concern that that land wouldbe lost. The amendment would add to the facility for correction inclause 19 the opportunity to correct that sort of situation. I will notdetain the Committee by reading out what the Minister&#146;sofficials have said to Mr. Pumfrey&#151;no doubt the Minister will dothat himself, in so many words, in a few minutes.</div><a name="060425125000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is an important pointhere, and I hope that the Minister will address it. What is the statusof a piece of land that was common by some other statute prior to 1965,but for whatever reason, was not registered? I am sure that allCommittee members would agree that it would be a great pity if thatland were lost as common land. I am looking for some explanation orreassurance from the Minister as to how that land can be kept as commonland if clause 19 is not amended in the way we propose. I look forwardto the Minister&#146;sresponse.</div><a name="060425125000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">AmendmentsNos. 48 and 49 are far more straightforward and simple because Idrafted them myself, and I am a simple man. They return to the issuethat I raised on Second Reading, and the Minister replied to myconcerns to some degree at that time. I make no apology for returningto these issues because they are very important, and fair play andjustice demand that we should examine them further.</div><a name="060425125000068"></a><div class="hs_Para">I do not think that there isany real dispute about the fact that after 1965, a large number ofrights were registered that had no true validity in historical terms.They were considerably in excess of rights that people had previouslyexercised under the old levancy and couchancy rules, which weredesigned to relate a person&#146;s common rights to the amount ofstock they could accommodate on their own land during the winterperiod. There were absurd situations where people who could accommodate10 or 20 head of stock during the winter on their own land wereregistering rights for several times that figure during the summer.That aspect is part of the picture.</div><a name="060425125000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are also examples, and Ireferred to one from my constituency&#151;needless to say, my localpress have tried to investigate this, but I have not given them anyfurther knowledge&#151;concerning an allegation that someone hadregistered rights when he had no rights on the common prior to thatdebate at all. They were registered, and there have been no grounds forcorrection. Amendment No. 48 would simply delete from clause 19 thesentence that would prevent a correction being made if it had anyimpact on the right of common.</div><a name="060425125000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 49, on which Iam happy to take guidance if the drafting of the precise terminology isincorrect, creates the opportunity in what is intentionally a fairlynarrow situation for correction where entries have been made thatresulted from fraud. <div class="Column"><a name="Column51" />Column number: 51</div>The Minister may ask how we could prove fraud and it would be for othersto come forward with the evidence to prove that someone who had claimedthe right had no justification for doing so. By using the word&#147;fraudulent&#148; in the amendment I have tried to narrow downsituations when countless people could say that this or that was notquite right. I understand the Government&#146;s desire not to reopenthe registration issue because it is a can of worms and my right hon.Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean) told usthis morning what his officials said to him when he was the Ministerresponsible for such matters. It is not something to be entered intolightly. Nevertheless, there is a fundamental problem and fair playrequires that it should be addressed. The Government should not simplyshrug their shoulders and pretend that it is too difficult to deal withbecause that would do no one anyjustice.</div><a name="060425125000071"></a><div class="hs_Para">In his replyto my Second Reading comments the Minister referred to stakeholders andthe National Farmers Union. It is true that the NFU is not in favour ofreopening the register, probably because a number of its members mightbe affected, but it is not true that it would apply to allstakeholders. The Country Land and Business Association, which I quotedearlier, is in favour and said so in its submission to the Committee.It is not a universal view among stakeholders that the matter shouldnot bereopened.</div><a name="060425125000072"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is acase. I do not have the optimism of the hon. Member for Brecon andRadnorshire that a few charming words will convert the Ministerovernight, but then I am not as gullible as most Liberal Democrats.Nevertheless, I have made the point and I hope that the Ministerunderstands that there are some serious injustices, with ongoingimplications for management. For example, if all but one of the rightsholders of a common accurately registered the rights to which they wereentitled, but one massively over-registered, that could result inover-grazing, which the Bill is, in part, designed to address. If thereis no power to correct that registration, the consequences ofover-grazing and the management decisions that would have to be made,subject to later provisions in the Bill, would affect all rightsholders. They would all suffer because one person massivelyover-registered. That serious injustice should be addressed and that iswhat is behind theamendments.</div><a name="060425125000073"></a><div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000220"></a>PaddyTipping:</b> I want to build on the point that the hon.Gentleman made that the registration process was flawed and that therewas injustice. I have no doubt about that. I would have liked to see abolder approach but clause 19 allows only minor corrections. Largeparcels of land throughout the country should have been registered buthave been left out. That is an injustice initself.</div><a name="060425125000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want todraw the attention of the Minister and his officials&#151;I know thatthey have been to Cumbria frequently to survey the scenethere&#151;to an example that was provided to me by that excellentorganisation, the Friends of the Lake District, which worked extremelyhard in the other place to modify the Bill and has been involved in theissue of commonholders associations and how they are developed. Theydrew my attention to a piece of land at Thirlmere, some of which hasbeen registered as common land. Under the <div class="Column"><a name="Column52" />Column number: 52</div>registration process the open fell was registered as common land, butsome of the common land, which was part of the landscape adjacent toit, had been planted and forested, so during the registration processit was not included on the register. There are strong feelings aboutthat. Forested land does not necessarily always remain forested. I ampleased with some of the Forestry Commission&#146;s work to removewoodland and return landscape to its nativehabitat.</div><a name="060425125000184"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">4.30pm</div><a name="060425125000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">As it stands,clause 19(2)(b)(i) does not allow the amount of the land to beincreased at all. I followthe hon. Member for South-EastCambridgeshire(Mr. Paice) on this point. My amendment issimple;it would strike out that possibility and allow theregistration authority to increase the amount of common land. I knowthat this is a radical amendment to clause 19, which just allows forminor correction. Sometimes, amendments are called probing amendments,but I want to use mine as a prodding amendment to remind the Ministerand the people who follow our debate that injustices have been done inthe past and that land that should have been registered&#151;it hadall the attributes for registration&#151;should have beenincluded.</div><a name="060425125000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wouldlike to see a greater proportion of common land and common rightsacross the country.

Friend the Memberfor South-East Cambridgeshire. I have not had the privilege of massivecorrespondence from William Pumfrey, MA Cantab., so I do not wish tosupport the exact wording of his amendment. However, I hope that theMinister considers whether on Report we might get an all-partyamendment to clause 19(3). It refers to two reasons why the registermay be corrected when itsays:</div><a name="060425125000177"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Referencesin this section to a mistakeinclude&#151;</div><a name="060425125000178"></a><div class="hs_brev">(a) amistaken omission;and</div><a name="060425125000179"></a><div class="hs_brev">(b) un unclear orambiguousdescription.&#148;</div><a name="060425125000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hopethat the Minister will say that he will add corrections to the 1965Act, because there are a large number of small but important injusticesarising from it. We cannot have the explanation that the 1965 Act wasdefinitive, is set in stone and can never be changedagain.</div><a name="060425125000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Ministerhas the privilege of being on an extraordinary Committee. When I was aHome Office Minister and passed many wonderful bits of legislation, theoldest Act that I ever managed to amend was something relating to the18th century. If colleagues turn to pages 44 and 45 of theBill&#151;sexy schedule 6, which deals with repeals andamendments&#151;they will see at the bottom of page 45 that theMinister is repealing the whole of the Commons Act 1285. I suspect thatthat sets a ministerial precedent in Committee: no one has ever amendedsuch an ancient Act. If the 1285 Act, which <div class="Column"><a name="Column53" />Column number: 53</div>was set in concrete or granite for eight centuries, can be repealed bythe Minister, I am sure that a few tweaks to the 1965 Act may beappropriate.</div><a name="060425125000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">Lookingat the other Acts that are being amended&#151;including the repeal ofsection 21 of the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866 and section 2 of theGifts for Churches Act 1811&#151;I do not think that the Ministercould say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, we can&#146;t touch the 1965Act. It was the definitive Act, the bible of commonslegislation.&#148; We know that mistakes have been made.</div><a name="060425125000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for Sherwoodis right to quote some examples in Cumbria. There are numerous otherexamples. It is not a mega, mega injustice; it is not that all the 1965Act is invalidated, but mistakes were made in all innocence andhonesty. We should have the ability now, after due process, to correctthem, not by arbitrary changing of the register but by going throughthe various processes in the Act and correcting registration mistakesmade in 1965.</div><a name="060425125000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">I donot believe that the Minister can say that clause 19(3) deals with thatissue. I hope that he will accept an amendment on Report thatspecifically mentions the 1965 Act in much simpler language than in theesteemed William Pumfrey&#146;s amendment, and then we can deal withinjustices done in1965.</div><a name="060425125000083"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000222"></a><b class="B">Mr.Elfyn Llwyd</b> (Meirionnydd Nant Conwy) (PC): I agreeentirely with what has just been said. Years ago, I used to practisethe area of law under the 1965 Act, and I came across mistakes time andagain&#151;not of my own doing, I hasten to say. I would often findthat rights had been registered throughout southern Gwynedd by a wellheeled landowner from 100 miles away. To correct those mistakes, thosewho were suffering as a direct result would have to go to the HighCourt. That was the greatest mistake in thatAct.</div><a name="060425125000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have heard inprevious discussions that the 1965 Act was flawed. By and large, it wasnot a bad Act. It was a bit too complicated in parts, but the bigmistake was that it was left to those who were suffering to try tocorrect entries that were patently wrong for whatever reason, whetherby mistake or fraud. They would go to the registration authority, but,ultimately, the answer would be, &#147;Take it to the HighCourt.&#148; Tenant farmers from north Wales could not even considerthat, despite the rights being an integral part of their farmingoperation.</div><a name="060425125000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">Imentioned in last week&#146;s debate that I hoped that the Bill wouldallow for those corrections to be made without reference to litigation,as has just been suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. I did not get afull response at that stage&#151;nor, to be fair, was I expectingone&#151;but it will be a grave omission in this Bill if we do not atleast open the door to resolving the most blatant of the mistakesand/or wrong registrations of the past. As he said, we are not talkingabout root-and-branch repeal of the 1965 Act, but merely of an avenueto correct what needs to becorrected.</div><a name="060425125000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I put thisas strongly as I can. It is clear that these things must be corrected.There are numerous examples in my own vicinity of people who aresuffering as a direct result of wrong registrations and who feel thatthe value of their registration rights has been undermined. Worse stillare those cases that, <div class="Column"><a name="Column54" />Column number: 54</div>strictly speaking, involve not an absentee landlord but someone from afarm who might have registered 10 times as much land as he was entitledto, and whose over-grazing is directly causing difficulties in the mostpersonal way to those small tenant farmers who rely on that grazingland in the spring and summer. In terms of the environment, we are allaffected, because even if the tenant farmers send up fewer sheep thanthey should, they find that most of the pasture has been taken over bythe stock of the wrongly registered dominant tenement. Therefore, interms of the environment and justice and to get the Bill right, I urgethe Minister to accept the course that has been suggested to him. Icertainly would join on an all-party basis to correct this omission inthe Bill.</div><a name="060425125000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">I dare saythat none of us were in Parliament when the 1965 Act was passed. I donot know how the omissions got into that Act, but, here and now, we arecreating law and are capable of correcting the omissions. We should dothat, as we have to consider all eventualities to make good law. I amnot saying for one moment that there will be an awful flood ofcorrections, but there will be several of them. There is the Cumbrianexperience, and I have spoken briefly about north Wales, mid-Wales andother places. Undoubtedly, corrections will have to be made, but theregistration authority will be able to look carefully at each and everyone, and I hope that eventually the situation will be dulycorrected.</div><a name="060425125000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection (2)(b)(i) says ineffect that the commons registration authority may not amend itsregister if it will in any way affect</div><a name="060425125000180"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the extent of any landregistered as common land or as a town or villagegreen&#148;.</div><a name="060425125000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">By that, I readthat the only way in which an amendment can be made is, again, withreference to the High Court. Again, that is a mistake. If the matter islive and the extent of any land registered as common land or villagegreen is genuinely an issue, we should consider a means of dealing withit, rather than rely on the High Court every time.</div><a name="060425125000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">As a lawyer, I know thatmaking an application to the High Court does not come cheap. I hopethat I shall not be struck off for saying that but, on a serious point,it is no use saying to people, &#147;You can always take thatavenue.&#148; It is available to only a few. If we are legislatingproperly, we must legislate for everyone and all eventualities. If myreading is correct, must reference be made to the High Court? I thinkthat I am right, but I may be wrong. No doubt, the Minister will put meright if necessary.</div><a name="060425125000091"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000223"></a><b class="B">Mr.Philip Dunne</b> (Ludlow) (Con): I support the tenor of theamendments. I have a couple of observations that I do not think otherhon. Members have made. On Second Reading, I referred to the registrarin Shropshire who told me that he thinks there is as much unregisteredas registered common land. The prospect of mistakes remains, and aflexible system that, without the necessity of approaching the HighCourt, allows errors and omissions to be corrected makes eminentsense.</div> <a name="060425125000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">I apologisefor referring to my previous remarks, but the issue was brought home tome by the consequences of the mapping exercise that the Department is <div class="Column"><a name="Column55" />Column number: 55</div>undertaking through the Rural Payments Agency. Most farms have been toldthat the maps that they have supplied are incorrect. It is highlylikely that the maps covering common lands will not conform to theDepartment&#146;s expectations, and as a result of more detaileddigitised mapping, a number of errors are likely to arise in existingregistered common land. From a practical perspective, it is importantthat there is an opportunity to make corrections to the registeredcommon land boundaries.</div><a name="060425125000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">My final point, which is aboutfraudulent rights, also picks up on one of the consequences of thesingle farm payment scheme that we in England are obliged to undertake.Wales is relieved of it. All parties with a claim to a piece of landmust agree about each other&#146;s claims before the Rural PaymentsAgency will sanction payment&#151;when it eventually gets round tomaking payments. As a result of the multiplicity of claims to commonland, if somebody has fraudulently claimed a right or they believe thatthey have a right, they can frustrate payment of claims to those whohave entitlements not only to common land, but to their entire holding.They can potentially frustrate the payment of a large number of singlefarm payments.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000224"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> With due respect to the right hon. Member for

Penrith and The Border, the purpose of this Bill, if I understand it

correctly, is to repeal the whole of the 1965 Act. It is a question of

amending not the Act, but some of the entries in the register, which he

addresses. It is correct to do so, because obvious and glaring errors

have been entered into the registers. The hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire cites an instance of an individual who would have

registered grossly more than his rights in relation to a common.

However, let me give the example of two contiguous commons that are

both in my constituency and in a neighbouring constituency. On one, the

commoners got together and decided to register&#151;I think&#151;10

sheep to the acre but, on the adjoining common, the commoners got

together and decided to register one sheep to the acre. Not

surprisingly, the sheep moved from one common to the

other.</div><a name="060425125000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I wanted the

opportunity to mention a right of common that has not so far been

discussed. My French is not good, but my Norman French is even worse,

and I am told that the right is known as a right pour cause de

vicinage&#151;meaning the right for sheep to stray from one common to

another. If there were ever an example of that right, it is the sheep

that stray from the great forest of Brecknock to the manor of Mawr

Penderyn, where the two registrations that I mentioned took

place.</div> <a name="060425125000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are

such instances, and I am sure that my hon. Friends and I would support

any cross-party amendment that could persuade the Minister that obvious

registration errors should be dealt with more efficiently and

effectively than is allowed for in the Bill. On that basis, we support

the amendment and look forward to Report when we can perhaps effect a

much more permanent resolution to the

problem.</div>

<div class="Column"><a name="Column56" />Column number: 56</div><a name="060425125000097"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000225"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Before moving to the meat of the debate, I shall

speak to Government amendment No. 7 and not dwell unduly on accretion

and diluvion. In essence, the amendment enables the registers to be

updated to take account of natural variations in the boundaries

alongside rivers, lakes, or tidal

waters.</div><a name="060425125000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the more

substantive issues, amendment No. 64 is the one that has been devised

by Mr. Pumfrey. I have some sympathy with the amendment and the

individual in that case, and I will genuinely reflect on what has been

said. However, for now, I am unable to accept the amendment and I shall

endeavour to explain

why.</div><a name="060425125000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">Undoubtedly,

some common land and some greens were not registered under the 1965

Act. Often, people did not realise that there was an

opportunity&#151;indeed, a requirement&#151;to register, and it was

soon too late to do so, because that Act sought to create a definitive

register, and its main sanction to compel the registration of commons,

including those made by statute as in this case, was that failure to

register before the cut-off meant that the land would not be common

land. That is how this circumstance came about, and I understand that

the amendment would afford a second chance in relation to land that was

once undoubtedly common land, because it was so designated in an Act of

Parliament. On first glance that seems reasonable, but it poses a

difficulty. The 1965 Act provided that unregistered land was deemed not

to be common land, and the view of the courts is that the Act trumps

any preceding provision in another Act. So land may be designated as

common land but, in our view, it is no longer so, and it would be

difficult to provide for its registration now, when it is not what it

claims to be.</div><a name="060425125000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) speaks with some

authority on such matters, and I need to take his thoughts seriously,

because there is an opportunity to look at matters afresh and not

necessarily accept history. My understanding, however, is that if

owners of such land wish to have it registered under the Bill, they

could create a right of common over the land in favour of another

person and secure its registration under clause 6. Alternatively they

could, as owner, apply for registration of the land as a green under

clause 15(7). So there are one or two options to right wrongs, as long

as owners wish to do so; all hope is not lost. However, in the case of

Monken Hadley common, I gather that the trustees do not believe that

their powers are sufficient for that purpose, which gives them a

particular problem. I will have to reflect on whether I wish to grasp

the elegant solution offered by the right hon. Member for Penrith and

The Border. I take great pride in taking this Bill forward, and I

suspect that his solution is a little too broad.</div>

<a name="060425125000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have concerns about

amendments Nos. 35, 48 and 49. We accept that there were flaws in the

1965 Act. Land and rights were registered that should not have been,

and vice

versa.</div><a name="060425125000102"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000226"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> It seems to me that the real flaw in the 1965

registrations was that somebody claiming a right could put forward

their claim without any evidence, and people who disputed that

application had to prove that it was incorrect. That is why these

errors have been 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column57" />Column number: 57</div>included; often, people did not want to object to an application for an

entry on the

register.</div><a name="060425125000103"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000227"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am sure that that may be the case, but the

fundamental question is that while one amendment wants us to include

land that was missed out, another wants to exclude land that was put

in, and similarly with rights.</div>

<a name="060425125000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Committee&#151;and

ultimately Parliament&#151;has to take a view on whether we want to

try to get all the wrongs righted, and open the can of worms that the

right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border referred to, or whether we

want to move on 40 years after the date. I have concerns about

reopening the can of worms relating to what are registered rights and

what is registered land. We might reopen all sorts of claims, and all

sorts of valuations. We are discussing things that are bought and sold,

and the value of those rights and that land would be affected. There

would be disputes. I am sure we would create a lot of business for the

former colleagues of the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, but I

am unsure whether that is the best motivation for doing

this.</div><a name="060425125000105"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000228"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I am not particularly rising to that bait. Schedule

2 addresses the rectification of mistakes under the 1965 Act. In it, we

cater for wasteland of a manor and other land wrongly

registered&#151;common land, town land and so forth. We deal with

ownership and registration per se, but we do not deal with

rectification of rights in respect of grazing and so forth. That is the

flaw. The rest of the schedule is good, but we have not dealt with this

vacuum.</div><a name="060425125000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000229"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I will reflect on the points made in the debate,

and, prior to Report, I would very much welcome the thoughts of Members

on whether it is possible to frame legislation in a way that

sufficiently closely defines it to ensure that we do not open a can of

worms&#151;so that we can define clear mistakes without then

including a bunch of other mistakes. I do not think that anyone

involved in the consultation did not want us just to be able to get on

with creating a workable

system.</div><a name="060425125000107"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000230"></a>David

Maclean:</b> May I press the Minister slightly on that point?

It is difficult for us as the Opposition and for minor parties to draft

technical amendments. However, if I understand the Minister correctly,

he is saying that his officials will work with us on a more narrowly

defined range of amendments to the 1965 Act. I accept that sticking

into subsection (3) a reference to any mistake in the 1965 Act would be

far too wide, but if the Minister is looking at some of the suggested

issues on grazing, the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnorshire and for

Meirionnydd Nant Conwy have made some points. If officials of all

parties would co-operate with us to create a more narrowly defined set

of amendments, we might be able to do some business. Is that the

assurance that the Minister is giving

us?</div><a name="060425125000108"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000231"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am not making any promises. I am sharing my

problem with the Committee. I have some sympathy for Mr. Pumfrey and

with some of the points 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column58" />Column number: 58</div>that have been made but, as things stand, I do not see a way forward

without opening a can of worms. If hon. Members want to meet me and

officials during the next couple of weeks prior to Report to discuss

their thoughts on how it might be done, I will be happy to do so. I

will also let them know the conclusion of my thinking on the matter

before then, so that they will have time to make their own amendments

if they choose and if the circumstances require it. I could talk about

the amendments at some length, but I think that, on that basis, it is

fair to ask the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire whether he is

happy to withdraw

them.</div><a name="060425125000109"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000232"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I thank the Minister and hon. Members from all

parties who have spoken on the amendments and who are largely in

support of their thesis, if not always in support of the precise

terminology. I am grateful to the Minister for the generous invitation

at the end of his remarks. It is what we have come to expect of

him.</div><a name="060425125000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that

there must be a way. I feel quite strongly that simply to leave all the

errors and not to reopen the issue is wrong. It must be addressed. If

it can be done in a relatively narrow way, we all have a responsibility

to try to find that way. As I said in my opening remarks, it is in the

interests of justice&#151;justice for the common land users of

unregistered land and the rights owners who correctly registered their

rights and are disadvantaged by those who incorrectly registered them.

Justice requires us to exercise as much effort as we can to find a

solution.</div> <a name="060425125000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am

grateful to the Minister for his offer. I look forward to those

discussions and assume that his office will be in contact with all of

us to arrange them. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

<a name="060425125000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 8 relates to the

power in clause 24 to make regulations regarding applications under

part 1. Subsection (7)(a) will enable regulations to make provision for

the appointment of persons from a panel to deal with particular

applications. The amendment will ensure that regulations can assign

appointed persons to deal with a class of applications rather than

individual applications. For example, the Government might wish to

provide that all applications under schedule 2 to de-register wrongly

registered common 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column59" />Column number: 59</div>land must be referred to a person appointed from the panel. That would

ensure that the sort of legally and factually complex issues likely to

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000234"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I return to the issue that was discussed in

great detail in the other place: how the panel might be established

under the Bill. Is it a better solution for dealing with applications

of the type that we have discussed than having commons commissioners do

that or establishing a group of people who I think were termed

&#147;inspectors&#148; in the other place?</div>

<a name="060425125000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">A point has been put to me by

the commons registrations officer in Powys. We have indicated that some

mistakes were made in respect of the 1965 Act, but a huge amount of

land was registered in Powys&#151;probably 13 per cent. of all the

common land in England and Wales. None of the decisions were ever

challenged in any way. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy might

say that the reason was the high cost that could have been borne by the

person making the challenge. Nevertheless, the decisions were accepted

by the people involved. The issue that has been put to me is that we

should have some form of tribunal or statutory decision-making process

to give people confidence that there is the necessary objectivity and

clarity in these contentious

issues.</div><a name="060425125000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am told

that a tribunals Bill did not complete its passage and did not become

legislation. It would have been an appropriate vehicle to set up a

proper tribunal for these purposes. The other suggestion made to me was

that we could have something along the lines of the existing

agricultural tribunals. This might seem a small issue to the Minister,

but it is about confidence for those who own commons or who have rights

on them, and for the public who seek to enjoy them and to promote

nature conservation, archaeology and all the other issues on which we

have put so much emphasis today.</div>

<a name="060425125000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">I suspect that the Minister

will reject what I have said. I can see from the expression on his face

that he is conjuring up the words that will let me down gently, but

this is a matter of great concern. Although proposals were resisted by

the Minister in the other place, the Minister who is present in our

Committee has an opportunity to say that there will be a statutory form

or a statutory body to deal with this matter, rather than its being

dealt with by the seemingly ad hoc type of organisation referred to in

the Bill.</div>

<a name="060425125000124"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000235"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The clause gives the national authority powers to

make regulations regarding applications to amend registers of common

land, and town or village greens made under part 1. We are discussing

subsection (7) in particular. My understanding of what the hon.

Gentleman just said is that in essence the question is why we are

getting rid of the commons commissioners, who, to some extent,

currently have an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column60" />Column number: 60</div>authority. They have a certain amount of competence, so he wants to know

why we want to get rid of

them.</div><a name="060425125000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

commissioners were established under the 1965 Act to determine disputed

initial registrations under that Act. Commissioners had to be lawyers

of seven years&#146; standing. I do not criticise that decision, or

lawyers or those individuals for the job they have done. We expect that

most applications under part 1 of the Bill will be straightforward and

well within the capacity of registration authorities advised by the

likes of Mrs. Griffiths. Authorities already deal with all applications

for amendment to the registers under the 1965 Act.</div>

<a name="060425125000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">Where applications raise

particularly difficult matters of law or fact, we have made provision

for them to be determined by an independent panel inspector. The

amendment that we have just discussed would allow referral to

particular individuals. Unlike commissioners, panel inspectors may be

qualified because of their knowledge and experience, or technical

understanding of agricultural practice, rather than their legal skills.

That will add value over what happens at present, when the

commissioners are simply there by virtue of their legal background. On

that basis, I hope that the Committee will agree to the clause, as

amended, standing part of the Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000236"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 50, in page 15, line 5,

leave out &#145;association' and insert

&#145;council'.</div><a name="060425125000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

is a challenge to know how to introduce the amendment. I would be quite

happy if the Minister said that he would be happy to accept it, and we

could move on, because it has huge support, which I will describe. The

amendment is logical and sensible and I look forward to listening to

any reason that the Minister might have to oppose it. It goes without

saying that were it to be approved, there would be a large number of

consequential amendments and I hope that we will not waste time arguing

about that. We are at the principal point at which the term to be

applied to the new statutory bodies needs to be considered.</div>

<a name="060425125000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">As the Committee and the

Minister are aware&#151;the Minister made the point in his previous

comments on Second Reading, in the Committee and outside the

House&#151;it is expected that a very large number of voluntary

commons associations will remain in existence. Indeed, the Minister

said that there will be many occasions on which groups of them will

come together to form a statutory body, which is why the next few

clauses in the Bill are relatively vague. I entirely agreed with the

Minister when he said that he wants to leave it open to see how things

work and how groups of organisations and people come together. We 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column61" />Column number: 61</div>will discuss later issues such as the proportion that should belong to

commoners. Overall, I support the Minister&#146;s desire for

flexibility.</div><a name="060425125000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">A number

of these overarching bodies already exist. We discussed on Second

Reading the Dartmoor commoners council, which is laid down in

statute&#151;the Minister has tabled an amendment on the matter.

There is the Federation of Cumbria Commoners, the Federation of

Yorkshire Commoners and Moorland Graziers, the Welsh commoners forum

and, I am sure, many, many other groups of individuals who come

together within an umbrella organisation. What is common to them is

that they bring together voluntary commons

associations.</div><a name="060425125000134"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

second part of my case is that there is no doubt that many voluntary

commons associations are not convinced that it is in their interests to

convert into statutory associations because of the costs and regulation

involved in doing so. The Minister will seek to allay that concern, but

it is genuine. Thoughts on the issue are being put forward in a joint

paper by the NFU and the National Sheep Association, which represent

many hundreds of commoners. The Welsh commoners forum is also involved

in putting the

case.</div><a name="060425125000135"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

associations are very concerned that there considerable added costs

will be involved in running a statutory body by comparison with running

a voluntary body. The Minister made it clear that he wants to keep

voluntary bodies when they wish to remain so. Indeed, it is

likely&#151;many may say desirable&#151;that a statutory body would

be an umbrella body for a group of much smaller voluntary

associations.</div><a name="060425125000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">That

leads me to the issue of the terminology. For the life of me, I cannot

see why we need to call the statutory body an association, given that

the voluntary body will remain a voluntary association. That can lead

only to considerable confusion. As I said, many existing umbrella

bodies have chosen other words to describe themselves, such as

&#147;council&#148;, &#147;forum&#148;,

&#147;federation&#148; and so on.</div>

<a name="060425125000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not wedded to the word

&#147;council&#148;; if the Minister says that it has too many

local government connotations and that we need to think of another

term&#151;&#147;commons court&#148;, &#147;federation&#148;

or whatever&#151;I shall not mind. My principal point is that to

avoid confusion it would be wise for the word

&#147;association&#148; not to refer to both a statutory and a

voluntary body, because nobody would know the difference.</div>

<a name="060425125000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Somebody trying to deal with

their local commons association would not know whether it was statutory

or voluntary without some investigation. If the titles were different,

that person would know that there was a distinction. I have struggled

with this issue and I shall listen to the Minister with interest if he

tries to persuade us to leave the Bill as it is. There is, however, an

unarguable case for an alternative term. As I said, if the Minister

wants to think of a term different from &#147;council&#148;, so be

it, but it has to be other than

&#147;association&#148;.</div>

<a name="060425125000139"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000237"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I am happy to make an offer to the hon. Gentleman;

we will agree to &#147;council&#148; if he agrees to our amendments

that would promote legitimacy by having people elected to that body

rather than things 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column62" />Column number: 62</div>being contrived so that those who form the voluntary associations decide

who serves on them. I do not think that that would give such bodies any

great legitimacy. The hon. Gentleman may choose to think about that

offer before we come to clause 30.</div>

<a name="060425125000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am intrigued by the notion

of a difference between a council and an association. If I read the

regulatory impact assessment properly, the Government will set much

greater store by how people form themselves into that body, whatever it

is to be called, in respect of environmental and social

purposes&#151;environmental in the sense that it will be a

representative body that applies for environmental grants, or some form

of support, and the single farm payment and ascertains when they get

paid, and, more particularly, looks at the higher level of

environmental support for the area that people are farming.</div>

<a name="060425125000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">On the social side, we are

looking at some accountability and also some responsibility. Animal

welfare, in which I have an interest, is listed as one of the issues.

The last time I went out with the Royal Society for the Prevention of

Cruelty to Animals we were looking at a beast on Minchinhampton common,

which was mentioned on Second Reading. The RSPCA officers made it clear

how difficult they had found things because this animal was in some

distress, and it needed its hooves cutting back. The officers found it

difficult to serve an order because it was not clear whom the animal

belonged to; although they had tried to ascertain that, they had not

made much progress.</div>

<a name="060425125000142"></a><div class="hs_Para">I see this measure as

encouraging those who keep animals on the common, who will be part of

the representative body, to take some responsibility for the animals if

they are grazing on the common. To be honest, I am indifferent to how

we would change the term. &#147;Association&#148; means something

to me, but I can see the value of calling the body a council if that

differentiates it from existing voluntary associations, provided that

under clause 30 legitimacy is entailed as part of the

Bill.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000238"></a>David

Maclean:</b> I support my hon. Friend the Member for

South-East Cambridgeshire, who made a valid point. No point of

Conservative party philosophy is involved in the amendment; there

should be no political divide between us. I knew nothing about this

issue until I got a brief from the Federation of Cumbria Commoners. As

the hon. Member for Workington (Tony Cunningham), the Whip, will tell

the Minister, the Federation of Cumbria Commoners is not a big

Conservative landowning interest with an axe to grind, but represents

hundreds of small farmers and commoners on the fells in both our

constituencies, who are saying that this provision will simply cause

confusion. They generally like what the Government are trying to do in

the Bill and can understand the concept of a statutory association.

They are saying, &#147;We may continue with our voluntary

associations, but we might move to statutory ones if there is money in

it for us; and the Minister has all the money to go with the powers

that we will have&#148;&#151;although that is a different

debate.</div><a name="060425125000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Cumbria

commoners are saying that there will be total confusion if the

associations are called the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column63" />Column number: 63</div>same thing. Irrespective of the legitimacy of the new council or

statutory association, the Cumbria commoners are saying,

&#147;We&#146;re small farmers, not lawyers or experts, and when we

hear of a commoners association, we assume it is the current thing that

we have and understand. If the Government are going to create a new

body, please, for goodness&#146; sake, irrespective of the powers

they give it, just call it something different.&#148; The commoners

have suggested the word &#147;council&#148;, which is not set in

stone&#151;perhaps it could be an authority, or some other words

could be used&#151;but they want something different from commoners

associations, which is the current model that they all understand, have

had for many years and are happy with. The Government are creating

something new and they should call the statutory body something

different, so that we can tell the dog from the rabbit, as they might

say in

Cumbria.</div><a name="060425125000145"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000239"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> The Liberal Democrats support the setting up of

a statutory body to represent the interests on commons. The Minister

will know that whereas the voluntary associations have been successful

in entering some of the environmental schemes that have been available,

there has always been a difficulty, because they have always had to

have unanimous support from the commoners. We hope that the statutory

solution will ensure that when the majority of commoners wish to abide

by a management scheme agreed to achieve environmental objectives, the

whole of the common will be able to go in and get the benefit and all

the people who contribute to its management get the reward as

well.</div><a name="060425125000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">It was brought

to my attention some time ago that a common on Abergwesyn hill that

tried to enter an environmentally sensitive area scheme in Wales was

confounded because one of its members refused to conform to the

management scheme put in place. That is a huge disadvantage and damage

to the common, but it also affected those commoners who could have

benefited from it.</div><a name="060425125000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">We

support this measure, but we also believe that there is a role for

voluntary commons associations, because they do an awful lot of good

work in managing the commons, easing out problems arising from time to

time in terms of access and nature conservation and in the co-operative

gathering and shepherding of sheep that takes place to ensure that, for

instance, in terms of scab control, particular commons are cleared at a

particular time so that sheep are not left that can continue the cycle

of infection.</div><a name="060425125000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">We also

believe that confusion could occur, with the voluntary associations

being confused with the statutory bodies. We support the amendment

moved by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire. We are not

particular about what the statutory body is called, but if the

amendment were accepted it would give a huge amount of clarity to the

situation. It would not be cost-effective for some small commons to

form a statutory body on their own; they would get together to share

costs and administration, so there would be a common in two

associations&#151;a voluntary one and a statutory body. The concept

of common law, going back to manorial times, is difficult, but the

provision would just add a complication to that difficulty. I hope 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column64" />Column number: 64</div>that the Minister, with his graciousness and his understanding of the

issues, will accept the

amendment.</div><a name="060425125000149"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000240"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I think that all the points have been made, but I

should like to make one brief point. The Farmers Union of Wales and the

Wales National Farmers Union are as one on the issue; they believe that

there should be a change in nomenclature. When they actually agree,

there must be something serious going on. That would be an excellent

idea to avoid confusion. To support what other Members have said,

whatever the wording, it should differentiate the voluntary bodies from

the bodies set up under the Bill. Incidentally, the Farmers Union of

Wales and the Wales National Farmers Union also see the need for

voluntary bodies that work well to continue. They feel that we should

keep the statutory form as simple and as representative as we

can&#151;we shall come to that shortly, no doubt&#151;and that

things should be done with the minimum

cost.</div>

<a name="060425125000150"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000241"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful for the amendment. I recognise that

the term &#147;commons association&#148; might attract some

confusion, firstly because only appointed representatives, many of whom

will be elected, will be members of a commons association&#151;the

remaining commoners and landowners will simply be

participants&#151;and secondly because of the potential for confusion

with existing voluntary commoners associations. However, the Bill does

not require us to include the words &#147;commons association&#148;

in the name of each new statutory body. When making the establishment

order, the national authority has to decide on the name of each new

statutory body, and under the order it could well call it a commons

council.</div><a name="060425125000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having

listened, I am willing to consider a minor amendment to clause 26 that

would put beyond doubt the fact that the establishment order is not

restricted to using the words &#147;commons association&#148; in

the name of the new body.</div>

<a name="060425125000152"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425125000242"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Dan Rogerson</b> (North Cornwall) (LD): I am grateful to the

Minister for the direction in which he seems to moving. Unfortunately,

it would be rather odd for the Bill to refer to

&#147;associations&#148; throughout, and then for organisations to

have different titles across the country. Bodmin Moor Commoners

Association has formed as an interim group, based on the model of the

Dartmoor Commoners Council. They are obviously expecting that to be the

model for going forward. Does the Minister feel that there might be a

little more room for further movement on the

issue?</div><a name="060425125000153"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000243"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> There may be room. As ever, I am your flexible

friend. We may well want to call a new body a commons council. However,

if we were to change all the wording in the Bill, that would require a

considerable amount of consequential amendment, which might in turn

confuse people, but I do not rule that out at this stage; I just offer

the option of deciding to be consistent in all the order making, so

that the bodies would all be called the same thing. The Committee might

want to dwell on what that name 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column65" />Column number: 65</div>should be, because there may be confusion with councils, too. It may be

decided in some areas with a parochial church council, a parish

council, a district council and a county council that a new council

might be one council too far, particularly given how popular councils

can be with the public. Some areas may prefer a commons committee or a

commons court. I am relaxed about that; there is some merit in keeping

the wording in the Bill as it is but simply being consistent in the

order making, but I am happy to listen to the will of the Committee on

that.</div>

<a name="060425125000154"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000244"></a>David

Maclean:</b> Will the Minister accept that he is probably on

the thinnest ice that he has been on all day? That may be reassuring in

some ways. Almost every single subsection of clauses 26, 27, 28, 31 and

32 talks about commons associations. If every section and subsection of

the Act refers to commons associations, it is no good telling us that

at the end of the day they might be called councils, committees,

authorities, quangos or courts. They will always be known as

associations if the Act refers to them as

such.</div><a name="060425125000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I welcome the

Minister&#146;s assurance that we will look at other matters, but we

must do that in the next few days so that we can return to this matter

on Report. His other defences and his buts and howevers have been

reasonable, but he is being unreasonable about this

matter.</div><a name="060425125000156"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425125000245"></a>Jim

seriously. I am happy to consider the matter, but I am reluctant to

accept all the consequential amendments and the confusion that they

might

create.</div><a name="060425125000157"></a>

Member for Penrith and The Border. It would be worse still to leave the

wording in the Bill and then proceed with orders using another name.

That would be confusing in itself, let alone in comparison with a

voluntary body. It would be compounded. The point may seem small, but I

am sure that the Minister will get round it because he wants the Bill

to be a good Bill, as we

Government, presumably with some form of code of practice, go out and

encourage voluntary associations to think about becoming statutory

what they will be called if and when they become statutory bodies. We

need to know that sooner rather than

inferior than usual, because during today&#146;s proceedings the

Minister referred to the immense importance that he always attaches to

everything that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy says about

escaped such

could not be clearer or blunter, and to suggest that they should be

called something else is stretching the point. Nevertheless, the

Minister quickly moved on from that position to a more emollient one,

which I welcome. I am sure that the Bill is on a word processor

somewhere and I do not believe that the necessary amendments would be

difficult to achieve. I would be happy with the word

&#147;committee&#148;. My principal concern, as I made absolutely

clear, is to avoid confusion and I am unfussed about whether we have a

confusion of having both statutory and voluntary

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000144"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 61, in clause 27, page

15, line 28, after &#145;land', insert</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column67" />Column number: 67</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(and in particular persons actually

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000145"></a>The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000146"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> This is a short, straightforward amendment. It says

that, under the procedure for establishment in clause 27(5), the

appropriate national authority for the purposes of the

debate&#151;the Minister&#151;must have particular regard to

representations from three groups of people. We should make it clear

that, under subsection (5)(b), it should not only be those who are

entitled to exercise rights of common over such land. We have already

heard how many rights are not exercised, but what matters is that the

role of those who do exercise the rights over the land rather than

those who just own the rights should be particularly important. In

other words, if they were to receive an application to establish an

association and it transpired that virtually everyone who was pursuing

it may hold rights and be entitled to exercise them, but have not done

so since the year dot&#151;or, at least since 1965&#151;clearly

that application would be considered baseless. The amendment does not

require great changes to be made to the Bill, but it is important that

we ensure that the voice of the active commoners&#151;those who are

exercising their rights, and who obviously have a much greater role in

the management of the common, which is what the Bill is about&#151;is

strong.</div><a name="060425126000011"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000147"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> Our amendment is the same as that tabled by the

hon. Gentleman, although it is directed at a different place in the

Bill. As he said, it emphasises the difference between active and

inactive commoners. Many people with rights do not exercise them and it

seems wrong that their views should be of equal weight to those who do

exercise their rights. If the management of a common is to be altered

as a result of the formation of the statutory body&#151;the

association&#151;it is the people who are grazing the common who

should enable that change to take place, either by reducing the number

of stock on the common or increasing it. Inactive grazers are unlikely

to be encouraged to put stock on the common as a result of the

formation of a statutory

body.</div><a name="060425126000012"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000148"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> To add to that, will the hon. Gentleman not include

signing up management agreements with Natural England or the

Countryside Council for Wales, or even entering the Government&#146;s

higher level conservation stewardship

schemes?</div><a name="060425126000013"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000149"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman has made a good

point. The amendment would be useful because it would assure those

commoners who contribute so much to the management of the common that

their interests will be at the front of the national authority&#146;s

decision-making process. For those reasons, I hope that the Minister

considers it appropriate to accept the

amendment.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column68" />Column number: 68</div><a name="060425126000014"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000150"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> I support what has already been said. The

important principle is that those who exercise their rights are often

those who live and work close to the common. There might be many

examples of dominant tenements being owned by people who do not occupy

the premises and often have little to do with the common concerned. In

constituencies such as mine, there are large numbers of second homes;

properties lie empty for much of the year. In the past, many of those

may have been agricultural holdings. It is particularly unfair that

those who choose to take very little active part in the community or

the management of the commons should have equal rights to

representation or should be given equal standing when it comes to the

formation of a commons association, committee, council or whatever it

may

be.</div><a name="060425126000015"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000151"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> May I urge the Minister to accept the amendment? I

respectfully draw his attention to clause 39(1)(a), which is, in

effect, a template for the use of the amendment in another

context.</div><a name="060425126000016"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000152"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am just looking at clause

39(1)(a).</div><a name="060425126000017"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

resisting the amendments for a number of reasons to do with

flexibility. It would be difficult to define what constitutes the

active use of rights. Should commoners grazing two ewes for one day of

each year be considered as exercising their rights, or should it be a

greater proportion of rights for a more limited period each year? How

long should it be before rights are considered inactive? The commoners

may have entered an agri-environment agreement that necessitates rights

not being used for a period&#151;does that render them

inactive?&#151;or the common may not have restocked after suffering

the impact of disease, such as foot-and-mouth. It would also be

impossible to determine who falls within the definition of an active

commoner, even if one could be

determined.</div><a name="060425126000018"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill

does not prevent the national authority from according greater weight

to the views of what it may define as active commoners, which will be

important when there are a large number of clearly inactive commoners,

compared with the number of apparently active commoners. However, in

reality, on an agriculturally active common, it is likely that most

interest, and therefore most representations, would come from those

actively exercising their

rights.</div><a name="060425126000019"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000153"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I have listened to the Minister&#146;s argument

about how it might be difficult to ascertain who is exercising the

rights of common. Following the comment by the hon. Member for

Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, will he say how he will do that under clause

39?</div><a name="060425126000020"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000154"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am sure that I will do so when we get to clause

39. While I think about that, let me just offer one other scenario to

hon. Members. On a common where there is no, or very little,

agricultural activity, more weight might and should be attached to

representations received from persons with nature conservation

interests, or with statutory responsibilities for the common. We would

not want to prevent such persons from being involved in, or having

their voices heard in, the establishment of a commons

association.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column69" />Column number: 69</div><a name="060425126000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">On that basis, I hope that the

hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire will seek leave to withdraw

his

amendment.</div><a name="060425126000022"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000155"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I am disappointed with the Minister, because I do

not think that he has listened to the argument at all. I am not sure

whether he is coming to the end of his file

tonight.</div><a name="060425126000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">I made the

case as eloquently as I could, and I appreciate that it may have its

weaknesses, but the comment from the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant

Conwy underlined the matter completely. The phraseology is identical.

Under clause 39, it is to do with the consent for

works:</div><a name="060425126000134"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the national

authority&#148;&#151;</div><a name="060425126000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">that

is, the

Minister&#151;</div><a name="060425126000135"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;shall

have regard to...the interests of persons having rights in

relation to, or occupying, the land (and in particular persons

exercising rights of common over

it).&#148;</div><a name="060425126000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">He obviously

believes that, in that context, it is

possible.</div><a name="060425126000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000156"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Of course,

clause 39 differentiates between landowners and commoners, which is a

much more straightforward difference than the one between active and

non-active

commoners.</div><a name="060425126000027"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000157"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I fail to understand the logic of that

intervention, because we are only talking about people

having</div><a name="060425126000136"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the rights of

common over it&#148;.</div><a name="060425126000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some of

them will be owners, but some will not be. We are talking

about</div><a name="060425126000137"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the interests of

persons having rights in relation to, or occupying, the land (and in

particular persons exercising rights of common over

it).&#148;</div>

<a name="060425126000029"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000158"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> The issue here is that an owner cannot exercise

right of common because that involves exercising a right on someone

else&#146;s land. The Minister is wrong on this issue because it is

bound to revert to a situation of people exercising rights as

commoners, not as landowners.</div>

<a name="060425126000030"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000159"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; he adds to my

argument. The Minister is accepting, under clause 39, that he, as the

national authority, will be able to divine which persons exercise the

rights of common over the land. However, half of his justification for

rejecting the amendment is that he will not be able to do that in

relation to whether to set up an association. Frankly, it is a daft

position and not one I would have expected the Minister to adopt. I am

tempted to suggest that he has not read his notes because he would have

seen through the argument if he had read them beforehand. I am far from

satisfied with his response and unless he wishes to intervene, I do not

feel inclined to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425126000031"></a>

<a name="060425126000052"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000176"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I am disappointed that the Minister could not

see his way to accepting the amendment because there are other aspects

of the clause that give me cause for concern. Who can initiate a

procedure for establishment? There are many thousands of commons

throughout England and Wales and all essentially could apply to become

the statutory body, the association or whatever we decide to call it in

the end.I would think that the people best placed to initiate

such a procedure would be the owner of the common, the people who

exercise rights, or perhaps even inactive graziers or people involved in

the management of nature conservation, access or some other element of

the public good.</div>

<a name="060425126000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Organisations or individuals

could initiate the procedure for establishment, which would cause a lot

of work for a voluntary association, if that were in existence, or the

national authority. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural

Affairs or even the National Assembly of Wales could be swamped by

applications&#151;I will not call them malicious&#151;that were not

based on the best interests of the common. It causes me real concern,

because if such an application were made and it resulted in a lot of

work for individuals who were interested in the common, it might deter

them from making genuine applications that could improve

it.</div> <a name="060425126000139"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">5.45

pm</div><a name="060425126000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">People might

not consult enough among commoners or voluntary associations to

determine the most appropriate application, whether by an individual

common or by a number coming together to form a statutory body of

sufficient substance to justify the administration and costs. I

attempted to table an amendment to that effect, but I could not fit it

into the 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column71" />Column number: 71</div>Bill. There is cause for concern, which the Minister could address on

Report by coming forward with a limitation on the people who could

initiate such a procedure.</div>

<a name="060425126000055"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000177"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Clause 27 sets out a procedure for establishing a

commons association. An association will be brought into existence when

the Secretary of State makes an establishment order, and orders will be

tailored to the specific circumstances of the common or commons in

question. The first step in the establishment process will be at the

local level, and it is for local legal interests to decide whether they

want to establish a statutory association. We shall not impose an

association on a common.</div>

<a name="060425126000056"></a><div class="hs_Para">I can reassure the hon.

Gentleman that a commons association will not be foisted by interested

outsiders upon those involved in managing the common. We realise that a

local interest may need some help at the preliminary stage. In recent

years, the Rural Development Service has been significantly involved in

helping set up voluntary commons associations to assist commoners in

their applications for agri-environment funding. As part of Natural

England, the service will continue that work. Natural England will play

a vital role in helping to facilitate the creation of those local

associations where they make good sense, but not to impose

them.</div>

<a name="060425126000057"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000178"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I believe that the Minister is genuine about

that. He has before given us the assurance that DEFRA and&#151;I

certainly hope&#151;the National Assembly for Wales will not be

involved in enforcing the establishment of statutory associations.

However, that is not my concern. My concern is that people who are not

legally involved with the common might get it into their heads that

statutory associations are a good thing and make applications on behalf

of commons for which they have little interest.</div>

<a name="060425126000058"></a><div class="hs_Para">Nothing in this Bill prevents

somebody from initiating a procedure on behalf of a common where the

great majority has no interest in forming an association. The time and

effort that would have to go into consultation and representation would

be entirely wasted, and they would use up a huge amount of energy that

could be better expended in another

direction.</div>

<a name="060425126000059"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000179"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Regardless of who makes the application for a

commons association, the national authority will still be required to

ensure that there is substantial support for it. In assessing the level

of support, the national authority will publish the draft establishment

order and representations on it, paying particular regard to the views

of those with a legal interest in the common, regardless of who

applies. Where significant objections are made, there will be scope for

the national authority to, in turn, hold a local inquiry. Those

safeguards will prevent external interests from overriding the views of

those who would be most affected by any new commons

association&#151;the people whom the hon. Gentleman seeks to protect.

</div><a name="060425126000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">There are sufficient

safeguards in the mechanisms that are being set up for the

establishment of a statutory commons association. It is intended to be

a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column72" />Column number: 72</div>bottom-up process. Part 2 will not impose those associations on the key

local interests against their will.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000180"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Clause 29 requires the Secretary of State to make

regulations prescribing standard terms about the constitution and

administration of all commons associations. Regulations made under the

clause are subject to the affirmative procedure. The standard

constitution will cover matters that are relevant to all associations,

such as conduct of members, frequency of meetings, and financial

reporting.</div><a name="060425126000068"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000181"></a>Paddy

Tipping:</b> Is it prescribed in the standard constitution

that sittings of such bodies be in

public?</div><a name="060425126000069"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000182"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> We would expect that normally the sittings would

be but, as with most statutory bodies, there may be circumstances when

the associations may want to sit in

private.</div><a name="060425126000070"></a><div class="hs_Para">Each

association will also have its own establishment order that will set

out its functions. That order can modify the standard constitution when

necessary, or can replace standard terms with terms more suited to

local circumstances. Some Members may have seen the draft standard

constitution and the specimen draft establishment order that we

published last autumn, and which were wielded in the Chamber by the

hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy. They illustrate how the

establishment order might integrate with and modify parts of the

standard constitution. There is also an example of one possible

approach to representation, and a voting mechanism for situations in

which there are different interests for a group of

commons.</div><a name="060425126000071"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000183"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> Is the Minister prepared to produce copies of the

two orders so that the Committee can examine them between now and the

conclusion of our deliberations? They came to me surreptitiously, but I

lost them, or maybe they were surreptitiously lifted&#151;I am not

sure.</div><a name="060425126000072"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000184"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I apologise to the Committee&#151;it would

probably have been useful had I anticipated that request and circulated

the documents in advance. They are available on the DEFRA website but I

shall make 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column73" />Column number: 73</div>sure that members of the Committee have copies. The net effect of the

documents would be to reduce the demands and potential costs on those

who want to create an association, but to leave them the flexibility

that they

need.</div><a name="060425126000073"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000185"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I believe that the issues with which we shall

deal in this and the following clause will determine whether the

statutory associations succeed. If there is any doubt about the support

that the Minister has for the Bill, especially from commoners

themselves, it arises from these issues, so if he could supply the

draft documents that would be good. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd

Nant Conwy is a known magician, and the way in which he produced the

documents out of a hat on that occasion was extraordinary and well up

to his usual

standards.</div><a name="060425126000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope

that there will be consultation on the standard constitution before the

regulations are made, because people would like to be involved, and

consultation would give them confidence that their interests are being

looked after. I have no doubt that there will be many amendments to the

standard constitution, because the nature of commons is extraordinarily

varied. For example, I have only to look to the common of Llangors lake

in my constituency, which is entirely composed of water, and over which

there are no rights at all, unless one can walk on water. I do not even

think that the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 applies to that

common, and I assure the Committee that there are no rights of piscary.

Yes, there will be amendments to the standard constitution, but that

standard constitution will be the basic document, and people must have

confidence in

it.</div><a name="060425126000075"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000186"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> For information, the hon. Gentleman should know

that the standard constitution will be subject to affirmative

resolution, so it will be scrutinised by both

sides.</div><a name="060425126000076"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000187"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> That is a great comfort. I am not sure whether

many of the commoners whom I represent understand the affirmative

resolution procedure, but I am sure that they will be heartened by that

comment. The more time that the Minister, DEFRA and the National

Assembly for Wales can take on the issue, the better the rewards will

be. I assure him that I will be out there encouraging people to take up

this opportunity and make the most of it, but we must put the

foundation in place to make a success of what should be a good piece of

legislation.</div><a name="060425126000077"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000190"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> It is a pleasure to speak to amendments Nos. 101

and 73 in this group. Amendment No. 101 is about how the constitution

should look. I cannot remember the details of the constitution that the

hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy produced on Second Reading, but

I suspect that it did not include as a majority on the commons

association those people who exercise rights on the common. This is a

probing

amendment.</div><a name="060425126000086"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000191"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> If I can enlighten the hon. Gentleman&#151;I am

speaking from memory&#151;I believe that the constitution said that

the membership would be between 10 and 12, of which five or six would

be commoners and the rest would have other interests. If that will be

the number, it will not leave a great deal of room for elected members,

for example, and it will not allow for a sufficient majority in favour

of the

commoners.</div><a name="060425126000087"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000192"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me how

the association would be constituted. Again, those people who actively

manage the common should have a majority on the association, and I know

that hon. Members will also be considering ways in which people can be

elected. For generations, people have contributed to producing commons

that are in good heart and under sound management. I hope that the

amendment will give confidence to such people so that they can continue

that work and so that their vision will drive it forward in the

future.</div><a name="060425126000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that

amendment No. 73 will appeal to the hon. Member for Sherwood, as it

would require that meetings of commons associations should be held in

public. They might want to transact some business such as financial

matters, particularly financial matters involving members of the

association, in closed 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column75" />Column number: 75</div>session, but, if the amendment were accepted, the general presumption

would be that the meetings would be held in public, which is best

practice for public bodies transacting their

business.</div><a name="060425126000089"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000193"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> I rise to support amendment No. 73, to which the

hon. Gentleman just referred, and amendment No. 37 and new clause 3,

which are in my name and the names of my hon. Friends the Members for

Sherwood and for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell). We had a debate under the

previous clause as to whether meetings of the associations, now to be

called committees, should be held in public. I was happy that my hon.

Friend the Minister agreed to the draft orders being made available.

There must be clarification on which matters would be discussed in

public. I accept that the caveats will be finance and, as discussed in

the debate in the other place, matters that refer to individuals who

may be taking action against another individual. We would not expect

such matters to be discussed in public, but I hope that they would be

reported on publicly in due

course.</div><a name="060425126000142"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.15

pm</div><a name="060425126000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No.

37 and new clause 3 duplicate each other in a sense, although new

clause 3 is somewhat longer. It sets out what we have in mind&#151;to

give some democratic accountability to the bodies&#151;in two ways.

It provides for elections, which we hope would also include election of

the commoners themselves, to give them legitimacy. We also wish the

bodies to have a local essence, and we feel that that aspect would be

best performed by parish or town councils.</div>

<a name="060425126000092"></a><div class="hs_Para">The analogy is that where

parish and town councils have allotments, they would bring forward

representatives of those bodies. We feel that that is a good model,

which can be replicated with commons or village greens. Parish and town

councils would certainly be responsible for village greens, but it is

possible that in terms of commons they do not have a say at present,

and we wish to open this up to give local accountability and local

legitimacy. One hopes that councils would take a strong interest in the

matter. We also hope that local areas would want to take an interest in

tying in such a plan with the environmental assistance that the

Government make available through changes in the common agricultural

policy, and to take some responsibility for it.</div>

<a name="060425126000093"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although the amendments are

probing amendments, they are useful in that they lay down in terms of

statutory instruments how we would want the elections to take place.

There are a number of details, but unless such provisions are put in

the Bill or at least debated so that we know exactly what the

Government have in mind, this ad hoc measure will never be teased out.

I hope that the Government will respond. I am sure that my hon. Friends

want to talk in more detail about how they think it might work in

practice.</div><a name="060425126000094"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000194"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> The amendments, including my amendments Nos. 51 and

65, raise a number of issues. Before I enter into the details, I shall

mention that in this clause we are considering almost a contradiction.

I can understand how it has arisen. In earlier debates the Minister

used the argument for flexibility, which I support in principle, yet

here we are with a standard 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column76" />Column number: 76</div>constitution that will be subject to the affirmative resolution process

in the House. Obviously, the element of flexibility will therefore be

more than a little bit reduced. I am not arguing against a standard

constitution, but I think that it seriously diminishes the value of

using the flexibility argument against some of the amendments that hon.

Members have put forward and that I am about to

address.</div><a name="060425126000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are

talking about a plethora of different scenarios. Huge commons, and many

small commons, each with a voluntary association, will come together

under a large umbrella association following the Minister&#146;s

early edict. He continually refers to them as associations for the sake

of the Bill, but they will operate under a much larger statutory

umbrella body. They could include hundreds of rights holders or half a

dozen; there could be one relevant local authority or half a dozen. We

will inevitably be dealing with a huge variety.</div>

<a name="060425126000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I look forward to seeing the

draft constitution when the Minister provides it for us, but it does

give rise to a question. This is a general point, to which I hope he

will respond. He might leave things open, but does he envisage that the

management of the association should be done by some sort of

board&#151;I cannot use the word &#147;committee&#148; because of

the earlier agreement&#151;a group of officers or something else? I

cannot imagine how it could be possible for a body with 10 or 12

members to represent all the interests in some of the larger

situations.</div> <a name="060425126000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let us

consider the area in which the constituency of my right hon. Friend the

Member for Penrith and The Border is situated, and the Cumbria

commoners. I do not know how many associations there are in that

overall council, but I suspect there are several. I would be hard

pushed to identify just 10 or 12 individuals to sit on such a body.

Therefore, I am unsure that there will not be a need for a larger top

body, with some sort of board, management group or something else

underneath it. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that particular

point. My amendments are aimed at that top body rather than at whatever

management board there will be where necessary.</div>

<a name="060425126000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">I understand that the Minister

wants flexibility, but I have a lot of sympathy with the point raised

in amendment No. 101: the majority involved should be owners of rights

on the common. I want to refer to clause 31, which we shall come to and

which lays down the functions. The functions of an association are

quite limited and are generally agricultural. They relate to the

management of agricultural activities, vegetation and the rights, which

will be largely agricultural although some of them might be

piscary.</div><a name="060425126000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am not

convinced by the argument of the hon. Member for Stroud about the need

for lots of local authorities and such bodies to get involved, because

we are talking about a pretty narrow sphere of agricultural functions.

That is why it is important that the principal people involved are

those who are carrying out such activities on the common: the owners of

the rights of common. So, I support amendment No. 101.</div>

<a name="060425126000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">My amendment No. 51 is

slightly different, and seeks to say that the standard constitution

should 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column77" />Column number: 77</div>determine the proportion of the members who should be owners of the

rights. I would go along with the majority being in that situation, as

the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire suggested. There needs, at

least, to be a reference about the proportion of the association who

should be owners of rights.</div>

<a name="060425126000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">I come on to amendment No. 65,

which raises an issue that I raised briefly on Second Reading and which

has not yet come up during Committee. On reflection, the amendment is

probably directed at slightly the wrong place in the clause, but that

is a separate issue and can be addressed at another time. The principal

issue is about who should be in the association. This following is not

necessarily an exclusive list, but it should be inclusive. Obviously,

the commons rights holders should be involved. It is essential that the

owner or owners of the land should also be in the association, as

should tenants of the land.</div>

<a name="060425126000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">I particularly want to refer

to the last group in my amendment, which is the holders of sporting

rights. I wish to do so because the holders of sporting rights will

hold them by virtue of the owner of the land. As I understand the law,

they will be leasing the rights not from the commons or the rights

holders, other than perhaps in extreme situations, but from the owner

of the land. The obvious example would be those commons that are also

grouse moors, but many smaller commons will have rough shooting or

other conventional forms of shooting sports taking place on them. The

shooting rights will be leased from the owner of the land, often for a

significant period, possibly 10

years.</div><a name="060425126000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that

the hon. Member for Sherwood takes an interest in such things and that

the Minister will know that the value of sporting rights can be

influenced over several years of practice in developing the sporting

activity, habitat and so on. Therefore, I am concerned that the commons

association could take action that was to the serious detriment of the

holder of the sporting rights over a period of time. If someone has

just signed a 10-year sporting lease when the commons association comes

along and makes management decisions according to functions under

clause 31, which are extremely deleterious to the sporting capacity of

the land, that person would have no comeback. That would be a very

serious situation.</div> <a name="060425126000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

am not suggesting that simply being a member of an association would

prevent such situations, but the holders of sporting rights should at

least be in the association, which is why I included them in amendment

No. 65. I hope that the Minister will understand&#151;picking up the

earlier gentle gibe of the hon. Member for Sherwood&#151;that this is

not some sort of throwback to antiquated support for landowners, but a

recognition that sporting rights are an extremely valuable commodity to

the individual and to the local economy of a number of areas. Grouse

moors, in particular, add huge sums of money to local communities and

the people undertaking rough shoots on more conventional common land

will be ordinary working people enjoying a day out with a gun and a

dog, perhaps. The important point is that their rights need to be taken

into account, if not totally protected, in the setting up and

constitution of an association, which is why they are included in

amendment No. 65.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000195"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> May I illustrate for the benefit of the Committee

some of the problems posed by introducing too much democracy into some

of these associations? The example I would like to cite relates to a

common in my constituency and the Stiperstones commoners association,

which has three holders of grazing rights, one of whom is retired and

is not exercising his rights. The common is a substantial one covering

an area of 1,000 acres, with only two practising graziers. If the local

authorities and the landowner&#151;I support the contention of my

hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that the landowner

and the tenant of the land should have rights&#151;were to be

included in the commons association and too many other organisations

were involved, the graziers, under the proposals in some of the

amendments, would be automatically outvoted in associations. That

cannot be

right.</div><a name="060425126000106"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000196"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> That is the whole point of trying to democratise

these bodies: to energise graziers so that they come back to use and

advance their rights properly. I accept that there may have to be a

balance between the rights of the grazier, the owner and other bodies,

but that is exactly the problem with a number of commons associations

at the moment. They do not have any life and they are effectively

inert.</div>

<a name="060425126000107"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000197"></a>Mr.

Dunne:</b> The hon. Gentleman makes the point that I am trying

to make. In many cases, graziers are not there to take up the grazing

rights. The land does not have the capacity to sustain more livestock.

Therefore, it is down to the few people who remain actively involved in

it to continue to enter into management agreements to preserve

agricultural activity on these commons. If we try to put in place a

prescriptive system for the management of the great diversity of common

lands, we are in great danger of over-regulating what in many cases

requires a very light touch.</div>

<a name="060425126000143"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.30

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000198"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Some interesting points have been made during this

debate. Amendment No. 101 would require a standard constitution or an

establishment order to ensure that commons rights holders have a

majority of votes in the association. Each commons association will be

different because of the numbers and characteristics of its commons. It

will not always be appropriate for rights holders to be in the majority

in an association, especially on a lowland common where common rights

are not exercised actively or perhaps even on the common to which the

hon. Member for Ludlow referred where there are only two active

graziers. However, when an association consists of agriculturally

active commons it may be appropriate for active rights holders to have

a majority. It is important to retain flexibility so that the

association can be tailored to local

circumstances.</div><a name="060425126000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire was not questioning

flexibility or a standard constitution, but how the two fitted

together. If it would help him, at the end of my comments on the

previous clause I said that that will reduce demands and potential

costs on those seeking to form associations because they would be able

to see a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column79" />Column number: 79</div>standard constitution agreed by both Houses. However, as for

flexibility, we can vary away from that if the national authority

chooses to do so to suit local

circumstances.</div><a name="060425126000110"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000199"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I challenge the Minister on that matter. If he is

absolutely correct, fine, but am I right that he is suggesting that the

Bill is giving the national authority power to permit another

constitution that is not in accord with the standard constitution that

the House has

approved?</div><a name="060425126000111"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000200"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Each association will be set up by order. My

understanding is that, when each is set up and properly consulted on

through the process of establishment, if there is a variation away from

the standard that seems sensible for the local association, that will

be possible. If I am wrong, I will advise the hon. Gentleman. However,

I am assured that I am

not.</div><a name="060425126000112"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000201"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> For the purpose of clarity, is the Minister saying

that the order setting up the association will take precedence over the

order approving the standard

constitution?</div><a name="060425126000113"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000202"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Yes, that is set out under clause

29.</div><a name="060425126000114"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000203"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> Strictly speaking, the order would not then be

subject to the affirmative resolution procedure because the order in

its final form would be drafted by someone else and not by the

House.</div><a name="060425126000115"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000204"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The standard constitution would be subject to the

affirmative procedure so that, when those seeking to set up an

association from the bottom up are looking at how to start and at what

sort of rules would be wanted to govern the work of the association and

its procedure, they would see that standard rules have been agreed

actively by both Houses through the affirmative procedure. That would

be helpful in streamlining and fast tracking the approach while still

retaining the flexibility that ultimately we want to be able to offer.

As has been said, each common and its situation is

different.</div><a name="060425126000116"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000205"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> The Minister has been generous all day in giving

way. However, I do not follow his argument. I had a quick look at the

standard orders. There is nothing untoward in them. Let us suppose that

there is a huge common with lots of sporting and recreational rights,

owners, grazing and even fishing rights. To bring in the democratic

element and to accommodate all those interests, surely the 10 to 12

would have to be doubled. If the standard constitution that had been

passed by order under the affirmative resolution procedure is then

effectively doubled in size outside, would that not seem a little

strange?</div><a name="060425126000117"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000206"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I do not regard that as strange because the

intention of a standard constitution is to minimise the repeated need

for parliamentary scrutiny of many standard forms. There is still the

ability to vary away from those standard forms, which will be subject

to scrutiny once the national authority brings it forward, but each

time an association is set up, we do not need 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column80" />Column number: 80</div>to go over and over again those matters that are lifted straight from

the standard set of rules that have been agreed under the affirmative

procedure. I hope that that explanation is

helpful.</div><a name="060425126000118"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000207"></a>Mr.

Paice:</b> I apologise to the Minister for intervening again

but, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said, he has been

generous. I want to be clear about the propriety of such matters. As

the Minister said, the standard constitution will be approved by

affirmative procedure. As I understand clauses 26 and 27, the order

establishing each statutory body will not go through under the

affirmative procedure. I am no expert in House procedure, but I find it

surprising that a ministerial order can take precedence over the

affirmative procedure. Surely, at least the order setting up an

association should be subject to the affirmative

procedure.</div>

<a name="060425126000119"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000208"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> It would occupy a considerable amount of

parliamentary time if every order were subject to the affirmative

procedure. Each order setting up an individual association supplements

what has been agreed, and by going through that process, we are trying

to save time and make things easier for people. The Committee may want

to reflect on that. If it has any further questions for me, I shall, as

ever, be willing to deal with them.</div>

<a name="060425126000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Member for South-East

Cambridgeshire asked about large associations and whether there will be

any form of executive group. Commons associations could be set up over

as large, as many or as few commons as the local legal interests

support. We should expect many associations to cover more than one

common, and in such cases, the number of representatives would be

tailored to suit the size and type of commoners. The Dartmoor commoners

council has jurisdiction over 30 commons, for example. A large

association might include a governing body with smaller committees, but

crucially it would still be just one association. There is flexibility

in the legislation. I think that I have dealt with amendment No. 101,

and I hope that I have given the hon. Gentleman sufficient reason to

withdraw it.</div> <a name="060425126000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.

Friend the Member for Stroud moved amendment No. 73. This amendment

would add holding meetings in public to the illustrative list. The list

refers in subsection (2)(c) to the proceedings of an association. Terms

about the proceedings would necessarily include terms about the holding

of meetings in public, so the national authority will already have the

power to make that sort of provision in an establishment order or in

the standard constitution.</div>

<a name="060425126000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">As I said in response to my

hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood, we envisage that commons

association meetings will be held in public. The draft standard

constitution that the Committee will see shortly provides that meetings

of an association and any committee of an association&#151;or

committee of a committee, potentially&#151;will be open to the

public. However, that is subject to the proviso that an

association&#146;s establishment order can prescribe circumstances in

which the public may be excluded.</div> 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column81" />Column number: 81</div><a name="060425126000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 37 and new clause

3 look at the representation of local interests on commons

associations. Amendment No. 37 would amend the illustrative list of

terms that may be contained in the standard constitution or an

establishment order. It would replace the reference to membership with

a more specific reference that seems intended to require that at least

half the members of an association should be elected, that the order

should specify the local community from which members are to be drawn,

and the role of representatives of town and parish councils. Similarly,

new clause 3 would require membership of a commons association to

reflect local interest.</div>

<a name="060425126000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment and the new

clause would require at least half the members of an association to be

elected. Clause 30(3)(a) provides that the standard constitution or an

establishment order for an association may include terms relating to

the appointment of members, and it clarifies that

&#147;appointment&#148; includes appointment by election. That is

because if the number of individuals with a particular interest were

small&#151;for example, if only one or two landowners were appointing

a representative&#151;or if there were no competition for a post, an

election could not take place.</div>

<a name="060425126000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill contemplates that

members might be appointed through an agreed procedure that does not

necessarily involve a vote. I stress that elections will be used when

there are sufficient numbers of persons to warrant such a process.

Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 37 would prevent the use of the most

appropriate method of appointing members to the association, and I hope

that it will therefore not be

pressed.</div><a name="060425126000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3

would require at least half the membership to be drawn from the local

area and would also broaden the representation on commons associations

to include parish and town councils. Our objective for commons

associations has always been to allow landowners and those with common

rights to develop more effective management practices on commons, and

associations will therefore be set up to manage rights of common,

vegetation and agricultural activities. They are not being established

to manage the land for the wider public benefit, or to deal with all

the activities that occur on commons, nor will they be given such

powers.</div><a name="060425126000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Membership of

commons associations will therefore normally be limited to those who

have a legal interest in the common: namely, commoners, landowners and

those holding other rights including sporting rights&#151;we

certainly regard sporting rights as being a type of legal interest over

commons, and it is right that associations are representative of those

who are directly affected by their

decisions.</div><a name="060425126000128"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000209"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> What about householders? A number of them are

entirely dependent on a common, largely because of the need for access,

which is the easement issue on which the Minister became expert through

the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill. How do they get

representation, and when there is a management arrangement, usually

through an organisation such as the National Trust, how is that

reflected in the way that commons operate? I accept that we are largely

talking about agriculture and in my question I am not, but not all

commons are principally 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column82" />Column number: 82</div>about agriculture; they have much more importance in providing access to

the general public and use for the other things that the Minister has

mentioned.</div><a name="060425126000129"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000210"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> The short answer is that if householders, or the

National Trust, or Natural England or the Countryside Council for Wales

have a legal interest, they would have representation. Obviously,

associations can co-opt members, and there can be flexibility of set-up

so that, if there were a reason to vary membership slightly for reasons

on the ground, we might do that. The core thing that the Committee must

understand, however, is that those who have a legal interest must have

proper representation. There is nothing in the Bill that authorises

interference with any easement unless the beneficiary of the easement

consents.</div><a name="060425126000130"></a><div class="hs_Para">Broadening

the range of interests represented on an association would also make

commoners far less likely to form associations, thus making it more

difficult to achieve our objective of effective common land

agricultural management. Although we do not wish to impose a

requirement for local involvement, the Bill provides sufficient

flexibility for other interested persons or bodies, such as parish or

town councils, to be involved in the association if there is

substantial support for that approach. That may be relevant on a

non-agricultural common, where membership may be made up of commoners,

the landowner and other interested parties such as the local authority,

the wildlife trust and local

inhabitants.</div><a name="060425126000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

wider public interest, such as public access and nature conservation,

will be represented by Natural England&#146;s oversight of common

land, and in Wales by the Countryside Council for Wales. As was

discussed on Second Reading, Natural England would not necessarily be a

member of the association unless it had a legal interest in the land or

was co-opted by the

members.</div><a name="060425126000132"></a><div class="hs_Para">We shall

establish a national stakeholder group to advise on implementation of

the Bill, which will provide an opportunity for involvement of wider

interests.</div><a name="060425126000133"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425126000211"></a>Mr.

Drew:</b> What happens if there is a dispute about the way in

which the association is set up or runs? Is that where Natural England

could be lobbied or could arbitrate? A dispute between agricultural and

public use is quite possible; that is why some of us were keen to have

some local representation, in terms of ensuring legitimacy, for those

people who clearly have a vested interest in making sure that those

commons exist in

future.</div><a name="060425129000052"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">6.45

pm</div><a name="060425129000003"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000054"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> Obviously, we hope that, in establishing the

association, we will manage to get the balance right, in terms of

representation and accountability through election and so on. However,

if that fails and there is a dispute, the national authority has the

power to arbitrate. Under a later clause, associations can be wound up

by the national authority following consultation. That ultimately is

the sanction. Certainly, we would hope that Natural England would

report to the national authority if it thought that there was a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column83" />Column number: 83</div>problem with the association not fulfilling its functions properly. I

hope that that satisfies my hon.

Friend.</div><a name="060425129000004"></a><div class="hs_Para">On amendment

No. 65, we certainly expect that the majority of associations will be

made up of common rights holders, landowners, tenants and those with

sporting rights. Those people are likely to be the majority of members

on an agriculturally active common and, in making the establishment

order, the national authority will have particular regard to their

views, but we do not want to limit an association to that because of

the situation on non-agricultural commons. As my hon. Friend the

Minister for Climate Change and the Environment said on Second Reading,

the Dartmoor commoners council has a veterinary officer, for example,

who advises on animal welfare.</div>

<a name="060425129000005"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, turning to amendment

No. 51, which would enable the standard constitution or an

establishment order to specify the proportion of members of an

association who must own rights over that common, we have avoided

specific requirements about membership in the primary legislation in

order to allow local interests to have a larger say at the

establishment order stage about how different interests in a common

should be represented. It is such flexibility that we are concerned

with. I hope that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire accepts

that and will withdraw his

amendment.</div><a name="060425129000006"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000055"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> On a point of order, Miss Begg. I wonder whether

you could say whether there will be a stand part debate on this

clause.</div><a name="060425129000007"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000056"></a>The

Chairman:</b> It is very much up to the Committee to decide

whether to continue debate. There has been a long debate on these

amendments.</div><a name="060425129000008"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000057"></a>Mr.

Williams:</b> Thank you, Miss Begg. I am sure that a number of

us will take great comfort from the fact that the Minister put on

record that, in setting up the statutory bodies to represent commons,

the people with a legal right in respect of the commons should have

their rightful place on those bodies. We can take some comfort from

that. He suggested the people whom he had in mind&#151;those who

exercise rights, the landowner, and sporting tenants. That is of great

comfort to us and to people who use

commons.</div><a name="060425129000009"></a><div class="hs_Para">How the

bodies are to be made up is important, because they will have

considerable powers; they will be entirely different from the voluntary

associations that will need the agreement of all commoners before they

can enter into agreements on environmental schemes. Clause 33, which we

will debate shortly,

says:</div><a name="060425129000050"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

commons association does not need the consent of a person who has a

right of common over the land for which it is established in order to

do anything on the

land&#148;.</div><a name="060425129000010"></a><div class="hs_Para">It

adds:</div><a name="060425129000051"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;A

commons association does not need the consent of any other person with

an interest in the land for which it is established in order to do

anything on the land where what is proposed to be done could be done

without that person&#146;s consent by any person who has a right of

common over the

land.&#148;</div><a name="060425129000011"></a><div class="hs_Para">So those bodies

really will have a new power that has not been exercised by voluntary

associations in any way. That is why we are concerned that people who

manage and use commons should have confidence in 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column84" />Column number: 84</div>the associations that are to be set up, and why we have taken some time

to debate the amendments. Certainly, the Minister&#146;s statement on

the matter is important, and we shall reflect on it, although we might

return to the issue on Report. In light of his comments, I beg to ask

leave to withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425129000012"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Amendment,

important. The hon. Member for Stroud has suggested that there should

be a democratic process, but other hon. Members have indicated that

that might not always be the best way forward. I should have thought

that commoners would want some democratic process for electing the

people who would represent them on the statutory bodies, given that

they will commit them to schemes and practices over which they will not

dominant tenements around a common and whether he or she should have

greater rights than a person owning one dominant tenement. Should there

be some reflection of the fact that one person may have rights to graze

100 sheep and another has the right to graze 1,000? Should the many

significant landowners that will, in effect, be guaranteed places in

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000061"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> Perhaps I could return briefly to an area of

confusion, and I am obliged to the National Farmers Union for drawing

attention to it. The NFU refers to the clause, in respect of which we

are talking about board, council, or executive members. Surely,

everybody who exercises rights of common on the common will be members,

as such, of the association. [<i class="I">Interruption.</i>] Is that not

right?</div><a name="060425129000021"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000062"></a>The

Chairman:</b> Order. That was not an intervention; I was

taking it as a

speech.</div><a name="060425129000022"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000063"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I was developing the theme. Surely, if the Minister

wishes to intervene, it would be fair for

everyone.</div><a name="060425129000023"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000064"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I was trying to intervene to be helpful, but I

have forgotten what I was going to

say.</div><a name="060425129000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">The members of

the association would be the representatives and members of the

committee. They would be there by virtue of their representation of the

various legal interests. In some cases, there might not be enough

people for an election; when there are, there will be an

election.</div><a name="060425129000025"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000065"></a>Mr.

Llwyd:</b> I am grateful for

that.</div><a name="060425129000026"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000066"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I may have answered most of the questions in my

intervention. The establishment order will determine voting mechanisms

for electing members of the association. In some cases, weighted voting

might be appropriate. We cannot give one method that would work for all

commons&#151;as we have discussed, they are so varied and there are

very different balances between landowners, commoners and so

on.</div> <a name="060425129000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to

retain flexibility and to ensure that how the associations are formed

and properly consulted on is appropriate to each case. It may well be

that in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop

Auckland (Helen Goodman) one or two landowners would be representative

because of their legal interests in a number of associations, if one

big one had not been formed. However, unlike at present, such

landowners would no longer have the veto over what went on, because the

associations would make the

decisions.</div><a name="060425129000028"></a><div class="hs_Para"><i class="I">Question

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000067"></a>David

Maclean:</b> I beg to move amendment No. 93, in clause 31,

page 17, line 43, at end

insert&#151;</div><div class="hs_AmendmentLevel1">&#145;(5A) Where a

commons association is established for an area of land that consists of

more than one common, it may exercise the functions conferred on it

under subsection (1) separately for each common or group of

commons.'.</div><a name="060425129000031"></a><div class="hs_Para">Part

2 of the Bill deals with statutory commons committees and the functions

related to the management of agricultural activities, vegetation and

the exercise of rights of common. Currently, to a 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column86" />Column number: 86</div>greater or lesser extent, those functions are carried out by the

voluntary commoners associations. The Federation of Cumbria Commoners

is excited about part 2. It tells me that if its potential is to be

properly realised, the voluntary associations will have to be convinced

that it is worth the candle to change to statutory committee

status.</div> <a name="060425129000032"></a><div class="hs_Para">At the

moment, the additional cost and responsibilities and increased burdens

may outweigh the advantages of going down the statutory route, unless

there is some Government pump-priming. If there had been a stand part

debate on part 2, I would have made a speech on the missing funding

elements. However, there is no legitimate scope for me to do so and be

in order.</div> <a name="060425129000033"></a><div class="hs_Para">The most

appropriate size for a typical upland statutory commons committee is

uncertain, although the larger the grouping of commons covered, the

greater the potential for cost-efficient administrative structures. At

the same time, the very individual and peculiar nature of some of the

commons, both in respect of their historical development and their

modern-day management needs, demands very localised and sometimes

individual decision making at individual commons level.</div>

<a name="060425129000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The amendment seeks to ensure

that when a statutory commons committee is in the form of an umbrella

organisation that looks after two, three or half a dozen commons,

because that is seen as the most appropriate and cost-efficient way

forward, rules that relate to specific individual commons within that

umbrella may be created, and there may be different rules for different

commons.</div> <a name="060425129000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">To give a

simple example, Caldbeck and Allendale commons in my constituency and

that of the hon. Member for Workington might decide to set up a

statutory umbrella organisation to share the costs of administrating

the statutory functions. However, they might wish for there to be

totally different management rules for Caldbeck common on the one hand,

and Allendale common on the other. The amendment seeks to make it clear

that a statutory commons committee could exercise different functions

for all the individual commons within its

umbrella.</div><a name="060425129000053"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">7

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000068"></a>Mr.

Rogerson:</b> Our sitting has been long and I shall attempt to

be brief.</div><a name="060425129000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rise to

support the thinking behind the amendment. The example of Bodmin moor

has been raised before and I raise it again. It covers a large area of

my constituency and of the neighbouring constituency of South-East

Cornwall. It is not a common, but a patchwork of many rural

communities. Around 17 parishes would be affected so a large number of

people would want to be involved. The more flexibility there is for

voluntary associations to act within a statutory association or in

concert with a statutory association, the more effectively the Bill

will function.</div><a name="060425129000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">I

shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about

provision for small areas of common land that may be near a major area

of common landwhere commoners and landowners want to form an 

<div class="Column"><a name="Column87" />Column number: 87</div>association and whether a nearby area might be able to have some form of

relationship with the larger statutory association to gain access to

some of the provisions in the

Bill.</div><a name="060425129000039"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000069"></a>Jim

Knight:</b> I am grateful for the amendment and to be able to

respond to the concerns of the Cumbria commoners and perhaps some of

the Cornish

commoners.</div><a name="060425129000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">The

amendment is unnecessary, but that is good news because part 2 is

already sufficiently flexible to enable a commons association to do

what hon. Members are asking for. It can respond to the different

conditions found on each common that it manages. For example, its

functions relating to the management of agricultural activities do not

have to be exercised in exactly the same way in relation to each

common. That will depend on the needs of each individual common. The

national authority could, in the establishment order, confer different

functions in respect of different commons within the same association,

but we would probably prefer to give commons associations wider

functions and allow the association itself to pick and choose those

most suited to it at any one

time.</div><a name="060425129000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">As commons

associations are empowered to do anything that will assist them in

carrying out their functions, they could, for example, vary the

livestock management regimes for each common or make different rules

for different commons to respond to local conditions. They could also

set up different voting regimes for different commons within the

association to avoid the need for everyone having to vote on issues

unrelated to their specific common.</div>

<a name="060425129000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">In response to the last

question asked by the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson), I

suspect that if there was worry about a small common being subsumed by

a larger one in an association, different rules would be set up for

their

management.</div><a name="060425129000043"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="060425129000070"></a><b class="B">Mr.

Rogerson:</b> The question also related to areas such as Bodmin moor,

which has clearly defined boundaries with areas of common land nearby

but not actually in the area. Would they be able to have some form of

relationship?</div><a name="060425129000044"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000071"></a>Mr.

Knight:</b> I am sure that they could have a relationship

because the associations will have wide and flexible powers to do

anything that will assist them in carrying out their functions. I hope

that that will be sufficient for the hon. Gentleman, and that the right

hon. Member for Penrith and The Border will withdraw the

amendment.</div><a name="060425129000045"></a>









<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="060425129000072"></a>David

Maclean:</b> In view of the Minister&#146;s assurances that

the various sections of part 2 of the Bill will allow to happen what I

want to happen, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the
