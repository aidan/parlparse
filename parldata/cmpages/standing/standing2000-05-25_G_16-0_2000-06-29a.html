<H4><center>Amendment of Children Act 1989</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>9 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 326 to 337.

<P>
I must inform hon. Members that had it not been for the fact that the amendments were selected with the stand part debate, we would probably not have had a stand part debate because of the amount of time that we have already spent debating amendments to the clause.

<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Hammond </B>(Runnymede and Weybridge): I understand your comment, Mr. Illsley, that we have spent a long time on clause 68, but it is an unprecedentedly long and complex clause. We have considered a large number of amendments to it, including Government amendments. When the Government find it necessary to table 50 amendments to one clause, it suggests that the Bill has not been as well thought out and honed as it might have been. Despite the fact that we have debated the specific points raised by those amendments, a case can be made for going back to consider the overall effect of the clause and questioning the Minister about it.

<P>
I find that approach to legislation somewhat baffling. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After Part X of the 1989  there shall be inserted.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is followed by 14 pages of insertion; the last provision, subsection (5), states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Part X of  the 1989 Act shall cease to extend to England and Wales.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Although that technically achieves the objective, it seems an extraordinarily cumbersome and tortuous way of legislating. However, we must consider the substance of new part XA of the 1989 Act.

<P>
The essence of our concerns revolves around the question of proportionality. Everyone is aware of the terrible cases of child abuse uncovered and described in graphic detail in the Utting and Waterhouse reports-inquiries that were set up by the previous Administration and reported to the present Government. I asked the Minister several times what evidence supports the child minding and day care regimes that the Government propose in clause 68.

<P>
It is clear from previous debates that the Government have had to wrestle with some difficult questions in deciding how far to carry the logic of their approach to the regulation of child care. I would like to be persuaded that the Government have acted rationally, on the basis of evidence that there is a serious risk, and that their proposals are proportionate to the danger that they have identified. Further, I would like to be persuaded that when the Government's approach is limited or has created a watershed-whether by age, by category of child or by category of minder-it should be logical and not based on expediency and convenience.

<P>
I have asked the Minister several times for such reassurance. She has said that she would write to me. Our previous sitting was before the weekend-[
Interruption.]-sorry, it was on Tuesday; time flies when we enjoy ourselves. I would be grateful if the Minister wrote not only to me but to all members of the Committee, so that the information could be shared. I am likely to receive the letter after the Committee has finished deliberating the Bill, and certainly after it has considered whether clause 68 should stand part. Members of all parties have expressed concerns and interest and have queried aspects of the way in which the clause has been put together. Many of those concerns have related to where the lines have been drawn and to where the watersheds have been created. If the Minister could adduce concrete evidence, many hon. Members might find their concerns allayed.

<P>
One area debated at length concerned the Government's intention to exclude baby sitters from the legislation. We understand the logic behind that position. In seeking to regulate child care, the Government do not want to go too far, finding themselves intervening in arrangements that are impossible to police effectively and looking unacceptably intrusive. The Minister, on reflection and having listened to the points made during debate, including those made by Government Members, might conclude that the proposed new section 79A(8) of the Children Act 1989 is inadequate. Although it excludes early-evening baby sitters, it will also exclude a category of people who, on any logic, could not be deemed appropriate for exclusion: those conducting normal child-minding activities, perhaps for people working shifts, between 
<P>
<H5>6 pm and 2 am.</H5>
</P>

<P>
I understand that there is a technical difficulty and do not claim to have an answer for the Minister, but she has greater resources at her disposal than me. I hope that, in responding to the short debate, she will be able to tell the Committee that she recognises the difficulty identified regarding proposed new section 79A(8) and that she will consider further the way in which the Government can create a meaningful distinction between the informal baby sitter in the parental home in the early evening and the child minder who looks after children during the evening-perhaps for shift workers-and who is qualitatively no different from the child minder who looks after children during the day for someone who works from 
<P>
<H5>9 am to 5 pm.</H5>
</P>

<P>
I turn to one or two general points that have already been touched on and which, having failed to amend to Bill, we must accept will continue as the Government have intended. I raised several concerns about the distinction between child minders who control the premises-those who look after children on their own domestic premises-and those who are merely employees. I am not convinced that the legislation makes that distinction effectively and thus does not risk injustice to those who are perfectly good, appropriate people to look after children. Because they do so not on their own but another's domestic premises they could lose their qualification to be registered-as a result of something outside their control. I hope that the Minister will consider that issue again. No issue of principle is at stake. The Minister clearly acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for individuals to be put at risk in the way that I have mentioned. Assurance is simply needed as to how the Bill would operate.

<P>
To digress a little, I asked on Tuesday about the tribunal that is mentioned in the proposed new section 79M of the Children Act. The Minister confirmed that it is the tribunal provided for in the Protection of Children Act 1999. I take it as read, therefore, that the Government will not bring the proposed new section into effect until the Protection of Children Act is fully operational and the tribunal is up and running.

<P>
I freely confess that I was confused about which tribunal the proposed new part referred, and, having had my attention drawn by the Minister to the relevant passages, I now understand that the tribunal created by the Protection of Children Act will be responsible for appeals provided for throughout the Bill. It seems odd, on the face of it, that an appeal against deregistration of a residential care home will be heard by such a tribunal. Do the Government intend it to become an all-purpose tribunal for social care issues? If so, where will the line be drawn between that and the tribunal that is created under health service legislation-if my memory is correct, under the Health Act 1999?

<P>
We have concerns, which have not been dealt with, about the role of the chief inspector in relation to training. I should like to think that the Government are creating an arm's-length inspectorate-a watchdog for standards. However, I believe that its role will be compromised, so as to undermine the inspectorate and parents' respect for it, by involvement in training provision. I hope that the Minister will think about whether she is comfortable with those proposals.

<P>
If the initial principle of the clause is accepted and the threatened mischief thought sufficient to justify the approach taken, we can concur with the Government on much of the detail. I have identified one or two aspects that still cause us serious concern, particularly with respect to fairness or equitableness of application. An important step is being taken in how we regulate and inspect establishments. For the first time, we are creating powers to enter not commercial or dedicated business premises, but people's dwelling houses. I am sure that the Minister will agree that we need to be absolutely certain that the powers are appropriate.
 
<P>
I make a plea for some evidence of work done by the Minister's Department that provides a basis for introducing such legislation; for some evidence of a risk of apparent mischief that justifies the creation of an enormous bureaucracy in response to it. As long as the Minister can show that the mischief has been properly evaluated and that the response to it is measured and appropriate, I am sure that the Committee will be reassured.

<P>
<H5>9.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Dr. Peter Brand </B>(Isle of Wight): We have had an interesting debate, in which valuable contributions have been made and searching questions asked by my hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I am confident that the ministerial team will have taken note of those questions, and I hope that we shall receive a response to some of our more detailed questions to which ministerial replies have so far not been forthcoming.

<P>
I have several concerns about the clause. I am uneasy about the ill defined powers of inspectors. I congratulate the Minister on sending us a note about the 14 criteria that will apply. Those criteria are comprehensive, and if the regulations are to be based on them, I cannot understand why the Government have tabled amendments to widen the inspectors' powers. The clause will set the tone for the way in which the inspectorate will function. I disagree significantly with the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) in that I believe that a good inspectorate or regulatory system should not act only as an investigatory power and policeman; it should also support and encourage, and work with the people whom it is supposed to control, to ensure that standards rise, irrespective of the minimal standards set down in regulations. Those points have already been made powerfully by Government Members.

<P>
I am really concerned that the Bill makes no mention of the exact scope of the inspectorate. I was alarmed to hear that there is no specific plan to co-ordinate the activities of the Office for Standards in Education with those of the National Care Standards Commission, and that their arrangements and local presence might not even be coterminous. I certainly support the idea of people working from home where that is appropriate, but it would be disastrous if inspectors sat at home plugged into a computer and did not relate to the people who deliver a service to children.

<P>

<B>Mr. Jonathan Shaw </B>(Chatham and Aylesford): My hon. Friend the Minister said that people would be allowed to work at home and I asked whether they would be forced to do so. Although some people will have transferred under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, does the hon. Gentleman share my curiosity about whether, when more staff are taken on, they will be permanent employees or contractual staff?

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> It is of course very important that the rights of people who are currently employed in the field are protected, but I am more concerned about the model that we are building in this legislation. I am not convinced that the right service will be delivered if people work in isolation.

<P>
I was interested in the Minister's response to our debate on the registration of nannies and au pairs. It was suggested that placement agencies for them should be regulated. We strongly support that. Earlier parts of the Bill specifically provide that several agencies will be regulated by the National Care Standards Commission. I encourage the Government to make the commitment on registration. We do not necessarily need to be told the time scale, but we want a commitment that nanny and au pair agencies, as well as-my special concern-agencies for foreign language students and foreign language schools that make domiciliary placements, will be registered. There is a great gap in the Children Act that has still not been addressed. The Government could include such a provision, which such agencies could use if and when appropriate.

<P>
My major concern about the clause has not arisen so far in debate. I am concerned that we are not creating a seamless service for children through regulation and inspection. There has been much talk about abolishing Berlin walls between health and social services departments, and I fully support that campaign. We have not achieved that yet, but at least there is a willingness to address the issue. I am concerned that, by having two separate agencies answerable to two different Secretaries of State, we will create an artificial barrier for looked after children, especially those with disabilities. Many children with disabilities will be presented with a range of services-a care package that will involve child minding, personal care, attendance at day centres, and perhaps occasional respite care-but I am uneasy that two distinct regulatory authorities will be able to carry out that work.

<P>
There has obviously been some turf war between the Department of Health and the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, and I recognise that we on the Opposition Benches are unlikely to change the outcome of the clause. However, I find it sad that the result of a power struggle will be evident in the Bill. I understand why the Government want to adopt a certain approach, and they should be allowed to try it out to see whether it works, but the clause seems to have more to do with the interests of Departments than the interests of children.

<P>
As the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) said during our sitting on Tuesday, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and I shall be happy to be proved wrong if everything works wonderfully. However, it would be sensible if the phrasing of this part of the Bill were similar to the amendment tabled by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, which refers to a registration authority. Through regulation, the Government may decide that the regulatory authority for provision under the clause should be the chief inspector and Ofsted. They have every right to do that, but should that not work out or should it not be in the interests of the children concerned, primary legislation would be needed to integrate the activities of Ofsted with those of the National Care Standards Commission. The Government have tied their hands unnecessarily. I should be grateful for a ministerial response, because we shall want to return to the matter on Report.

<P>
<B>Caroline Flint </B>(Don Valley): I have studied the report of Tuesday's debate, in which my hon. Friend the Minister seemed to be making three arguments against the registration of child care provided in the parental home.

<P>
The first argument was that domiciliary care provided in the home by a care worker for disabled sick people was different from the care provided by nannies, au pairs, grandparents, friends or neighbours. Grouping those people together undermines those qualified child workers in the parental home who share the work, who live in or who have daily entry into the home. I sought not to extend registration of au pairs, family members or neighbours, but to recognise that child minders, like many self-employed people, work in domestic settings that may vary from their own. The key issue is whether they are qualified to do the job. Many who provide child care in the parental home are qualified. The example that I gave on Tuesday of a nurse using such child care involved the employment of someone with a Nursery Nurses Education Board qualification.

<P>
My hon. Friend's second argument was that child minders care for an average of three or four children, perhaps from different families. That is a weak argument; I am sure that nannies do exactly that.

<P>
The third argument was that there could be a personality clash between the nanny and the parent, but that occurs with child minders and the staff of day nurseries. I understand that the present and previous Governments and the civil servants who advised them may be concerned about this aspect of registration. However, the examples given by my hon. Friend the Minister are not sufficient to sustain the argument against registering workers who are qualified to provide such child care.

<P>
<B>Mr. Paul Burstow </B>(Sutton and Cheam): My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) and the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) have raised important issues, which I hope will be answered. I want to deal with the role of the children's commissioner in Wales and the children's rights director in England.

<P>
We have had the benefit of being able to study the amendments tabled on Tuesday, so we now know that the children's commissioner will have responsibility under this part of the Bill and that he will have the power to take decisions and be involved in matters that affect the rights of children in connection with Ofsted's discharge of its responsibilities. That is in stark contrast to what we were told on Tuesday. I welcome the fact that such duties will be part of the children's commissioner job, but it seems that the same rights will not be extended to the children's rights director in England. Will the Minister address that point?

<P>
We in England should be learning from Wales in order to ensure a consistent approach that does as much as possible to give rights to children. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide assurances, and that it will be possible to appoint a children's rights director who is capable of dealing with those services.

<P>
<B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Margaret Hodge)</b> The clause is long and will have a significant effect on the regulation of child minding and day care services. I should point out to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the provision is not new. The regulation currently takes place under the Children Act 1989. It is not the case that the practice of entering individuals' homes is being suddenly introduced, whereas previously it did not happen. By bringing together Education Act regulation and regulation under the Children Act 1989, we shall prevent duplication of inspection entry into people's homes. With respect to proportionality, that will be a more efficient and less cumbersome regulatory regime for those who are registered and inspected.</B><P>

<P>
<H5>9.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
We are undertaking a substantial expansion of our child care and early years education services, to give children the best start in life and to ensure that the service is appropriate to the changing nature of the family, given that eight out of 10 mothers now choose or need to work. The distinction, as we expand the services, between care and education, is increasingly blurred. As I have said, we want to provide for a seamless offer to children and families. The evidence from the early excellence centres that have been running for two or three years, in which we bring together care, health and education focused around children's needs, is that the seamless, integrated, multi-agency approach is both cost-efficient and effective in responding to the needs of children and families. We also want, and have embarked on, a massive expansion of free nursery places for three-year-olds. We want to maintain the diversity that is part of the strength of the British system of early years education and child care. That means that we want the three-year-olds' places to be in the private and voluntary as well as statutory sectors. It makes sense for those who provide those places to come under one regime of inspection and regulation rather than two.

<P>
We also want traditional schools, nursery schools and other statutory institutions to start providing wrap-around care, to meet the needs of children and families. In that case too, it makes sense to bring the regulation and registration of those services under one umbrella. That is why we are establishing a distinct new arm of Ofsted with an early years director. We will achieve our aims by inserting a new part XA in the Children Act 1989. We shall thus enjoy the best of the current care and education regulatory regimes, and ensure that the skills and experience of those who have been working on those matters in local authorities will be maintained and transferred to the new arm of Ofsted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> Will my hon. Friend settle my concern? During debate, she told me that people would be transferred under TUPE and would have permanent contracts. When they leave their jobs, will they be replaced by people on temporary contracts?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Given that what is proposed will be a permanent function of the new and distinct arm of Ofsted, I assume that permanent staff will be wanted. I see no reason why that would not be the case.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I leap to my feet because I specifically asked the Minister on Tuesday whether she would rule out the possibility of Ofsted using the same methods of short-term contracting of independent self-employed persons that it uses for school inspections. She declined to do so. That seems a little at odds with what she has just said.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Not at all; the two sit comfortably together. On the whole, most of the people engaged in inspections will be staff employed by the new regulatory arm of Ofsted. For some reason or other, Ofsted might occasionally want to employ the services of consultants or short-term contractors to carry out work. There might be a shortage in a particular area or a host of other reasons to justify such action. We do not wish to rule that out. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge thinks that there must be total consistency. These are issues of judgment. The skill is in exercising judgment in the best interest of children and their families.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I have listened to the exchanges. Will the Minister go one step further and confirm whether she intends it to be normal practice for new employees of the new arm of Ofsted to be on permanent contracts and not on short-term contracts?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I honestly think that it is not for members of the Committee to determine the way in which Ofsted executively carries out the regulatory functions that we give it.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> No I will not, because the issue is sending us down a blind road. I will not give any commitment in Committee on the actual terms and conditions under which Ofsted will employ individuals.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. Will you confirm that it is in order for members of the Committee, before agreeing to the inclusion of the clause, to explore fully the way in which the Government intend to use the powers granted?

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Nothing said so far has been out of order.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Perhaps I can assist the Committee by referring to a helpful note that has been passed to me by my advisers, which says that, regardless of whether staff are permanently contracted, they will have to be registered. That is the key issue for us. Registration under proposed new section 79P will mean that they have the appropriate competencies and qualifications to do the job that Parliament wishes them to do in protecting children on our behalf. Such people will need to be of a good standard.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I of course would not want the Minister to be prescriptive about an agency that has not yet sorted itself out. However, she made great play of the stability that will be created by an agency that integrates school inspections with inspections of child minding and care of the younger age groups. That can surely be achieved only if there is stability on both sides of the work force. We have not seen that demonstrated in the school inspection service. It is legitimate for us to explore the Minister's attitude on the way in which she will achieve her stated objective of integration between a permanent service and local authorities, the voluntary sector and other bodies, so that those concerned with the welfare of children know to whom they are relating and so that individuals are not drafted in only to disappear after an inspection.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Clearly, the service will be much improved and of a higher standard if there is stability and appropriate expertise among those carrying it out. However, I am not prepared to commit the chief inspector before the organisation is even established to employing his staff in a particular way. The chief inspector has said, and we have agreed, that the staff will be permanent, qualified and recognised inspectors and that they will be registered so that we can all look at a register to assure ourselves that the job is being carried out by appropriate people. The goal that we are trying to achieve in terms of the proportionality argument is to cut out the duplication that has been described as unfair and unjust by many private and voluntary providers who seek a level playing field.

<P>
The other Government amendments are consequential to other legislation arising from the insertion of part XA.

<P>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked me for evidence of the need for a regulatory regime. We have had a long discussion about proportionality to determine how we should proceed. It is difficult to say that one or more cases of child abuse are needed before we can determine whether we need a particular regulatory regime. One case is one too many. We have attempted to put in place a regime that is not too cumbersome or burdensome, but which nevertheless has the protection of children at its heart.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley mentioned cases involving nannies, and there have been cases involving au pairs, particularly in the USA. The Government have had to judge the appropriate proportionality, and I think that we have made the correct judgment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> That seems woolly. Let me draw the Minister's attention to an area where the Government have tried to be more scientific in their approach-the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. After undertaking an appraisal, the institute published a report on beta interferon saying that the benefits for patients were modest compared to the cost. On that basis, it recommends that the drug should not be available. What evaluation of benefits and costs did the Minister's Department carry out before introducing the Bill?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I will certainly send to the hon. Gentleman the regulatory impact assessment, which attempts such an evaluation. However, the issue is not as measurable as the benefits of a particular drug. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, as an Opposition Member, would be the first to jump up and down if it were shown that a form of regulation rejected by the Committee could have prevented a particular instance of abuse. One case of abuse is a case too many. We must implement a framework that we think best protects the children involved. That is a difficult judgment to make, but I think that we have got the balance right. In terms of proportionality, the new system is less cumbersome.

<P>
On the issue of baby sitters, I find it difficult to see how the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge can distinguish between formal care in the evening and informal arrangements. Is he suggesting, for example that Ofsted should inspect neighbours who have reciprocal care arrangements? That is the sort of difficulty that we would be forced into were we to define matters as he suggested.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I acknowledged that the problem was difficult, and when I have the benefit of the Minister's office, and the support and back-up that she has, I might be in a better position to advise how to tackle it. I would like her at least to acknowledge that Opposition and Labour Members have raised real issues on the amendment. The problem might be difficult, but that cannot be a reason for leaving a glaring inconsistency in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> Again, I must tell the hon. Gentleman that I do not believe that there is a glaring inconsistency. We have made a balanced judgment as to when it is and is not appropriate to have regulations. He may disagree with that judgment, but we have made it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): Does my hon. Friend agree that the vast majority of people would accept the balance of her judgment rather than the tenor of the remarks by the hon. Member for Weybridge and Runnymede? He seems to suggest that we need no regulation at all in this sector. His view flies in the face of considerable evidence that children have been abused, permanently damaged or killed while in the care of others.

<P>
<H5>9.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I completely concur with my hon. Friend. The overwhelming majority of the representations that we have received from those interested in this field have supported the steps and measures that we are putting in place today. That probably means that the Opposition have not had a very good briefing, which is why they are attempting to raise inappropriate points.

<P>
If a registered child minder has an assistant, that assistant will have had a suitability check. If the child minder is then deregistered for some reason, there is nothing to prevent the assistant from moving to other employment. No connection is made to the deregistration of her employer, unless it was for a reason linked to that assistant's behaviour. There is no difficulty there.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight expressed concern that we had widened the scope of inspectors' powers too greatly. We face a difficulty in that Ofsted is a creature of statute. Therefore, the regulatory authority can act only on powers given to it in statute; it has no leeway to act beyond that. If we wish to ensure that the interests of children are properly protected, we need to introduce flexibility into the Bill so that in individual circumstances where the authority thinks it appropriate, it can inspect a little beyond the regulations that I have sent to all members of this Committee. There is no intention that inspectors should use that power for anything other than the regulation of child care providers.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I hear what the Minister says, but her 14 criteria are very specific. The only examples that she presented to the Committee were well covered by them.

<P>
My other concern was the power of the chief inspector to require child minders and agencies to give information, not in relation to his function regarding child protection and the welfare of children, but in his strategic role in planning services. It is unreasonable to make that a statutory requirement; it should be a request. Reasonable agencies would agree to such a request, but I can see that yet more bumf and questions to answer may have a negative effect on the way that some people look after their children. The power could prove to have negative, rather than positive, consequences.

<P>

<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The chief inspector's reports-I term them state-of-the-nation reports-will be culled from the evidence that he receives from the inspections. He will engage in a specific study around a specific issue only if he is asked to do so by the Secretary of State. It is not in the interests of the chief inspector, the child care providers or the Government to have an overload of bureaucracy. As we develop the headline standards that I have circulated to members of the Committee, we are consciously trying to minimise bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory conditions.

<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley and I have engaged in long discussions on the issues that she has raised; I have no doubt that we will go on talking about them. We intend to regulate employment agencies through the Department of Trade and Industry. We shall issue comprehensive guidance on nanny agencies, but it is not appropriate to include au pairs because they are not carers. My hon. Friend and I will continue to engage in such conversations to see whether there is a sensible way through as the national child care strategy develops and evolves.

<P>
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to a power struggle between my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) and I.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Before the Minister expands on that interesting matter, I remind her that I also asked about registration of host families and foreign language students.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As the care of children is not involved, that is not appropriate for regulation.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we are right to integrate the registration and regulation of child care with the regulation and registration of early years educational services, and whether that should be an issue for the National Care Standards Commission. I have discussed the matter with my hon. Friend the Minister of State and others throughout the Government and our joint approach-and the fact that we are sitting together in Committee-reflects joined-up government. The overwhelming response of those in the field supports our proposal for establishing a new and distinct arm of Ofsted.

<P>
The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) referred to the children's rights director, but that is not appropriate because, unlike most of the children covered elsewhere in the Bill, the children covered in this part will be in the care of parents for the majority of the time. If parents or children are dissatisfied with the service that they receive, parents can vote with their feet and not send their children to the service. I am not clear about the way in which the hon. Gentleman envisages the director playing a role in that context.

<P>
I assure the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that the chief inspector has no desire to monopolise the provision of training. Ofsted will work with the early years development and child care partnerships, as well as local authorities and others who have a duty-Ofsted has a power-to secure the provision of training. The information that Ofsted gathers from inspection will be valuable in targeting training appropriately.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> Before the Minister makes her final point, will she respond to the issue that I raised about facilities for disabled children or children with personal care needs? Will there be a lead agency to regulate those services? How does the Minister envisage her Department working with the Department of Health to ensure that the regulation is seen to be seamless by those receiving the service?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We are talking about day care services for children with disabilities. Such children will be covered by the legislation on discrimination against children in educational premises that we propose to lay before Parliament as soon as we can. Their access to education and care will be covered by the special educational needs programme of action. The social care and protection of children with disabilities is covered by other clauses of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> I am not sure whether the Minister is deliberately not responding to my point or whether I am not being clear. Children with special needs will have a package of care that will be regulated by different agencies. I want to know whether there will be a lead agency on the regulatory side, or whether the two agencies will discuss matters between them locally. How will the mechanism work, given that the Minister has not responded to my point about coterminosity of local aspects of the two inspection regimes? I look at the matter from the perspective of a simple person-the family and the child-rather than two Departments homing in on the child. I want to ensure that we do not create an artificial barrier, which would not be in the interests of children.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> All that I can do is to repeat the assurance that I gave to the hon. Gentleman. In relation to particular children, agencies will have to co-operate on the ground, and we have in place a series of mechanisms to ensure such co-operation. Ofsted made it clear in discussions with me that it recognises the need to establish relationships with the early years development and child care partnerships, child protection groups and others in the locality to ensure the proper protection of children. The system will have to work across the agencies, in the way that child protection systems have worked in the past.

<P>
We have already appointed a chairperson, Trevor Aldridge-whom I believe was the former chairperson of the SEN tribunal-to the new protection of children tribunal. We are currently establishing the tribunal's office, which will be up and running by the autumn of this year. If the provisions in the clause find favour with Parliament, we hope to implement them in September 2001.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Will the Minister give way?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> I commend the clause to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond rose-</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Is the Minister giving way?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As we have already had a lengthy debate on the clause, I am commending it to the Committee.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> As the Minister did not give way to my brief question, I rise to ask whether she can answer the second part of my question on the tribunal, which she answered only partially. Although there is no reason why a tribunal should not deal with appeals on registration of care homes, it seems slightly strange that this tribunal will-as I understand it-deal with such matters, given that it is called the protection of children tribunal. Do the Government intend that it will have a broader function as the ultimate tribunal of appeal on social care matters?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As the hon. Gentleman well knows, it would be appropriate to ask that question at a later point in our deliberations. As far as this part of the Bill is concerned, the powers of the tribunal will be broadened. It seemed sensible to have one tribunal system, rather than two, and we proceeded on that basis.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> We have discussed whether it is appropriate to support the clause, and I am happy to allow the Minister and her officials to reflect on the wise words of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge-who is keen to encourage Committee members to think about what has been said-and explore the matter further on Report. I am not convinced by the Minister's answers; nor am I convinced that the clause is a blueprint for the welfare and protection of children, whether able-bodied or disabled, which is my greatest concern.

<P>
The clause is something of a dog's breakfast, and simply replicates current procedures. The Minister says that multi-agency work is brilliant and everything works excellently, but it does not. As one of the few GPs in my constituency who has attended case conferences regularly, I know that multi-agency work is not always the easiest way in which to get things done. I am concerned that we are setting up a mechanism that will prove divisive rather than inclusive.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
The purpose of the amendment is to probe the Government's intentions with regard to volunteers, especially parent assistants working in child day care centres. Do the Government intend the definition of persons employed in sub-paragraph (2) to embrace people working in an establishment on a voluntary basis? If so, why, and if not, why not? Once the Minister has clarified that, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> The answer is yes. It covers only schools.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I think that I am asking a valid question, but perhaps directing it at the wrong part of the Bill. My substantive question is this. Will someone who works as a volunteer in a child care setting, and is not doing it for reward, be regulated or unregulated? For example, parent assistants often voluntarily go to primary schools to help children with reading and so on. Would those people be regulated in any way, or would they be wholly outside the scope of the Bill?

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> We have carried forward exactly the same powers that existed under the Children Act 1989, so my understanding is that they would be regulated. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to proposed new section 79B(4)(a).

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister, and I shall look at that in detail. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<B>Ms Hodge:</B> As the Bill stands, it may be understood that anyone in a hospital is exempt from part XA. However, it is clearly not the intention that, for instance, a creche that is operated in a hospital should be exempt. The amendment ensures that only the patients in a hospital will be so considered. It was also not the intention of the Bill that only health service hospitals should be exempt. To correct that, the amendment changes the reference to a hospital as defined in clause 2.

<P>
The other amendments are consequential, technical amendments to correct the grammar.

<P>
<B>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Hutton)</b> I beg to move amendment No. 427, in page 44, line 16, after ``clinic'' insert ``, an independent medical agency''.</B><P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss Government amendments Nos. 428, 429 and 440.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments are technical amendments that I hope will improve the application of the legislation, and its clarity.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 427 and 429 add independent medical agencies to the list of employers subject to the requirements set out in part VI. They will be covered to the extent that they provide prescribed services, as is the case for other health care services. This is intended to ensure that all providers of services to vulnerable adults are covered by the provisions.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 428 and 440 seek to clarify the way in which the requirements of clauses 71 and 72 apply in respect of domiciliary care agencies and independent medical agencies that might also operate as employment agencies or businesses. Clause 71 will apply in relation to workers who are not supply workers as defined in clause 69(5). In circumstances in which workers are supply workers-that is, when the organisation is operating as an employment agency or business-clause 72 will apply. That was always our original intention. This clarification should ensure that all such agencies that provide care staff, and all their workers, are covered by the appropriate provisions in the Bill.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 367, in page 44, line 38, leave out ``prescribed''.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 368, in page 45, line 2, leave out ``prescribed''.

<P>
No. 369, in page 45, line 3, leave out ``prescribed''.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> Amendment No. 367 is a probing amendment. I do not intend that the word ``prescribed'' should actually be removed. That would have bizarre consequences. However, I am anxious to hear from the Minister which type of patients in NHS hospitals and institutions are to be regarded as vulnerable. A case could be made that anyone in a hospital is vulnerable.

<P>
The Minister and his colleague, the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham), will be aware, because we have had such discussions before, that I am especially interested in the case of anaesthetised patients in relation to unregulated operating department practitioners. All patients in hospitals, by definition-by virtue of their being there-could be said to be vulnerable. Will the Minister clarify who is to be included in the definition of vulnerable adults in the context of the regulation-making power to prescribe classes of services?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for prefacing his remarks by saying that this is a probing amendment. That will dramatically cut short the points that I was going to make in response.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman has extended a beguiling invitation to me to spell out who is to be covered by the provisions. He will be aware that we are introducing a completely new list and we must, therefore, be absolutely clear from the beginning-as I am sure he would wish-where we should start in preparing it and which services should be covered by it. There is no definition of vulnerable adults in the Bill. We are approaching the issue from a slightly different angle by specifying the types of services in which a reference to the list-and the other consequential changes that we are introducing-will kick in.

<P>
Initially, our intention is to include acute and community settings for three principal groups of patients using health care services: learning disability services; psychiatric services, including psychotherapy services; and dedicated elderly care services. That will include residential and non-residential care. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Gentleman. He will be aware that, because of the way in which the Bill has been put together, it would be possible for other health care services to be included at any stage in the future by using the appropriate regulatory powers. Those are the three principal health care settings in which we currently envisage that the requirements to register and to refer people to the vulnerable adults list, and the other changes that we are proposing, will be implemented when the provisions are brought into effect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. I understand the logic of starting with a manageable group and extending it. Will he consider, and perhaps discuss with the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen, the case of anaesthetised patients, who are extremely vulnerable to the attentions-which are sometimes not well intentioned- of unregistered operating department practitioners? Surely a person who is anaesthetised should be ranked with the categories of vulnerable people to which the Minister referred. I hope that he will bear in mind the claims of other groups to be included in the definition, although I accept that it cannot be done immediately.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall do that.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following:

<P>
Government amendment No. 432.

<P>
Government new clause 30-Temporary provision for access to lists.

<P>
Government amendments Nos. 460 and 461.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendments Nos. 430, 432, 460 and 461, are minor and consequential amendments to part VI of the Bill and the Protection of Children Act 1999 resulting from the introduction of new clause 30.

<P>
New clause 30 replaces the temporary access arrangements set out in the 1999 Act to take account of the amendments that we are making to the Bill. It will ensure that all relevant lists can be accessed by the right people in advance of the criminal records bureau becoming fully operational. Regulations will provide that registration authorities under parts II and V-that is the commission, the Assembly and Ofsted, as well as the councils-will be able to access the lists to screen people applying for registration.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I have nothing to say about the amendments, but I have a query about new clause 30. Can the Minister clarify whether the classes of people who will have access to the lists via the Secretary of State under the temporary arrangements are the same as the classes of people who will have access under the on-going arrangements once the criminal records bureau is established?

<P>
From memory-I do not have a copy in front of me-under the Protection of Children Act, child care organisations would have access to the lists once the system is up and running. My quick reading of new clause 30 suggests that, under the temporary arrangements, a wider category of people, including, for example, a parent who proposes to offer employment to an individual, would be able to access the lists. Is that correct?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We certainly intend that the classes of people should be the same, and we shall check to ensure that we have secured that; I believe that we have. It is not my understanding that a parent, in the context that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, would be able to refer to a list.

<P>
A local authority will be able to make a check on behalf of a parent in relation to direct payments. We shall reach that part of the Bill shortly. Furthermore, we intend to use the regulation-making power to allow adoption societies, for example, to access the lists when considering the suitability of prospective adopters. We also intend to make regulations allowing part II regulation authorities, and councils under part IV, access to the lists when considering whether a person is suitable to be registered with them. Part V registration authorities will be given access through the regulations to enable them to check child minders and day care providers against the lists as part of the registration process.

<P>
We had to make the changes because of the way in which the Bill is constructed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by my remarks.

<P>
<H5>10.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> It may be that I am missing something, but we are debating a new clause, so it must stand alone. It states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any person seeking to ascertain whether a relevant individual is included in  the list  shall be entitled to that information on making  an application  to the Secretary of State.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Perhaps I have missed a cross-reference elsewhere, but I see nothing that qualifies the term ``any person''. However, the Minister has made clear the Government's intention and I am sure that he will, if necessary, clarify the provision in due course.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendment No. 433.

<P>
Government new clause 32-Power to extend Part VI.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments are purely technical. They will alter the wording of the clause in the light of the introduction of new clause 32. New clause 32 will enable the Secretary of State to extend the protection of vulnerable adults scheme to other services through regulations. The range of services that may be included by regulation are defined as those that local authorities provide to adults in the exercise of their social services functions; services that are similar to those that may, or must, be provided by local authorities in the exercise of their social services functions; and those similar to NHS services that may, or must, be so provided.

<P>
I hope that Committee members agree that the new clause will provide flexibility. By making regulations, the Secretary of State will be able to ensure that the provisions in this part of the Bill remain comprehensive by applying them to all services that provide care to vulnerable adults. Until the scheme beds down, it is intended that it will apply only to services regulated under part II, or those subject to ministerial direction. For example, when day centres are brought into the regulatory arrangements in part II, Ministers might decide to make such services subject to the provisions in part VI that relate to the protection of vulnerable adults scheme.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I do not want to anticipate the argument of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and I shall respond to any points that he wishes to make after he has spoken to amendment No. 370.

<P>
The amendments are purely minor and are intended to tidy up the wording as a result of the addition of the new clause. Clause 70 specifies that people can be listed only if referred under clauses 71 or 72 or section 2 of the Protection of Children Act 1999. New clause 25, which we have not yet had a chance to debate, will introduce a new way in which people can be referred to the list-for example, by a reference by the National Care Standards Commission or the assembly. The provision has been reworded simply so that people can be listed only if referred under this part. [
Interruption.]

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. When hon. Members leave the Room will they please either switch off mobile telephones and pagers or take them with them?

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I apologise to the Committee for not switching off my mobile. I am sorry, Mr. Illsley.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he would not anticipate my remarks. I am slightly ashamed to say that I have not always shown quite the same courtesy when responding to Government amendments in groups led by an Opposition amendment.

<P>
The Minister could have responded readily to the spirit of amendment No. 370. He will recall our debates on the Protection of Children Bill and I am sure that he knows very well what is in my mind. The answer may well lie in the reference that he has just made to new clause 25. However, my concern, which the amendment may not address perfectly, is that although the arrangements allow for an employee in an organisation to be reported to the Secretary of State by the employer in certain circumstances, there is a gap in provision for the principle. If one can be reported by one's employer, what happens in a care setting where the person who needs to be reported is the employer himself? I can find no structure for reporting him. Amendment No. 370 rather crudely allows the Secretary of State to extrapolate what an employer might have done if the principal had been an employee. There may be a better way of doing that; I have tabled the amendment in order to flag up the possible gap in the armoury that the Minister has created under the Protection of Children Act and is supplementing in the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I share the hon. Gentleman's concern to ensure that there are no avoidable and obvious loopholes in the new arrangements. He has had a look at new clause 25 and I believe that he will find that we have closed the gap to which he and others have drawn attention, partly as a result of the Protection of Children Act and in debates in another place. There is clearly a potential problem if the person about whom there are serious concerns is running the home and is the employer. The hon. Gentleman is right: it would be difficult for the employer effectively to refer himself to the protection of vulnerable adults list. That is why new clause 25 gives the registration authority power to refer to the list any care worker who has not been referred by the employer but whom it considers has been guilty of misconduct.

<P>
As we envisage the scheme working, the definition of a care worker in subsection (2) would cover the case of the care home owner who is also the manager of the care home and in regular contact with vulnerable adults. There is no difficulty with who can be referred to the commission; clearly that person could be referred. The problem is that if he chose not to refer himself to the list, it is likely that we would hit a brick wall-and that is what new clause 25 is designed to get around. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured that we have not only accepted his point, but tabled a solution to the problem.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I accept the Minister's assurance that the Government have recognised the problem and dealt with it. Does the same problem not also occur in relation to the Protection of Children Act? It is immediately apparent to me that new clause 25 also extends to that Act.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are alert to that problem, and the Bill covers it.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
Clause 70, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Persons who provide care for vulnerable adults: duty to refer</center></H4>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 373, in page 45, line 16, after ``shall'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`, and any other person may,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
Again, this takes me back to the days of the Protection of Children Bill. The amendment is a means of probing what I see as an inconsistency here. As I recall, the Protection of Children Act requires that certain categories of people must report incidents to the Secretary of State, but beyond that there is a capability for others, who are not so obliged, to do so if they feel the need. The amendment would add to the requirement that a provider ``shall'' refer a care worker an additional, optional extra that others not providing care ``may'' refer someone to the Secretary of State. I seek to probe the Minister on whether he sees the need for protection in some circumstances. This is really a whistleblowers' charter. The employer might, for example, be the spouse of the worker in question or there might be some other relationship that inhibits the employer from taking the action envisaged in the Bill, so there is a need for some mechanism by which a third party can report an individual.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Gentleman is largely seeking to extract an indication of how we see the system of referrals applying in practice, under the new protection of vulnerable adults list.

<P>
I hope that he agrees that the new structure needs a series of proper checks and balances, so that we can serve two aims simultaneously. Our paramount concern is to provide better protection to the public, but we want to do so in a way that is fair and reasonable to those working in this crucial area of the industry. I would be the first to accept that it is difficult to achieve the right balance, but employer referrals should be one of the key elements. It is to be hoped that the employer will be best placed to know if someone has been involved in misconduct. There are, of course, proper employment protection measures in place already for those workers. Laws governing unfair dismissal and so on require employers to act in a reasonable way.

<P>
If we were to allow the scheme suggested by the hon. Gentleman, where members of the public could make referrals to the Secretary of State, it is difficult to see how the checks and balances we want could be maintained. There would be nothing to stop a member of the public picking up the phone or writing to the Secretary of State and saying ``I've heard that X is not doing a good job and I want to refer him to your protection of vulnerable adults list.'' That would not be helpful or useful and that is the problem with the amendment. I am sure that he will understand the difficulty. In particular, in relation to the protection of vulnerable adults list, we would be expecting a member of the public to determine who was a vulnerable adult in the context of the Bill, and that might be a difficult judgment for such a person. It might also be difficult for others, although there is a particular problem about the concept of a member of the public defining who is vulnerable.

<P>
New clause 32 allows us to extend the powers of the Bill by regulations if necessary. The scheme is brand new and we need to make sure that it is up and running as we intend, so that it adds value to the principle of public protection that we hold so dear.

<P>
Amendment No. 373 would create a substantial difficulty. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that the gateway to referral should in the main be the employer, because that is the best way to maintain the right checks and balances in such circumstances. It is also possible, as he will know from the amendments that we have already discussed and those that we are about to discuss, that the registration authority will also have the opportunity to refer those who should not work with vulnerable adults.

<P>
There is a series of measures designed to ensure that the gateway to the list is the right one. It is essentially employer-led, as employers are in the best position to decide whether someone is suitable. Opening access to the list to members of the public, with all its potential consequences for employees, might be a step too far. We want the scheme to be flexible so that we can adjust it as and when necessary in the light of how it works, but to open a wider gateway allowing any member of the public to make a referral to the Secretary of State would be to go too far.

<P>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied by what I have said, particularly since the registration authority will also be allowed to refer people to the list. In that way we can prevent non-referral because of loopholes or gaps and maintain the right checks and balances in the system.

<P>

<B>Mr. Hammond:</B> I rather suspected that the Minister's principal argument would be that new clause 25 will deal with the mischief with which I am concerned because, effectively, it provides a filter between a third party and the Secretary of State. That would avoid many of the problems rightly identified by the Minister that would arise if people were able to walk off the street and make direct referrals for inclusion on the list to the Secretary of State. Government new clause 25 to a large extent deals much more appropriately with the problem that we sought to solve through amendment No. 373.

<P>
What drove us to table the amendment was the apparent inconsistency with the Protection of Children Act. Section 2 of it states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A child care organisation shall, and any other organisation may, refer to the Secretary of State an individual who is or has been employed in a child care position<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and ``any other organisation'' is defined simply as a body-corporate or unincorporated-or an individual who employs others in the course of a business. We wanted to raise the issue to explore the logic for the different approach in this Bill. However, with new clauses 25 and 27, the Minister has addressed our concerns about loopholes and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 30, in page 45, line 19, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(1A) Where a referral involves a care worker who is also on the nursing register the provider shall also refer the care worker to the nursing registration authority.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The amendment is intended to explore how the new list will operate in practice and how it will relate to other registration and regulatory regimes. Clause 71 deals with circumstances in which a care worker caring for vulnerable adults who has broken some of the conditions set out in the clause may have to be referred to the Secretary of State. The same duty to refer applies, as I understand it, to circumstances in which the person may no longer be working-may have been transferred or have resigned or retired. Some Government amendments in the next group will also add circumstances in which the person has been made redundant.

<P>
The amendment raises the question of the relationship between the list maintained by the Secretary of State and the work of the United Kingdom Central Council for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visitors. It is important that the robust system of regulation that exists for registered nurses should be informed by the system that will be put in place by the Bill and that the new list for the protection of vulnerable adults should mesh with that existing system.

<P>
The amendment would provide a mechanism whereby if circumstances are felt to be sufficiently serious to warrant a referral to the Secretary of State, they must be sufficiently serious to merit a similar referral to the UKCC. What we seek, therefore, is a guarantee that the UKCC would be made aware in such circumstances so that it could carry out its own investigations. Without such a mechanism clearly in place in the Bill, it would at least be conceivable for somebody to be referred to the Secretary of State, to be included on the register but not to be dealt with directly through the UKCC. That cannot be in the interests of patients or of nurses, and it certainly cannot be in the interests of employers, either. Will the Minister reassure us that the Government recognise the problem and will deal with it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments and the amendment. For reasons that I am sure he will appreciate, we cannot accept the amendment. It would be quite inappropriate to single out one professional group and not refer to doctors and other staff. I assume that it is a probing amendment to establish what our intentions are.

<P>
It is certainly our strong view that employers should already be making referrals to any professional body to which an offending worker might belong. That is essential common sense and good practice. We shall certainly be issuing guidance to remind employers that when a worker who belongs to a professional body is being referred to the protection of vulnerable adults list he should also be referred to his professional body at the same time.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman will also be aware that under parts of the Bill that we have already debated it will be possible for the General Social Care Council to issue a code of practice for employers of social care workers, which will reinforce good employment practice. Through the guidance and the code, I believe that we can achieve the results that he has in mind. We certainly want the schemes to be consistent and we do not want people who are referred to the vulnerable adults list or the Protection of Children Act list to slip through the net of other regulatory arrangements are necessarily in place, too.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I am very encouraged by what the Minister said. However, given that he rightly acknowledges that there is a responsibility on the employer to refer to those other agencies and bodies that register, has he not considered-and, if so, with what result-the possibility of putting in the Bill some form of specific duty rather than relying on codes and guidelines?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> We considered that but decided not to go down that road. The particular importance of the protection of vulnerable adults list and the Protection of Children Act list is that they are both innovatory. A consultancy index in relation to children has been in operation for some time, but we are putting that on a new statutory basis and creating the new protection of vulnerable adults list. We have to have a set of arrangements in place that will make that scheme effective and operationally intact-make it work to deliver the goods that we have in mind. That is why we have made it clear in the Bill that there has to be a duty on the employer to refer to the list; otherwise the list will be redundant almost at the beginning. There is thus a substantial argument in favour of imposing that duty.

<P>
The arguments are slightly different in relation to referring on to other professional regulatory bodies, for reasons of which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be aware. There would have to be an extensive process of consultation with all those regulatory bodies to see whether they wanted that process to apply. We decided that that was not a sensible path to pursue, but we can achieve the result that the hon. Gentleman seeks without the amendment, particularly for social care employers. With the codes of practice that the General Social Care Council will be promulgating, and policing through the National Care Standards Commission as well, we can achieve the desired result and share the hon. Gentleman's objective in tabling the amendment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> The objective is one that we share, and the Minister has certainly said sufficient to reassure me and my hon. Friends. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 436, in page 45, line 24, leave out ``or retired'' and insert
<P>

</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 437 to 439, 453, 454, 457 and 459.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendments owe their origin largely to concerns expressed by the noble Lord Phillips of Sudbury in another place about the operation of the protection of vulnerable adults list. By adding redundancy to the list of circumstances that can trigger referral to the list, we seek to ensure that the list remains accurate and up to date, and that it performs the purpose that we had in mind when we set it up. It would not do any of those three things if people were dismissed on the grounds of redundancy, but in circumstances where behaviour on the part of the employee also constituted serious misconduct. That essentially is what the amendments seek to do.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this we will take amendment No. 372, in page 47, line 25, after ``determination'', insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`where he believes it necessary to do so for the purpose of protecting vulnerable adults'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> These two small amendments seek to make the process, and the motivation for it, clear and transparent, in the two cases where a determination is taking place. When such circumstances arise, it is likely that the situation will be quite charged, with a number of people giving information concerning another individual, and it is important to make transparently clear the motivation in both applications of the amendments.

<P>
We have already debated why measures are taken to protect vulnerable adults, on which there is a wide measure of consensus. We have supported the Government on the measures affecting many of the registered workers covered by the Bill, and it would be consistent with that to make the motivation clear.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The hon. Lady wants to avoid unnecessary provisional listings, and so do we, and clause 71(4) should do precisely that. The amendment would require the Secretary of State to come to two separate decisions before making a decision to list someone provisionally when a referral had been made. First, he would have to decide, under clause 71(4), that it would be appropriate to include that person on the list provisionally. Secondly, under the amendment, he would have to decide whether it was necessary to do so in order to protect vulnerable adults. The amendment achieves nothing substantial. The Secretary of State will not include people on the provisional list if it is not appropriate to do so. The aim is to protect vulnerable adults from the risk of abuse. It is part of the fabric of the way in which the scheme would work.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
To require the decision to be made at the provisional listing stage, would sit oddly with the second stage of the decision-making progress when the Secretary of State considers all the evidence that the employer has made available and what the employee has to say about the situation. It is in no one's interest to put people on to the list who should not be on it. We have tried to make sure that that is the case.

<P>
We do not intend that everyone who is referred should be put on to the list willy-nilly. That is not the point of this exercise or the object of the clause. There will be an initial screening. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that it is appropriate for a particular person to be on the list. I hope that will sufficiently reassure the hon. Lady about our intentions and about how we expect the scheme to work.

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> We are concerned about the process behind the steps that result in an individual name going on to the list. The Minister has explained more clearly how that process will work on a day-to-day basis when the Bill comes into operation and how it will improve the present situation. He is right: our objective was to avoid unnecessary provisional listing. I am reassured that that is also his objective and that of subsection (4). I have reread it. The meaning did not quite spring out of the text, but I now understand it. I accept his point that the objective is to avoid the undoubted distress that would be caused by unnecessary provisional listing. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> It is right to recognise the vulnerability of adults with learning difficulties and their need to be protected from those who would seek to abuse them. However, there needs to be fairness within the system when someone is on the list. At present, someone can be put on the provisional list for nine months. Has the Minister considered creating a mechanism whereby, providing that there is sufficient evidence, if there is doubt about why a person has been put on the provisional list, leave could be sought from the Secretary of State by an individual or, for example, their trade union to apply to have an earlier hearing. Will the Minister consider including a provision to take account of that? I wholeheartedly support the measure, but we should create a mechanism so that, in exceptional circumstances, someone could seek a written or oral hearing to have their name considered earlier.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hilton Dawson </B>(Lancaster and Wyre): Will my hon. Friend confirm that what he suggests, which would introduce a further element of natural justice to people who are themselves in a difficult position, would not compromise the safety and well-being of vulnerable adults, who must be at the forefront of our concern?

<P>
<B>Mr. Shaw:</B> I am treading cautiously. I do not want anyone to misunderstand me; I want to see the provision included in the Bill. Appeals should be considered earlier. Being on the list for nine months could effectively destroy the careers of those who have worked with vulnerable adults for years, which is particularly serious if that is their sole source of income. That is a simple point. I look forward to my hon. Friend's reply, and I hope that such a provision will be included in the Bill on Report.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the matter. He will be aware that this is the first time that it has been raised, but it is entirely appropriate that we should have another opportunity to discuss whether we are drawing the line in the right place. Like my hon. Friend, we want to be absolutely sure that the vulnerable people and children who need to be protected are not exposed to the criminal and dangerous behaviour of those who would abuse them. That is why we have introduced a list for the protection of vulnerable adults.

<P>
The nine months referred to in clause 73 is a backstop. It is the extreme limit. We do not expect cases to take as long as that to be decided and resolved under the provisional listing procedure. There are two stages-the initial referral, when the Secretary of State might provisionally list someone, followed by the subsequent determination by the Secretary of State, which can be dealt with by tribunal on appeal. We do not expect the Secretary of State to take nine months to decide whether to include someone on the list. We have drawn the line at that point because the Secretary of State will be partly dependent on the speed with which employers respond to requests for information and so on. We did not want to include a time limit in the Bill that would compromise the Secretary of State's ability-

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the Minister address the Committee? Hansard is having difficulty in hearing him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Illsley; I am addressing an empty seat and my hon. Friends are sitting behind me. However, the Opposition are ably represented by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman).

<P>
The nine-month limit was introduced in the Protection of Children Act 1999, which was promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley). The nine-month period is a backstop. We expect cases to be dealt with much more quickly than that. We fixed on a nine-month limit for the reasons that I have given, but I should make it clear that it would be possible under clause 73 for those who have been provisionally listed who are still waiting for an outcome to ask the Secretary of State to review the decision to provisionally list them within the nine-month period. That will give us the opportunity to correct injustices and allow people to make further representations to the Secretary of State before the nine months have elapsed. We do not want people to be trapped in limbo, for the reasons explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> With regard to checks and balances, experience has revealed a problem for some care workers working with vulnerable children, in that sometimes investigations into allegations of misconduct take an inordinately long time because relevant individuals have dispersed to other parts of the system and must be traced. During that time there is a cloud over the care worker concerned, who may in the end be cleared. That has a severe personal effect and may affect people's livelihoods, as the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford pointed out. We want children to be protected, but surely we need to learn from what is happening. Looking into those cases can have long consequences.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Yes, but I am afraid that that goes with the terrain. We must be clear about our purpose. We are constructing the new arrangements to protect children and vulnerable adults.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> On a similar point, in relation to the reference in subsection (5) to ``civil or criminal proceedings'', what is the definition of proceedings? Does it include the investigation of an allegation, which I know can take the police many months, or only having been charged with an offence?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I am sure that there is a technical legal definition and I shall let the hon. Gentleman know. I do not want to attempt my own ad hoc definition today, if he will forgive me.

<P>
I hope that hon. Members now appreciate that my hon. Friend's example of someone being stuck for nine months unable to do anything is not right. Under clause 73, that person could make further representations to the Secretary of State, who could, if appropriate, decide not to maintain the relevant entry on the list. Hon. Members should also not lose sight of what would have led to a referral in the first place, as set out in clause 71(2). The relevant circumstances are extreme and include dismissal because of concerns about behaviour. It would not be a matter of the employer's whim or referrals that were malicious or insubstantial. The Secretary of State would need to be sure that the conditions leading up to the referral were fulfilled. All the referrals would relate to substantial cases in which the employer had already conducted a procedure to establish the facts and decide on appropriate measures.

<P>
I hope that that response reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford, and that he now believes that the balance in the Bill is right.

<P>

I take this opportunity to put on the record the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who has gone to limber up for the six-hour debate that the Opposition have obtained on the health service. It is unusual for a full Opposition day to be devoted to one subject and it places our team of three Front-Bench spokesmen at a distinct disadvantage in comparison with the Government's team, which has substantially more. I counted six Ministers on Tuesday afternoon. With a full phalanx in Committee, it is like David and Goliath.

<B>The Chairman:</B> With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 455 and 456.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> Amendment No. 441 will require employers who provide care to vulnerable adults to cease to employ workers who are included in the list of those who are considered unsuitable to work with vulnerable adults, should they discover that they have employed such a person. That can be done by suspension, transfer or dismissal if necessary. Amendment No. 456 includes a similar provision in relation to the Protection of Children Act 1999, and amendment No. 455 is a technical and consequential amendment to that Act.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> The amendment is an important addition to the Bill because it puts in place the final piece of the jigsaw in ensuring that we have a comprehensive set of regulatory arrangements to serve the purpose that we all support. The amendment will make it a criminal offence if a person,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>applies for, offers to do, accepts or does any work in a care position-<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
when he knows that he is on the protection of vulnerable adults list. ``Care position'' is defined in clause 69. As is entirely appropriate, the person will have a defence if he can prove,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that he did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to know, that he was so included in that list.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I know that some Members of the Committee will be anxious to ensure that there is an equivalent provision in relation to the Protection of Children Act list, and I can assure the Committee that such a provision is contained in another Bill that is currently before the House.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> I do not want to speak against the Government amendment, only to probe the Minister on one aspect of it.

<P>
Our purpose in tabling the amendments is to try to achieve consistency with other parts of the Bill. In relation to other situations of equal gravity-for example, where one person tries to deceive another about his or her qualifications or registrations-the Bill legislates for a level 5 fine. If we are to have a consistent system of carrots and sticks, we must ensure that those in positions of responsibility in relation to vulnerable children and adults are clear about the consequences of any conduct that is not within the letter of the law.

<P>
To return to the matter on which I want to probe the Minister, although I agree that it should be a justifiable defence for someone to say that he did not know that he was on the list, will the Minister explain how easily it will be for an individual to slip through the net and be unaware of that? I am unsure how anyone could not be aware of that. Presumably, an individual is informed if his name is included on the list, so would it boil down to some mistake being made, such as written notification being sent to the wrong address? Will the Minister explain how someone could reasonably use that defence and outline the process for informing someone that he or she is on the list?

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> If the hon. Lady is asking me to anticipate the circumstances in which the defence could be used, that is rather difficult to do. Essentially, it will be a matter of fact as to whether the person knew or should reasonably have known that he was on the list. It is conceivable that notification from the Secretary of State could be sent to the wrong address. The hon. Lady is right to say that an essential element of having such a list is that it gives the employee an opportunity to respond to the reference that has been made by the employer, so the employee will be engaged in the process. If the employee has been engaged in the process, it will be very difficult for that person successfully to plead ignorance of inclusion in the list. In fact, it is almost impossible to imagine a set of circumstances in which a person could successfully raise that defence after being notified. However, the defence is included to cover the circumstances in which the person genuinely did not know. It is conceivable-just-that something could go wrong in the process, and because this is a criminal offence, it is appropriate that someone should be able to raise that argument in court. The offence carries a criminal sanction, so it should apply in only the clearest cases.

<P>
Amendment agreed to.

<P>
<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> On a point of order, Mr. Illsley. I did not hear the Minister's response to my amendments.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`( ) A person shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of subsection (1) if, having made an application under section 77 or 78 he has received no response to that application within a period of fourteen days from the date of making such application'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
I am sorry if I created any confusion, but I am still a relative novice. I have got used to hearing the Minister construct a strong argument as to why I should withdraw amendments, which I usually do if it makes good sense. However, I shall return to those issues during the clause stand part debate.

<P>
Amendment No. 366 is a probing amendment. I am still thinking about the practical implications of the clause because the effect of inclusion on the list is very serious for the individual concerned. If, having made an application, no response is received within 14 days, a person shall be deemed to have complied. The practical example that I gave was of someting going missing in the post. That was also the only circumstance that the Minister could think of in which someone might be unaware. There are practical problems, but the amendment was designed to probe the Government on what would happen in that situation. The Minister said that it was difficult to scroll forward to how it will work in practice, and I am not asking him to do the impossible. The amendment will allow us to think our way into how it will work.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I apologise to the hon. Lady for any confusion about which amendment she wanted me to speak to. We have responded to the issue raised by amendment No. 363 with Government amendment No. 442. The hon. Lady was trying to do the Government's work for us, and we are grateful to her for helping out, but amendment No. 442 is the right way to proceed. My amendment is better than hers. It is also bigger than hers-substantially bigger-and that is another argument in its favour.

<P>
With amendment No. 366, the hon. Lady is asking us to allow the possibility that employers could, if they have not received the results of their reference to the list within 14 days, take someone on. The hon. Lady's amendment would allow a situation in which someone is offered employment and starts work with vulnerable adults or children, before the information that he or she is on the list comes through. We cannot have circumstances in which an employer can offer work notwithstanding the fact that someone might be on the list.

<P>
The hon. Lady may be looking for some indication from us as to how quickly we will be able to respond to requests for information. We shall respond as quickly as possible. The Secretary of State provides that service at the moment and will do so by means of the protection of vulnerable adults list, when the Bill becomes law. We will provide information to employers at the earliest possible moment, as is appropriate. We do not want to make it difficult for employers to recruit workers, nor do we want to create uncertainty for prospective employees. All the issues should be sorted out as quickly as possible.

<P>
The hon. Lady will be aware that, from July 2001, the criminal records bureau will be the gateway through which employers will get information about people on the Protection of Children Act list or the protection of vulnerable adults list. The employer's request will go to the CRB, not the Secretary of State and the bureau will be responsible for undertaking the check and providing the employer with the relevant information. It is in everyone's interests that the CRB should carry out that task at the earliest possible opportunity. It is likely that the CRB will have to cope with a significant volume of business, but everyone will want to get on with the task quickly and end any uncertainty for employers and prospective employees.

<P>
It would be a mistake to have such a provision in the Bill. It would create a substantial loophole that would allow people on the list to work in situations in which they will come into contact with vulnerable children and adults. For that reason, we cannot accept it.

<B>Mrs Spelman:</B> The Minister said that it was obvious that the Government amendment was better than ours, because it was bigger. It seemed that the overtone was, ``Never mind the quality, feel the width.'' However, I accept his point that his amendment has captured ours, so we will not need to include it in the stand part debate.

<P>
On amendment No. 366, the Minister has entirely understood our concerns about the transitional period until the criminal records bureau is up and running. It will be vital for employers, who have no desire to place those vulnerable adults in their care at any risk through inadvertently employing someone wholly unsuitable for the position. The difficulty that I foresee in the transitional period between now and 2001-and perhaps even during the transitional period during which the criminal records bureau gets itself up and running-are unnecessary delays.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Our proposal of 14 days was intended to probe the Government's intentions. I urge the Minister to do all that he can in the transitional phase before the criminal records bureau is up and running to ensure that the information is processed as quickly and accurately as possible. I am sure that no one would want speed at the expense of accuracy. That would be disastrous. It will be important for the criminal records bureau, once it is established, to consider the speed with which it replies to requests for such critically important information. It must be afforded the importance that the Minister concedes is necessary. He has given us his assurance that information should be turned round at the earliest possible opportunity and, on the strength of that undertaking. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.

<P>
<B>Dr. Brand:</B> This is a sensible clause, and I do not want to speak against it. However, I would like to seek clarification from the Minister.

<P>
It is clearly right that employers should not employ people who are on the list, if that would create the potential for damage to vulnerable adults or children. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the definition of employment in a care position is to be made clearer, or whether the National Care Standards Commission will be able to advise employers who are uncertain as to what constitutes a care situation? This morning, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Barking (Ms Hodge), gave the Committee a good example when she asserted that host families were not in a caring position towards their charges. I was amazed by that. I cannot imagine a situation in which someone could be more vulnerable to potential abuse than that of a lonely 12-year-old in a host family.

<P>
Furthermore, I can foresee circumstances in which a person on the list might want to be employed in a residential home, for example, to do a job that did not involve personal intimate care. Whether such employment was appropriate might be a grey area. When we discussed the role of Ofsted earlier, it was clearly described as a regulatory authority, not an advisory authority. I hope that the Minister will reassure me that advice will be available to potential employers on such grey areas, if they exist.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there are no such grey areas. If he casts his mind back to our discussions on clause 69, especially subsections (2) and (3), he will remember that we set out clearly the definition of a care position for these purposes. There is, therefore, no need to spell out that definition more specifically.

<P>
Ambiguity about the types of employment covered by clause 76 would be in no one's interest, as the consequences of failing to comply with the provision could be quite serious. One such consequence could be the deregistration of that agency or care home by the National Care Standards Commission. That would be a very serious step, and we do not want employers to find themselves in that situation by accident or misadventure. The definitions set out in clause 69(2) and (3) are precise and clear.

<P>
Question put and agreed to.

<P>
Clause 76, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<P>
Clauses 77 and 78 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Persons referred for inclusion in list under Protection of Children Act 1999</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 443, in page 50, line 40, leave out from beginning to ``apply'' in line 43 and insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`.-( ) Section 2(4) to (7) of section 2 of the 1999 Act (referrals for inclusion in list of individuals who are considered unsuitable to work with children) shall, in the case of any reference under section 2 or 2A of that Act,'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 444 to 452.

<P>
Government new clause 25-Power of registration authority to refer.

<P>
Government new clause 26-Individuals named in the findings of certain inquiries.

<P>
Government new clause 27-Inclusion in 1999 Act list on reference by certain authorities.

<P>
Government new clause 28-Inclusion in 1999 Act list of individuals named in findings of certain inquiries.

<P>
Government new clause 29-Transfer from Consultancy Service Index of individuals named in past inquiries.

<P>
<B>Mr. Hutton:</B> This is a large group of amendments and new clauses and I shall explain them in context.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 443, 444, 445 and 446 update the provisions in clause 79 to allow cross-referral from the Protection of Children Act list to the protection of vulnerable adults list to take account of the new clauses on referrals by the registration authority and following an inquiry report. They are technical amendments.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 447 to 452 are also technical amendments and will alter the existing wording of clause 81, bearing in mind new clauses 25, 26 and 27, to ensure that the ability to cross-refer from the protection of vulnerable adults list to the Protection of Children Act list is available in all circumstances.

<P>
New clause 25 provides for the registration authority to refer workers to the Secretary of State on grounds of misconduct which harmed or risked harming a vulnerable adult. I said during an earlier debate that this important new provision will ensure that there are no gaps in the referral process to the Secretary of State, so that we can ensure that the list is accurate, up to date and does precisely what we want it to do.

<P>
New clause 26 gives the Secretary of State powers provisionally to list and to determine whether to confirm the listing of a person employed in a care position and named by an inquiry as being guilty of relevant misconduct or as being unsuitable to work with vulnerable adults.

<P>
New clause 27 amends the Protection of Children Act 1999 to provide for the National Care Standards Commission, the National Assembly for Wales and the chief inspector of schools in England to refer workers employed in child care positions to the Secretary of State on grounds of misconduct.

<P>
New clause 28 provides for the Secretary of State to be able to consider for inclusion on the Protection of Children Act list an individual who has been named in the findings of certain inquiries when employed in a child care position and when it appears to the Secretary of State from the report that the inquiry considered the individual guilty of misconduct which harmed a child or placed a child at risk of harm and when it appears to him that the person is unsuitable to work with children.

<P>
New clause 29 completes this array of amendments and allows the names on the Consultancy Service Index to be transferred, as a result of a relevant inquiry, to the Protection of Children Act list if it appears to the Secretary of State that the person who held the inquiry found the individual guilty of misconduct and that the individual is unsuitable to work with children.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burstow:</B> I want to raise what is almost a point of order but is probably best dealt with in this group of amendments. We have before us a series of complicated and long new clauses, which add a number of important provisions to the Bill. The Minister went to some trouble to explain them, but it would have been helpful if the Committee had had, at the very least, some explanatory notes in advance. We could then have considered the new clauses in the context of whether amendments should be tabled to them and better understood them when framing any such amendments and posing further questions to the Minister.

<P>
Other new clauses will come before the Committee during its remaining sittings. I suggest to the Government and their business managers that the Committee should have explanatory notes, at least to new clauses, but, preferably, also to long amendments so that we can all do our job better.

<P>
<B>Mr. Julian Brazier </B>(Canterbury): I second the hon. Gentleman's comments. I am not sure whether they are a point of order, but I shall follow him in treating them as part of the debate. It is disappointing that these new clauses and amendments have come before us not only without explanatory notes but at the very last moment. I am not sure whether they were available yesterday, but I saw them for the first time just now. When I looked at the amendment paper yesterday, they were not on it.

<P>
I have a long-term interest in child abuse issues and am a member of an all-party group on the interests of adults with learning difficulties-Voice.

<P>
This group of amendments seems to have a worthy aim and I am sure that the Committee will welcome the bringing together of the fragmented arrangements for listing and checking people for a variety of purposes, including looking after children and adults with learning difficulties. The amendments are extremely complicated and there are a lot of them. I do not believe that the Committee can make a contribution without having time to consider them or, better still, some explanatory notes.

<P>
It being twenty-five minutes past Eleven o'clock, The Chairman adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing order.

<P>
<UL><UL><UL>Adjourned till this day at half-past Two o'clock.
