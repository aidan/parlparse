<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I hope that right hon. and hon. Members had a relaxing break. It may be of interest to the Committee to know that I spent most of my break carrying out parliamentary duties, but that I enjoyed the same level of masochistic gratification that I experience while presiding over our proceedings.

<P>
<B>Mr. Richard Ottaway </B>(Croydon, South): On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I hope that your gratification is not too retarded. You will be aware that amendments Nos. 17 and 18 have not been selected for discussion. Notwithstanding the fact that they are defective-given that Opposition amendments, if selected in principle, must be refined-I believe that they were not selected because they relate to benefits, not taxation. To that extent, I do not quarrel with the decision that we debate tax matters rather than benefits. However, the Government are moving towards an integrated tax and benefits system, as shown in the operation of the working families tax credit and the imposition of national insurance contributions on taxation. National insurance contributions relate to benefits, and the amendments were tabled to stimulate a debate on the interaction of benefits and taxation.

<P>
Reference is made frequently on the Inland Revenue website that deals with IR35 to benefits from both the Government and employers. My right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) drew to my attention case law on the assessment of IR35, which is based on social security case law relating to benefits. Page 280 of the Bill sets out the nine steps for the assessment of schedule E payments, step six of which refers to national insurance contributions that purchase benefits, so even the schedule refers to the integration of benefits and the tax system. While I do not quarrel with your interpretation of the rules as they stand, Mr. Cook, may I suggest that the matter is referred to the Procedure Committee, so that consideration can be given to permitting the Committee wider debate on the interaction of tax and benefits?

<P>
<B>Mr. Michael Jack </B>(Fylde): Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I, too, am mystified by the reasoning behind the matters to which my hon. Friend has referred. I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that cases such as Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd. v. Minister of Pensions and National Insurance are prayed in aid of the Government's position as is the case of Market Investigations Ltd. v. the Ministry of Social Security. The fact that much of the Government's thinking seems to be predicated on those cases in which social security issues are mentioned adds weight to my hon. Friend's point of order.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway) for giving me notice that he intended to raise the issue. I understand the problem of making a distinction between benefits and taxation, especially given recent developments. I undertake to have the matter reconsidered in the appropriate quarters of the House and to give the Committee an analysis of the issue at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<B>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo):</B> Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. You said that you would consider the matter. However, I should tell the Committee and particularly the hon. Member for Croydon, South and the right hon. Member for Fylde that the question of IR35 revolves around the definition of employment, which is the subject of forthcoming debates. Employment status determines national insurance and tax payments, and that, not integration of the tax and benefits system, is the common thread that runs through the matters under discussion. The authorities will be able to examine that more closely.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I can do no better than to repeat what I said. I am sure that all remarks made this morning will be taken into account when the authorities deliberate.

<H4><center>Schedule 12</center></H4>
<H4><center>Provision of services through an intermediary</center></H4>
<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 277, line 13, after ``that'' insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`having regard to the practice generally received or adopted at any time as to the manner of performance of the services for persons in the same business as the client'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments: No. 12, in page 277, line 15, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) but, shall not apply if the worker or intermediary works for many different clients or as a sole trader as well as under a relevant engagement.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 13, in page 277, line 15, at end insert-

<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(d) but, shall not apply where the intermediary contracts with a party other than the client such as an agency.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 39, in page 277, line 15, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(nothing in this Schedule shall be taken to alter any rule of law as to whether an individual is or would be an employee of any other person).'<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
No. 40, in page 277, line 26, at end insert-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`(6) This Schedule applies only to a case where the Inland Revenue can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the General Commissioners that its application would not damage the flexibility of the market for the services performed by and for the client.'.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 40 would have the same effect; they would ensure that flexibility is maintained in the labour markets by adoption of existing practices and that there is no change in employment law. In her response to the point of order, the Paymaster General rightly said that the proposals relate primarily to employment law. She will also be aware that amendment No. 38 adopts the words
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>practice generally received or adopted<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
from Inland Revenue statement of practice 8/91 and would limit Revenue powers to overturn an agreement of tax liability made on the basis of previous prevailing practice or law.

<P>
Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 go to the heart of our suggestion that there should be no change in employment law. Paragraph 3 of the press release for the famous-or infamous-IR35, dated 9 March 1999, states that there
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is no intention to redefine the existing boundary between employment and self-employment.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That may be the intention and what the Minister says, but it is not how many people understand the legislation. There is a fundamental shift in definitions of employment and self-employment; amendment No. 38 seeks to hold the Minister to the words of IR35 and to stop that shift, which is damaging the economy.

<P>
What does IR35 seek to do and what does it mean when it states that there is no attempt to redefine the boundaries? The proposed new rules for the provision of personal services were published at the same time as the press release. Part 1 of the memo summary identifies engagements caught by new rules, and starts with a test of supervision, direction or control. The Paymaster General will be aware that that was subsequently abandoned, even though that was the thinking at the time. On 23 September, there was a climbdown. A press release, under the heading ``Preventing avoidance; preserving flexibility'', stated that
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any action must do no unnecessary damage to the flexible labour markets where intermediaries are currently used.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That came after a period of consultation. Clearly, the Paymaster General recognised that a valid point had been made. We welcome the shift of emphasis.

<P>
In relation to employment and self-employment rules, one begins to wonder whether, if there is no change in the law, this debate is much ado about nothing. However, there is a change in the law. IR35 is therefore a contradictory document. The two press releases to which I referred are contradictory-effectively, they say, ``There is no change, but here is the change.'' The amendments would limit the damage to the British economy, business-especially small businesses-and, most of all, the self-employed.

<P>
In relation to the Paymaster General's press release, issued on 23 September, why, if there is a wish to preserve flexibility, which was always the reason that Conservative Governments rejected the proposal-

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman and other Conservative Members repeatedly refer to the number of times that Conservative Governments rejected such proposals. However, I can find only one such instance, in a Committee in 1981. If he wishes to continue repeating the point, will he provide details of when, why and how much revenue was at stake? Otherwise, he should stop making such a vague point.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I will make the allegations that I want to make, when I want, how I want, and in my own way. I will not be lectured by the Paymaster General. She has no basis for suggesting that no consideration was given to the matter, as she does not have access to Treasury papers relating to the Conservative party's period in office-[
Interruption.] I will tell hon. Members that the matter was considered by Conservative Governments, but not accepted. That is fact.

<P>
<B>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Stephen Timms):</B> When?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Some time between 1979 and 1997. I was not a Treasury Minister at the time, and therefore do not have the detailed information. However, I know, from conversations with colleagues who were in the Treasury at the time, that such a proposal was considered. I shall therefore continue to make the allegation.

<P>
The proposal was not accepted because it was felt that it would destroy flexibility in markets. The reaction to the current proposal implies that flexibility is being destroyed. The Inland Revenue's figures show that it will affect 60,000 people, and many commentators believe that it will affect substantially more. I will provide an illustration of the impact of the proposal. If you, Mr. Cook, were to decide to set up as an agent supplying IT consultants to, let us say, British Telecom, and you chose to hire four members of the Committee and pay them a salary, you would not be subject to the schedule's provisions for running a business and receiving income, as you would be simply supplying services. However, the four of us could dispense with your services and form a company, each take a 25 per cent. shareholding, and supply ourselves to British Telecom. We would end up with the same income as before, but we would be subject to the schedule whereas you would not. Four people would do the same work in the same circumstances; in one case a tax would be imposed, and in the other it would not.

<P>
<H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
If that is an attempt to preserve the flexibility of the markets, I am confused. It would create rigidities in the market. I mean no disrespect to you, Mr. Cook, but it effectively puts someone in a position in which he or she does no work but pays less tax than the four who set off on the exercise in their own right.

<P>
The Paymaster General has not made the case about the labour market that she set out in her press release. The modified approach after the press release of 23 September was that the existing rules would be used to determine the boundary between employment and self-employment. That is fine, but whom will it hit? Where will its impact fall?

<P>
I have received a substantial amount of correspondence, as I am sure have many members of the Committee. I would like to test your patience, Mr. Cook, by reading a passage from a letter that I received from an IT consultant who was concerned about the operation of the provisions. He states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As an IT Computer Consultant who has traded for over 25 years, and operated as a limited company since 1983, I am now caught up in the IR35 debacle. The iniquities in this legislation are numerous.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He lists them on an attachment, but I shall not refer to it. He continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are between 200,000 to 300,000 IT contract workers caught up by this situation plus Avionics engineers (who work on the Harrier jet for example), Oil and Gas Engineers who work off shore. These are highly intelligent, motivated, self-starters who are accustomed to the inconvenience of a transient life style and risk of lack of work. We, like the Professional Contractor's Group who represent many of these contractors, feel sure there will be serious repercussions for the development of technology in the UK if these regulations are implemented.

<P>
Far from statements about the need for ``a level playing field'', it is clear that the Labour government have no idea of the workings of the highly skilled UK technology industry. They seem to have no idea of the cost to us of keeping skilled (how do they think we got where we are?) and have no idea that they can't  just recruit foreign workers as replacements for those who opt to go abroad. On average my partner and I have made NI payments of £640 per month. I doubt if incoming foreign workers would make such level of contributions.

<P>
Under IR35 my partner who undertakes all the administration (on a part-time basis), including finding contracts for me, is no longer able to draw a salary and therefore unable to contribute to her pension scheme. As I work flat out either on my client's site, or updating my skills at home, I will still need her assistance. Also, I will now be limited in the amount I can pay into my presently under-funded pension scheme which makes a mockery of this government's statements about self-reliance in old age.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
The letter continues, but I have given a flavour of it. That middle-aged man-we have an ageism problem in this country, but that is a separate debate-relies on self-employment to find work, and cannot get back to employment. He is being hit in a way that he did not expect. I suspect that the Government did not expect it either when they started down the road, which is why I hope that they will be persuaded in due course to listen to our arguments.

<P>
The Government entered office with a firm commitment to help the business sector. Their 1997 manifesto stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A new Labour Government will give Britain's entrepreneurs and small businesses the backing they deserve.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What has been proposed? IR35, which does not constitute ``the backing they deserve''. It constitutes, not help and assistance for Britain's entrepreneurs and small businesses, but a kick in the teeth. Nevertheless, it might be acceptable on its own if it were the only measure involved. However, other proposals include £5 billion extra tax per annum on business and an extra £5 billion regulatory burden, and later amendments will introduce double taxation relief and national insurance contributions on share options, all of which add up to a heavy hit on the business community. There is no doubt that most of the extra burden of taxation will fall on the business community, so it is no surprise that the Government are beginning to lose business support. Their honeymoon with business is now over, and they should not be surprised about that. They have decided, for various reasons, that the proposal is appropriate as part of their drive for fair taxes, and they must pay the cost and accept the consequences.

<P>
The language that the Government have used has caused offence to people in the information technology sector. The expression ``disguised employment'' suggests to many people cheating of some sort, or inappropriate behaviour; the phrase has caused offence.

<P>
We have already debated the matter at some length. I do not quarrel with the Paymaster General about the fact that there has been some abuse. However, the proposal is the wrong approach to take to tackle that abuse; it is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It demonstrates a lack of vision and a failure to recognise that the world is changing and that the way in which companies do business has moved on. Before the Committee started this morning, I was discussing with colleagues the extent to which business has changed-how, for example, work is e-mailed to Bombay from the City overnight, turned around by the cheap labour available there and sent back. When people ring to make a booking on British Airways, they speak not to someone at Heathrow but, more often than not, to someone with a Scottish accent, in Scotland. Location is becoming increasingly less important: the people who do much of the work might, if penal levels of taxation continue, be driven offshore to offer advice from outside British tax jurisdiction, and there is no question that the firms in Bombay doing the overnight work will also be affected.

<P>
The Paymaster General has said in the past, when we debated the matter on the Floor of the House-

<P>

<B>Mr. Michael Clapham </B>(Barnsley, West and Penistone): When a person orders a ticket from BA, the information is translated electronically to Bombay, where the ticket is printed. The people who do such work in Bombay work for an employer and are paid as employees. They have been able to win the contract from BA, so the change that IR35 will effect should not impede British companies from being just as competitive as the people in Bombay.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I agree. In fact, I gave two separate examples-BA in Scotland, and overnight typing for the City in Bombay. However, the same point applies: it is a competitive world. The hon. Gentleman says that the people in Bombay are employees. I do not know whether schedules D and E apply in India, or about employed and self-employed status in the Indian labour market; my point is that we live in a competitive world, in which new patterns of labour and new methods of raising revenue are emerging. I do not argue about money having to be raised in some way to pay for public services, but the measure will discourage entrepreneurial activity in this country and could drive it offshore.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford </B>(Colne Valley): The hon. Gentleman says that the measure could drive business offshore. Can he give examples of places where he thinks that people will go? The majority of countries have introduced similar measures, so the competitive element means that we are dealing with a level playing field.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> That is the point that I was coming to before I took the intervention from the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham). Australia has recently abandoned IR35. During the clause 59 stand part debate on the Floor of the House, the Paymaster General suggested that the United States, where many computer consultants are likely to head, was not as attractive to them as I had thought. It would have been helpful if she had pointed out that the Independent Contractor Simplification and Relief Act of 1999, now going through Congress, effectively abandons IR35. She has relied on the USA's having such a policy. That is a good example of the way in which the Government have put their toe in the water, tried to see whether they can make the policy work, and decided that it is not working. It comes as no surprise to discover that the US Government are also passing legislation in tandem with that Act that allows for the fast-tracking of 200,000 high-tech worker immigrants into the US, to make up for their shortfall of IT workers. There is a similar shortage in this country. It would be counterproductive to drive such workers offshore, which is why Australia abandoned the policy and why the United States is doing so.
 
<P>
I alluded to another discouraging factor that keeps rigidities in the market in connection with amendments Nos. 17 and 18, which were discussed on a point of order. The Paymaster General suggested on the Floor of the House that people who were self-employed, or subject to IR35 and directly employed, would be in the same position for the purposes of benefits. In an intervention, I drew attention to the IR35 website-on which I congratulate her, as it is a mine of information for the Opposition.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Whoops!

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I mean that genuinely; it is a constructive site. For example, its question 38 asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If I work through my own service company on `relevant' engagements will my client have to provide me with employment rights such as sick pay, holiday pay etc?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer is no, so people are not in the same position. Question 39 asks:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If I work through my own service company on relevant engagements will I be entitled to employment benefit?<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The answer, to paraphrase, is no. A set of proposals is being introduced that will hit the self-employed so that they pay their national insurance contributions but do not receive the benefits that they would receive if they were directly employed.

<P>
<B>Mr. Roger Casale </B>(Wimbledon): I understand the hon. Gentleman's line of argument. It is necessary to give careful consideration to the Bill's impact. Like many hon. Members, I have received several representations from software experts in my constituency, many of whom I have met. Few of them object strongly to the measure in principle, but they do question how it will work in practice. A problem of abuse exists, and the hon. Gentleman does not seem to object in principle to the main thrust of the proposed legislation. Does he recognise the problem that IR35 is intended to solve? If he does not like the proposed solution, what alternative would he suggest?

<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I said a few minutes ago that I recognise that abuse exists. However, the Opposition believe that IR35 is the wrong approach to take to tackle it. We object to it in principle, as we object to the broad thrust. We shall let the hon. Gentleman know in due course what we would suggest in its place. [Laughter.] If the Paymaster General were to make her vast army of excellent civil servants available to me to advise me on the market, and provide me with the necessary data, I could work out a suitable solution. When the Conservative party wins the next election we shall give serious consideration to the matter. We shall have had at least a year to see how the measure is working, and we shall implement fundamental reform as appropriate. Such reform will stimulate entrepreneurial activity, not dampen it, as has occurred.

<P>
<B>Dr. Nick Palmer </B>(Broxtowe): Is the hon. Gentleman saying that, prior to the next election, the Conservative party will make no statement on what change it would wish to introduce?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I am saying that we shall give the matter close consideration and implement whatever reform we regard as appropriate.

<P>
I have been slightly blown off course.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am taking note of it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I shall return to the issue of flexibility, which is at the heart of the amendment.

<P>
The proposal is a bureaucratic nightmare. A double hit will be necessary-if people have any doubts, they will have to send in their contracts to ascertain whether they are subject to schedule D or schedule E, and a subsequent assessment will have to be made when tax returns are filled in. In many cases, therefore, the Revenue will have to deal with people twice. Individuals will not find it simple to assess whether they fall under schedule D or schedule E-the explanatory notes to this schedule alone constitute a substantial wodge. People who are trying to manufacture widgets do not have time to examine contracts and weigh up whether they are subject to schedule D or schedule E. Many such decisions will be taken on the basis of case law and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde pointed out, many will relate to social security case law. There is no way that individuals will be able to do that; they will have to rely on professionals.

<P>
I would guess that there will be an early test case as to what is a contract. All the tests to enable people to decide what is a relevant contract will relate to substitution. Can one worker be substituted for another worker? Is the person working for a fixed fee, no matter how long the project takes? Can help be hired? Is equipment provided? Such issues will have to be reassessed individually in the light of the measure. The letter that I read out to the Committee a few minutes ago was referring not to the 60,000 workers to which the Minister alluded, but the 300,000 people whose contracts will be affected by the provision. It will be a bureaucratic nightmare of monstrous proportions.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I am fascinated by the problem of how to identify whether someone is an employee, an employer or self-employed. I do not understand how someone with the intelligence of the sort of person that the hon. Gentleman is describing would have a bigger problem than, say, my brother who is a builder and subcontracts work to other people, takes on people at certain times but not at others, and continually has to redefine contracts. Why would such a task be more difficult for those described by the hon. Gentleman than it would be for my brother?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I suggest that the hon. Lady asks her brother. [Laughter.] Does he think that he will fall under schedule 12? [
Interruption.] I challenge the hon. Lady to go through the explanatory notes in the next couple of minutes and to give the Committee an explanation of the workings of IR35. If she can do that, so can her brother.

<P>
The market will adapt. Although she cannot say so, I am sure that that is exactly what the Minister hopes will happen. The Government want people to switch from self-employed status to employed status. That will simplify matters. Bureaucratic nightmares will not arise. However, the market will not be as accommodating as the Minister hopes. People will go through the tests of substitution, risk and hiring help and amend their contracts. In fact, many consultants and their clients are about to include a substitution clause in their contracts, which would enable them to avoid being affected by schedule 12. As a result, the Government will not receive the revenue for which they hope.

<P>
The Department for Education and Employment has introduced a work permit arrangement. Its press release states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The processing time for work permit renewals is to be slashed by up to three months following the introduction of the renewal system<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and it says that there will be a
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>fast-track work permit route for employers in recognised shortage sectors.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It will take more than a fast-track route to attract the input of IT workers that the Government want. Let us suppose that they did enter the country. That would represent much taxation for the Government and offset much of the revenue that they would lose if they accepted the amendments. The press release continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are listening to the needs of employers, and we are giving them what they need.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Industry wants a simple system that it can understand and implement satisfactorily. It comes as no surprise that the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce is making representations behind the scenes and expressing her concern about the measure. The e-commerce tsar is also reported to have expressed reservations about its effectiveness. The Government will not raise the revenue that they hope to raise. If they were not introducing IR35, they would get more revenue from immigrant IT workers. They are not encouraging entrepreneurial activity or flexibility in the markets but destroying them.

<P>

<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The amendments seem to probe the scope of the legislation. It is true that we must consider in more detail the question of whom the legislation will affect. However, the line that the hon. Gentleman has taken has been disappointingly general; he has used a broad-brush approach rather than considering specific cases. Will he give one or two such cases and tell the Committee when he thinks that people should be affected by the legislation and when they should fall outside its scope? Will he tell us why the scope should be changed? Unless he talks about specific cases, he will not illuminate the debate any more than he has done up to now.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I read out in detail the case of someone affected by the legislation and have not read more only because time is limited. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if we are still discussing these matters after lunch, I will bring the huge case of letters that I have been sent. I suspect that people listening to the debate may react to his intervention by bombarding me with further evidence. I suggest that he has a look at the No. 10 website during the lunch break, where he may find a lot of evidence, although much of it has recently been wiped off.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> I accept the evidence given on the No. 10 website and that a number of cases fall outside the scope. That is why we are having the debate. However, will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee about the cases that he feels should be affected by the new legislation? Does he think that no one should be affected? Does he agree that someone who works exclusively for one employer for a long time should be affected? He has mentioned who should fall outside the legislation, but who should fall within it?

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. We agree that there has been abuse. When the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, was asked to define an elephant, he said that he could not do so but that he would be able to identify an elephant if he was shown one. It is difficult to define a negative, but we in the Conservative party believe that people who work for a service company should not fall foul of the legislation. That legislation means that people who perform through intermediaries are subject to schedule E; my argument is an attempt to explain our disagreement with that. If he wants more examples, I will give them to him-he may look at my files afterwards if he wants to.

<P>
The final point that I want to make is about the erosion of competitiveness. The Paymaster General will have had the chance to consider the Institute of Chartered Accountants' report, ``Towards a Better Tax System'', to which I will return during the stand part debate. That report takes IR35 as an example, applies to it 10 tests for good tax law and gives it a loud raspberry and a thumbs down. The report's tenth test considers whether IR35 encourages competitiveness, and states that it
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>is ironic that as the Prime Minister espouses the Internet and seeks to promote its use, his party is implementing a mighty blow to many industries working in this field, such as those in the Information Technology sector, with these new rules.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Marks out of ten: 0.<P>

<P>
The Institute of Chartered Accountants is not a fly-by-night organisation but the nation's premier body dealing with such issues, which needs no great brain power to evaluate such a measure and conclude that it will ruin Britain's competitive position. For all those reasons, I hope that the Paymaster General will say that she will reconsider the amendments.

<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 deal with two specific examples and relate to the point that the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) made a few moments ago. The schedule relates to a worker who uses a service company defined as an intermediary in a contractual relationship with a client. Amendment No. 12 relates to a worker who works for several different clients. The example that I gave on the Floor of the House was of a musician who might, for example, participate in a recording session for a record company in the morning, appear at a lunchtime concert with a group of friends, rehearse in the afternoon for a concert scheduled for the following week, and perform in the evening under her main contract for her main orchestra. Those four different contracts would involve several different employers, but they would all fail the current legal test for schedules D and E. It is not possible to substitute a musician in an orchestra-or, at least, it might be possible, but the same musician could not be found. No risk is involved on fixed fee. There is no question of hiring help. Musicians supply their own equipment-although I understand that orchestras do, too. In such circumstances, as is proposed in amendment No. 12, schedule 12 should not apply.

<P>
Amendment No. 12 deals with circumstances involving an agency between the intermediary and the client. A client-such as BT-that needs a clutch of IT consultants does not ring individual consultants but uses an agency and contracts with the agency for the provision of consultants, whom the agency finds. The chain therefore has an extra contractual link, and will lead to a myriad of problems in implementing schedule 12. I hope that the Paymaster General will give favourable consideration to that point.

<P>
The proposals are muddled and breach the Government's manifesto commitments. They will create a bureaucratic nightmare. They will erode competitiveness and could lead to a brain drain, on which I have not dwelt, and they will not raise the revenue that the Government expect. I hope that the Paymaster General will say that she has had a few further thoughts since she last discussed the issue and will comfort the Committee.

<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before the debate continues, I should alert the Committee in general and the mover of the amendment in particular of my intention. The hon. Gentleman mentioned his intention to refer to ``Towards a Better Tax System'' in the clause stand part debate. I hope that the Committee will agree that I have been very tolerant in allowing the debate to go much wider than the amendments. I have done so deliberately, because of the direction in which the debate was going, but if the debate continues to range as widely as it has, I shall be disinclined to permit a clause stand part debate, because I shall consider it to have already taken place. With that in mind, let us hear the future comments of this sitting.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I was dismayed to hear that you were engaged in rather masochistic parliamentary duties during the recess, Mr. Cook. I hope that in returning to the Chair you will enjoy a break from those arduous tasks, as you are enjoying our deliberations so much-although your body language suggests otherwise. Perhaps if I stick to the amendments and am not drawn into a clause stand part debate, you will look on me more favourably.

<P>
The group of amendments deals with paragraph 1 of schedule 12 in which the Government propose vague definitions of to whom the provisions will apply. Presumably, they are trying to meet the objectives set out by the Chancellor when he first announced IR35. However, in his Budget speech in March 1999, the right hon. Gentleman did not refer to IT workers, oil contractors or engineers, but to those who left work on a Friday and returned to work at the same company on the Monday, but through a personal service company. That was the abuse to which the Chancellor referred and how he justified the introduction of IR35. If the measure hit that target, people inside and outside the House would not be worried because it would be a focused anti-avoidance piece of legislation. If paragraph 1 had concentrated on such types of avoidance, our debate would have been short.

<P>
However, as the hon. Member for Croydon, South said, the provision is similar to the action of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. So many people will be caught by the Bill who would not otherwise fall into the category of what the Chancellor described as Friday afternoon, Monday morning tax avoiders. The provision has caused a great furore because it is hitting people who go about legitimate business creating wealth for our economy and helping the country compete in a key industry for the future. It is no wonder that people are so annoyed.

<P>
When considering the commercial realities of contracts, we can understand that annoyance. The provisions are not targeting Friday afternoon, Monday morning people-those who have had a long relationship with a particular company and who are continuing that relationship under a different contractual arrangement-but are returning to the old self-employed or employed tests. Some people may say that that is a welcome development, but it fails to recognise the way in which the economy and the market have changed. When individual contractors are trying to win contracts with, say, the IT industry, the construction industry, the engineering industry or the oil industry, the people who are giving those contracts require the individuals to belong to personal service companies or operate via an agency that requires people to belong to personal service companies. Market pressures will force people into that type of commercial structure.

<P>
It could be argued that the contracts that large companies, government organisations or agencies give to subcontractors who operate through personal service companies should make it clear that the relationship is a self-employment relationship. However, those who are issuing contracts to the personal service companies, be they agencies, government organisations or large companies with IT projects, are producing standard contracts. Such contracts do not necessarily reflect the real relationship between the contractor and the contract giver, but force contractors into an employment status.

<P>
Thousands of people who regard themselves as self-employed, and whose genuine commercial relationship is that of self-employment, are being forced, by market pressures, to sign contracts that suggest a different relationship. People are annoyed not because they are opposed to the Government cracking down on tax avoidance, but because the Government do not realise the commercial reality of large companies and institutions, including government organisations. People who are to all intents and purposes self-employed will be deemed by the Revenue to have employed status because of the contracts that they must sign. That is the crux of the problem, which is why paragraph 1 of the schedule is inadequate. If the Government wanted to crack down on tax avoidance, they should have targeted the abuse rather than the wider group of people, who are crucial to this country's future.

<P>
Despite a long debate on the matter, the Government's stance has not changed, which is even more worrying. Many of the large IT companies that bid for the contracts, along with large engineering and oil companies, will not be affected. Those companies were worried about competition from smaller companies-whether personal service companies, the small contractor or the one-man band-and therefore support the proposed legislation. The measure will ensure that those small businesses that are nipping at their heels, driving down prices and promoting competition, cannot compete with the large players. It is anti-competitive, and anti small business, in a key and growing part of the economy, in which small business and innovators are needed. That is why the measure is so damaging. The sectors that will be hit by the legislation are those that need small business more than any others. They are the most innovative sectors, which will ensure that Britain remains at the leading edge of technology, whether in the oil industry or the IT industry.

<P>
The Government, with their narrow legislative focus, may be satisfied that those who are genuinely self-employed will not be caught. However, they fail to see that those who perceive themselves as self-employed, and who do not have the benefits of being employed, are being forced into contracts that give them employed status. Those people have no choice but to accept such contracts, because they are the only kind that large companies will provide. I shall illustrate that with an example of someone from my constituency-Richard John Hider, of 20, Meadow way, Chessington, who is an engineer. He does not earn a large salary, and his business is not large; it is just him. He has done a great deal of work on the channel tunnel. In order to win work, he has to go through an agency, because the channel tunnel builders use agencies-two or three of them-to employ their contractors. Anyone who wants to gain a contract to work on the project has to use an agency; they have no choice. Those agencies will only provide standard contracts, so those who sign them will be deemed to be employed under this schedule. Because of the proposed legislation, my constituent will lose upwards of £10,000-

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the hon. Gentleman therefore tell us how much his constituent currently earns, and what level of tax he currently pays? That will allow us to judge the statement that he is expected to pay £10,000 more.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The Paymaster General will not be surprised at the fact that I do not have those figures with me. She should not be asking questions about divulging tax affairs in Committee and in Hansard.

<P>
<B>Mr. John Burnett </B>(Torridge and West Devon): Does my hon. Friend agree that it is outrageous that individuals have made contracts on an existing tax basis, yet there are no transitional provisions in respect of existing contracts? People's budgets will be thrown askew.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> My hon. Friend makes a pertinent point on which I am sure that he will elaborate later.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Would the hon. Gentleman like to strike from the record the name and address of his constituent, and the amount of tax that he says that he will have to pay as a result of the provision? The hon. Gentleman is clearly divulging confidential information.

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I divulged what my constituent has allowed me to divulge. I cannot divulge what he has not asked me to divulge, as the Paymaster General ought to recognise.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the cheap debating trick that we have seen perpetrated by the Paymaster General suggests either that she has read none of the representations that have been sent by thousands of taxpayers, or that, in our own way, we are respecting the privacy of individuals, because that information has already been sent to her?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The right hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The hon. Member for Wimbledon (Mr. Casale) talked about the correspondence on the Downing Street website, so the Paymaster General should be aware of the tax increases that people face.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I may be able to give a simplistic answer to the Paymaster General's question. She and the hon. Gentleman will know that the Red Book says that the cost will be £900 million in the first year and £450 million thereafter. According to the Inland Revenue, 60,000 people will be affected. That can be worked out with simple mathematics at £15,000 a person in the first year and £7,500 a year thereafter.

<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I cannot check his mental arithmetic now, but I am sure that it is spot on as usual.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> The hon. Gentleman has quoted a taxation figure that most of my constituents would find high for an individual. They would wonder why someone whose earnings were such that he or she could pay that much tax should not do so. They are required to pay the appropriate tax on the jobs that they do to earn a living. Why should people have dividends and avoid their tax?

<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> When Labour Members read the report of our proceedings, they will find that I said up to £10,000. [Hon. Members: ``Ah.''] If Labour Members listen to the point, they will not be so pleased with themselves.

<P>
The reason that I say up to £10,000 is because many such people's businesses have peaks and troughs. My constituent is involved in the construction industry, which is well known for its cyclical nature. Construction businesses have to take risks. In most recent years, the extra tax that my constituent would have had to pay would have been far less than £10,000. Ten thousand pounds would be the figure for a bumper year, but such years are crucial to people to stay in business and ensure, over the years, that their employment decently remunerates them and their families and covers their pensions.

<P>
Government Members seem to misunderstand the nature of such people. They are entrepreneurs and risk takers. Their earnings from contracts are bound to ebb and flow.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Was my hon. Friend surprised to hear a second intervention from the hon. Member for Colne Valley, and that she referred to builders and people with low earnings? One of the most unfortunate effects of recent taxation is that under this Government low-earning builders, or builders with low profits, must cede cash through a withholding tax, and are the least able to afford it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Colne Valley will speak to her brother after today's proceedings to find out whether he is happy with the tax measures that the Government have introduced. I doubt that he is.

<P>
I stray from the amendments. I shall finish by citing another example of the commercial reality of how the employment tests will work, which involves not a constituent but someone from East Sussex, who wrote to me following the debate on clause 59 on the Floor of the House, having read our proceedings in Hansard. Having seen an invitation in the newspapers to bid for a contract with a large IT company, he inquired about the bidding arrangements, which involved a security check for which a fixed cost was payable. The IT company told him, rightly or wrongly, that, as the company would not be paying for the check, it might be seen by the Inland Revenue as ensuring that the relationship constituted employment, because the risk and the security check was being taken by the large IT company. That is another practical example of how the tests that the Government say will apply to such contracts will ultimately disadvantage tens of thousands of our constituents.

<P>
Before the Government came to power, they argued that they would be the party of small business and competition. If they push through the Bill in its current form, the reverse will be true.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> It is evident from the stance that the Paymaster General has taken to date that the Government have decided to proceed with the proposals. The debate on the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, in which he sagely observed that the starting point of the process was not fundamentally to change the boundaries between employment and self-employment, was a good point from which to step off.

<P>
I had thought that the Paymaster General might ask me what I would have done if I had been in her place. As Financial Secretary, I confronted a similar problem to that of IR35. In dealing with tax matters, we must be honest enough to answer the question of what we would have done. My sphere of activity related to that of the hon. Member for Colne Valley-dealing with contractors in the building industry-but we could tell much more straightforwardly what was going on. Employees of companies were invited on a Friday by the employer to attend on Monday to do the same job in the same circumstances for the same pay in the same place, but when they turned up they were to adopt the label ``self-employed''. It was very much a black-and-white case that if Mr. X was a painter, for example, and got halfway round the room on Friday and came back on Monday, with paintbrush in hand and materials, paintbrush and room provided by an employer, he was doing the same job as the one that he did on Friday although he had decided to be self-employed. That was a proper area for the Inland Revenue to investigate.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> For the sake of clarification, the right hon. Gentleman is talking about the construction industry scheme on which he worked before he left government, which was designed to deal with the problem of lump labour in the construction industry. My understanding of what he said at the time is that the scheme came out of case law and the question of whether people were truly employed, and not out of the Friday to Monday situation that he has mentioned. Will he clarify for the Committee that he did not say anything at the time about Friday to Monday-just as the Government are not saying anything of that sort now?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I hoped that I would not have to go into that matter-but I will. In the course of my remarks I shall be considering several cases in connection with IR35. The House and those affected by IR35 deserve to have on record the background detail of exactly how the Inland Revenue cobbled together its position. I am intrigued by a statement in one of the Revenue's own publications, to be found on its IR35 website, to the effect that there is no statutory definition of employment.

<P>
The Paymaster General is right that some of the definitional aspects of the matter are based on established case law. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South said that we should hold the Government to their originally stated intention not to change the boundary between self-employment and employment. I want to explore in detail the difficulties that the Government will get into when the proposals become reality.

<P>
As for the question of definition, it is clear that there have been abuses, of which I gave one example. I have discussed that issue with people in the building industry, from a company that will remain nameless because I do not want people from the Revenue to visit it. People in that company told me explicitly that they encouraged their employees to take up those opportunities. The hon. Member for Colne Valley is nodding, so we now know that her brother is in the same category. That is the type of body language that people from the Revenue love, and they will soon visit her brother and question him.

<P>
I do not want to get too sidetracked on to the subject of the construction industry scheme, but it serves to show that there were obvious and deliberate cases of employers telling employees to call back on Monday morning under a different status. As my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South and the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) said, the people with whom we are dealing are in a different league. I have been impressed, in the nicest sense, with the ordinariness of the people who are affected by IR35. We are not, as the hon. Member for Colne Valley has insinuated, dealing with fatcat employees who are earning £100,000 a year and paying virtually no tax. My constituent Mr. Shearer is a very interesting man.

<P>

<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The footballing Mr. Shearer?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> No, not that Mr. Shearer but the lesser-known one, who is a self-employed consultant in the IT field. He is interesting because he and I differ politically on almost every subject. He bombards me with good letters about the work of Amnesty International and human rights, and on those subjects I have sympathy with him. However, I would not count him a supporter on other topics, and I was surprised when he turned up and told me that he was affected by IR35. I hope that I am not about to impugn his reputation, given that his politics are more in line with those of the Paymaster General than mine. Mr. Shearer said, ``I get about £30,000 a year. I take all the risks in my business. I provide my own training, holiday pay, sickness and pension contributions and my own equipment.'' The Paymaster General asked how much someone would lose under the proposals. I can say that Mr. Shearer would lose about 10 per cent. of his present modest income. Those individuals who came from all over the country to a meeting in my constituency to discuss the matter were ordinary in every sense of the word. They work in a new type of industry. The Government's entire legislative approach has not picked up that the old master-servant relationship does not apply in the world of information technology.

<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>

<P>
Rullion, which is one of the seven companies that recruit IT specialists for the Benefits Agency, has also discussed the matter with me. Those specialists enable the ebbs and flows of the agency's work to be undertaken smoothly and effectively on behalf of the Government. Self-employed contractors can be employed for periods to be part of a team to carry out particular tasks under the direction of the Benefits Agency and can then be moved to other employers in my constituency, such as BAe Systems. The employment of such people in the aerospace industry has given it new competitiveness and flexibility, so why do they feel threatened by the proposals?

<P>
Good tax law should provide taxpayers with certainty about where they stand. Where is the certainty in the proposals? People can e-mail their contracts to the Revenue to receive pre-legislative scrutiny, a process that is rejected throughout the rest of the tax system. There can be a backwards and forward process with the Revenue, however, in such matters in which people can ask, ``Am I or am I not self-employed?'' When considering the nitty-gritty of certain cases, it is interesting to note that the Revenue has attempted to redefine the boundaries of the definitions of employment. It has created its own three worked examples in an attempt to add clarity to the matter. It is intriguing that, in the preamble to those examples, reference is made to several court cases that I cited earlier in support of the point of order of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South.

<P>
The Revenue's position in determining whether a person is self-employed or employed is based on its selective interpretation of a series of court cases. I shall respond to the challenge issued by the Paymaster General. In its website, Ascot Drummond has summarised about 10 individual cases on employment law. They make interesting reading. The 1997 case of McManus v. Griffiths in the High Court was one in which the Inland Revenue argued that the taxpayer should be treated as self-employed despite his wanting to be treated as an employee-the reverse case of IR35. The Revenue's arguments prevailed, although the taxpayer in question provided no premises or plant to undertake the work. Will the Paymaster General-in her quest for detail-give us the reasons why the Inland Revenue embarked on an exercise to convert someone who wanted to be an employee into a self-employed person?

<P>
<B>Mr. Clapham:</B> Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether the person concerned-even though he did not provide any plant-was under the control and direction of the client, and therefore an employee?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, as I will deal with the matter in relation to examples that the Revenue has given. [
Interruption.] I am asking questions because there are people whose livelihoods depend on knowing where they stand. That is the minefield into which the proposed legislation is rapidly moving.

<P>
The hon. Gentleman's question is perfectly valid, and I would not want to denigrate it. It is a pity that he will not make a speech himself, although perhaps he will. I want to know the characteristics of the case. The hon. Gentleman's point may be the one that drove the Revenue to its intriguing reversal of the employee's status: no doubt the Paymaster General will enlighten us.

<P>
On the 1996 case of Brabyn-

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will enlighten the Committee on the matter. If my memory serves me right, he was Financial Secretary at the time, and therefore had responsibility for the Inland Revenue.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The Paymaster General must stop resorting to cheap debating points. If she wants a lesson in taxpayer's confidentiality, she will know that the Inland Revenue would not discuss with Ministers the detail of particular cases. If she asks the Revenue to supply details of the transfer pricing case involving the Glaxo company, and the way in which the Inland Revenue dealt with it in the first instance, she will immediately understand the reluctance of the Revenue to discuss individual companies in the context of court cases.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I just want to finish the point, because the Paymaster General is making cheap debating jibes. There is a serious reason for my concern. People want to know where they stand. When the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien) was an Opposition Treasury spokesman, he was fond of pointing out, in debate after debate, the importance of Pepper v. Hart. That has seared into my memory the fact that what we say in this Committee Room can be taken down and used in evidence. It is important that the Paymaster General tells us about the relevant cases.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman is usually a pleasant debater, and does not generally stoop to insults. I was not, as he perhaps inadvertently suggested, making a cheap debating point, although I admit that I am capable of doing so. He was quoting case law in relation to action taken when he was Financial Secretary, and he called on me to provide an explanation of why that happened. I merely suggested that, as he was Financial Secretary at the time, he could provide the explanation. That is not a cheap debating point, although I dare say that his question might have been.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> I do not want to fall out with the Paymaster General, because she is an equally pleasant person. When I was a Minister and she was in opposition we always had cordial relations of an appropriate and proper nature. I cannot directly answer her question because IR35 was not a relevant issue when I was a Minister, and I did not receive a request from the Revenue to act in that area. That mirrors the Revenue's assessment in 1981. My hon. Friend the member for Croydon, South was probed about the reasons why the matter was dismissed before, and it was because the Ministers and Revenue officials involved realised that it was all too complicated and that some of the definitional problems that, as the court cases suggest, the Government now face would beset them.

<P>
In the 1996 High Court case of Brabyn v. Barnett, the Inland Revenue identified three overwhelming factors in favour of self-employment-the original intention to have a self-employed relationship, the fact that the worker had an element of flexibility in the hours that he worked, and the cogent factor that the Inland Revenue had determined his tax assessment in previous years on a self-employed basis. The Inland Revenue won the case, which was an interesting one because it involved a worker who the Inland Revenue argued was self-employed but who wanted to be treated as an employee. Such cases illustrate the employment law minefield into which the Government are heading.

<P>
The 1983 Swan Hellenic High Court case underlines the importance of the intentions of the party involved and significantly plays down the so-called control test. As Mr. Justice McCullough explained, the High Court judged that even people who are subject to considerable control can none the less be independent contractors. If such cases continue to arise and seem to challenge the very foundations of the Government's approach to IR35, that will illustrate, like the three examples that I cited, the fact that people are going to indulge in appeals to commissioners and prosecute court cases, among other procedures. We shall face a legislative minefield, and for what reason? We are not dealing with a group of people who do not want to pay tax. All the people whom I have mentioned want to pay tax and appropriate national insurance contributions. They recognise that it is in the nature of their business, because they choose as individuals to exercise flexibility in the contracts that they accept and the companies for which they work, that, like actors, sometimes they will be engaged and sometimes they will be resting. That is the risk that they take.

<P>
<B>Mr. Casale:</B> The right hon. Gentleman has detailed several interesting individual cases. If those cases had come to any one of our advice surgeries, I am sure that we would have given them equal time and taken equal interest. However, without having the details, it is difficult for members of the Committee to comment on them. To help proceedings, we need to hear details of not individual cases but categories of cases that will or should be affected by the Bill and about other categories that the right hon. Gentleman feels should not be affected and should be outside the scope of the Bill, rather than merely hearing about individual cases, important though they are, that have come through his surgery.

<P>
The right hon. Gentleman referred earlier to regulation of the building trade. Is the main thrust of his argument that a case can be made for regulating business, for example, but not information technology? Or is he saying that the industry should be regulated? If so, which categories of cases should be affected by the Bill?

<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The cases to which I referred were taken not from my surgery but from the courts of the United Kingdom, and my citing them follows precisely the same route as the Inland Revenue on its website in its advice on IR35. It has selectively taken cases to pray in aid of its position in changing the boundaries of employment law. Under the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South there would be no change; it would retain the status quo. It suggests that we should not alter the boundary. In the judgment of those who will be affected by the Bill, the Government have changed those boundaries. I am merely reversing the roles and asking the Government to comment on those germane cases. The Government may have read about those cases, but all that they say is that the Inland Revenue has interpreted the results of those cases in certain ways, which are reflected in the advice on the Inland Revenue's website. We shall see more challenges in the courts on such matters.

<P>
On the construction industry, I decided to do the right and proper thing when I started speaking, which was to deal with that issue straight away. I spoke to people in the industry and was convinced that there had been a ganging up between employer and employee to find a way that was cheaper for one and better for the other. That conspiracy persuaded many to take the Friday to Monday option, which I could see was not genuine self-employment.

<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>

<P>
I can understand that the small, jobbing tradesperson, who is responsible for finding his business, materials and perhaps for small designs, takes risks. The people that I defined in my remarks were not risk takers in the context of the construction industry. The document quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South, ``Towards a Better Tax System'', deals with the matter, so I shall choose some neutral ground to tackle the remarks made by the hon. Member for Wimbledon. On page 54, commenting on IR35, it states that

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Such broadly targeted legislation often leads to anomalous situations. In this instance, one such example is how the provisions will affect those in the building industry. Sub-contractors are governed by the rules of the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) which came into effect last year. Under CIS one can take into account costs of materials when determining the tax due.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It goes on to explain why some policies will work and some will not. That is why I pray in aid expert opinion to reinforce my remarks.

<P>
<B>Kali Mountford:</B> I can understand the right hon. Gentleman's point about the definition between employment and self-employment, but I do not understand why he would find acceptable a quasi-situation in which someone is neither and so does not pay an appropriate tax at either level.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The words ``pay an appropriate tax'' suggest a most interesting concept. What is the hon. Lady's definition of appropriate tax? Some of the people who have come to see me having been affected by the proposal have pointed out that the facility to take part of one's emoluments via a dividend or something that is not a straightforward salary payment is also available in a corner shop. I do not see the Government rushing to the barricades to attack the owners of corner shops, who may use the same mechanism.

<P>
The second matter not dealt with in the hon. Lady's remark was that those with personal service companies choose to reward themselves-I emphasise the word choose-because the Government have changed the operation of corporation tax to make it more attractive. Suddenly, they have drawn people into thinking that it is a good way in which to go. However, it is unfair to attack people who choose a specific way in which to conduct their employment, and we do not know what the bottom line is. How much do people have left at the end of the day? What is the cost of the risks that they take?

<P>
Some of the people who have come to see me are not in continuous employment. They have costs associated with all the factors that I mentioned earlier. The hon. Lady talks about paying the appropriate tax, but the bottom line is more important. We ought to be considering how people choose to work in this context.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that it would be fair to remind the Committee that personal service companies pay corporation tax and a tax on dividends when they are distributed to individuals, if that is the way in which individuals choose to take their income? Does he agree that, if an individual receives a distribution from a personal service company, he or she will not receive the schedule E benefits that other individuals will obtain?

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> The hon. Gentleman makes a telling and important point. I am grateful to him for adding to my comments. We are getting into a minefield of difficulty. I looked at the internet for further examples of the employment law difficulties that the Paymaster General will run into, and the website, ``Accounting Web'' makes fascinating reading. The hon. Lady was involved in an internet exercise in which she put out her own billet doux on the register, and urged:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Contractors: cast aside your IR35 fears.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<B>Mr. Keith Simpson:</B> The Paymaster General knows something about it.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> My hon. Friend is right. The entry from Fiona Carroll on 21 May at 1513 hour is directly relevant to our proceedings. It concerned IR175, which is a booklet issued by the Inland Revenue to explain employment issues. She headed her contribution:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Being economical with the facts<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
and said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I work as a lecturer in Further Education. I am hourly paid, I work on the clients premises with the clients equipment. I take no financial risk, have no other clients and I have to do the work personally. I do not have a service company. However the Inland Revenue and the courts consider me and thousands of my colleagues as self-employed!<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What is happening when people say that IR35 and the employment definitions under schedule 12 are trying to define such people as employed, but the Inland Revenue is saying that they are self-employed? Where are we going? The Paymaster General must shed some light on the matter.

<P>
The Inland Revenue has given some examples on its own site. The dilemma is summed up by example 3, the case of Charlotte the IT consultant. I am sure that other members of the Committee are familiar with the intense detail of the case, so I shall not read it all out. It illustrates the difficulty in defining matters. At one stage, the Inland Revenue said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>She has a variety of clients and all her contracts have been fairly short term.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Yet in other examples, the Inland Revenue refer to time scale and engagement. In one example, it put a time scale on it. In another, it did not. It takes an entire page to adjudicate on Charlotte's situation. The situation is difficult and finely balanced. One of the great drawbacks of the whole charade is the bureaucratic minefield into which the Inland Revenue has now allowed itself to be drawn by trying to adjudicate on all the contracts.

<P>
I have discussed such matters with 60 or 70 such people and I know them to be honest, straightforward, ordinary-in the nicest sense-and highly intelligent, skilled individuals who chose to ply their trade in the modern IT era, which is an era of flexibility and sometimes uncertainty but which has now been brought into sharp question by the Government's approach to IR35. My hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South was entirely right in his opening remarks to say that the Government should have stuck to their own advice and not tried to alter the balance. I understand why the Paymaster General finds such matters a seductive area for activity. Basically, it is a nice little earner, but the Government will rue the day when they walked into such a minefield.

<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I shall speak only briefly because my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South skilfully described the purpose behind the amendments, and his contribution was reinforced, to great effect, by that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde.

<P>
We understand that abuse can take place in any part of the tax system. We would never support that-we believe in taking anti-avoidance measures where appropriate. However, in trying to deal with this particular abuse, the Government have done massive collateral damage. We all know that people set up companies, from time to time, to receive earnings. The present Director-General of the BBC had a service company of that kind, although it did not seem to do him any harm. We read that the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) had a company that received some of his earnings, which did not seem to do him harm either. It is a familiar tax avoidance technique. However, by dealing with one problem, IR35 has created a much larger one.

<P>
The Government would have fared better if they had consulted on the policy at the outset. The Institute of Chartered Accountants' Budget submission complained about the tax changes. It also stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are  surprised about the stance on this issue taken at the outset not to discuss or consider the policy underlying the decision to introduce these proposals.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
If the Government had taken the professional bodies and the industry into their confidence earlier, and there had been discussion of what they intended to do and whether there was a genuine problem, a measure might have been designed that would stop the abuse without doing damage.

<P>
I cannot be the only Member who has received many letters from constituents who are affected. My right hon. and hon. Friends have referred to letters that they have received, and I shall refer to two more. The issue has been an effective recruiting sergeant for the Conservative party-people who were seduced into thinking that new Labour is on the side of the business have been given a rude shock. In his letter, Mr. Simon Bayliss complains that the measure appears to target not only the IT industry but the smaller company sector. He notes that companies such as Electronic Data Systems and Andersen Consulting are exempted, and mounts a general attack on the proposals. He says that the supposed extra revenue might never accrue, because of people returning to lower-paid jobs or moving abroad. He also complains about compliance costs, which he estimates will be far greater than the Inland Revenue has divulged.

<P>
The letter that I received from Mr. John Popham ends
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of your anxious constituents being ruined by ``New Labour''.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
He also makes the good point that many service companies are useful to older workers who might otherwise find it difficult to be taken on as employees. He estimates that the measures will force him to retire in April 2000; he will therefore already have done so. Those letters constitute only a fraction of the complaints that have been received.

<P>
I want to return to the issue of flexibility, which is dealt with by amendment No. 40. The Government have not understood how the so-called new economy operates. They often get their rhetoric right-they talk about new and emerging technologies and ways of working, and a breakdown in the old system whereby companies and Governments employed people rather than contracting out services-but they do not follow that through into policy. That is odd, given that they are constantly lecturing our neighbours in Europe about the need for a trained and flexible work force. They endlessly lecture other people about those virtues. The Prime Minister goes to the United States, where there is a much more dynamic economy in that respect; when he returns and considers the sclerotic employment and tax laws in the European Union, he goes over to the continent and tells our partners that they have to change. He says, ``We have no hope of making the single currency work unless we achieve a real wage-price flexibility.'' However, having said that, he converges with the EU model and goes further away from the United States system. The matter under discussion is a good example of that tendency.

<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
Service companies, or intermediaries as they are called in the schedule, provide an extremely effective means of achieving that flexibility. It suits companies to be able to take people on and then get rid of them when the project is complete. For instance, work in the field of IT does not come in an even flow. Larger companies are faced with big demands, such as the cost of installing new equipment or new software or retraining staff. They do not want to take on employees to do that job, with all the trouble and expense of getting rid of them. They prefer to bring in, without any obligation or comeback, companies that do the work and leave. The risks have to be shouldered by those smaller companies; when the project is over and they leave, they are not eligible for the full range of benefits for which an employee would be eligible. They are thrown back into the marketplace to seek new opportunities.

<P>
That situation suits the smaller companies providing the services, and the larger companies, and provides the flexibility of which the Government say that they are in favour, but which is clearly undermined by the proposals. The Government tried to address that issue in the Revenue press release issued on 23 September 1999, which was headed ``Preventing avoidance: preserving flexibility''. Reading it through, one sees that the central proposals are unaltered and that the damage will still be done to the economy.

<P>
The Government are lucky in that they inherited a strong economy with falling unemployment, and they seem to assume that that will go on for ever, just as the great American boom seems to, providing growth and employment in the anglo-saxon world. However, such booms are not permanent features of the economic scene and are eroded and undermined if the Government take wrong policy decisions, as they are doing in this case. The amendments, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South so ably spoke, go some way to correct that, and I urge them on the Committee.

<P>

<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> This has been a long debate, we have spent almost two hours on it, and have covered a vast area of ground, some directly relevant to the amendments and some less so. I will do my best to answer the many points made by hon. Members and to deal with the amendments before us. First I should set the scene, so that we have facts before us that can be substantiated, and so that people do not have to take my or anyone else's words.

<P>
There are 90,000 individuals working through service companies. Their average annual earnings are £50,000 and they pay, on average, 21 per cent. in tax and national insurance. Compared with someone who would be doing exactly the same job-

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> In a moment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> On that point.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> It is always best to hear the entire point first.

<P>
If we compare that with someone in an identical employment relationship in terms of where the work is carried out, how it is carried out and who supervises it but who is an employee, that person pays 35 per cent. tax and national insurance through pay-as-you-earn. The only difference between the two workers is the interposing of a service company, which adds nothing and does not change the terms and conditions or the nature of the work. The vast majority work on standard contract terms that clearly represent employment.

<P>
Before I make my next point, about the role of service companies-the argument has been advanced that the Government are trying to abolish service companies-I give way to the hon. Gentleman.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> I am grateful to the Paymaster General, who is patient and always polite. Does her 21 per cent. tax figure include the corporation tax paid by the personal service company?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The figure of 21 per cent. includes all tax liability, including that which the hon. Gentleman mentioned.

<P>
The amendments relate to whether the person is considered an employee or self-employed and whether the client or the service company employs him. From that flow the decisions taken here.

<P>
Before I give way to the hon. Member for Croydon, South, I refer to the Inland Revenue's work on how many service companies have an element of employee contracts as opposed to being straightforward self-employment, legitimate companies that fall outside IR35. So far, the Inland Revenue has been asked to examine 1,200 contracts to ascertain whether they involve employees or self-employed people. That is a reasonable sample. Of that sample, 53 per cent. were found to be within IR35, and 47 per cent. were found not to be within IR35, and would therefore not be caught by the current employment tests that work throughout the tax system. At no point this morning has anyone-nor did the Professional Contractors Group-explained why, of all the millions of employees who pay tax and national insurance and can determine whether they are self-employed or are employees, those in the IT industry are different.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South advanced some arguments that were supported by some of the points that the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton made about flexibility, competition, and how the market operates. Nothing in the proposals is designed to change or define employment status, to undermine flexibility or the use of service companies, or to cut across the question of competition. All that it seeks to ensure-a reasonable proposition, as I hope that the Committee will agree-is that a person in our tax system cannot choose his own definition of whether he is employed or self-employed. Case law determines that. If he is an employee and the only difference is that he seeks to interpose a service company to route money through, the definitions in case law mean that we will expect and require him to pay tax and national insurance in the same terms as though he were employed directly by the company. Really, he is employed directly by the company, as demonstrated by the terms and conditions.

<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> If the legislation does not affect competition, why does it specifically give preferential treatment to large partnerships as opposed to small ones?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is mistaken to assert that the Bill is advantageous to large companies and puts smaller ones at a disadvantage. In truth, large companies could not interpose a service company-there are tens of thousands of legitimate ones-between themselves and the employee when the only purpose of the service company is to reduce tax liability. It is not to change or influence the terms and conditions of that employment.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> I quoted an extract from ``Towards a Better Tax System'' in which the Institute of Chartered Accountants gave the proposal nought out of 10 for competitiveness. Why is the institute wrong?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The institute is wrong-obviously it can account for itself-because it agrees with us that there is avoidance, but it does not have a proposition to deal with it. It simply does not like the way in which we have proposed to do so. I was amused when the right hon. Member for Fylde went through his case law and quoted the case of Charlotte from the website. The right hon. Gentleman said it was misleading, yet that document was prepared with the help of those in the industry, and with co-operation and representation from chartered accountants' organisations and the Professional Contractors Association, which was set up only because it does not like the legislation.

<P>
We could trade across the Committee quotations that supported one advancing of the case against another. The right hon. Member for Fylde quoted from the ``Accounting Web'' website. To balance that and to show that there were counterviews, I shall quote from a debate that took place on that website on 18 April:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Personal service companies have always been a tax avoidance mechanism designed to use the veil of incorporation to<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
conceal
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>what is otherwise the sort of arrangement operated by any number of temping agencies.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It continues: ``You''-that is, service companies-
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>have every right to arrange your affairs so you pay as little tax as possible, but it's a bit rich to whinge when a loophole is closed.<P>
</UL></FONT>

<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
There are two important issues involved. Some of the information that is circulating about IR35-not from the Inland Revenue-has not been wholly accurate. Some has been a little misleading, to put it mildly. As a result, many people who operate service companies, and work legitimately through them, have been extremely concerned that they may be caught by the provision. That is not so. The figures that I gave earlier demonstrated that a significant proportion of service companies already operate as self-employed companies and IR35 will not therefore affect them. The idea that it will somehow damage flexibility is incorrect.

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> The Paymaster General said of the 21 per cent. tax paid that it includes the corporation tax that would also have been paid. That surprises me, because the cash coming into the company would, until the commencement of this tax year, have suffered corporation tax of 21 per cent. Is the Paymaster General saying that the distribution would have suffered tax at only 1 per centum?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The hon. Gentleman is mixing up several points with regard to tax liability. The situation that we are trying to deal with through IR35-although the hon. Member for Croydon, South said that some people do not like the suggestion-is disguised employment, whereby someone who has a contract and terms and conditions that reasonable people would see as employment by the client seeks to route payments through a company. In order to conceal the fact that that is all that we are trying to deal with, some people-I am not suggesting it of the hon. Member for Croydon, South-try to broaden the debate into a much wider debate about whether service companies can exist or are legitimate. Service companies can exist and are legitimate-it is the relationship with those service companies and their clients that we are trying to deal with.

<P>
The idea that our IT industry can make progress only by the presence of such a tax-driven arrangement does not bear scrutiny.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall in a moment.

<P>
It has repeatedly been said this morning that the IT industry can flourish only if we allow that relationship to continue. However, that is not what is being said by people in the IT industry, who work through their service companies as employees of those companies and have regularised their tax position. In a letter to The Independent, Mr. Brian Hughes, who has worked in the IT industry for 27 years and knows a considerable amount about the matter, said
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am amused to read the howls of protest from some of your correspondents about having to pay tax on their earnings as computer consultants  I  have great experience of these so-called consultants  They are, in reality, hired hands. Many have been made redundant, pocketed the tax-free handouts and immediately started work again.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That is the view of someone in the IT industry about what was going on. Hon. Members have also said that, in some cases, clients preferred the existence of a service company and were prepared to pay a higher rate for the contract in preference to carrying the obligation to employ someone.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I will not forget the right hon. Gentleman, but I would like to make my points in the way that I choose, just as he wanted to do with his contribution. He was good enough to allow me to intervene, and I will, of course, give way to him in a moment.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South made the rather strange proposition that his constituents would not be able to start or grow their own service companies or businesses, because of IR35. There is nothing in IR35 that would prevent anyone from starting up a business. Anyone can choose to start up a business at any time and make the necessary arrangements. Any business undertaken by a service company that is genuinely entrepreneurial will not be affected by IR35. The companies in support of which hon. Members have rightly spoken this morning will not be affected.

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Jack:</B> In her previous passage, the Paymaster General said that the use of existing tax legislation by the people who would be subject to the terms of the schedule represented avoidance. She said that that was wrong. Why does she consider it right for people to use lifetime gifts to circumnavigate the payment of tax under the terms of inheritance tax law?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> The right hon. Gentleman knows, because he would have done it himself when he was Financial Secretary-in fact, he told us that he had-that Governments, regardless of political complexion, will look at a range of taxation issues and decide whether they should tolerate the fact that something of which they do not approve is going on or act against it. I have always said that the scale of the incomplete payment or loss of tax, compared to what would apply in an employee relationship, was such that the Government believed it right to act. The right hon. Gentleman said that he had taken a similar decision in relation to the construction industry scheme. Such are the decisions that Governments will take about how they respond to what is going on.

<P>
In quoting various examples of case law, most of which accrued while he was a Minister, the right hon. Gentleman none the less made the important point that case law shapes and determines the tests for employment and self-employment. The tax system is predicated on that complex relationship for all of us and involves national insurance and tax contributions. Over time, case law may change the situation.

<P>
IT consultants have suggested for some reason that they are uniquely different from highly skilled workers in other industries, including marine engineering and architecture, and from the rest of us, and that accumulated case law should not apply to them. I cannot accept that proposition. The relevant bodies, including the Professional Contractors Group, have not advanced an argument to support that assertion.

<P>
<B>Mr. Jack:</B> Would the Paymaster General refresh my memory about the other professions that were listed in the October 1999 regulatory impact assessment that the Government produced? It showed that other trades and professions, besides IT, would be affected by the proposal. What were they?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I have to be honest and say that they do not immediately spring to mind, but I agree with the right hon. Gentleman's central point. Despite the fact that our debate has centred only on IT, other workers who use service companies within the 90,000 figure will fall within the remit of IR35 if they are an employee of their client and not self-employed.

<P>
The hon. Member for Croydon, South prayed in aid several arguments. He said that in Australia the IR35 rules, which have applied for several years, were about to be removed, but that is not the case. A Bill has been introduced into Congress to repeal such legislation, but Bills are introduced into Congress all the time-their role is similar to that of private members' Bills in the United Kingdom's parliamentary system. Its introduction does not mean that there will be legislative change, and the indications are that the Bill has no chance of success.

<P>
The level of tax that consultants will be required to pay in other countries was mentioned. I have dealt with that matter several times in our many debates on this issue, and I shall not repeat my argument. Committee members also discussed whether the Australian legislation would be repealed-it will not be. The Australian Government, like us, have consulted widely on the proposals, and they, like us, are presumably also making changes as they go along to improve the legislation. The advice that I continue to receive does not confirm the hon. Gentleman's suggestion-I am told that relationships that are similar to those that are described in IR35 will be dealt with in the Australian Parliament.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> My understanding from Australia is that the proposals were never introduced-they were announced a few months ago and abandoned before they hit the statute book.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I am happy to double check that, and I am not asking the hon. Gentleman to take my word for it. I shall write to him on the matter, but according to information that I have been given, the proposals are still moving forward and there is no intention to withdraw them.

<P>
I turn briefly to the points made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I find it bizarre-odd in the extreme-that a party that advocates the introduction of a higher top rate of tax and raising everyone else's basic rate of tax by at least 1p should defend those who are not paying the correct level of tax. I have a great deal of respect for the hon. Gentleman and I do not want to ruin his career, but he should go back to basics and look carefully at what is happening.

<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>

<P>
I say again to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton and other Committee members that the legislation will not change the employment status of anyone in service companies, and we are not giving larger contractors an advantage over smaller ones. Instead, we are levelling the playing field for all contractors, so that those who trade fairly and comply with definitions of ``self-employed'' and ``employed'' will not be undermined by those who avoid using the correct definitions.

<P>
As a result of the various contributions that were made this morning, the debate became totally confused. On one occasion, we were told that we had not consulted; on another, we were told that we had, but that the changes that we made in September were insufficient. However, the PCG, whose arguments have been used this morning by Committee members, welcomed the changes and the fact that we consulted on the issue.

<P>
The debate has moved towards consideration of principles that are not on the table for discussion. At no point has any Committee member said whether they agree that there is avoidance in this area. If they do agree, would they deal with it in a manner different from the Government?

<P>
<B>Mr. Burnett:</B> Does the Paymaster General think it fair that an individual should be required to contract through a personal service company? We all know the reason for that provision. Such an individual will have additional tax and national insurance to pay, but will gain no benefit.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> Frankly, the intelligent people who negotiate these contracts are perfectly capable of ensuring that terms and conditions, including pay, reflect their remuneration. In participating in this debate, we would be a little disingenuous were we not to admit that, often, such contracts carry a higher price to compensate for differences between employee and self-employed in terms of sickness pay and holiday pay. It is not credible to suggest that IT workers are poor little mites who cannot calculate a good return for their labour.

<P>
I shall deal briefly with the amendments. They all provoke a debate about the definition of an ``employee''. There is no definition in the Bill because we are resting on case law. Amendment No. 38 appears to propose that the provision should not apply if it is the general practice in an industry to employ consultants through service companies. That would be a novel approach to tax avoidance. The amendment would provide that avoidance should be allowed to continue in the industries in which it already exists, but nowhere else. That is not a credible amendment, and I ask the Committee to reject it.

<P>
Amendment No. 12 proposes that the legislation should not apply to someone who works for many different clients, or who, in addition to contracts that would otherwise be caught, also does some work on a genuinely self-employed basis. The drafting is imprecise. There have been complaints about the lack of definitions in the Bill, but the amendment does not contain any, either. It does not specify how many different clients would be necessary to meet this test, or what would constitute work as a sole trader. As I have already said, the decisions on employment or self-employment rest on case law, a considerable amount of which the right hon. Member for Fylde quoted.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General says that amendment No. 12 lacks precision. I should be grateful if she would address the example that I gave of a musician who might work under three contracts: a major contract, a recording contract and a subsidiary contract under which he or she played with friends. Would such an example fall under the regulations?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I can quote back to the hon. Gentleman the case of Mr. Lorimer, a vision mixer. I do not know whether he counts as a knowledge-based worker, because I am not exactly sure what that is.

<P>
<B>Mr. Oliver Letwin </B>(West Dorset): Will the Paymaster General give way?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> No; I do not want to provoke the hon. Gentleman before 1 o'clock. Mr. Lorimer worked for a large number of production companies and television companies in different locations. It was ruled that he was self-employed, carrying out his work in a variety of locations. That is a well known item of case law.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> Will the Paymaster General allow me?

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I do not want to trade case law across the Committee with the hon. Gentleman. It would not be relevant to the way in which we use the terms ``self-employed'' and ``employed'' in tax legislation. The information is there for everyone to see. However, if he wants to come back to me on that point, I shall be happy to give way to him.

<P>
<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The point that I should like to make is that there is a difference between a vision mixer-of whom there are many-and a musician with an individual talent that is personal to them. This illustrates that no two cases are the same. The Government will get into a bureaucratic nightmare over this issue.

<P>
<B>Dawn Primarolo:</B> I shall leave it to the hon. Gentleman to explain to vision mixers why they do not have such talents and are not such able individuals.

<P>
Amendment No. 13 seeks to exempt from this provision any contract made through an agency. I can see no justification for that. The involvement of an agency in setting up a relationship between a worker and a client will, in most cases, have no relevance to the nature of the relationship, in relation to the employment test. The amendment might be based on a misunderstanding of the extensive guidance issued by the Inland Revenue in February on the application of the employment status tests in typical service company situations. Most contractors in the IT industry work through agencies on standard contract terms. Those terms include an obligation to work set hours for an agreed hourly rate; to work on the client's premises under the client's control; and to perform the work personally, not send a substitute. One does not have to be familiar with case law to recognise that that bears all the hallmarks of employment.

<P>
Amendment No. 39 seeks to make it clear that nobody's employment status is changed by the Bill. I am happy to confirm that nothing in the Bill alters the legal relationship between any worker and his or her client or employer. If a worker is currently an employee of a service company, not of the client, that will remain the case under the Bill. It does not determine anyone's employment status. One of the misleading rumours that is being spread about the Bill is that it deems that a service company worker will be an employee of his or her client. It has been suggested to clients that that would mean that they would be vulnerable to claims under employment law-for example, for unfair dismissal. However, nothing in the Bill supports that claim. If the person is employed by the service company, their employer is the service company. The fact that their service company has a contract with a client does not make the client liable.

<P>
Amendment No. 40 would limit the application of IR35 rules to cases in which the Inland Revenue can prove to the general commissioner that the rules will have no effect on the flexibility of the client's market sector. The amendment is unnecessary, because the Bill does not interfere with the flexibility of any market sector in any way. IR35 affects only people who fall within the accepted definition of an employee. Even then, the provision allows them to continue to provide their services in any way that they choose-as an employee, a sole trader or through an intermediary such as a service company. Later amendments will reinforce that position and assist those who still wish to run their service companies.

<P>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.

<B>Mr. Ottaway:</B> The Paymaster General's response was completely unpersuasive. She did not explain how flexibility in the labour market will be maintained; on the contrary, her arguments implied that it will be reduced. She has completely failed to persuade us that this is not an uncompetitive measure. There is no evidence to suggest that it will not affect competition. She was unable to answer my point about amendment No. 12, which was a simple illustration of a musician with three contracts. Without wishing to be offensive to vision mixers, leading musicians have a unique talent which is irreplaceable.

<P>
The Paymaster General referred to other matters that I can work into debates during this afternoon's sitting in order to allow us to conclude this debate before lunch. Under the circumstances, I shall not withdraw the amendment.
