						</b> Good morning, Mr. Cook. Amendment No.
267 is not the most hard-hitting of amendments. It is consequential, so
I shall overlook it and move on to amendment No.
215.</div>
					<a name="07061433000019"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 4 imposes
a duty on the Legal Services Board to assist in the
maintenance and development of standards of regulation by approved
regulators of regulated persons, and in the education and training of
those persons. For example, it may issue guidance on or disseminate
examples of good education and training practices or principles of
professional conduct that have been developed for reserved legal
activity by one approved regulator to all approved
regulators.</div>
					<a name="07061433000020"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 215 has been tabled on a probing basis. It stresses the importance
of the board&#146;s role in education and training. As the
overarching regulatory body that oversees the work of all other
regulatory bodies, the board must understand the importance of its role
as a supervisor and ensure that all regulators meet the necessary
standards. Accordingly, it is 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column102" />Column number: 102</div>important that it is instructed to withdraw its approval of any
education or training schemes that do not satisfy the relevant
criteria.</div>
					<a name="07061433000021"></a><div class="hs_Para">The approval
of the LSB as given to regulatory bodies should be regarded as an
endorsement oftheir suitability and mean that consumers will
have confidence in them. Therefore, it could be seen as necessary that
such approval is given only when it is deserved, not in the case of
regulatory bodies that fall short of the necessary
standards.</div>

maintenance and development of
standards&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061433000023"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						seem
to be rather weak. The Minister should contemplate using the word
&#147;ensure&#148; because it gives a more appropriate and clearer
direction to the board and also sends out a message about the role of
the board to the professions. The amendment is worthy of the
Minister&#146;s thoughtful consideration over the next day or
two.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000024"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000205"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Bridget
Prentice):
						</b> Obviously, I agree that it is part of the
board&#146;s remit to work with approved regulators to achieve high
standards across the legal sector. That was the view of the Joint
Committee on the Draft Legal Services Bill and we accepted its
recommendation. The Bill explicitly states that intention in clause 4.
However, I have a different view on the nature of that duty. Clause 4
states:</div>
					<a name="07061433000169"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Board must assist in the maintenance and development of
standards&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061433000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">in relation
to the regulation and the education and training of people authorised
by the regulators. I think that that gives the approved regulator the
necessary freedom to tailor its standards and training
regimesin a way that is appropriate to its own area of legal
expertise.</div>
					<a name="07061433000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Although I
heard what my hon. Friend had to say, I think that it is appropriate to
use the word &#147;assist&#148; because it is about proportionate
regulation. We have discussed proportionality during the proceedings of
the Bill. The same must apply in this area. If we said that the board
had a duty to &#147;ensure&#148; the development and maintenance of
those standards, it would become a more interventionist approach. I am
not surethat that sits comfortably with effective oversight
regulation. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Huntingdon will
withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that we are attempting to agree
that education and training standards are important, but that
assistance is the right way forward for the board&#146;s role in
relation to the approved
regulator.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000206"></a>Mr.
Djanogly:
						</b> I take the Minister&#146;s point about the
need for proportionate intervention. However, there is a subtle
difference here. If the legal services are not performed in accordance
with the provisions of the Bill, the Legal Services Board need not act
because the regulatory bodies will deal with the matter. If there
isa problem in respect of development and training schemes
with the regulatory bodies themselves, the Legal Services Board should
act in their place because 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column103" />Column number: 103</div>there is no supervisory body above it. Therefore, it could be said that
it is the responsibility and obligation of the Legal Services Board.
The board should not just assist in the maintenance and development of
the education and training schemes, but at some point be able to take
control. There may be a case for turning the amendment on its head, so
that if the board is not satisfied it should consider withdrawing its
approval for
schemes.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman makes an
important point. If the board felt that the
arrangements had an adverse impact on the regulatory objectives, it
could intervene and have them changed. The Bill as it presently stands
responds to the very important point that he is
making.</div>

probing amendment. It would make the Lord Chancellor responsible for
approving appointments to the consumer panel, to safeguardthe
panel&#146;s independence. We need to ensure that appointments to the
consumer panel are made andare seen to be made objectively.
That is why we need someone&#151;the amendment

Djanogly:
						</b> Amendments Nos. 209 and 220 are complementary to
amendments Nos. 208 and 219. Clause 8 will require the Legal Services
Board to set up and maintain a consumer panel&#151;a panel of persons
whose task will be to represent consumers&#146; interests, as defined
by clause 208. Appointments to the panel will be made by the Legal
Services Board and one of the members of the panel will be appointed
its chairman by the board.</div>
					<a name="07061433000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 8 sets out the
categories of person who may not sit on the panel. Subsection (4) will
require the board to ensure that the membership of the consumer panel
gives a fair degree of representation
to:</div>
					<a name="07061433000170"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;those who are using
(or are or may be contemplating using), in connection with businesses

					<a name="07061433000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						However, we
believe that it is also necessary that the consumer panel should
include representatives of the corporate users of legal services and
qualified but non-practising solicitors who use or purchase services in
their professional capacity, as well as individual and small business
representatives. To enable that, it is necessary to remove the
prohibition on authorised persons serving as members of the consumer

services is concerned.</div>
					<a name="07061433000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">One of the great purposes of
the Bill is to increase consumer protection, so the Minister needs to
explain why certain consumers are to be disadvantaged and not given the
same protection as others. We thought that the idea of the consumer

legal services. The Government agreed on the need to ensure that a
range of voices should be heard on the consumer panel.</div>

can the consumer panel truly call itself representative of consumers.
The thousands of in-house lawyers are a growing and important part of
the consumer body of legal services; they are possibly the largest such
consumers outside the Government. It seems unfair that they should be
excluded from representation on the so-called consumer
panel.</div>
					<a name="07061433000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">On 12 June, the
General Counsel 100 group wrote to the City of London Law Society
expressing its concerns. I have been passed a copy of the
letter:</div>
					<a name="07061433000171"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;As you
know, GCl00 is the representative body for in-house counsel and company
secretaries of the top...FTSE companies. Legal services from
external law firms are necessary to the efficient running of the
organisations for which our members work and it is our members who are
responsible for arranging the purchase of these
services.</div>
					<a name="07061433000172"></a><div class="hs_brev">We would
welcome an amendment to the Bill in the terms you have suggested
allowing for representation of in-house counsel on the Consumer Panel.
Without this, we are concerned that the new regulatory regime for legal
services will not be suited to our needs and those of the law firms we
use. If this is the case regulation may well impact on the global
competitiveness of UK City law firms and our companies will look to
other jurisdictions for their legal
advisers.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061433000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">Our concern is
that, if those consumers continued to be excluded, the consumer panel

						</b> Conservative Members cannot help themselves. The
profession requires regulation, but they want to water it down to
protect vested interests, despite the fact that, under Standing Order
150(2)(c), advice will be required from the Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards on whether the amendments can be moved. I await his
correspondence on that. I am sure that hon. Members have read the 2002
speech of the Chairman of the Committee on Standards and Privileges on
what it is and is not entitled to
do.</div>
					<a name="07061433000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">Leaving aside the
inherent and extraordinary vested interest, to suggest stuffing the
consumer panel with lawyers and finding a guise in which to do so shows
a lack of understanding of what the real world feels about the problems
of the legal profession. I hope that the Minister will outline the sort
of people who should serve on the panel. First, there should be someone
who has suffered industrial deafness, so that the absurd practices in
the legal profession that have taken place for decades can be properly
addressed by a decent, sensible consumer voice that
says, &#147;Run your profession properly and fairly, and then have
the respect that you are
due.&#148;</div>

Prentice:
						</b> Sadly, I cannot view this amendment with the
same positive attitude with which I viewed the previous one. I have
listened carefully to the arguments about corporate consumers of legal
services and whether lawyers and non-practising
solicitors generally should be represented on the
consumer panel. Clearly, there is a role for the corporate consumer on
the panel, but I cannot agree that the prohibition on authorised
persons sitting on it should be waived.</div>
					<a name="07061433000059"></a><div class="hs_Para">First, the establishment of the
consumer panel has a distinct purpose: to ensure that the voice of
consumers is clearly heard in the regulation of legal services. We have
striven to shift the balance, as my hon. Friend constantly encourages
me to do, from the interestsof the profession to the interests
of consumers. Thatis the principle behind the Bill. To allow
the panel&#146;s independence from the legal profession to be
compromised&#151;the amendments would do that by allowing authorised
persons to be members&#151;would undermine that
aim.</div>
					<a name="07061433000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, I am
not persuaded by the suggestion that authorised persons need to be on
the panel, so that the representations of large corporations as
consumers can be heard. If large corporations cannot find someone other
than an authorised person to represent themon the panel, they
are in a very bad way. I want to encourage large and small corporations
to be represented, but I want them to be represented by people who are
not authorised persons. In fact, under clause 8(4)(a), the board will
be required to ensure that membership of the panel includes fair
representationof business consumers, but they cannot be
represented by a practising lawyer. That will not
prevent representatives from the Federation of Small Businesses, which
has representatives on our own consumer panel, or large industry that
uses legal services regularly from being
represented.</div>

they cannot put authorised persons on the panel. Providers of reserved
legal services cannot be part of the body that is specifically set up

voices consumer interests is important for those on the high street who
have not had their concerns or opinions adequately heard in the past. I

outside the definition of an authorised person, and therefore outside
the prohibition inclause 8.</div>
					<a name="07061433000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">Talk of the principle of the
independence of the legal profession has been heard loud and clear, not
only in the Committee, but during six months of debate in the other
place. We have heard the concerns about the principle very clearly
indeed, but it must apply equally to the role of the consumer panel. If
we in this House are the first to make that argument, so be it. The
consumer panel must be independent of the influence of the legal
profession. On that basis, I shall not accept the

their rights as consumers, whereas the Bill does not. I shall put the
hon. Gentleman right by saying that I did not suggest stuffing&#151;I
believe that that was the word he used&#151;the panel with in-house
lawyers; I simply said that they should be represented.</div>
					<a name="07061433000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">It might be that, generally
speaking, corporate and qualified non-practising solicitors who are
users of legal services are more business-savvy and so do not fall into
some of the pitfalls that individuals and small businesses do, but the
fact that the former group generally have more resources at their
disposal does not mean that they do not have similar problems and
issues that need to be resolved. Simply put, there are different types
of consumer problems. Granted, corporate and non-practising solicitors
might not face the same issues as those faced by individual users and
small businesses, but that is exactly why they need fair representation
on the consumer panel.</div>
					<a name="07061433000067"></a><div class="hs_Para">The whole idea of the panel is
to give a voice to the users of legal services, whoever they might be.
The panel must thus be adequately representative of all users. I fail
to see how the Minister can justify the exclusion of corporate and
qualified but non-practising solicitors, because they, too, are users
of legal services. She is in danger of damaging the credibility and
legitimacy of the consumer panel by taking such a negative position on
the amendments. That would be a shame. She should think again, which is
why we shall not be pressing the amendments to a Division. We will

wording is intended to ensure that appointments to the consumer panel
are made and seen to be made objectively. It is important that all
positions on the consumer panel be advertised publicly, so as to inform
a wide and varied group of people about their existence. That will give
all applicants a fair opportunity to apply for the panel. As a consumer
body, the panel needs to represent the consumer. A public advertisement
will therefore be the best means of ensuring that that is the
case.</div>
					<a name="07061433000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">Additionally,
it is important that the current criteria for selecting members of a
public body be applied, so that all applicants are given, and are seen
to be given, an equal opportunity to be selected. That is vital, as the
consumer panel is the voice of the public and it ensures that consumers
are given adequate representation. Any suggestion of favouritism in
selecting members could only damage the panel&#146;s integrity and
cause people to lose faith in the efficacy of the
Bill.</div>
					<a name="07061433000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it

What is in order is to point out that many things in statute are
similar, in terms of how matters are processed. We have a spaghetti
systemof statute that has developed piecemeal. There
isa substantial argument for simplifying it, so that reference
is made to a standard form in the appointing of boards, for instance.

in some detail. In fact, an identical amendment was tabled in another

like to think that the Committee and consumer groups know that the
Bill&#146;s raison d&#146;être is to put consumers at the
heart of the legal system. The prevailing standards of appointments to
public bodies are well known to members of the Committeeand,

reason, there would be little to gain by including a more specific
provision in the Bill to the effect that those standards must be
followed. However, given that the appointments are to be made by the
board and not by Ministers, there would, strictly
speaking, be no compulsion to follow the Commissioner
for Public Appointments&#146; code of practice. I can see why setting
out those requirements in the Bill would give an assurance that the
appropriate appointment practice would be followed, however, and for
that reason I should like to take the amendment away for further

should be able to make representations to the consumer panel. My
decision not to move new clauses 1, 4, 5 and 6 was tied to our proposal
in new clause 3, which will hopefully be clearer now than if we had
gone through all the other new clauses as
well.</div>
					<a name="07061433000094"></a><div class="hs_Para">The new clause

regulators whether in their regulatory or representive
capacity.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061433000095"></a><div class="hs_Para">I note that we
have received a strong representation relating to the clause from the
patent and trade mark institutes. Apparently, they met the Minister on
21 May at her request to discuss the changes made in the Lords and to
bring any concerns before Committee. They discussed with her their
disappointment at Baroness Ashton&#146;s refusal, as they see it, to
honour a commitment to accept this amendment in the other
place.</div>
					<a name="07061433000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">On Report in
the Lords, Baroness Ashton stated that she accepted the principle but
not the wording of the amendment in Committee, and that on discussion
with ministerial colleagues, she had been advised that the Bill
provided a variety of means for consultation, and that no amendment was
therefore necessary. The institutes felt that the Minister had simply
reneged on her commitment. Apparently, they ran through the arguments
again with her, explaining why they felt that professional
representation was so vital. They argued that if the Government
accepted the amendment in principle, they should table a Government
amendment to make that explicit in the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07061433000097"></a><div class="hs_Para">My understanding is that the
Minister refused their request, saying that the Bill already contained
a number of obligations on the board to consult approved regulators. As
something of a compromise, she committed to writing to the patent and
trade mark institutes with a list of all the instances in the Bill
requiring the Legal Services Board to consult approved regulators, in
order to demonstrate that significant 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column111" />Column number: 111</div>consultation was already explicit. My understanding, although I have to
say that it is a few days old, is that the patent and trade mark
institutes have as yet received no correspondence. Does the Minister
intend to provide that information, and will she agree to present it to
the Committee if she
does?</div>
					<a name="07061433000098"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institutes
welcome new clause 3, on professional representations. Lord Kingsland
pursued the issue on their behalf at length in the Lords. The
institutes have concerns about the lack of a requirement on the board
to receive representations from approved regulators. The Minister has
argued that all the regulators are free to make representations to the
board, and that it would be expected to work in close partnership with
them, consulting them and listening to their views.</div>
					<a name="07061433000099"></a><div class="hs_Para">The institutes believe that
their position as regulators of a niche part of the legal services
market, and their limited resources and membership, differentiates them
from the likes of the Law Society or the Bar Council, which have larger
resources. They also have grave concerns that their voice will be lost
and their considerations overlooked by the board unless the Bill
contains a direction or other positive statement that the board should
have regard to representations made by legal services
providers.</div>

					<a name="07061433000100"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
listened to the Government&#146;s previous arguments against the
establishment of a practitioner panel and understand their concerns
that such a panel might jeopardise the role of the consumer panel, that
it would be bound to be appointed by the board and that it is difficult
to understand what provision could be made to ensure that any panel
that the board appointed was representative of the regulated sector,
rather than comprising people whom the board was happy to
consult.</div>
					<a name="07061433000101"></a><div class="hs_Para">That
position is supported by the Law Society and other regulators, so,
accordingly, we did not move new clauses 1, 4, 5 and 6. Instead, we
proposed a simple addition to the Bill to ensure that the Legal
Services Board has a duty to consider any representationsmade
by the regulatory or representative bodies of the professions. That
approach mirrors the provisions in clause 10.</div>
					<a name="07061433000102"></a><div class="hs_Para">We were disappointed by
Baroness Ashton&#146;s response when the issue was raised on Report
and on Third Reading in the other place and by the subsequent feedback
that the institutes received in their later discussions with the
Minister and her team in the Ministry of Justice. The institutes feel
that Baroness Ashton backed out of a commitment that she made in
Committee in the other place when she acceptedthe amendment in
principle. On the back of that acceptance, she persuaded other peers to
drop their later amendments, because the Government had accepted
amendment No. 38.</div>
					<a name="07061433000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
agree on that point and therefore propose that the Bill should
explicitly state that representations to the board by the professions
must be considered. The Government appear to have made a U-turn. We
urge them to accept the amendment or, at least, to agree to return with
another amendment to meet this important
point.</div>

made to it and to respond with reasons why it disagrees. That is
entirely reasonable. There is an interesting legal question about
whether it would have to do that anyway, but it is far better
explicitly to include such a provision in the Bill. It is only
reasonable that the board should respond in writing to representations
made to it, giving reasons for disagreeing with
them.</div>

							<a name="07061433000241"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I should like to add a couple points to the
excellent argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon. First, the Committee will be aware that the patent and
trade mark institutes are small professional bodies and thus will be
small niche regulators. I stress that their future could be put at
risk, because they are not closed professional bodies in the sense that
one could still practise as a patent or trade mark attorney if one were
not a member of the relevant institute.</div>
					<a name="07061433000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such people join their
institute to give themselves added credibility, clout and professional
recognition. However, if they feel that the institutes are being cast
to one side, not listened to and perhaps undermined over time, they
will have every incentive not to pay their levy or fee to their
professional association and to go it alone. Those two important
institutes have been to see the Minister and the Department and have
lobbied members of the Committee. The institutes feel strongly that if
they lose their critical mass&#151;we are only talking about 2,000
members in total&#151;they could wither on the vine. That is why it
is important that they are given extra standing and credibility under
the new clause. My hon. Friend&#146;s arguments are spot
on.</div>
					<a name="07061433000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also agree with
what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley has just said. Looking at
things in the round, I do not understand how anyone could disagree with
the proposed new clause being added. If anything, it would add weight
and muscle to the consumer panel. It would not, in any way,
dissipatethe consumer panel&#146;s impact; it would
complement the work being done by it. I urge the Minister to consider
the new clause
sympathetically.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<a name="07061433000242"></a>
							<b class="B">Robert
Neill</b> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con): I should like
briefly to support the observations that have already been made by my
hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk. First, it is important
to bear in mind that, if we are going to make the consumer panels
system work, there must be a maximum buy-in from the organisations that
responsibly seek to represent various elements of the profession. The
trade mark and patent attorneys, with whom I have had no professional
connection, dealwith a small but important area of work. Even
large representative organisations, such as the Bar Council, find it
difficult to ensure that people think there is value in joining and
belonging to them. In fact, they can, within the structure of the Bill,
do a valuable job, at a certain level, in
self-policing.</div>
					<a name="07061433000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is
much better that people in the trade mark field have an incentive to be
members of an associationthat provides a pretty
cost-effective, useful means of bringing together
representative views. All the professional organisations in the legal
sphere carry out a degree of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column113" />Column number: 113</div>valuable self-policing as well, which is sometimes not recognised. It is
much better to give people an incentive to belong to such organisations
than their being tempted to freelance. We should remember&#151;others
will&#151;that, on the liberalisation of the conveyancing rules some
years ago, there was concern that some people were attempting to
operate outside any of the professional frameworks, which was for the
worst. That has been dealt with. It is right that we should build in
the incentive now, for the same
reason.</div>
					<a name="07061433000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, it
is important and desirable to place an explicit obligation on the panel
to state why it disagrees with representations from the professional
bodies, as it may, for good reason. That point was fairly made by the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley. It struck me that the same
principle was involved, albeit in a different context, in dealing with
the Greater London Authority Bill. The Government have sought to
strengthen the transparency of the relationship between the Mayor and
the assembly, by placing a duty on the Mayor and the functional bodies
in greater London to state why, having consulted and disagreed with the
assembly, they disagree with it. That makes the whole process more
robust from the point of view of the consumer, the professional bodies
making the representations and the public at
large.</div>
					<a name="07061433000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
and her colleagues have talked a lot about the importance of
transparency, and the new clause would underscore that. I hope that the
Government feel that the new clause is not trying to wreck or undermine
the thrust of what they are trying to do, but that it is trying to make
things
better.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000243"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> The new clause would place approved regulators
on an equal footing with consumers in relation to any representations
to the board. I do not consider it to be necessary, because, as I have
already said, there are many provisions in the Bill under which the
board and the Office for Legal Complaints might consult and consider
representations made by approved regulators. However, before I come to
that, I endorse the comments made about the patent and trade mark
institutes&#151;those small but important bodies&#151;and the niche
market that they represent. I have met them and discussed their
concerns. In relation my writing to them, they wrote to me on 4 June
setting our their concerns, and I understand that I shall reply to them
this evening.</div>
					<a name="07061433000113"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me
list some of the provisions in accordancewith which the board
or the OLC must consider representations: clauses 31, 35, 46, 47, 50,
58 and 66, schedules 7, 8 and 9, clauses 78 and 81, a raft of
provisions in schedule 10, clauses 143 and 145, clauses 127, 132, 133,
136, 141, 139 and 206, clause 179, schedule 4, clause 180, schedule 7,
and so on. It is therefore a myth that the OLC and the Legal Services
Board will not listen to representations from the legal profession, and
I hope that by reading out that list of provisions that are already in
the Bill I have squashed the myth.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000244"></a>John

there were a disagreement, the OLC and the Legal Services Board would
have to respond with reasons?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000245"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> Certainly, if the OLC was making directions, it
would have to give reasons. In the general course of things, it would
be good practice for the board also to give reasons for rejecting
certain representations if representations had been made. I am
confident that the position is already
covered.</div>

						<b class="B">

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000247"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> It is not currently my intention to issue
guidance. The Bill is not designed to fetter the way in which the Legal
Services Board will conduct its operations, and I do not want to impose
any fetters, but I might consider whether it is appropriate to issue
guidance.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000248"></a>Robert
Neill:
						</b> On that point, the Minister has said that she hopes
that reasons will be given as a matter of course if there is a
disagreement&#151;I think that thatis the right
view&#151;but can she really envisage a circumstance in which it
would be appropriate for the board or the panel not to give reasons?
Given that it is almost inconceivable that they would not, will
she&#151;in the same constructive way that she indicated she would
think again on a previous issue&#151;reconsider whether an explicit
requirement could be made, in guidance or in a short amendment to the
Bill, to give comfort to all the political parties that good practice
will be entrenched? Surely no harm would be done to the Bill&#146;s
purpose by making it explicit that reasons for disagreement should be
given.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000249"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> In considering whether guidance should be given,
I shall certainly look at the issue in the round and consider whether
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s suggestion would be an appropriate way to
proceed.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000250"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> Before the Minister goes too far, willshe
consider also that there might be extenuating circumstances? Let us
take the examples of an inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office into
certain practices or investigations that have not yet reached that
stage but in which malpractice&#151;perhaps routine
malpractice&#151;is suspected. There might well be a wish for
pre-emptive action in such cases, but there might be reluctance to give
precise reasons for a decision on the basis that providing too much
detail of other activities could prejudice other regulatory
action&#151;for example, bythe
SFO.</div>
					
					<a name="07061433000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000251"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> My hon. Friend makes a good point, and that is
exactly why I cannot commit todayto imposing a requirement on
the board that it give reasons or to issuing guidance. As he has
rightly pointed out, there are instances in which it might be
appropriate for other action to be
taken.</div>
					<a name="07061433000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I move
on, I have one other comment on the issue concerning patent and trade
mark institutions that was mentioned by the hon. Member for Bromley and
Chislehurst. If people opted out of those institutes, they could not
exercise reserved services and they would not have rights of audience
to conduct litigation associated with patent and trade mark work. 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column115" />Column number: 115</div>They would be diminishing their own ability to do that work if they
chose to opt out of the institute. That is an important point to
make.</div>
					<a name="07061433000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a
general statutory right for the approved regulators, of which I have
listed some already, to have their representations heard, and there
will be an obligation on the board to provide a notice setting out its
reasons when it disagrees with the regulators. To go further would be
to create a system that is too heavily tilted towards the
profession.</div>

						I
have said in previous sittings that it is well established and clear
that authorised persons have well organised and well funded bodies to
represent their interest. They have extensive experience of making
representations to other regulatory bodies, and we need only to
consider the way in which their representations were taken up
successfully in the other place to know just how influential they are.
Consumers need a general right of representation to balance that
situation out, and the Bill creates that balance.</div>
					<a name="07061433000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">If the LSB fails to account of
the authorised persons&#146; views in reaching a decision, they will
be able to go to judicial review. They know how to. I do not have any
fear that the authorised persons will not use all the powers that are
available to them to ensure that their voices are
heard.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000252"></a>Mr.
Burrowes:
						</b> On the substance of the issue, however, is it
not important that the Government continue to reflect on the clear-cut
undertaking given in the other place to accept the amendment that has
now been moved in this Committee? Not to do so would be ironic, given
that we are dealing with regulatory objectives that include upholding
the rule of law and the constitutional principle and convention in the
other place, whereby such an undertaking should be properly followed
through. It has not been followed through, and Lord Kingsland&#146;s
words still apply: the Government should be ashamed of
themselves.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000253"></a>Bridget
Prentice:
						</b> When I conceded some of the arguments that were
made earlier, I said that I could not accept them directly, because I
had to take on board the views of others in the form of collective
responsibility. The amendments would undermine the consumer&#146;s
voice, which is at the heart of the Bill. The legal professions are
more experienced than anyone else in making their views heard, as they
have done so clearly and successfully in the other place. It is time to
redress the balance.</div>
					<a name="07061433000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">I draw hon. Members&#146;
attention to clause 3, inwhich the board is required to be
accountable and transparent. It must publish an annual report under
clause 6, and use that opportunity to demonstrate that it has given
proper consideration to the representations made by consumers and
practitioners. Practitioners already have a strong voice in the system,
and if Iwere to accept the amendment, I would undermine
consumers&#146; weak voice and the Bill&#146;s attempt to
strengthen it. I therefore reject the
amendment.</div>

Birmingham, Yardley and my hon. Friends the Members for North-West

saying that the amendment is reasonable and straightforward. My hon.

that it would improve transparency, and I agree with everything that
they said. My hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate was right

Djanogly:
						</b> We propose to insert the words
&#147;onits own initiative&#148; on a probing basis. The
proposal comes from current consumer bodies. The wording of clause 11
will permit the consumer panel to carry out research for the Legal
Services Board and provide it with advice when it so requests. The
amendment would enable the consumer panel also to carry out research
and give advice to the board on its own
initiative.</div>
					<a name="07061433000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment aims to ensure that the consumer panel has an active and real
purpose. It suggests that the panel should be given some independence
and the opportunity to investigate matters and pass on relevant
findings and associated advice without having to wait to be asked by
the Legal Services Board. That would enable the system to become far
more dynamic and less
static.</div>
					<a name="07061433000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">We are, of
course, aware that such increased freedom on the part of the consumer
panel will lead to further costs. As we have indicated in earlier
amendments, the Conservatives are keen to ensure that such additional
costs are not passed on to the regulators. It would be 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column117" />Column number: 117</div>unjust to make them pay for research carried out by the consumer panel
on its own initiative on consumers&#146; behalf. Therefore, we
suggest that an additional amendment be made&#151;amendment No. 223,
which is
self-explanatory.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000259"></a>Simon
Hughes:
						</b> My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley
and I have added our names to the amendment. We are strongly persuaded
that it should be introduced. It is consistent with practice in other
regulatory bodies with a consumer panel. I gather that Ofcom&#146;s
consumer panel has the power to carry out research into any relevant
area that it sees
fit.</div>
					<a name="07061433000140"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to get
good people to serve on the consumer panel, one of the things that they
will want to know is that they are free to set their own agenda rather
than having it set for them. The hon. Member for Huntingdon and his
friends realised that there is a cost implication, and I thought that
where that might fall would be left for the discussion. There is a
potential cost implication, although the consumer panel will have a
support system. It will take additional time if the panel decides that
it must assess what it ought to do as well as what it is asked to do
and work through the programme, so it is appropriate to debate where
the additional cost will fall. Perhaps amendment No. 223 is the right
proposal; it may be something else, but my hon. Friend the Member for
Birmingham, Yardley and I are clear that the panel ought to have the
power to take initiatives. I hope that the Minister is entirely signed
up to this pro-consumerist amendment.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000260"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I also endorse what has been said. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Huntingdon pointed out a moment ago, the consumer
panel must have direction and focus. It would be wrong for it to be
purely a reactive panel. It must be proactive. Let us consider the
various disasters that have taken place in respect of how the consumer
is affected by a legal action&#151;indeed, the hon. Members for
Bassetlaw and for North Durham know well that it would have been useful
if the consumer panel had been in place when case of the miners&#146;
compensation scheme was going on, as it could have taken up the cudgels
on behalf of the people who were afflicted by that appalling, ghastly
saga.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000261"></a>John
Mann:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong.The last
thing that I wanted was a body into which complaints could have been
palmed off. I wanted&#151;and want&#151;effective regulation. Is he
not in danger of going down the track of beefing up the consumer panel
to such an extent that it can handle all the consumer issues and the
Legal Services Board can wash its hands of
them?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061433000262"></a>Mr.
Bellingham:
						</b> I very much disagree with the hon. Gentleman,
because they can work in tandem. Of course, we want tougher, better
regulation of the solicitors, but that is separate from giving
consumers a greater voice. If consumers feel that they have suffered a
serious grievance, whatever action the consumer panel might take might
well prompt the Legal Services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column118" />Column number: 118</div>Board to take regulatory action against particular solicitors. The two
can work in tandem.</div>
					<a name="07061433000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">As far as commissioning
research is concerned, I, too, considered the case of Ofcom. If one
widens the remit of the consumer panel in such way, it will attract a
higher calibre of members and will build up a body of research opinion
that will build credibility over the years. The Bill is about improving
the way in which legal services are run, and they are run for
consumers&#151;our constituents. What would happen if outside
consumer bodies wanted to help the consumer panel with research
programmes? For example, if the National Consumer Council or Which?
decided that it would be sensible for the consumer panel to consider
research programmes and wanted to work with it and, perhaps, to help
sponsor research, would that be in order?</div>
					<a name="07061433000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the Member for
Huntingdon andI are concerned about the cost implication. If
the consumer panel builds up a huge amount of momentum and wants to
take on many new challenges, there will be a cost implication and that
is why we have had to qualify matters. We did not want the provision to
become an open-ended commitment. We are conscious that the Minister and
her colleagues are in a Department that faces financial constraints. We
do not want to put too much financial pressure on her Department, but
we also want the job to be done. I urge her to consider the possibility
of using some outside resources if particular projects have merit and
if the panel is proactive in a campaign. I hope that she will consider
that and support our
amendments.</div>

							<a name="07061433000263"></a>Mr.
Jones:
						</b> I find it very strange that on the second day of
our consideration, Conservative Front Benchers are talking about the
rights of the consumer. Up to now, they have been trying to protect
their vested interests, and the amendments are another
attemptto do that. Like my hon. Friend the Member for
Bassetlaw, I am concerned that if we are not careful the consumer panel
will end up in competition or rivalry with the board. That would be a
dangerous step, because it would weaken the role of the board. Such an
approach is not inconsistent with Conservative policy these days, under
which policies are put forward with no attempt to explain how they will
be paid for. If we accept amendments Nos. 222 and 223, it is not clear
who will pay for the research&#151;as long as it is not the poor
solicitors or the legal profession, who, poor as they are, could not be
asked to contribute anything to such research. I resist the amendments.
They have been portrayed as an attempt to help the consumer, but they
are actually part of a cynical guise around an attempt to protect the
vested interests of the legal profession.</div>

						</b> The hon. Gentleman has not thought this through at
all. The Government propose in the Bill that there should be a consumer
panel; the hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing against not only the
amendment, but the idea of a consumer
panel&#151;<i class="I">[Interruption.]</i> Well, that was the clear
implication; if I am wrong, what he said was not very clear.</div>
					<a name="07061433000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is fundamentally important
that there shouldbe a consumer panel and that its
representatives donot sit&#151;with formal status, as it
were&#151;as a non-departmental public body such as the Legal
Services 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column119" />Column number: 119</div>Board. Those representatives should be able to make sure that there is
an access point and response base for consumer issues. The amendment is
consistent with the idea that there should be a consumer panel. If
there is to be one, we should let it do its job, not hold it
back.</div>

Neill:
						</b> I often find myself agreeing withthe hon.
Member for North Durham&#151;on local government issues, for example.
However, I am sorry to say that he is absolutely wrong on this issue.
There seems to be an extraordinary illogicality to his
position.</div>
					<a name="07061433000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">I rather
resent the suggestion that the Conservatives have ever objected to the
notion that the consumer is at the heart of the Bill. Perhaps the hon.
Gentleman has spent so many years in the Labour party and trade unions
that he has become an inveterate conspiracy theorist. We are talking
about not a conspiracy todo down the consumer interest, but a
proposal to advance it.</div>
					<a name="07061433000151"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry to use an analogy
from another piece of legislation, but it is apposite. During the
passage of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill,
we debated how we would make local involvement networks, or LINks,
effective&#151;how we would give them teeth and attract people of the
right calibrewho would be an effective voice for patients. The
Government seemed to accept that there was a need to empower LINks.
That is what we are trying to do for consumers in this context: to
empower the consumer panel. That is consistent with the
Government&#146;s own philosophy of the Bill. We accept that point,
so I find it bizarre that Labour Members should try, by using rich
lawyers as a smokescreen, to limit the scope for consumer panels to
carry out research on their own initiative.</div>
					<a name="07061433000152"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know lawyers who do legal aid
work, and they have seen not an increase, but a real-terms cut in their
fees over the years. They do not necessarily come into the &#147;rich
lawyer&#148; category. It would be very sad if, of all people, Labour
Members started to stereotype. That would get us away from the real
issue of trying to geta balanced regulatory framework, which,
I accept, involves enhancing the position of consumers. It also
involves respecting the position of the professionals. Enabling the
consumer panel to take the initiative is to go in absolutely the right
direction, not the wrong
one.</div>

Prentice:
						</b> I have some sympathy with the arguments that
have been advanced in so far as I agree that representations from the
consumer panel will be hugely important in informing the
board.</div>
					<a name="07061433000154"></a><div class="hs_Para">To ensure that
the panel is equipped to do its job, we have provided that it must be
consulted by the board in respect of certain key regulatory activities.
The panel may also make representations to the board about any other
matter. When it does so, the board must consider them and give the
panel notice if it disagrees. Any such notice must state the
board&#146;s reasons for disagreeing with the representations. If it
wishes, the consumer panel can publish any information relating to the
provision of its
advice.</div>
					<a name="07061433000155"></a><div class="hs_Para">I turn to how
that might work. If the panel considers that there is evidence of a
clear detriment to the consumer interest, it may make a representation
to the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column120" />Column number: 120</div>board that it request that the panel carry out research into the matter.
Such a representation could also specify that the board should receive
and consider advice from the panel. If the board elected to disagree
with such a representation, the panel would have to be provided with a
justification for that disagreement, and it could then go ahead and
publish that
exchange.</div>
					<a name="07061433000156"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
No. 222 would allow the panel to conduct research of its own volition.
A number of hon. Members have prayed in aid other consumer panels, but
they are labouring under a misunderstanding of the role and powers of
some of those other panels. Ofcom&#146;s consumer panel can provide
advice of its own volition, but only in very specific circumstances
under section 16(3) of the Communications Act 2003. As far as I am
aware, neither the Financial Services Authority nor Ofcom consumer
panel have the power to undertake research of their own volition. I do
not know of any other statutorily provided consumer panel having that
ability.</div>
					<a name="07061433000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the Bill,
we have given the consumer panel more powers than those available to
others. In fact, I would argue that Ofcom&#146;s consumer panel is
more restricted in its ability to carry out research than the panel of
the Legal Services Board.</div>
					<a name="07061433000158"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 223 states that
the cost must not fall on the approved regulators. In that case, on
whom must it fall? If the implication is that it would fall on the
Government, in effect, that means the consumer. In fact, the Bill
states that, after the transitional period in which the Government
contribute to the cost, the Government will play no further part. It is
for the legal profession, which is to be regulated, to bear the burden
of that cost. Therefore, even if the amendments are accepted, it is
inevitable that the cost will fall on the legal profession.</div>
					<a name="07061433000159"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment No. 223 is
problematic because it does not indicate who should bear the costs. I
understand what it seeks to do, but the amendment is flawed in itself
and in its principle because the implication is that the cost will fall
on the consumer. In fact, once the board is up and running, the costs
will fall on those who are being regulated.</div>
					<a name="07061433000160"></a><div class="hs_Para">When the board identifies an
area that needs regulatory scrutiny&#151;or a representation has been
made by the panel that identifies such a need&#151;it is important
that the panel is available to undertake that research and to advise
the board on the potential impact on consumers. There would be a real
danger that the panel might be unable to honour that request if it is
dedicating time, manpower and other resources to research projects of
its own.</div>
					<a name="07061433000161"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally,
there are no safeguards in the amendments to ensure fairness or to
prevent misuse of power. Nothing in the amendments would stop the panel
from conducting irrelevant research, incurring exorbitant costs, or
providing that the board need not act on the advice. The amendments
contain no clear lines of accountability. They are flawed in themselves
and in the principle that they are trying to express. On that basis, I
ask the Committee to reject
them.</div>

Hughes:
						</b> The hon. Member for Huntingdon will make his own
decision but, unless I am mistaken, I detect a bit of resistance from
the Minister. Some of 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column121" />Column number: 121</div>her arguments are good, although some facts need checking. I am not
persuaded by her arguments, but I am happy to consider them further. If
the amendments contain flaws, I am sure that that we can improve
them.</div>

Djanogly:
						</b> As the hon. Member for North Southwark and
Bermondsey says, we are not convinced by the Minister&#146;s
argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst was
right to say that the Conservative party is concerned about the rights
of the consumer. I echo that remark. Many amendments tabled by
Conservative Members that we have discussed so far have been in the
interests of the consumer. Sometimes they have questioned who the
consumer is and sometimes they have examined how 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column122" />Column number: 122</div>the existing Bill has been adapted, but they have certainly considered
the rights of the consumer from the consumer&#146;s point of
view.</div>

Member for North Durham had got over his fixation with vested
interests, he suggested that the board and the panel would come into
