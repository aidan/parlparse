                           </strong> On a point of order,
Mr. Amess. I wish to correct the record in respect of a
statement that I made earlier in our proceedings. During discussions on
an amendment to clause 3 on employee shares, I informed the Committee
that the clause was explicit that all those who work for a Royal Mail
company—the company providing a universal service—must be
part of the employee share scheme. I wish to clarify that
clause 3 does not, in fact, oblige all those who work for Royal Mail to
be part of the employee share scheme. It requires that the scheme must
include employees and allows the Government to make the employee share
scheme available to all employees of Royal
Mail.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000022">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
provision itself does not require that all employees are part of the
scheme. There is a good reason for that, as some individual employees
might not wish to be part of the employee share scheme, and the Bill
should not require them to do so if it is not their wish. The hon.
Member for Llanelli was concerned that the employee share scheme could,
for example, be used just to reward members of the management team. I
absolutely assure her that that will not be the case. The scheme will
not be limited to a particular group of Royal Mail employees. Our focus
will be to make employee share ownership as wide as possible to help
align the incentives of employees of the company. There will, of
course, be transparency to Parliament on the employee share scheme. As
I said when we were discussing amendments on the subject, clause 2
requires the Government to report to Parliament when they decide to
transfer or issue shares in the Royal Mail company, including to the
employee share scheme. I hope that my explanation has benefited members
of the
Committee.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000023">&#160;</a>

                           </span> The weather has not helped this
morning, and we seem to be a bit thin on the ground. Clause 30 is an
extremely important part of the Bill, as it sets out the requirements
for the universal service, something that is dear to our hearts and
that we want to be as explicit as possible. We are pleased that the
minimum requirements are more than the minimum required by the EU
directive, as we are worried that some areas of the Bill could see a
slipping back to providing only what is in the directive. We have
talked at some length about the amendments we would have liked under
requirements 1 and 2, such as Saturday delivery extending to all shapes
and sizes of packets and parcels and not simply being for letters. That
is a matter for regret, but I shall not spend a great deal more time on
requirement
1.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000027">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">It
is absolutely essential that we clarify exactly what requirement 2
means. As I understand it, it applies when there are access points. In
other words, if the access points have already been established, the
requirement sets out what has to happen at those points. However, it
sets out nothing about a specified number of access points, such as
postboxes or counters where people can take registered letters or
parcels. I emphasise that matter, because reference has been made to
access points as if a certain number of them had been designated during
our
discussions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000028">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Well,
a certain number of access points has not been designated, which is in
contrast with several providers abroad where the number of access
points is specified under legislation. We have heard plenty about
Germany’s 12,000 access points, but let me tell the Committee
about another country that has a specific explanation on the
distribution of access points and where 90% of people in urban areas
are expected to have a post office-style access point within a 2.5 km
radius of their home. Some 85% of people in rural areas are expected to
have such access within 7.5 km of their home. I am not describing a
compact, densely populated country—it is not Germany but none
other than Australia. Many members of the Committee will have seen
pictures or will themselves have journeyed across miles and miles of
country, where a garage is a welcome landmark. I am sure that they will
be astounded to note that even Australia specifies criteria for access
points to the postal service. Why can we not have criteria specified in
our legislation? Okay, where there is an access point, there has to be
a collection—that is obvious—but there would be a
specific number. Of course, we would have liked to go even further and
specified post offices, but, failing that, at least if there were a
minimum number, that would provide better cover than is currently the
case in the legislation as it
stands.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000029">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
requirement 3, we are pleased to see that prices will be affordable and
uniform. That is an extremely important addition to the EU directive,
which simply refers to “affordable”. However, we are
worried that there may be other parts of the Bill where that could be
eroded. For us, it is important that wherever we send a first class
letter, the length and breadth of the country, it should be at the same
price in line with a uniform public tariff. Again, there is a
difference between what we see in the Bill, which we welcome, and what
the EU directive says. It is something about which I feel strongly. It

welcome the inclusion of requirements 4 and 5 on the registered and
insured items services, which are in line with EU directives.
Requirement 6, which is optional in the EU directive, provides for
services to blind and partially sighted people. I dare say some members
of the Committee will have had the privilege of recording talking
newspapers, which are sent out to blind and partially sighted people,
providing a valuable source  of local news, gossip and all
sorts of things. Certainly, it is a well-subscribed service in my local
area, and a lot  of hard work is put in to make it so. We
welcome the opportunity for packages to be sent free of
charge.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000031">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
welcome requirement 7, which is perhaps unique to this country. It is
not in the EU legislation. However, although the requirement looks
acceptable on paper, there are threats elsewhere in the Bill that seem
to undermine the minimum requirements. The danger is that it would be
possible for Ofcom to simply pare back to what is required to comply
with EU directives. I have already mentioned such threats in our
discussions on clauses 28 and 29, particularly in clause 28(4), when we
read of Ofcom’s duty
to<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000032">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>That
gives Ofcom an opportunity to reduce any service it deems unreasonable.
That leaves it open to question, so we worry that what we see on paper
in the minimum requirements may be easily eroded. It would be helpful
if the Minister could offer assurances that that is not the
case.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000033">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
clause 29, we noted that Ofcom can make various assessments and
consider the extent to which the market is meeting the reasonable needs
of users. Again, there is an open opportunity to perhaps reduce the
service in some way, so even before we reached clause 30, we found that
the requirements were being
undermined.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000034">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
32 sets out exceptions to the requirements. As I am sure that the hon.
Member for Angus would have wanted to remind us, the exceptions relate
to geographical and other conditions. He would certainly find
that  most unacceptable, as we do. Almost immediately after
clause 30, we find a threat to its
provisions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000035">&#160;</a>

be made, and once more exceptions start to be made, they can grow and
grow. As I have said, I will mention that in the debate on that clause,

clause 32. On clause 33, we will again discuss the opportunities that
Ofcom has to review, revise and consider what is reasonable. All those
words might be used in various ways, including possibly to undermine
what we see as the good start made by clause 30. We would like that
clause to remain much more secure, by removing a few mays from the Bill
and by removing some of those opportunities for Ofcom to reconsider and
possibly modify what is
reasonable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000039">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Under
clause 34, if Royal Mail is the universal service provider, it would
have no guarantee of being so for more than three years. That might
have negative impacts on its investment programme and on its decisions
about investment relating to the universal service obligation network.
As we move through the Bill, we will mention some other issues about
which we are worried, and we have great concerns that clause 30, as it
stands, is not as strong as it at first
appears.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000040">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">To
sum up, we are very concerned that the requirements set out in clause
30 are under so much threat from elsewhere in the Bill. In short, a
privatised Royal Mail that is looking to cut corners might use the
existence of what I call review-and-get-out clauses to put pressure on
Ofcom to amend those minimum requirements. We are also extremely
concerned that no minimum number of access points is required, and that
we have no criteria for the distribution of those access points. We
also do not know how many postboxes and counter services we may end up
with, or whether they will be evenly distributed across the whole
country.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000041">&#160;</a>

place on the record our concerns about that, alongside the concerns
that we mentioned earlier about our wishing, in an ideal world, to have
a Monday to Saturday delivery service covering packets and parcels as
well as letters. We welcome the minimum requirements above and beyond
those set out in the European directive, but we have some reservations.
In particular, we are concerned that the clause might be undermined
elsewhere in the

approach in the clause. She noted—without using the

postal directive. I apologise to colleagues who are worried about
gold-plating, but in this case they will welcome it—we have gone
beyond the European directive in clause 30 by enshrining a higher level
of minimum service requirements into UK
legislation.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000043">&#160;</a>

was pleased that the hon. Lady compared the UK with Australia,
suggesting that in effect Australian requirements were stricter,
because she gave me a chance to mention England’s victory by an
innings and 71 runs and to pay tribute to Mr Strauss and his
colleagues. The Royal Mail also wins against Australia Post. Australia
Post is a fine postal administration, do not get me wrong—I had
the pleasure of visiting its headquarters in Melbourne many years ago,
and it is at the cutting edge of postal
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000047">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
disagreeing with the hon. Lady, and saying that the UK compares
favourably with Australia, I do not wish to rub salt into Australian
wounds. However, Postcomm’s analysis in 2007 looked at access
criteria equivalents and compared Australia with the UK. It showed that
our access criteria have 99% of the urban deprived population within
1.6 km and 95% of the urban population within 1.6 km, whereas the
Australian requirement is 90% of the urban population within 2.5 km.
The criteria for rural areas are similarly
worse.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000048">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">In
comparison with the UK, both urban and rural households in Australia
have a weaker commitment. I hope that the hon. Lady will at
least accept that. The reality—the facts on the
ground—which we will take forward in our legal agreement on
access criteria with Post Office Ltd is that we have more access points
for both urban and rural
populations.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000049">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
am sure the hon. Lady is about to intervene to mention the difference
between access points and access criteria which, in anticipation of
what she will say, I accept. However, the practical reality is that we
are, through the access points provisions in clause 28(4) and the
access criteria in the funding contract with POL, ensuring a double
protection, the result of which is more access for universal postal
service
users.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000050">&#160;</a>

access criteria above and beyond Australia’s, reflecting our
more densely populated islands. Our figure of 99% of people being
within a mile of a post office is clearly much better than the
Australian model, but my point is that that has nothing to do with what
is in the Bill. The criteria concern how many post offices there are,
but they have nothing to do with the number of access points specified
in the Bill for any provider of the universal service to provide. We
are still no further on with getting the number of access points
specified, never mind any thought that those access points might be

offices.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000051">&#160;</a>

comprehensive post office network is much more effective than any that
I have looked at in any country, including Germany, Australia and
France. We can continually replay the argument, but I want to return to
what the Government are doing to protect the post office network, which
is rather more than what the previous Government did, in terms of
money, overall policy framework and the legal agreement with Post

services for blind and partially sighted people, is extremely
important, and I confirm that I, along with friends and volunteers,
have made recordings of Liberal Democrat “Focus” leaflets

the last part of her remarks, however, the hon. Lady, having welcomed
the minimum service requirements, said that they were somehow under
threat. She was both reprising some discussions that we had on
clauses 28 and 29 and looking forward to the debate on
clause 33. I do not want to anticipate that debate, beyond saying that
the protections in the Bill for the minimum service levels are the
strongest that this Parliament has ever been asked to agree to, and we
will make that case very

approaches to the clause. The hon. Member for Angus, who tabled an
amendment to the clause but is not here, seeks to remove the words
about geographical conditions and so on being allowed as exceptions,
whereas Labour Members seek more parliamentary control over what might
happen. Subsection 2 clearly states that there are circumstances in
which it is not necessary to comply with requirements 1 and 2 in clause
30. Requirement 1 specifies a six-days-a-week—Monday to
Saturday—delivery service for letters and a five-days-a-week
delivery service for postal packets, and requirement 2 specifies the
same for collection
services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000060">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
first circumstance in which the requirements can be waived is a public
holiday, which I think we all find acceptable. Paragraph (b), however,
could be a get-out clause—horror of horrors—allowing
Ofcom the discretion to consider as exceptional particular geographical
conditions or other circumstances. I imagine that the hon. Member for
Angus would have told members of the Committee something along these
lines: the clause gives a lot of discretion to Ofcom—quite
possibly rather too much—to decide whether an area should be
left without delivery and collection, because it is exceptional due to
geographical conditions or other circumstances. It would give Ofcom

                           </strong> The clause leaves a lot of leeway for Ofcom. The
hon. Member for Angus wants to remove the exception all together, while
our approach is somewhat different. What we said in amendment 79, which
was not selected but which we have debated in other contexts, was that
the Secretary of State should put a regulation before Parliament before
such exceptions are allowed. We want a clearer opportunity for
Parliament to look at these matters, rather than just leaving them to
Ofcom. It is not a matter of not trusting Ofcom; it is that there will
be a lot of pressure, because it will effectively be a privatised
monopoly. Consumer Focus, the Hooper report and Postcomm have all
notified us that the pressures on Postcomm from the current set-up have
been significant. With a privatised monopoly, even though Ofcom is much
bigger and has more experience of dealing with all sorts of
communications industries, there would inevitably be a temptation for
Royal Mail to push hard to bend the rules and to be open to creating a
two-tier system.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000064">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">In later
clauses, we will look at how other providers could provide help in
doing that. By introducing a number of different providers, there would
be more leeway whereby this type of exception could become the norm.
So, our way of circumventing that particular problem would be to
suggest that the Secretary of  State brought these exceptions
to Parliament, giving an opportunity for scrutiny of any proposed
exceptions. Whether such cases would remain as very exceptional or
whether they would creep, creep, creep, creep, creep along to include
other areas, that approach would at least allow us the opportunity to
scrutinise what exceptions are
allowed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000065">&#160;</a>

will have further to travel to collect a registered item from a postal

live in the so-called exceptional areas; it also affects those who want

we post an item first class on a Friday morning it will almost
certainly arrive the next day, wherever in the UK it is sent. We will
have no idea which rural pockets Ofcom has designated as
exceptional—they could be large areas of the Scottish highlands,

should not leave it to Ofcom alone to decide such matters. If there are
to be any no-go areas, the Secretary of State should come before
Parliament and justify why some UK citizens would find themselves being

requirements of the universal service as set out in clause 30 need not
apply. The wording, as the hon. Lady mentioned, directly replicates
section 4(1)(a) of the Postal Services Act 2000 and clause 32(6) of the
Opposition’s Bill from last year. It flows from the European
directive’s article 3(3), which states that member states must
take steps to ensure a universal

exceptional situations we have in mind and which are deemed exceptional
by Postcomm at the moment are, for example, where there is an address
on a remote island to which there is only a single ferry service a
week. It would be unreasonable to expect Royal Mail to deliver to that
address every day, as it would be required to charter its own boat. I
hope that in the hon. Lady’s opposition to the measure, she is
not suggesting that Royal Mail should do that to deliver to one address
on  a remote island. I hope she understands that that is a
reasonable exception.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000078">&#160;</a>

in which the exceptions policy has been interpreted by Postcomm, and
how it will be interpreted by Ofcom, is not as elastic as the way she

important that the Committee understand why we need such exceptions. I
could give another example: where an address has dangerous dogs and
poses a genuine threat to postmen and postwomen. I am sure that all
members of the Committee have, at times, delivered leaflets around
their constituency at elections, and will have come across addresses
with problems that are less exciting to deliver to. Sometimes such
problems are temporary—for instance, where it is impossible to
deliver because the calling system for a block of flats is out of
action. There are also occasional increases in the number of addresses
that cannot be delivered to. For example, there was an increase of 182
in the reported number of delivery points excepted from the universal
delivery service between 2009 and 2010. When queried, Royal Mail
explained that the increase was due mainly to 110 new exceptions in an
east London postcode, where a number of tower blocks were listed as
temporary health and safety exceptions because of unsafe delivery
environments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000081">&#160;</a>

are the sorts of examples where such exceptions happen, and in no way
will that undermine the universal service. In many ways, it will
support that service because it would be unfair to require postmen and
postwomen, and the universal service provider, to deliver come what may
if there are health and safety or access difficulty issues. I am sure
the hon. Lady understands

most of them concern access problems. She will know that where someone
has exceptions to their home or business and they are not getting the
universal service delivery, they can appeal. There is an appeals
procedure, and Royal Mail has to defend itself to the regulator in such
a case. In no way is the provision a loophole to undermine the
universal service. It is what happens now and what is required by the

had it had a plan for that operation, because the House has not given

                           </strong> The clause is extremely important as it deals

                           </div>opportunities whereby the service can be eroded in an unhelpful way.
Amendment 45 would add the words “after five years” to
the clause so that Ofcom can review after such time whether clause 30
reflects the reasonable needs of the users of postal services provided
in the United Kingdom. In the difficult times that will ensue following
the privatisation of Royal Mail, when everyone is becoming used to new
circumstances, it will be important to have
stability.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000093">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
also consider that the universal service obligation is of such immense
importance that it needs a good five-year period to bed in with the
newly privatised provider. Our worry is, why on earth would anyone want
to start reviewing that universal service obligation within 12 months,
18 months or three years—periods that are referred to throughout
the Bill? We want a firm assurance that there will be a proper
five-year period during which the full universal obligation will be
provided, and to be given an opportunity to see it operating properly
in practice. We do not want anything reviewed, revised, changed or
watered down before a proper, full five-year
period.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000094">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">When
I spoke to clause 29, I reminded the Committee about a potential end of
the inter-business agreement about 18 months after privatisation,
depending, of course, on when privatisation takes place. So, there
would be a huge amount of negotiation as to exactly what the Royal Mail
wanted from any inter-business agreement, be it with post offices or
other providers. There would be leeway, because there is nothing about
the number of access points on which to cut down and the number of
access points that it provides. At the same time, a simultaneous review
by Ofcom of what is actually required in the universal service
obligation leaves the door open for an enormous amount of manoeuvring
by Royal Mail to put everything in order in one go, in a way that suits
it, rather than the consumer. Ultimately, we are looking at the
protection of the consumer, and we want to ensure that that is in mind
first and
foremost.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000095">&#160;</a>

amendment, therefore, is a sensible and easy one for the Minister to
accept. One ought to do nice things at Christmas, and accepting the
amendment is a nice, easy option for him. Universal service provision
would be strengthened in one fell swoop and nothing too complicated

speaking to this amendment, I want to make it absolutely clear that
subsection (6) is vitally important. It is right and proper for the
legislation to include the subsection, which ensures that any amending
of clause 30 by the Secretary of State should not include
making different provision for different places in the United Kingdom.
It is important to have that universality of service across the whole
UK, and such a response is likely from the devolved
Administrations.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000098">&#160;</a>

assumptions by the Secretary of State about what those in the devolved

least, 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>the devolved Administrations ought to be consulted about any amendment
to the clause proposed by the Secretary of State—any amendment
to the minimum requirements of the universal postal service. Why? The
reason is that many areas in the devolved settlements involve a
significant overlap in responsibilities. In real life,
devolved responsibilities interlink with the responsibilities reserved
to the UK Government in different
ways.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000099">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">For
example, the issue of economic development is important to the Welsh
Assembly and the Scottish Executive, with their particular attention to
the needs of small businesses in rural areas and so on—both
Administrations have made significant investment in their post office
networks. For those in the devolved Administrations to want any
break-up of the universal service might seem extremely unlikely.
Nevertheless, given their investment and how they want to support
economic development, it would be important for them to be fully
involved in any review, consultation or steps taken by the Secretary of
State, simply as a matter of a courtesy, and because they see the
interlinking of anything happening to the universal service provider
and their local
economies.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000100">&#160;</a>

80 would provide the devolved Administrations with an opportunity to
comment on proposals by the Secretary of State to amend the minimum
requirements. If the Secretary of State had some 
mad idea, which I cannot believe, and wanted to
give  Ofcom powers to amend minimum requirements in an
unhelpful way, consultation with those in the devolved
Administrations about any such report or review might head off complete
madness and any unacceptable proposals. Consultation with the devolved
Administrations is practical, because of their involvement in economic
development and, in particular, the sorts of investment they have made
in the post office
network.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000101">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendments
60 and 61 are fairly self-explanatory. We are simply asking that
vulnerable users, users in rural areas, and small and medium businesses
be able to express their particular needs, and that those needs be
considered. Clearly, there are people who can and always will speak up
and shout the loudest, but the most vulnerable in society do not have
that
opportunity.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000102">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">There
should be a duty on the regulator to take account of the needs of
vulnerable users, such as the elderly, those who find it more difficult
to get out and about, those who rely on items coming through the post
and who want to be able to post items without having to traipse miles
from their homes to do so. We all know what a joy it is for many
elderly people to receive items through the post, and they are probably
the best at remembering birthdays and sending the delightful things
that younger family members enjoy receiving. Vulnerable users who need
to be taken into account include those who, for many reasons, are
housebound and people who, for one reason or another, rely more on
postal deliveries than on their going out to find and buy items, as
other people
might.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000103">&#160;</a>

have mentioned several times the concern that isolated rural
communities, in which enterprising people use the postal service to
help establish small businesses, should also have their needs taken
into consideration. It should not just be assumed that because people
live in the countryside, they want to live at a slower pace of life and
therefore do not want a postal service on more than five days a week.
There should not be assumptions of 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>that nature. We have discussed small and medium enterprises at length,
and their needs and requirements from the universal service are
all-important. They use the postal service in many ways, and Ofcom
should take great note of the ways in which they want it to be run, and
of the provisions they would like for facilitating economic growth and
for helping to increase the number of jobs, particularly in rural
areas.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000104">&#160;</a>

                        <p>It
is self-explanatory that we would want such representatives to be
consulted. Ofcom has a responsibility to consumers, who may be members
of the public or businesses, and those groups are represented by
different organisations. We hope that the present Government will not
try, in any Bills that might be around the corner, to get rid of any
groups that look after consumers’ needs. It is important that
consumer representatives be kept in mind and in the loop about how the
universal postal service might be developed and about the review that
Ofcom might want to make of the requirements, so that they can state
their needs and
priorities.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000106">&#160;</a>

earlier sittings, we heard several references to surveys that have been
carried out among business users and the general public about what they
would like to see. We want those types of information and opinion to be
considered. We are asking for amendments 60 and 61 to be made to
subsections (1) and (2), so that we can be assured that such needs will
be looked after when Ofcom reviews the minimum
requirements.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000107">&#160;</a>

sum up on clause 33, we are concerned that such a review will take
place so quickly. It leaves a door open, very early on, for the service
to be reshaped in a way that might be detrimental to the consumer,
particularly the more vulnerable users, those in rural areas, and small
and medium enterprises. We worry that the negotiations that the
privatised Royal Mail will have, probably simultaneously, on any
inter-business agreement on access points, will put pressure on Ofcom
to water down the minimum requirements. For those reasons, we have
tabled the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000108">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
was not a Member in the previous Parliament but there is no doubt that,
had I been, I would have opposed the privatisation of Royal Mail. I
make no secret of that, but I accept that some investment is required.
In my previous contribution to the Committee, I emphasised the need for
the Bill to be absolutely watertight in its instructions to Ofcom in
its role as the postal service regulator. My reasons were twofold, and
I wish to reiterate them. First, as I have said time and again, the
Bill goes much further on privatisation than any previous proposal. It
has also been seen through the House at startling speed. It is
essential to ensure that Ofcom has the powers to regulate a privatised
Royal Mail effectively and in the public interest, so I again urge the
Minister to slow down and be more considered in his approach.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000110">&#160;</a>

                        </div>
                        <p class="tabbed">Secondly,
watertight legislation is required not least because the handover from
Postcomm to Ofcom will have its difficulties. I take the point that the
Minister touched on in his closing remarks in the previous discussion.
Although I have confidence in the professionalism of both bodies, the
task is large, and the Bill should be specific in its instructions to
ensure that the universal service obligation and the post office
network are protected, despite any handover
issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000111">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
45 is a reasoned amendment that turns on the issue of speed versus
proper consideration. It ensures that Ofcom is prevented from
undertaking a review of the minimum universal postal service until five
years have elapsed, which is helpful for two reasons. First, the
amendment protects the minimum requirements for an extended period,
ensuring that Royal Mail’s new owner or owners are unable to
exert any pressure on Ofcom to re-examine the minimum requirements
straight after a sale. Secondly, it prevents Ofcom from undertaking a
hasty review, so that when and if a review is undertaken the full
effects of privatisation will be understood, modernisation will be
complete, and the pension deficit will be far from people’s
minds. In short, the amendment ensures that the regulator will not be
able to do what the Government are attempting. Ofcom will be able to
look at the long-term effects of privatisation and modernisation,
rather than making short-term decisions that might themselves have
negative long-term
effects.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000112">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">On
amendment 60, I welcome any change that tightens the regulatory
framework. I see no reason why Ofcom should not pay particular
attention to vulnerable consumers, rural consumers and small and
medium-sized enterprises when it undertakes a review of the minimum
requirements. Those groups are heavily reliant on Royal Mail’s
universal service. Any review that results in a watered-down service
would affect those groups more than any other, so it seems only right
and proper that particular attention be focused on
them.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000113">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
61 would ensure that consumer groups and representatives of small and
medium-sized businesses are consulted as part of any review of the
universal service undertaken by Ofcom. If a privatised Royal Mail is to
be regulated effectively and fairly, the affected groups should be
given a voice in that process. The fact that those groups will
represent people who rely heavily on Royal Mail services would surely
enhance the review rather than work to its detriment. It would ensure
that people—as well as balance sheets—are included as an
important
consideration<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000114">&#160;</a>

80 seems perfectly reasonable. I would be surprised to hear any
objection to it. The Secretary of State is to agree to a change to the
universal postal service that affects the whole of the UK. It seems
only reasonable that consultation should occur with those devolved and
territorial bodies. We should do this in a spirit of co-operative
government to ensure that all parts of the unitary state are
effectively
consulted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000115">&#160;</a>

amendments to clause 33 would mean that any regulatory review was
undertaken no sooner than in five years’ time, ensuring that,
following the sale, Royal Mail’s new owners would have no
incentive to increase pressure on Ofcom to dilute the universal service
requirement. They would also allow them to take a wider view of the
state of the universal service provision

interest is a large consideration in any change to the universal
service. They would put those groups that most rely on the postal
service at the heart of Ofcom’s review and draw representatives
of business and consumers into the process, ensuring that they are
fully
consulted.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000116">&#160;</a>

radically. For that reason, the Minister could perhaps concede them. In
my respectful submission, they are reasonable amendments. They seek to
change the Bill for the better to ensure a strong and effective
regulatory framework is in place to protect the universal service for
all who rely on it. For those reasons, I support the amendments. I urge

point to get across is that the Bill is about protecting the universal
service. That is the starting point. Clause 30 enshrines the minimum
requirements for that. Clause 33 tries to show that those minimum
requirements can be reviewed, but the powers in clause 33
enhance the safeguards against changes to the minimum requirements. I
want to explain that in detail, because people need to understand this.
Under the European Communities Act 1972, the Government already have
the power to change the minimum requirements of the universal service
to the level required by the directive, which is five days a week.
There is no requirement under that directive for there to be uniformity
in the service. That change could be made by negative resolution. That
is not acceptable. We talk a lot—I certainly do—about
what was in the 2009 Bill, and it is interesting that there was no
protection for the minimum service. The previous Government were happy
to keep the powers that they had under the 1972

                           </strong> That goes back to whether one trusts Ofcom. Ofcom
has a record of being a good regulator. Across Europe, it is seen as
one of the continent’s finest regulators. I thank the hon. Lady
for her intervention, but she was not able to explain why the previous
Government did not want to enhance the safeguards for the minimum
service requirement, which this Government are doing. If we had kept to
the previous Government’s policy, we might have seen a Minister,
having been lobbied by a partially privatised Royal Mail, coming to the
House and seeking a reduction in the minimum service on a negative
resolution. What protection was that? We have gone further in clause
33.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000121">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The Minister is skilful at avoiding the issue,
which is that the 2009 Bill was different. It proposed selling Royal
Mail, but with the state retaining the majority shareholding. He seems
unable to accept that there is a big
difference.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000122">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                              <span class="hs_CLMember">Mr
Davey:<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000458">&#160;</a>
                              </span>
                           </strong> Let me help the hon. Gentleman: I completely accept
that there is a big difference between this Bill and the 2009 Bill,
particularly on ownership. I hope that he will accept that there was no
protection—as there is under clause 33—in the 2009 Bill.
It would have left the Secretary of State with the power to reduce the
minimum requirement by negative resolution.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000123">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When I looked
at that issue, I could not see how that was acceptable. Clause 33 has
been deliberately inserted, because it introduces three additional
safeguards. First, before any change to the minimum requirements can
even be contemplated, Ofcom must have conducted a review of
users’ needs. That seems to be a reasonable thing to do.
Secondly, subsection (6) guarantees—I am glad the hon. Lady
welcomes this—that no change can result in a different minimum
level of service for different parts of the country. The Bill is
absolutely clear: it does not permit the minimum service requirement in
London to be different from that required in Llanelli, Kingston upon
Thames or Kingston upon Hull or any other constituency in the country.
That is to be welcomed. The third extra safeguard that it creates is
that any change would have to be made by affirmative, not negative,
resolution. There would have to be a debate and vote in both Houses to
make that change. That means that if the Secretary of State accepts
Ofcom’s review recommendations, he has to bring it to Parliament
for it to give its assent or not. Those are extremely strong
safeguards.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000124">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">When
one considers those safeguards and then looks at the amendments, one
sees that the amendments are not needed, in particular amendment 45,
which would prevent Ofcom from initiating a review of the minimum
requirements until at least five years after Royal Assent. It is
important that the regulator can review the market and user needs as
and when it sees fit. As a result of getting good information and
evidence, Ofcom will be able to make the best regulatory decisions. I
therefore see absolutely no value in tying the regulator’s hands
in this particular
regard.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000125">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">More
importantly, hon. Members will note that Ofcom will merely conduct a
review under the clause. There is no imperative to act—indeed,
Ofcom cannot act on its findings. The Secretary of State is the person
who will make the order if he feels it to be necessary, and it will be
for Parliament to debate and approve the order. I think that
that is the right approach in an incredibly important
area.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000126">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That was a good attempt by the Whip. I assure him
that the service in Telford will be protected under subsection (6).
There is no time limit, be it five years or any other term. We have
kept flexibility to ensure that user needs can best be reflected as and
when they change. We have the safeguard, but I do not expect it to be
needed in this Parliament, so I do not think the

			Column number: 595<a class="bkMark" name="Column595">&#160;</a>
                           </div>fixed term issue comes into play. However, it will give long-term

                        <p class="tabbed">Although
the intention behind amendment 60 is commendable, Ofcom already has
duties to that end. Indeed, its duties go far wider than the amendment,
and I would not want them restricted. Section 3(4) of the
Communications Act 2003 requires Ofcom, in performing any of its
functions, which will now include its postal services role, and
therefore any review that it conducts under clause 33(2), to have
regard to<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000129">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the
vulnerability of children and of others whose circumstances appear to
Ofcom to put them in need of special protection; the needs of persons
with disabilities, of the elderly and of those on low
incomes…the different interests of persons in the different
parts of the United Kingdom, of the different ethnic communities within
the United Kingdom and of persons living in rural and in urban
areas”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000377">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>That
is quite a strong list of protections.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000130">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Of course,
one of the principal duties of Ofcom is to further the interests of
consumers in relevant markets. An SME using postal services would
undoubtedly be seen as a consumer under the powers. Therefore, we are
in agreement about the importance of the groups named in the amendment,
and we are also concerned about others. The 2003 Act already caters for
the groups set out in the amendment, so I hope the hon. Lady will
withdraw
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000131">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
same arguments apply to amendments 61 and 80. Section 16 of the 2003
Act gives Ofcom a duty to
have<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000132">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“effective
arrangements for consultation about the carrying out of their functions
with…consumers in the markets for the services and facilities in
relation to which Ofcom have
functions”.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000378">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The
Bill gives Ofcom a new function in respect of postal services, and the
requirement to have a mechanism for consultation will extend to its new
role, including any review of minimum requirements. There is no need to
specifically name representatives of either consumers or SMEs. The 2003
Act already requires Ofcom to have regard to that range of groups in
carrying out of all of its duties and furthering the interests of
consumers. I think those duties cover what the amendment seeks to
achieve.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000133">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Regarding
amendment 80, once again Ofcom has duties to consult, and must have
regard to, the interests of persons in different parts of the United
Kingdom. Thus we do not need a new requirement to consult devolved or
territorial bodies of Government as set out in amendment 80. The needs
and views across the whole of the UK are key, and Ofcom will know them
better than the Government.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000134">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The hon.
Member for Llanelli rightly described subsection (6) as vital, as it
will prevent the Secretary  of State from making an order that
results in non- uniform minimum requirements across the United
Kingdom. Hon. Members will appreciate that any  order made
under clause 33 will have strong parliamentary accountability. Members
representing constituencies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and
in all the regions of the United Kingdom will have a chance to make
their views known. I do not think her amendment will add to those
protections. I hope that she feels able to withdraw her lucky
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000135">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I listened
carefully to what the Minister said about the other groups. Indeed,
there are specifications that Ofcom consult with a number of different
groups and perhaps the consumer umbrella could be used to cover some of
those. I am glad that he regards that as part of its role when its
duties include the mail services. On that note, I shall not press
amendments 60 and 61.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000137">&#160;</a>

that the Minister understands the important nature of the devolved

                        <p class="tabbed">We suggest
that there could be massive fragmentation, and
cherry-picking—here, there and everywhere—of different
providers providing different parts of the service. Some of our
experiences of that to date have not been happy. Providers might have a
real interest in compact, densely populated areas, in which they might
be willing to do all sorts of things to obtain franchises or services
to run, but they might have little interest in providing  a
service to more sparsely populated areas. It is not difficult to
imagine Royal Mail being left with a disproportionate burden of areas
that are expensive to service and a loss of income from more profitable
areas, which had previously allowed for cross-subsidisation. The
difficulty is that there would be a lot of pressure to reduce costs in
rural areas by reducing provision, which could easily lead to fewer
deliveries or collections of mail, or fewer access points, all as a
result of the splitting of the universal service obligation
among  the different
providers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000172">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Among the
parallels is the water service. If we look at water providers in this
country, the south-west has a reputation for expensive water and
sewerage services. The reason is fairly easy to understand: it is a
fairly large, sparsely populated rural area, with many kilometres of
water and sewerage pipes to and from people’s homes. Providing
such a service in that area is expensive. Contrast that with water
charges in the south-east, such as those by Thames Water: the area is
more compact and densely populated, so it is easier to keep the cost to
the consumer
down.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000173">&#160;</a>

Water, for example, is not far behind South West Water in the league
tables of high water prices. Welsh Water has the constant dilemma of
how to keep the price down for consumers, when it has high costs in a
more sparsely populated area, while making the investment that we are
all desperate for—in my area in particular, where we have a
precious inlet, with a lot of letters after its

concerns the costs incurred by the companies. The problem is that those
costs are different because of the different nature of the areas. The
companies charging at the high end—Ofwat obviously tries to keep
the prices down—have a huge dilemma, because they need the money
to invest in infrastructure. Areas such as mine 
<div class="columnNumber">

                           </div>need the investment to stop sewage going out into the sea. However, the
companies cannot charge all that much because consumers, and Ofwat on
their behalf, will say, “This is outrageous.” The
companies have a difficult situation and no opportunity for
cross-subsidy.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000176">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">With
the Bill, we could end up with a number of different providers, but the
opportunity for cross-subsidy being taken away. Therefore, a lot of
interest in the more profitable areas would be likely—the
cherry-picking syndrome, with providers rushing in to take the easy
ones, wanting to do a nice little compact service for the cities of
Birmingham or Manchester, or wherever. They would not be interested in
the less profitable parts of the service. The cross-subsidy would
therefore be lost, with a knock-on effect in rural areas. If a
universal price was kept, the only other way we could end up is with
the service being diminished in some
way.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000177">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am not sure I am buying the analogy or the
fears. We can understand the possible entry of an alternative universal
service provider in some areas, but when the last-mile collection
prices in those areas go down, we might see an increase in volume and
capacity, which would generate more revenue. Moreover, even if the hon.
Lady’s fears were fulfilled, does she not accept that the
“financially sustainable” provision would mean that the
service is maintained by all operators in all areas under a universal
service
provision?<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000178">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> With a universal service covering the whole UK,
the opportunity for cross-subsidy is there de facto, because it is
already built into the provider company. If, however, there are
different companies providing effectively different services, and some
services are much cheaper than others, we have to bring in the clause
that we will discuss later, in which compensatory money has to come
from the providers in the cheaper areas with the lower infrastructure,
to cross-subsidise a provider of  a universal service in a
rural area. That seems to be a rather more complicated mechanism than
that of one company providing the service across the whole country. The
minute we start breaking things up, we add a lot of complications and
take away the opportunity for economies of scale and for
cross-subsidy.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000179">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull
East recalls the cream and green telephone boxes that there were once
upon a time in his area, but he probably does not remember the time
when a thruppenny piece was all that was needed to make a phone call
there, when a sixpenny piece was required in the rest of the UK. We all
can give examples of where services have operated differently, but our
real fear is that once we start to have a number of different
providers, the door is opened for some to do the easy bits and make
quick profits. And what do we do in areas that are more expensive to
service? We have to close down access points, because their number is
flexible: the Bill does not specify how many there should be. If there
is a lot of expense in a rural area, that can be cut by closing down
access points, deciding not to collect from a few postboxes or not to
use a few post office
outlets.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000180">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Fragmenting
the service between a number of service providers creates a problem,
and Royal Mail, because it is the body that currently provides the
service, possibly gets left with all the less desirable areas. Other
companies come in like vultures, pick up the best bits and make money
out of them, leaving Royal Mail to struggle.

                           </div>We hope that there would not be any overlap, because it is
specified elsewhere in the Bill that there should be none, but it is
difficult to envisage no overlap if there are several companies all
having to do collections and presumably bringing their lorries to
various depots where they swap the bits and pieces. That is a recipe
for some overlap, in spite of the fact that Ofcom is not supposed to
allow any. Having more than one provider is a problem, because from one
end of the country to the other several providers might have to handle
the items before they get to where they are
going.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000181">&#160;</a>

in economics a number of times over the years: one provider is best,
and the big provider achieves the economies of scale. I think that that
was one of the arguments in the 1930s that led Ford Motor Company to
try to run its own steel mills as well as making cars and brought it
almost to the point of bankruptcy. Is not the truth that the hon. Lady
misses that in many instances competition provides benefits to the
universal service obligation? The spur of competition could end up in
prices for the universal service, and costs, going down. It would spur
innovation in different forms of last-mile delivery. Does she not omit
those benefits of competition as she paints her rather grey picture of
the
future?<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000182">&#160;</a>

can access the universal service provider so that they can use the last

people to see how others can do things better.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000183">&#160;</a>

hypothesis only, and if the hon. Lady is conceding the benefits of
competition in upstream services, why is she so scared about
competition in downstream services? Why will they not bring the same
benefits? I am not hearing her argument about the overlapping delivery
routes. There are many instances when people deliver down streets and
follow each other. Such a service can be effective and end up in lower
prices

would regard the last mile as part of the infrastructure, such as
happens with the water or rail network. As the hon. Gentleman says,
sometimes there will be competition.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000186">&#160;</a>

think of the urban areas that receive lots of leaflets from their local
supermarkets. We also know that those who deliver such leaflets do not
visit many rural areas—probably to the great relief of many who
live there. If we are to have a universal service throughout the
country, there will probably be little interest in certain areas. We
will always be left with that position. If that is the case, will the
burden be shared fairly if it is dealt out among various providers? If
not, what mechanism will be in place to look after the areas that are
least well served, to protect them and not lead to a deterioration in

that we can tease out her particular areas of concern. I think she has
conceded that competition in upstream areas has been
of benefit to consumers. I think she is conceding
the possibility that, downstream, competition can exist and bring some
merit. I think her concern is that, in some areas, that service will be
offered but, as a consequence of competition in the last- mile
delivery in, say, urban areas, there may be some detriment in other
areas of universal service provision. But does she accept that, even if
that were the case, there are plenty of provisions in the Bill to
protect the universal service obligation in all areas of the
country?<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000188">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> If one company provides the service from one end
of the country to the other, there will obviously be more of a uniform
service, but if that is not the case, the mechanisms of
compensatory-type payments and so on would have to be used to put
things right. My fear is that we would end up with a fragmented
service, with different types of service being provided in different
areas, and I do not think that that is what the British public want. I
think they want a proper, unified service. When one is contemplating
such matters for 45 minutes on a freezing station on a
Thursday night because there are different train companies that do not
talk to each other and thus do not keep one’s connection, and
that is a regular occurrence, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that one
has very strong views about whether there might be more joined-up
thinking if there were one provider rather than a number of providers.
However, perhaps mail does not mind sitting around and waiting for its
next bit of onward
transport.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000189">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">The
existence of several different companies providing the universal
service in different areas of the United Kingdom would raise
complicated issues of logistics. We are not just talking about a bit of
upstream sorting and taking the mail to the local access point to let
the Royal Mail carry on; we are talking about a different provider in
Cornwall passing mail through several other areas before it arrives in
Scotland, with each provider having their own different way of doing
things. That raises considerable issues.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000190">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">That is the
background to the amendments. They  are obviously grouped for a
very simple reason. Amendments 82, 83 and 84 would omit the subsections
in clause 34 that are relevant to having a number of different
providers. The reason for removing them en bloc is, quite frankly, to
avoid the possibility of having a number of different providers of the
universal service obligation. The amendments follow logically from
amendment 81; if we take one out, we need to take the others
out.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000191">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
87 is relevant to clause 35, which is about designated USP conditions.
The purpose of the amendment is to prevent cherry-picking, which would
see some of the nice, easy bits in highly populated areas being picked
off by people who would like to provide those services, making it more
difficult for those who pick up the more sparsely populated areas. We
want to amend clause 35 so that it matches what we are proposing in the
amendments to clause
34.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000192">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
91 also relates to clause 35. It is about taking out subsection (7),
which states:<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000193">&#160;</a>

                        </p>
                        <p>The
reason for those requirements is the significant worry if the universal
service is provided by more than one provider. The clause is obviously
intended to safeguard that situation. We feel that the problem would
not arise in the first place if there were one provider of the
universal service. Amendment 91 complements our amendments to clause
34.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000194">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Lastly,
we have amendment 93, which relates to clause 36. It takes
out the reference to two or more providers of universal service
provision. Our amendments relate to the same idea—we feel very
strongly that there should be one provider of the universal service,
and we should keep uniformity so that people have one service serving
them across the whole country. For that reason, we have proposed the
amendments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000195">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> This group of amendments concerns removing from the
Bill the ability of Ofcom to designate in very limited circumstances
more than one universal service provider. My hon. Friend the Member for
Bedford and the hon. Member for Llanelli had an interesting debate on
that subject, but at many points the debate became muddled between two
issues. One issue is whether more than one universal service provider
can be designated, with all the conditions that apply to a USP, and the
other is whether there can be competition in end-to-end delivery,
because nothing in current law, regulation or the Bill prevents
end-to-end competition. If a postal company operating within the scope
of the universal service wished to provide end-to-end deliveries, in
the way that I think my hon. Friend contemplated, it can go ahead and
provide
that.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000196">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We
will talk about how such operators would be regulated and what
conditions Ofcom might chose to put on them when we discuss clauses 39
onwards, particularly clause 40(2). We can then debate issues of
concern to the hon. Lady, who has raised the potential for
cherry-picking. However, that debate is not relevant to this group of
amendments. The amendments seek to change clauses 34, 35 and 36, which
are part of a group of clauses under the heading “Universal
service providers.” What is at stake is whether more than one
company can be designated as a
USP.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000197">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
intention of the group of clauses is to give Ofcom the power to
designate one or, in two specific circumstances, more than one USP to
ensure the provision of a universal service. I come back to the fact
that the Bill is about providing a universal service, and the special
circumstances relate to concerns about whether 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 602<a class="bkMark" name="Column602">&#160;</a>
                           </div>that universal service can be provided. In the two circumstances, Ofcom
would have the ability to designate more than one USP. The designated
operator or operators would be obliged to comply with conditions,
including the requirement to provide a universal service throughout the
United Kingdom, presumably—as we will come on to—working
with the other
USP.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000198">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
group of clauses provides an essential part of the regulatory
framework. It is different from the 2009 Bill, but that is because it
is an improvement, and it relates to options that are available to us
under the European postal services directive. As with other elements of
the Bill, the intention is to ensure that it is
future-proofed—in other words, to enable the regulatory regime
to adapt, when it needs to, to ensure the continued and long-term
provision of a universal service. Personally, I think it is
inconceivable that Royal Mail will not be the sole provider of a
universal service for the foreseeable future. However, it makes sense,
as part of future-proofing, to provide for a situation in which that
might not be the case. As we will discuss when we come on to the
special administration regime, legislation has to provide for the
unforeseen or for unlikely situations. That is what Parliament needs to
do in making the law, even if we think it unlikely that such provisions
might be
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000199">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause
34 allows Ofcom to designate more than one provider under two
circumstances. The first is
where<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000200">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“OFCOM

                        <p>Members
of the Committee will know that clause 43 deals with the fairness of
bearing the burden of the universal service obligation by the incumbent
USP, and we will reach the clauses relating to that particular issue in
due course. The second circumstance is
where<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000201">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

                        <p>and
Ofcom considers it necessary to increase the number of USPs to secure
the universal service and bring about the end of the
administration.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000202">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">If
we have to use the clauses in part 4 in the future, we will be in a
difficult position. As the Under-Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage, will
explain when we discuss part 4, the clauses under “Postal
administration orders” mirror similar arrangements, particularly
on energy and water, in other legislation. Their role is to be a last
safeguard, and the second circumstance under which Ofcom might
designate two or more USPs is only an extreme example. I hope that, in
respect of these clauses, the hon. Member for Llanelli will realise
that that is not likely to happen. We hope that we never find ourselves
in either of those scenarios, and we do not expect that we will. Both
procurement determination and the special administration provisions are
genuine backstops, only to be used if the future of the universal
service is at
risk.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000203">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">At
times, the hon. Lady talked as though Ofcom could designate alternative
providers in profitable areas under these provisions, but that is
simply not the case. Clause 34 only allows for the designation of more
than one universal service provider if it is necessary to do so in the
event of a special administration, or if Ofcom has found that there is
an unfair burden on the universal service provider. In the latter case,
an alternative provider can only be designated where it can provide the
relevant part of the universal service with less of a burden—not
in the profitable areas where there is no burden. The

			Column number: 603<a class="bkMark" name="Column603">&#160;</a>
                           </div>fragmentation risk, which she discussed at length, does not exist. I
hope that she will be reassured by those
points.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000204">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">As
I have mentioned, having the ability to make multiple designations in
specific, albeit unlikely, cases is simply a sensible and pragmatic
fall-back provision. It is also important to make it clear that having
more than one designated universal service provider in no way provides
for or permits varying levels of minimum service across the
country—at one point, the hon. Lady suggested that it might.
Provisions elsewhere in part 3 of the Bill guarantee that the minimum
requirements of the universal service must remain uniform. Having given
those assurances, and having explained the sensible rationale behind
the policy, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000205">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> These are very important amendments, because it
is fundamental to us that there is a united, universal service
obligation provided by one provider. Although I have listened to the
Minister trying to reassure us that there are only certain
circumstances where these provisions might be used, we feel that the
emphasis in a number of clauses—beginning with this clause and
continued throughout the Bill—is that there may be more than one
provider. I sense that there is a slight difference of approach between
the Minister and the hon. Member for Bedford, who was perhaps more
enthusiastic about seeing a number of different providers.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000206">&#160;</a>

amendment requests that the procedures to be followed on a review must
be provided for in regulations made by Ofcom, subject to those
regulations being placed, by the Secretary of State, before Parliament
for approval. This is simply a way of strengthening the Bill and
strengthening the opportunity for parliamentary approval and scrutiny.
We are suggesting that the procedure to be followed on a review must be
provided for in regulations made by Ofcom, subject to the placing of
those regulations before Parliament. I think it is self-explanatory. We
have debated before why we think it is important to have parliamentary
scrutiny for such matters,

                           </strong> We feel that the amendment would place an
unnecessary, inappropriate and cumbersome burden on the making of such
regulations. I apologise to the hon. Lady, but her amendment did not
feature in the 2009 Bill. In this particular aspect, we have
used the same wording as that Bill here. Before the hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull East stands up, let me say that the matter is about
the regulatory powers, and I do not think it has anything to do with
ownership.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000229">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
think the previous Government realised that the amendment would be
unnecessary. It concerns the procedure that Ofcom will have to follow
in a review of designations under the clause. The procedure will be
provided for in regulations made by Ofcom, and such procedures are
highly technical and detailed. I think it is for the independent
regulator, who will have the details, to determine the procedure. That
is a far better place than Parliament to have a review of the process.
The amendment would be quite cumbersome, and I can only imagine members
of the Statutory Instrument Committee reviewing a set of procedures
scratching their heads, wondering why they were there and why Ofcom was
not just getting on and publishing the procedures. I do not think there
is a big issue here with parliamentary accountability, so I hope the
hon. Lady will withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000230">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> Well, I do not think there is ever a matter that
Parliament cannot consider. I always think it is important for
Parliament to have the maximum opportunity for scrutiny. When we are
setting up something new—Ofcom is going into a new
area—there is every reason for a proper scrutiny of the
procedures. I will therefore press the amendment to a
vote.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000231">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The purpose of amendment 11, which was tabled in
the name of the hon. Member for Angus, is to strengthen the role of
Ofcom by deleting the words “seek to” and leaving
“must”. Amendment 90 would require Ofcom to ensure that
the prices that it imposes take into account the universal
provider’s money for future investment and service provision. We
agree with the hon. Member for Angus that the measures under paragraphs
(a) and (b) should be strengthened. We have more to say about paragraph
(c), however, which I shall discuss
shortly.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000275">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">On
paragraph (a), we agree that Ofcom must ensure that prices are
affordable; how we define affordable, however, is problematic.
Furthermore, the EU directive does not specify uniform, and the way in
which the Bill is worded at present affords Ofcom opportunity to modify
the universal service requirements and, therefore, scrap uniform price
for delivery across the UK. Therefore, the need to keep prices
affordable assumes even greater importance.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000276">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We would
rather the prices always be kept uniform, because that is a vital part
of our understanding of the universal postal service. A uniform price
would ensure that we all share the actual cost of delivering a letter
to the most costly places. However, even if the prices are not uniform
they should be affordable, so we very much concur that “seek
to” should be deleted to leave “must” in paragraph
(a). It is also perfectly reasonable that Ofcom should have to ensure
that<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000277">&#160;</a>
                        </p>

the end of clause 35(5)(c). We know that there has been a drop in the
number of items being sent through the post, with an average
day’s total being some 71 million letters, packets
and parcels, following a peak of 84 million in 2005. We
understand, therefore, that there are significant pressures and that
the way in which people use postal services may be changing. Therefore,
in reaching any decision about pricing, account must be taken of the
costs incurred in providing the service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000280">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Before such
costs can be calculated, the resources needed to provide the service
must be identified. The total cost of resources used to provide the
service is made up of a number of different costs including labour,
supplies, equipment, facilities and purchased services.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000281">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I think I am right in saying that that is not quite
true—there has been a big increase in the amount of mail that is
machine-sorted, but not right down to the walk order for the individual
Royal Mail employee. That is where there needs to be an awful lot more
automation, so that Royal Mail can get to that fine level of sorting
and save time in the delivery office, and postmen and women do not have
to do the final sort, which can sometimes take several
hours.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000283">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I am sure that the Minister will enlighten us
further on that point. However, the important point that he is making,
which is the one that I would make, is about the need for continuing
modernisation and, therefore, investment. We heard from Moya Greene
excellent stories about wonderful places that she would like to take us
to, but she also mentioned places where there is still a huge need for
more modern equipment. Progress is certainly being made, and I think we
now find that a lot of the A4-sized mail, including magazines and
catalogues, is being sorted automatically.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000284">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">We have
talked quite a lot about how Royal Mail has continued to modernise its
operations with a considerable amount of investment. However, as with
any industry, manufacturing or service, investment is required to keep
abreast of developments. It is not just a matter of what has been done,
but a matter of looking to the future. It is not just a matter of new
equipment and innovations, but a matter of investment in replacing
older equipment, particularly in an industry such as Royal Mail, which
has a large number of vehicles. All those are cost items.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000285">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Through the
amendment, we are saying that we think it is important that Ofcom is
aware of the matter and takes into account the need for future
investment and service provision. That is why we would include, at the
end of subsection (5)(c),<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000286">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“the need for
future investment and service provision.”<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000388">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We think it is
important that that is taken in conjunction with the need to provide a
service or part of a service efficiently. We have had a long debate on
what we meant by “efficiently” and whether it was a good
thing to 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 607<a class="bkMark" name="Column607">&#160;</a>
                           </div>include it in the legislation. Here we want to amend the clause so that
efficiency does not stand there on its own, but stands with our
amendment, so that Ofcom can take a more realistic look, is not in a
situation of simply being driven by the need to maximise profits and
looks at the need for future investment to continue to provide the best
service. That is where amendment 90 stands. It is difficult for us to
support amendment 11 tabled by the hon. Member for Angus because it
slightly cuts across what we have proposed. However, before I press any
amendment to a vote, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say
to our
suggestions.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000287">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I understand the intention behind the amendments,
but I think they are unnecessary and, in the case of amendment 11,
unworkable.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000288">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 35
allows Ofcom to impose designated universal service provider
conditions, which will enable Ofcom, among other things, to require a
universal service provider to provide a universal postal service in
accordance with the standards set out in the universal postal service
order. Designated USP conditions may also set tariffs or price controls
for the provision of the universal postal
service.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000289">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
11 would, on the face of it, make a relatively minor change. The Bill,
as drafted, provides that Ofcom must seek to ensure that prices are
affordable, that prices take account of costs and that prices provide
incentives for the USP to provide an efficient service. This mirrors
the requirement in article 12 of the directive. The amendment would
delete “seek to” so that Ofcom must ensure these
objectives are
delivered.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000290">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">If
one reflects on that, one would understand why that would be quite
difficult. It would not be appropriate or workable for Ofcom to ensure,
in all instances, that prices were affordable, that they took account
of the costs of providing the service or that they provided efficiency
incentives. Let me explain that a little more, because however
attractive that idea might be, it is the practicalities that are of
concern to us.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000291">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">At any given
time, circumstances outside Ofcom’s control might make it
impossible for it to deliver such a commitment. For some unforeseeable
reason—for example, because of a change in accounting
methodology—it simply might not be possible for Ofcom to ensure
that prices took account of costs. In such a scenario, Ofcom would, of
course, still be under a duty to seek to ensure that they did, but it
could not reasonably be expected to ensure that they did. The clause
builds in sufficient flexibility to deal with such a scenario, and I
hope that my explanation satisfies hon. Members. Although the hon.
Member for Angus is not here, I think he will understand why amendment
11 is not
needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000292">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Amendment
90 would make a different change altogether. It would add a requirement
on Ofcom, when setting price control tariffs, to seek to ensure not
only that the prices provided incentives for the USP to be efficient,
but that the level of the prices took into account the need for future
investment and service provision. Obviously, one understands the
rationale behind the proposal, but it really is not needed.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000293">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Clause 28
provides that Ofcom must carry out all its functions in a way that it
considers will secure the provision of a universal service. In doing
so, it must 
<div class="columnNumber">
			Column number: 608<a class="bkMark" name="Column608">&#160;</a>
                           </div>have regard to the need for the provision of the universal service to be
financially sustainable and efficient, and the hon. Lady can refer back
to our discussions on those points. The need for future investment and
service provision is clearly implicitly included in those
considerations. It is difficult to see how Ofcom could fulfil the key
duties in clause 28 if it was not taking account of investment. In
setting price controls, Ofcom will have to give consideration to those
primary duties, so the amendment is not needed, and I hope that the
hon. Lady will not pursue
it.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000294">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> We still feel that it is important that the
future need for modernisation and investment is taken into
consideration. It is not sufficient for Ofcom just to look at prices in
terms of incentives to provide the service efficiently. Given the way
in which paragraph (c) is worded, we want to press amendment 90 to a
vote, because it adds a different dimension and introduces a more
realistic appraisal of the costs and the way in which a universal
service provider must look to the future to make sure that it can
invest appropriately. On that note, I would like to press amendment 90
to a vote.

                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
amendment is about making a report concerning each of the devolved
Administrations, not because we want a fragmented service that is
different in any of the devolved territories, but because of the
importance of Royal Mail with its universal service to the devolved
territories, and the interest that the devolved Administrations take in
its
future.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000321">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The
universal service is particularly important to small businesses, and
links in with the devolved Administrations’ responsibilities for
economic development. They know how important the universal postal
service is to the many small businesses in their territories, and they
have put by significant sums of money for investment in their post
office programmes. They are particularly keen to have full consultation
about the future of the universal service provision. The amendment
would require an independently audited performance report to be
published annually on the specific Government
territories.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000322">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> I often begin by making the point that the
Bill’s overall aim is to secure the universal service. By
definition, that service benefits consumers throughout the United
Kingdom. If I have understood the  hon. Lady’s
intentions correctly, she is keen to ensure that there is no reduction
in service in the devolved Administrations. The amendment would place
an additional requirement on Ofcom to publish an annual independently
audited performance report concerning each of the devolved Government
territories. I understand her intentions, but hon. Members have no
cause for concern. Ofcom already has statutory duties and powers
relating to consumers, and the Bill extends them to cover the interests
of postal service consumers. Furthermore, Ofcom has well established
advisory committees representing the interests and opinions of those
living and working in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Those committees offer advice to Ofcom on the needs of those they
represent.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000323">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
assure the hon. Lady that the universal service is for the benefit of
consumers throughout the entire United Kingdom, and preserving it for
all consumers is what the Bill is about. Given that existing
protection, I invite her to withdraw her
amendment.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000324">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> As I have said, the devolved Administrations
have a particular interest because we know that considerable sums of
money have been invested in providing updated post office counters and
so on. It would be very nice if those post office counters were
protected in the Bill with some reference to access points or a
specific reference to the Post Office. The interest of the devolved
Administrations is specific, because of the money that they have put
in. That is why we bring it to the Minister’s attention a second
time this morning, and why we want the provision about the publication
of information on performance, with specific relevance to the devolved
territories.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000325">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">However, if
the Minister can give a full assurance that all the necessary
consultation will take place, perhaps it will be possible for us to
consider withdrawing the amendment; but I do not really see why we
should. It is

                           </div>a perfectly good amendment and would ensure that there was additional
involvement for the devolved Administrations. On that basis, I will

                           </strong> We now embark on a new and different chapter,
and no doubt the hon. Member for Bedford will be extolling the virtues
of the opportunity for all sorts of providers to use the final mile of
the Royal Mail. It has certainly been a matter for considerable
discussion in the past. Hon. Members may recall that way back in the
Hooper report and again in the evidence

                           </div>sessions at the beginning of our sittings there was considerable concern
about the exact operation of the arrangements.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000352">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">There were
two sides to the story: Royal Mail always reckoned that it did not have
the right price for the provision of the universal service for that
last mile, and that therefore those who were, in the jargon, joining
upstream—bulk carriers such as TNT, who do a lot of mailing for
large companies and put a lot of similar, easy-to-sort and
easy-to-deal-with mail in one place, at one price, for companies that
want that—would pass it on to Royal Mail for the difficult bit,
or the last mile.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000353">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Therefore
Royal Mail felt that the prices were not effective for it, and did not
take into account its real costs. It considered that the arrangement
was an unfair form of competition. On the other hand, submissions from
some competitor providers argued the other case—that there was
not in fact such difficulty for Royal Mail, and that it was those
competitors who were perhaps not getting a fair deal.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000354">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">The clause is
immensely important in trying to get things right for the future and
ensure that Ofcom’s role under the clause will be performed
effectively. We do not want to end up with a situation like that in
which Postcomm was accused by both sides of not getting the sums right
or doing things correctly and
properly.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000355">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">Our
amendment 106 would insert, at the end of subsection
(4)(b):<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000356">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="hs_brev">“provided
in either case that such action would not be likely to adversely affect
the ability of the provider to provide the universal postal service in

                        <p class="tabbed">We
want to insert that because we understand why people want
competition—the hon. Member for Bedford made a good case for
competition and all its possible benefits. However, we have the strange
situation of what the Bill describes as the
“burdens”—that is not me putting in an emotive
aspect, but because the additional responsibility or cost of that final
mile is well
recognised.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000357">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">While
Ofcom is looking at the universal service provision conditions, and in
particular the access conditions, our amendment would provide that it
needed to take into account each of the following purposes. We would
not just extend paragraph (b) so as to promote effective competition
but also put in an amendment that would, in some ways, seek to protect
how the universal service is provided—in other words, it would
not be
detrimental.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000358">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> The hon. Lady is extremely generous in giving
way—perhaps too generous. As my hon. Friend pointed out, I
rather jumped the gun when discussing a previous amendment, in
extolling the virtues of competition, but I was getting warmed up for
now.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000360">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">Is
the hon. Lady concerned that her amendment is drawn so widely that it
gives a provider the opportunity to cry wolf all the time? The
definition of what might adversely affect a provider’s ability
is so broadly drawn that it could have the chilling effect of damping
down any form of competition whatsoever.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000361">&#160;</a>

                           </strong> That is an interesting observation. The
difficulty is how to leave a regulator any leeway in which to operate
if some things are not widely drawn. We have had that discussion, in
part, elsewhere in the Bill. The Minister has pointed out that Ofcom
needs some leeway, while we have tried to tighten up on that leeway.
Here is a possible opportunity for Ofcom to have such discretion, but
if it is not stated in the Bill—in other words, without the
requirement to look carefully at what might affect the universal
service provision and the ability of any universal service provider to
provide that service for the last mile—I am not sure where that
protection is to come from. It is easy to open the doors to all sorts
of competitors, but it is much more difficult to provide the necessary
framework and protection for the provider of the universal service
provision.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000362">&#160;</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="tabbed">I
do not know whether the hon. Gentleman had any particular example in
mind, but we thought Ofcom ought to have the opportunity to have as a
must that it has got to do something. It can then turn around and say,
“Well, the reason we have had to set such and such a price is
because we had to take into consideration the needs of the universal
service provider.” That is precisely the sort of criticism that
Postcomm came under previously. Ofcom would then have a legitimate
reason to look at such matters but, I hope, with enough flexibility for
it to be able to make an appropriate judgment and balance the pros and
the cons and the necessary factors that have to be taken into
consideration when allowing for certain access provisions and when
setting certain
prices.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000363">&#160;</a>

                        <p>The
purposes are not (a) or (b) or (c) as under the 2009 Bill, but the
condition has to be appropriate for each of (a) and (b) and (c)
provisions. To make it more appropriate for the universal service
provider, we would not remove “promoting efficiency”. In
the past, we have been accused of wanting to do that. For obvious
reasons, we would not remove the provision under paragraph (c)

                        <p>nor
would we remove the idea of effective competition. We are not saying
that there should not be competition. Sometimes, we are portrayed as a
monolithic, dinosaur socialist party. At some stage, the Minister was
trying to convey to us some rather insulting
comments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000366">&#160;</a>

                        <p class="tabbed">We
are saying that there should be competition, but that Ofcom would need
to look carefully at the way in which people were to have access, to
what they were let access for and for what price. That would need to be
balanced by the needs of the universal service provider. Obviously, we
want the provider to continue to provide the service as specified under
the standard in the universal postal service order. That is why we
specifically want to include such a provision in the clause. We are not
anticompetitive. We simply want a firm way in which to ensure proper
consideration of all the
arguments.<a class="bkMark" name="10120733000367">&#160;</a>

95 deals with the condition being commercially negotiated at a proper
commercial price. An earlier argument in respect of Postcomm was that
the price was not a real reflection of the cost. If something were
commercially negotiated, we would hope that both sides agreed the right
price for the job to be done. The amendment would link in clearly with
the need for

between Royal Mail and the Post Office, the hon. Lady spoke eloquently
about disparities in commercial negotiations, and about her desire to
maintain the agreement between the two for a very extended period. Will
she admit that, in these circumstances, we find ourselves in a
situation of even greater disparity of competition between a Royal Mail
monopoly provider of the last-mile service and a potential entrant into
that market, which—if subject to the amendment—would

undermine the universal service obligation. If the hon. Lady does not
accept that amendment 106 would be chilling on competition and perhaps
