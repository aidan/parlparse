&#145;stated in
it.&#146;.</div><a name="09031255000023"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000242"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Good morning, Mrs. Humble. We
are about to discuss technical, drafting amendments. 
Subsection (2)(b) of clause 10 requires that the
apprenticeship sector concerned must be stated in the framework.
Amendment 157 is intended to make it clear that only one apprenticeship
sector will be stated in each apprenticeship framework. The original
drafting on that point was ambiguous.</div>
<a name="09031255000025"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 15
enables the Secretary of State to make an order providing certain
transitional provisions for an apprenticeship framework. The technical,
drafting amendment to clause 15 has a mirror amendment to clause 20 on
Wales. Amendments 163 and 171 put it beyond doubt that the sector to
which the clauses refer is an apprenticeship sector as defined under
clause
38.</div><a name="09031255000026"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause
23 provides the Secretary of State with the power to direct the chief
executive of Skills Funding  to prepare modifications to the
specification of apprenticeship standards for England and submit them
to the Secretary of State. Clause 23(4) makes it clear that the
Secretary of State may not make an order bringing modifications into
effect unless he is satisfied that the modified specification complies
with the requirements of the content of the specification under clause
25. Amendment 173 is a technical, drafting amendment merely
intended to achieve consistency with clause 22(2), which deals with the
same point when an order is made bringing a specification of standards
into effect for the first time. Amendment 174 is a mirror amendment in
respect of
Wales.</div><a name="09031255000027"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
draw attention to several drafting amendments to clause 30, which sets
out the meaning of &#147;apprenticeship agreement&#148; in England
and Wales. The agreement will be a contract entered into between the
apprentice and the employer. It will contain terms that will be set out
in a prescribed form. It is intended that the agreement will 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column236" />Column number: 236</div>include, among other things, on-the-job training and learning away from
the work station. Amendment 175 reflects the fact that clause 30(4) is
making provision about circumstances in which an agreement will be
treated as meeting one of the criteria for being an apprenticeship
agreement under subjection (2). Removing &#147;apprenticeship&#148;
from the first line of page 14 of the Bill avoids circularity in the
provision.</div><a name="09031255000028"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment
176 ensures that the three-year period specified under clause 30(5) is
instead specified under subsection (4)(a), the subsection to which it
relates. Amendments 177 and 178 are consequent on that amendment, and
amendment 186 corrects a cross-reference under clause 79. Finally,
amendment 187 is a technical, drafting amendment to make it clear that
the statutory instrument containing regulations made under
clauses 5 or 9 is subject to an annulment by resolution of
the National Assembly for Wales.</div>

John Hayes</b> (South Holland and The Deepings) (Con): The

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000246"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We return to our efforts to make this bad Bill
better with enthusiasm and vigour&#151;and if the second is rather
less than the first this morning, it is because the lobster thermidor,
which the Minister specifically recommended to me and on which I dined
in the small hours, rested more heavily on me in the slightly larger
hours than I would have wished; however, not as heavily as the Bill
rests on his shoulders, and we have tabled the amendment in that
spirit.</div>
<a name="09031255000035"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
explanatory notes make it clear that sector skills councils will issue
apprenticeship frameworks for England. The Opposition support that. I
have said before that we strongly support the role of sector skills
councils for reasons that we have set out and for many of the reasons
set out by the Minister. Their closeness to employers means that they
can articulate their skills needs and ensure that frameworks match
those
needs.</div><a name="09031255000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">Subsection
(1)(a) allows a body to &#147;issue apprenticeship frameworks
generally&#148;, rather than for a specific sector. The risk is that
that could lead to generic apprenticeships. As I have argued, we are
anxious that apprenticeships be tailored at every level and in all ways
to particular needs. The prospect of a ubiquitous apprenticeship does
not sit comfortably with our vision. The Government have started to
advance amendments by which frameworks will relate specifically to one
sector. Indeed, we have heard something of those and will no doubt hear
more. I am at a loss to understand why they do not leave this
contradiction alone all together and step beyond it.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column237" />Column number: 237</div><a name="09031255000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">When taking
the evidence of expert witnesses, it was made clear to the Committee
that generic apprenticeships&#151;or ubiquitous apprenticeships, as I
have described them&#151;are not worth the paper they are written on
because they are not respected by employers and so do not add to the
employability of apprentices. In the evidence session, the CBI said
that the most important thing is
that</div><a name="09031255000199"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the
programme is more fit for purpose&#151;delivering the sort of skills
that are in demand by businesses.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 6,
Q5.]</div><a name="09031255000038"></a><div class="hs_Para">We must
therefore ensure that frameworks are of the highest
quality.</div><a name="09031255000039"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
do not know whether you, Mrs. Humble, or other Committee
members shared my feelings last week, but I felt that I was beginning
to deliver this point with persuasiveness sufficient to change the
Minister&#146;s mind. I felt once or twice that I touched his heart.
I do not know whether it was due to the intellectual force of my
argument or the silky persuasiveness with which it was delivered, but
on occasion he looked as if he had the stomach to acknowledge the force
of our argument and the weakness of his own. That proves beyond doubt
that the way to a man&#146;s stomach is through his heart. He did
not, however, go as far as he might have done on the frameworks. The
purpose of the amendment is to push him that extra
mile.</div><a name="09031255000040"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
think that all Committee members, and certainly the Minister, will
agree that quality will come from getting the frameworks right. In the
evidence sessions, Keith Marshall of the Alliance of Sector Skills
Councils made that clear when he
said:</div><a name="09031255000200"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
key to this is the framework. If we get the framework right, it will
ensure that the quality is
maintained.&#148;<i class="I">&#151;&#151;</i>[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill Committee,
</i>3 March 2009; c. 9,
Q19.]</div><a name="09031255000041"></a><div class="hs_Para">If a
generic framework is issued, the quality of all apprenticeship
frameworks will be undermined. It will also damage the apprenticeship
brand, which I am determined we should avoid. As I said, I know that
the Minister is gradually and grudgingly coming to the same
conclusion.</div><a name="09031255000042"></a><div class="hs_Para">A
tangential issue is the status of sector skills councils. It was clear
from the evidence session that Mr. Marshall, the
representative of sector skills councils, was not entirely happy about
the way their status is diminished in the Bill; they play little part
in it. The Minister is right that they play a large part in the
explanatory notes, but I am not sure that that satisfies sector skills
councils or us. Sector skills councils are particularly important in
the development, publication and implementation of frameworks, which is
why they are so pertinent to the amendments and to these
clauses.</div>
<a name="09031255000043"></a><div class="hs_Para">In the
evidence sessions, the Minister for Schools and Learners asked the
representative of the sector skills
councils:</div><a name="09031255000201"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;should
we mention that in primary
legislation?&#148;,</div><a name="09031255000044"></a><div class="hs_Para">to
which Mr. Marshall
replied:</div><a name="09031255000202"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;You
specifically mentioned other organisations and agencies in other parts
of the overall system, but not
there.&#148;</div><a name="09031255000045"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister open-mindedly&#151;I thought&#151;went
on:</div><a name="09031255000203"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;And
you would like us to?&#148;&#151;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report,
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Public Bill
Committee</i>, 3 March 2009; c. 21,
Q60-61.]</div><a name="09031255000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">Mr.
Marshall unequivocally answered that he would.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column238" />Column number: 238</div><a name="09031255000047"></a><div class="hs_Para">So those
representatives of business&#151;the Minister spoke fondly of them
when we met last&#151;clearly want to be mentioned not just in the
explanatory notes, but in detail in the Bill. The Minister surely
agrees that the sector skills councils are the bodies to take forward
apprenticeship frameworks. If that is the case, why not agree to the
amendment?</div><a name="09031255000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">More
significantly, sector skills councils favour tailoring frameworks to
one sector. Why, therefore, is there the need to &#147;issue
apprenticeship frameworks generally&#148;? The clause should be
specific on that, so that educators, employers, learners and potential
learners receive the training that they need and so that they know that
they will receive it. It is imperative that the amendment is agreed
to.</div><a name="09031255000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">Once
again, I see that my case is beginning to resonate here and elsewhere.
We debate the Bill in a context in which the representatives of
employers have been sceptical, the champions of adult learning have
been doubtful, and the colleges, in the Minister&#146;s words, have
been surprisingly critical. The Minister seems to stands alone, and I
want to assure him by the means and in the detail of today&#146;s
amendments that he is not alone. We are on his side in trying to make
this bad Bill
better.</div><a name="09031255000050"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000247"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I start by addressing the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
remarks about my stomach. I remind him&#151;this is
pertinent&#151;of the words of the great reformer and radical William
Cobbett, who memorably said that you cannot agitate a man on a full
stomach. I was up very early this morning, as is often my custom, and
have therefore had two breakfasts since my rising. I have a full
stomach and am afraid that I am not susceptible to agitation in the
manner he has described. The hon. Gentleman also wondered whether he
had succeeded in inciting my feelings or intellect. He is almost
beginning to incite some feelings but my intellect remains absolutely
steely against his silken
words.</div><a name="09031255000051"></a><div class="hs_Para">Turning
to the substance of the matter, I wish to reassure him that there is no
such thing as generic apprenticeships and no intention to create them.
The word &#147;generally&#148; in the clause does not in any sense
imply &#147;generic&#148;. The clause enables the Secretary of
State to designate a person to issue apprenticeship frameworks in
England, either generally or for particular sectors. Clause 16 contains
a similar measure for Wales. The frameworks are high-level curricula
for an apprenticeship in a specified career and it is essential that
the right issuing bodies are identified and maintained in order to
ensure that high standards of apprenticeships are
preserved.</div>
<a name="09031255000211"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">9.15
am</div><a name="09031255000052"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
understand the intention behind the amendment, which would mean that
the Secretary of State could not designate the person to issue
frameworks generally across a range of sectors.</div>
<a name="09031255000053"></a><div class="hs_Para">Last year, in
&#147;World-class Apprenticeships: Unlocking talent, building skills
for all&#148;, we set out our commitment to streamlining and reducing
bureaucracy in the process of developing and approving apprenticeship
frameworks. Our intention is to designate sector skills councils as
English issuing authorities. Working in partnership with standard
setting bodies, SSCs will have a key role in ensuring quality
apprenticeship frameworks that comply with the specification of
apprenticeship standards for England. We look to SSCs to focus their
activities on 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column239" />Column number: 239</div>working with employers to increase the number of good quality
employer-led apprenticeship places and to support employers in bringing
forward frameworks tailored to their business
needs.</div><a name="09031255000054"></a><div class="hs_Para">We
welcome the work being led by the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils to
develop streamlined arrangements for the development and issuing of
apprenticeship frameworks, which will prepare the way for an even
brighter future. It is important to recognise&#151;this is the
crucial point&#151;that we do not have full sector skills coverage
for every occupation in which there may, occasionally and
exceptionally, be a need to have apprenticeship frameworks. It
therefore makes sense to retain the possibility, against such an
eventuality, that a pan-sector body such as the Alliance of Sector
Skills Councils could issue frameworks if
necessary.</div><a name="09031255000055"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000248"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Is that
likely?</div><a name="09031255000056"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000249"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> The assumption is that frameworks will be issued by
sector skills councils for their particular sectors. I think that I
will have a secondary and then a tertiary assumption, which is not
something that I have often had before. The secondary assumption is
that all efforts will be made to achieve coherence and simplicity, and
to fit every framework that can be so fitted into a definable and
discernible sector skills council sector.</div>
<a name="09031255000057"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
assumption is that in the cases that do not easily fit the preference
will be for an existing sector skills council to lean over and extend
itself to try to embrace the anomalous case. Our hope is that those
three different hierarchies of possibility will encompass every
eventuality. We have tabled the clause simply to allow for the
possibility, which we hope will not happen, that the Alliance of Sector
Skills Councils needs to issue frameworks that do not fit any existing
sector.</div>
<a name="09031255000058"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000250"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Because of the stratified, multi-tiered approach,
it is extremely unlikely that the Bill would be used in that
way.</div>
<a name="09031255000059"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000251"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> My judgment is that it is unlikely. Our hope and
our preference is that it does not occur. The power exists in case
matters cannot be resolved according to the hierarchy of the three
different ways that I listed. It makes sense to keep the possibility
that a body such as the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils could issue
frameworks if necessary. However, the Bill makes clear that at any time
only one person may issue frameworks relating to one particular
apprenticeship sector.</div>
<a name="09031255000060"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that I
have satisfied the hon. Gentleman and given the members of the
Committee the assurances that they require so that they will feel able
to withdraw the amendment, the purpose and intention of which, as I
have said, I understand and
appreciate.</div><a name="09031255000061"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
shall speak to two technical Government amendments, one of which,
amendment 158, is required to enable the Secretary of State to amend or
revoke the designation of a person to issue apprenticeship frameworks.
That is necessary in case of future changes in policy or, for example,
in the composition or coverage of a sector skills council. Without it,
the Secretary of State could not change the designated authority from
time to time, as operational requirements dictate. Amendment 165 gives
analogous powers to Welsh Ministers.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000252"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It was good to have William Cobbett at such an
early hour. The Minister, with his estimable literary grasp, will know
that it was that great Tory, Dr. Johnson, who said that a lack of
manual dexterity constitutes a form of ignorance. The Conservative
Benches are committed to the apprenticeship system&#151;to transmit
manual dexterity or, as I prefer to put it, to elevate the
practical&#151;which is why we want the framework to be as tightly
constructed as
possible.</div><a name="09031255000063"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Minister gave a well structured argument about how this part of the
Bill might come to effect. He said that there were primary, secondary
and tertiary levels at which frameworks might be defined. The frailty
in what appeared to be a good argument, however, is that the secondary
stage of his chronology&#151;he presented it in a chronological
fashion&#151;contradicts the tertiary stage. Sector skills councils
need to have the flexibility to step outside their existing remit to
embrace new challenges. That is entirely right, because the economy is
dynamic&#151;increasingly so as it becomes more advanced&#151;as
are skills needs. We need to be able to redesign apprenticeship
frameworks and to alter the scope of sector skills councils as
necessary. If that is what sector skills councils will be able to do,
we shall never reach that tertiary stage when the Alliance of Sector
Skills Councils has to step in, because in the Minister&#146;s
secondary stage we are giving sector skills councils the flexibility
necessary to do that job
themselves.</div><a name="09031255000064"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Alliance of Sector Skills Councils thinks the same. It does not
perceive an occasion on which it would have to override a sector skills
council. It sees itself as an umbrella organisation, of course ensuring
a degree of consistency; certainly articulating the case for the role
of sector skills council; and, yes, communicating the collective voice
of sector skills councils on the Bill and other related matters. I am
not sure that the alliance would necessarily want the frameworks to be
slackened. Indeed, the evidence from Mr. Marshall suggested
the opposite&#151;that it did not want what I describe as generic
apprenticeships. However, that is the possibility&#151;faint though
it might be&#151;that could result from the well intentioned
provision of a well intentioned
Minister.</div><a name="09031255000065"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000253"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I want to restate that there is no question of the
unlikely-to-be-used power that we want to give to a body such as the
Alliance of Sector Skills Councils overriding the duty on sector skills
councils to produce frameworks&#151;quite the reverse. We are talking
about a situation in which a particular framework cannot find a home,
the possibility of a framework needing to be picked up. There is no
question of overriding; the hierarchy is the other way
around.</div><a name="09031255000066"></a><div class="hs_Para">There
is no question of loosening, slackening or generalising, and everything
that the hon. Gentleman said about how apprenticeships are by their
very nature sector specific is absolutely right and I agree. However,
yesterday I was talking to a parliamentary colleague who did an
engineering apprenticeship in the 1950s&#151;the golden days of
apprenticeships, as the hon. Gentleman would have it, when an
apprenticeship was a proper apprenticeship&#151;and I asked him what
the difference was. He said that they were a lot more general than they
are now. Given that he defines a good apprenticeship
as&#151;</div><a name="09031255000067"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000254"></a>The
Chairman:</b> Order. I must interrupt the Minister. He is
making an intervention which is becoming a
speech.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column241" />Column number: 241</div><a name="09031255000068"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000255"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> As I said at the outset, Mrs. Humble,
you are firm but fair.</div>
<a name="09031255000069"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
switches seamlessly, but that apparent seamlessness does not fool
Opposition Members. He switches from a chronology to a hierarchy. He
started by saying that there was a process which will be exhausted
until the point that this power will be used. We then moved to a
hierarchical argument. I am not sure that this power would ever be used
if the flexibility in his secondary stage&#151;we will use his
structure for the sake of clarity&#151;were there. I think the sector
skills councils should, as he says, expand their scope to take into
account dynamic skills needs and a changing remit. That flexibility, if
sufficient, would avoid the need for his tertiary level. He said
himself that he did not like a three-stage process and that he would
have rather have a simpler one. So why not accept this amendment,
bolster the power of the sector skills councils to expand their range
to respond in the way we both wish they could and introduce a
Government amendment to strengthen that part of the
Bill?</div>
<a name="09031255000070"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000256"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Three points. First, I want to make it clear that
the hierarchies and chronologies that I have described are in no sense
intended to be a formal part of the process. These are constructs that
I have recently invented to try to explain the situation to the
Committee as I understand it. Secondly, the hon. Gentleman&#146;s
dichotomy between a chronology and a hierarchy is entirely false
because it is perfectly possible to have a chronological hierarchy.
Finally, what does he think we should do if a very valuable framework
needs to be made and we cannot find a sector skills council that wants
to take ownership of
it?</div><a name="09031255000071"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000257"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> My goodness, we have a range of sector skills
councils which covers an immense number of frameworks and disciplines
and a wide range of skills. I would expect those sector skills councils
to consult on this and certainly to be in discussion with the
Government. Surely they should be able to respond and embrace those
additional challenges in the way that he describes. Adding this extra
element&#151;be it a hierarchy or not, and I see that he is rushing
away from his hierarchical argument, lest anyone feel that they have in
these few moments been demoted in some way&#151;is unnecessary. I
cannot see why we need all of this complexity. The sector skills
councils should be able to do the job. I trust them to do so and I hope
that the Minister does
too.</div><a name="09031255000072"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000258"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I will not keep interrupting the hon. Gentleman to
restate the same point in different ways but what he has described is
exactly what we envisage will happen. All that he disputes is a power
that we have put in the Bill just in case it does not happen. It
should, and we think it will, happen as he described. However, he
surely must agree that it is conceivable that it may not happen,
particularly as the sector skills councils have a strict focus on their
own sectors that is so disciplined and sector
specific.</div><a name="09031255000073"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000259"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Let us move up a gear, up the hierarchy and along
the chronology, and explore this a little more fully. The truth is that
we should not be passing anything we do not need to in this place. We
should not add to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column242" />Column number: 242</div>Bills things that are never going to happen or for distant eventualities
that are extremely unlikely. The truth is that we are doubtful about
the creation of generic apprenticeships and worry that the
apprenticeship brand will be diluted. As I have said before, we think
that the Government might even, in their less noble moments, be seduced
into doing just that.</div>

structure, perhaps with additional flexibility of the kind the Minister
and I both advocate. For that reason, we will press the

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000276"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Government amendments 158 and 165 are minor
amendments that ensure that the Secretary of State can amend or revoke
the designation of a person to issue an apprenticeship framework. That
is intended to make the system work and is justified, as the Minister
said in his brief words, as an operational requirement. It is
operational requirements that often dictate the revocation or amendment
linked to an apprenticeship. The question to be asked is what these
operational requirements actually are, but the Minister did not make
that clear in his opening remarks. What are the circumstances in which
the Government would seek to revoke a designation, and to whom would
they consider redesignating
it?</div><a name="09031255000097"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000280"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> These amendments aim to reduce bureaucracy in the
formation of frameworks by ensuring that the information an issuing
authority requests from a person developing the draft apprenticeship
framework is not too onerous, and that the issuing authority makes the
person aware of their decision within two weeks. The hon. Gentleman
will know that the priority for many employers&#151;particularly
small and medium enterprises, as I know from my experience as a
businessman&#151;is the day-to-day running of their business, never
more so than in the current economic circumstances. Many SMEs already
feel hamstrung by red tape and bureaucracy. I do not need to expand on
that at length because Ministers and members of the Committee will be
only too aware of the complaints that those businesses and their
representative organisations make in that regard. It should therefore
be our determined ambition to reduce regulation, except where it is
absolutely necessary.</div>
<a name="09031255000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">If we are to
re-focus apprenticeships to the skills demands that I mentioned in the
debate on the earlier amendments and if we are to put apprenticeships
at the heart of our response to the skills crisis, it is imperative
that employers find the development and deployment of apprenticeships
as straightforward as possible. I do not wish to suggest that good
apprenticeships are not available now nor that apprentices do not learn
important things which add to their employability. There are excellent
programmes and frameworks with employers engaged in a full and valuable
way. But I am certain that the only way that we can rebuild and
rejuvenate the apprenticeship programme more generally is from the
bottom up. We must engage SMEs in the necessary spread of
apprenticeships. In every village and small town, there are countless
businesses that could take on an apprentice, but one barrier to that
happening is what they perceive as excessive bureaucracy. It is vitally
important that we take that into account and try to improve the Bill by
reducing regulation and so add incentive to that bottom-up rejuvenation
of the system by
SMEs.</div><a name="09031255000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
House of Lords Select Committee on Economic Affairs noted that
employers find administrative burdens associated with apprenticeships
unacceptable and its report, &#147;Apprenticeship: a key route to
skills&#148; found that</div>
<a name="09031255000204"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Witnesses
stressed that procedures for the administration of government funding
of apprenticeship had the effect of marginalising employers (Unwin and
Fuller Q 77; Ashton p 173).&#148;</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column244" />Column number: 244</div><a name="09031255000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">The draft
Apprenticeships Bill took steps to remedy this. As the Minister will
know, the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Committee found
that</div>
<a name="09031255000205"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;Taking
the draft Bill as a whole, we conclude that, for those employers
represented by the CBI and the British Chambers of Commerce, the draft
Bill has the potential to deliver two of their key requirements: a
reduction in unnecessary bureaucracy through greater flexibility and
streamlining of the central government agencies supporting
apprenticeships.&#148;</div><a name="09031255000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
truth is that the merging of the draft Apprenticeships Bill with this
Bill means that it now falls a long way short of its potential. We make
no bones about it&#151;less administration, less bureaucracy is what
employers want. We know that from what they have said themselves. The
Federation of Small Businesses described cutting red tape and
bureaucracy around apprenticeships as a &#147;carrot&#148; to their
development&#151;the incentive that I mentioned a few moments ago.
The British Chambers of Commerce has
said,</div><a name="09031255000206"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;For
years businesses have made it abundantly clear that they find the
paperwork associated with taking on apprentices a real
barrier.&#148;</div><a name="09031255000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
CBI response to world class apprenticeships said that</div>
<a name="09031255000207"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;the removal of
unnecessary red tape and greater simplification must be a key
focus&#148;.</div><a name="09031255000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendments are small steps to remedy the over-regulation and
administrative burden that this provision will place on employers. I
repeat: it is desirable but not enough to add apprentices to large
businesses that have well established and well respected programmes,
such as BT, Honda, Rolls-Royce and others. It is not enough, because
that is not the way that we will build enough extra apprenticeships to
deliver the skills that our economy needs. I hope that the Minister
will deal with that point in his response.</div>
<a name="09031255000111"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to see
100,000 more apprenticeships. That is why we have set out our policies
on the subject in our skills Green Paper. It is built around
incentivising small businesses, partly by providing them with funds,
but also by removing the barriers. It is about supply-side reform and
the amendments go some way towards improving the Bill in that
regard.</div><a name="09031255000112"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031255000281"></a><b class="B">Alison

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000282"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> The test of reasonableness is not unusual in
legislation or in law. However, in these terms, I would expect it to
take into account what employer representatives felt was acceptable,
and what the sector skills councils&#151;which we mentioned earlier
and which are centrally involved in apprenticeship
frameworks&#151;felt was tolerable. In discussion with Government,
that mix could come to a definition of reasonableness that by all
accounts is not what we have now. I have offered some examples of that
to the Committee this morning.</div>
<a name="09031255000114"></a><div class="hs_Para">Most
employers&#151;including those in the hon. Lady&#146;s
constituency, which I take careful note of&#151;and those in mine,
and their representative organisations, seem tofeel that at the moment
we are not being reasonable about regulation, bureaucracy and red tape.
To achieve the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column245" />Column number: 245</div>reasonableness that she personifies&#151;which I merely seek to
emulate&#151;we need to lighten the burden rather than add to
it.</div>
<a name="09031255000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">The risk of
all legislation is that it adds to administrative burdens. Almost by
definition, that is the case. As we scrutinise the Bill, we should be
determined to strip out all that is not necessary to our shared
ambition to make apprenticeships a bigger part of how we respond to the
economic downturn and rebuild the nation&#146;s skills. In that
spirit, I ask the hon. Lady, the Minister and others to consider the
amendments carefully and I wait to hear what the Minister says with
bated breath.</div>
<a name="09031255000116"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031255000283"></a><b class="B">Stephen
Williams</b> (Bristol, West) (LD): I rise briefly to support
the amendments. It is obvious that if a business or a training provider
puts forward a draft proposal for an apprenticeship framework, there
should be information to accompany it. That information should be clear
in advance. It is not clear how the business or the training provider
will know in advance exactly what they need to provide alongside their
application. However, as long as it is clear in advance, that should
mitigate any misunderstandings and areas that later need
clarification.</div>
<a name="09031255000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">If certain
areas need to be questioned by the body that will approve the
apprenticeship framework, such requests for further information should
not be onerous. If the application amounts to a refusal, the refusal
notice should be clear and given on a timely basis. I hope that the
Minister will clarify the process for the applicant who comes back with
a fresh or slightly amended proposal after a refusal. What time scales
are envisaged in order to get that apprenticeship framework agreed as
soon as
possible?</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000284"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I can reassure Opposition Members that we agree
entirely that the process of agreeing apprenticeship frameworks needs
to be as unbureaucratic and unburdensome as possible. Where we differ
in that respect is that we are convinced that the Bill contains such
injunctions, which I will come on to explain. However, we equally share
the hon. Gentleman&#146;s determination that the process be
streamlined and effective&#151;particularly for small
businesses.</div>
<a name="09031255000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">Sector skills
councils have streamlined the process; they are in the process of
making it more streamlined, and will continue to do so. We have reduced
the burden of data collection, we have already streamlined the
framework developing and issuing process so that employers can develop
in-house training programmes as frameworks, provided that they comply
with the SASE. We have already asked sector skills councils to
streamline processes further in the forthcoming months and
years.</div>
<a name="09031255000120"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clause 14
sets out the procedure for when individuals and organisations submit
draft apprenticeship framework to an issuing authority and request that
it be published as a framework. If the issuing authority chooses not to
publish it as a framework, then they must give a reason for that
decision. Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 both aim to ensure that the
issuing authority does not require unreasonable or burdensome amounts
of information to be submitted alongside the draft framework.</div>
<a name="09031255000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am
sympathetic to those outcomes, but we believe that the Bill will do
that job. We included a commitment in &#147;World-class
Apprenticeships&#148; to streamlining the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column246" />Column number: 246</div>framework development process to make it more user-friendly to providers
and organisations and also to make it easier for them to develop
frameworks appropriate to their business. That is why the Bill ensures
that issuing authorities will be able to require only
&#147;appropriate&#148; information to be provided. If the
information requested is unduly burdensome, or unnecessary, it would
not be appropriate.</div>
<a name="09031255000122"></a><div class="hs_Para">I hope that
hon. Members will accept my assurance that this will be a light-touch
process&#151;only enough information to ensure that there is
sufficient rigour in meeting the requirements set out in the SASE will
be required. Rather than imposing a burden on providers and employers,
I expect that issuing authorities will work closely with providers and
employers to support them in getting their frameworks to that standard
as quickly as possible and to focus their efforts on reducing
significantly the current lengthy process, which can be involved,
before frameworks are available for learners to undertake
apprenticeships.</div>
<a name="09031255000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">Similarly, we
will ensure that the approval process after a draft framework is
submitted is as streamlined as possible. However, I am not persuaded
that it is sensible to require the framework issuing authority in
England to notify those submitting draft apprenticeship frameworks when
a draft has been rejected within a specified period of time, as
amendment 102 suggests. By applying a time limit, the issuing authority
will be held accountable for any breach of the proposed limit, even
when circumstances might arise that would reasonably prevent the
issuing authority from meeting any specified deadline.</div>
<a name="09031255000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">Issuing
authorities will be working hand in hand with those who are developing
frameworks and there should be no delay in making them aware of areas
where the draft framework does not comply with the specification of
apprenticeship standards for England. I will expect the issuing
authority to proceed quickly in its decision making during that
iterative process. Our intention is that, as part of its role in
performance managing the sector skills council, the UK Commission for
Employment and Skills will ensure the prompt issuing of
frameworks.</div>
<a name="09031255000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">I now turn to
the question from the hon. Member for Bristol, West, about what happens
if the sector skills council refuses to issue a framework. If the
framework complies properly with the specification of apprenticeships
standards in England&#151;if it fits&#151;the sector skills council
cannot refuse to issue the framework. Where the framework does not fit,
the sector skills council&#146;s job is to work as closely, quickly
and co-operatively as possible with the proposer to help them to make
it
fit.</div><a name="09031255000126"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000285"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> What representations has the Minister had from
sector skills councils? Have they complained about the bureaucratic
burden that deters SMEs and others from engaging with
apprenticeships?</div><a name="09031255000127"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000286"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I personally have not had any such representations.
I suppose that I need to remind the hon. Gentleman that I am not the
Minister with responsibility for apprenticeships. Therefore it is
conceivable that, if such representations have been made, they have
been made to the relevant Minister, Lord Young of Norwood Green, in the
other place. However, I am pretty nearly 100 per cent. certain that no
such representations have been made to him, as they have not been made
to me or to the Department in any other way.</div> 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column247" />Column number: 247</div><a name="09031255000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">In that case,
I hope that hon. Members will be persuaded that, given the use of the
word &#147;appropriate&#148; in the Bill, the provisions that they
sought to highlight with their amendments are included and that if we
amended the Bill as they wanted, it would be tautologous. On that
basis, therefore, I ask them to withdraw kindly and graciously their
amendments.</div><a name="09031255000129"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000287"></a>Mr.

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000290"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Clause 15 enables the Secretary of State to make an
order making certain transitional provisions in relation to
apprenticeship frameworks. This is intended to ensure that
apprenticeship frameworks that already exist when clause 12 comes into
force can be treated as if they are a framework issued under the terms
of the Bill. In turn, this is intended to allow a reasonable period for
new frameworks to be developed and issued, under the terms of the
specification of apprenticeship standards for England, and to ensure
that existing apprentices and those who are embarking on
apprenticeships over the next few years are not
disadvantaged.</div>
<a name="09031255000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">Amendment 159
is a technical amendment that will ensure that apprentices who are
participating in the apprenticeship scheme in part 4, also known as the
16 to 18 apprenticeship entitlement, can benefit from the transitional
provisions included in clause 15. Amendments 160 to 162 and 164 are
consequential amendments to clause 15. Amendments 167 to 170
and 172 make the same changes to clause 20, which applies in
Wales.</div>
<a name="09031255000137"></a><div class="hs_Para"><a name="09031255000291"></a><b class="B">Mr.
Nick Gibb</b> (Bognor Regis and Littlehampton) (Con): As the

amendments,
says:</div><a name="09031255000208"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order provide for an existing vocational
specification to be treated... as if it were an apprenticeship
framework&#148;.</div><a name="09031255000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">Obviously,
there need to be transitional arrangements. Our concern is about what,
precisely, will be in the order. Which existing vocational
specifications will become 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column248" />Column number: 248</div>apprenticeships? Again, it is about quality, as my hon. Friend the
Member for South Holland and The Deepings mentioned. The concern is to
ensure that this is not just another method of creating vast numbers of
apprenticeships out of things that are not actually apprenticeships. If
the Minister listed all the vocational specifications that he intends
to put in the order, it would help the
Committee.</div><a name="09031255000139"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
Government amendments seem to broaden the scope of clause 15 further by
extending the transitional arrangements to include apprenticeships for
16 to 18-year-olds. An assurance from the Minister about quality will
help to ensure that the amendments have a swift passage on to the
statute book.</div>
<a name="09031255000140"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000292"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Existing apprenticeships are all that we are
talking about. There is no question of reclassifying anything that is
not currently an apprenticeship as an apprenticeship. The regulations
will simply specify the various kinds of vocational training linked to
employment that can be apprenticeships and define the existing
apprenticeships as apprenticeships until transition. Those matters
require regulation because the legislation does not
exist.</div>
<a name="09031255000141"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000293"></a>Mr.

<a name="09031255000142"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000294"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> No: as he knows, a programme-led apprenticeship is
not defined as an apprenticeship now; we do not count it in our
listings of apprenticeships or in our current targets. It is not an
apprenticeship under the Bill and it will not be an apprenticeship in
the future.</div>
<a name="09031255000143"></a><div class="hs_Para">To restate my
answer to his hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton, an apprenticeship that is currently defined as an
apprenticeship under the blueprint will, by these regulations, be
defined as an apprenticeship for a discrete period. The day after the
school leaving date in 2013 is the maximum final point. Until then,
current apprenticeships will still be apprenticeships and nothing that
is not currently an apprenticeship will be an apprenticeship under
these regulations.</div>

providers of the existing provision to be consulted, whatevercourse is
rebadged on a transitional basis as qualifying under the framework. The
Minister said, in response to the hon. Members for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton and for South Holland and The Deepings, that this is a
transitional arrangement while the Bill, should it be passed, takes
effect. That arrangement will lapse, as I understand it, on the summer
2013 school leaving date.</div>
<a name="09031255000147"></a><div class="hs_Para">Of course, in

have tabled the amendment on consultation because there are students or

are training providers, which have designed and are teaching vocational
courses, that did not envisage that they would have to comply with the
provisions of the legislation. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and
Littlehampton has already asked for examples of such courses. The
Minister said that something currently considered as an apprenticeship
is the only course envisaged as being rebadged to qualify under the
legislation; I hope that he will confirm that. It is essential that if
a change is made in order to meet the requirements of the legislation,
existing providers are consulted on whether that will have any
ramifications for them, or if it is something that they would want to
agree
to.</div><a name="09031255000149"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000296"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> As I said, clause 15 is an enabling clause to
ensure that we have adequate transitional arrangements to protect those
apprentices currently training under existing frameworks. There is no
question of re-badging anything as an apprenticeship that is not an
apprenticeship. There are 180 frameworks, currently available for
apprenticeship training, which meet the requirements of the existing
blueprint. It is our intention, on introducing the new specification of
apprenticeship standards for England in August 2009, to allow
sufficient time for sector skills councils, and other organisations, to
develop frameworks that are compliant with the new standards.</div>
<a name="09031255000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have
committed to, and just discussed, streamlining the process for issuing
frameworks. It is an important and serious business. Quality, as the
hon. Gentleman is fond of saying, is also important and so the
development and introduction of the new frameworks is not going to
happen overnight. We need a transitional period to allow for the new
frameworks to be developed. Sector skills councils will be designated
as issuing authorities; they will continue to issue frameworks in
England. It is right that the 180 existing frameworks continue to be
available throughout the transitional period, so that existing and
prospective apprentices are not disadvantaged while the new frameworks
are developed. To require consultation on individual frameworks, in the
way suggested by the hon. Gentleman, would clearly slow that process
down. In the terms of his amendment, we would have to consult on the
existing frameworks.</div>
<a name="09031255000151"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000297"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Perhaps I could be helpful to the Minister while he
seeks, or reads, inspiration. The nub of the argument is about whether
he expects, and the Bill facilitates, a growth in the number of
apprenticeship frameworks by the translation of some of what is being
taught and tested now. In other words, does he anticipate much of a
metamorphosis from existing vocational training specifications to
apprenticeship frameworks? If he does, is it not important, in line
with the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Bristol, West, that
that type of process is possible?</div>
<div class="Column"><a name="Column250" />Column number: 250</div><a name="09031255000152"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000298"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I am not sure if that is the implication of the
hon. Member for Bristol, West&#146;s amendment. Ultimately, the
number and content of the apprenticeship frameworks will be the
responsibility of the employer bodies, the sector skills council. I do
not anticipate an immediate expansion in the number of frameworks. It
is possible, subject to consultation, that there could even be a
slimming-down of the number of frameworks. Ultimately, that will be a
matter for employers, through the sector skills councils, to
decide.</div>
<a name="09031255000153"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
point at issue in the hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment is whether we
retrospectively consult the stakeholders on whether the existing
frameworks, which are about to become obsolete, should be deemed as
frameworks for the purposes of the transitional period. We do not
believe that we need to do that. It is clear what an existing framework
is; it is anything that is a framework under the blueprint. Anything
that is a framework under the blueprint will remain a framework.
Effectively, what we are talking about is calling a framework a
framework.</div>
<a name="09031255000154"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000299"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> What is also required is some assurance that the
re-badging of existing provision&#151;to provision that that meets
the requirements of the Bill&#151;will not require any change in the
delivery of that apprenticeship, or in the training that is part of
that apprenticeship, by an existing provider; that is part of the
assurance that is being sought. If there will be a change, then that is
why there needs to be consultation on its nature. If there was no
change&#151;if it is simply a semantic re-badging of something that
already exists to something else&#151;the Minister will have a point
in saying that the amendment is unnecessary, but that is not clear at
the moment.</div>
<a name="09031255000155"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000300"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> In that case, that is my fault, because I failed to
explain the matter sufficiently clearly. Nothing is being re-badged.
Existing apprenticeships will continue to be deemed apprenticeships
until all the new frameworks have come in&#151;they do not have to be
changed. The frameworks will change over time, as they move to the new
arrangements, but the point is that anybody who is currently doing an
apprenticeship, or who starts an apprenticeship before the new
frameworks have all come in&#151;who is doing, or will start before
the end of the period, an old apprenticeship framework under the old
blueprint--will still count in exactly the same way as having and doing
the apprenticeship that they thought they were doing when they started.
That is all that is happening in the transitional arrangement, which
will lapse in 2013, as he
said.</div><a name="09031255000156"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000301"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> I think the Minister, after a couple of
interventions, has clarified the Government&#146;s provision. It is a
shame that subsection (1)
states:</div><a name="09031255000209"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;The
Secretary of State may by order provide for an existing vocational
specification to be treated&#148;.</div>
<a name="09031255000157"></a><div class="hs_Para">If it said, &#147;to
an existing apprenticeship framework to be so treated&#148;, then the
uncertainty would not have
arisen.</div><a name="09031255000158"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000302"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> I cannot remember who was speaking and who was
intervening, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I
understand the point that he has just made. It took me a little while
to get beyond that point, but as he will understand, there are all
kinds of arcane legal reasons for that. There is a definition of an
existing vocational framework in subsection (5), and I think that the
point that he is making&#151;in an ancillary 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column251" />Column number: 251</div>fashion&#151;is that currently, we lack legislation such as this one,
which enables us to call an apprenticeship, an apprenticeship. So the
purpose of this piece of legislation&#151;during the course of which
will move to an apprenticeship, where everybody knows exactly what it
means&#151;is that during the transitional period, we will have to
call a vocational specification &#147;an apprenticeship&#148;, even
though in reality, it always was an
apprenticeship.</div><a name="09031255000159"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000303"></a>Stephen
Williams:</b> Thank you, Mrs. Humble; you indulged
my long intervention. The Minister is right that sometimes&#151;he
has been here longer than I have; I have only been here just short of
four years&#151;draft legislation is opaque. It was not clear to me,
but more appropriately, perhaps, it was not clear to many people in the
sector, who may have encouraged us to probe that particular
point&#151;that what the Government envisaged was simply a
re-designation of an existing provision without any inherent change to
provision that qualifies or meets the requirements of the Bill. As the
Minister has assured us that all that is intended is that the change is
effectively neutral&#151;it is just a badging exercise, which does
not change the inherent nature of what is being taught or
provided&#151;I beg to ask leave to withdraw the

Hayes:</b> As the Minister said, the amendment seeks to
correct a muddled clause, but it may take us from a muddle to a mire; I
will explain the reasons for that, and I am sure that the Minister will
comment on the issue himself. The amendment does little to answer the
central question, namely, in what precise circumstances would Welsh
Ministers need to withdraw recognition? Clause 16(1)(a) states that,
for an apprenticeship framework to be issued, there must be an issuing
authority. If that is the case, why would Welsh Ministers ever need to
withdraw recognition of a framework, as they are allowed to do in
clause 17(2)(b)? That is inconsistent. In what circumstances would
Welsh Ministers become the issuing authority and withdraw recognition?
Is this not another example of a measure that disempowers issuing
authorities as much as it empowers them, and consequently disempowers
employers, educators and learners? Whether they be Welsh or otherwise,
why would Ministers ever want to act in that way? If the Minister can
give a persuasive explanation, we will listen and respond in the same
spirit.</div><a name="09031255000215"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.15

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000306"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> If a Welsh sector skills council ceases to exist or
a framework has to be changed, Welsh Ministers will need the authority
to which the hon. Gentleman has referred to make the changes. Under the
clause, Welsh Ministers would have to notify themselves formally of
having made such a change. That is clearly absurd, hence the need for
the
amendment.</div><a name="09031255000175"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000307"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> Just to be clear, this is an emergency power then?
The Minister suggested that a framework having to be changed and a
sector skills council ceasing to exist were synonymous. If a sector
skills council ceases to exist, it might be necessary for a Minister to
intervene in the short term. Surely a Minister would not have to
intervene if a framework were changed because that is within the
competence of the sector skills
council.</div><a name="09031255000176"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000308"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> It is not just an emergency power. It is a
relatively routine power that will enable Welsh Ministers to make
changes that are made by a sector skills council statutory or, as the
hon. Gentleman said, to step into the breach if a sector skills council
ceases to exist.</div>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000309"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> So this measure is about giving Welsh Ministers the
same competence as Ministers outside Wales. I understand the point
about notification. It is clear that there was a muddle in the
drafting. However, are we giving Welsh Ministers powers that are
different from those of Ministers in
England?</div><a name="09031255000178"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000310"></a>Mr.
Simon:</b> Yes, in a way. The Welsh situation is very similar,
but not identical. In England, the powers will be vested in the chief
executive of skills funding under clause 13. The Welsh Assembly
Government have chosen to vest the powers in Welsh Ministers, which is
why we need this provision. It is a fairly routine provision, which
enables the system to work as envisaged. The amendment will just
correct a
misdraft.</div><a name="09031255000179"></a>




<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000311"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> It is the nature of parliamentary scrutiny and of
the interface between Ministers and shadow Ministers that on occasion
things must be taken on trust. That is appropriate when Ministers offer
assurances in good faith, as the Minister has in this matter. I will
take what he said in good faith and accept that we are not moving from
a muddle to a mire, but simply clearing up a
muddle.</div><a name="09031255000180"></a>

<div class="hs_Para"><b class="B"><a name="09031255000316"></a>Mr.
Hayes:</b> We are speeding along in a determined fashion, but
we are in no sense lacking in our duty to ensure that every aspect of
the Bill is scrutinised carefully. To that end, I am happy to move the
amendment. It is a drafting amendment to ensure that in the
consultation process on apprenticeship standards the chief executive
officer of Skills Funding must consult the representatives of industry
and education, rather than merely &#147;such persons as the Chief
Executive thinks appropriate&#148;, as the Bill currently requires.
The amendment is important for ensuring that apprenticeship standards
and any subsequent modification to those standards are based on what
employers actually want and what educators can deliver. The marriage
between employer need and the role of colleges and other providers is
critical, and the consultation process in those terms is also
important.</div><a name="09031255000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
amendment would ensure that apprenticeships will be representative,
responsive and realistic. If the Government accept the amendment, we
hope that it will go some way to allaying the fears of employers and
others about the imposition of arbitrary standards identified in
Committee by the witnesses from both the CBI and, in particular, the
British Chambers of Commerce. The Opposition want to ensure that
apprenticeships are neither developed in a top-down fashion, nor bound
by unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy, but that they are instead
developed in consultation with all those who will deliver and
participate in them, driving up the quality and sustainability of
individual apprenticeships and the apprenticeship brand as a
whole.</div><a name="09031255000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">On
a purely technical note, the amendment will also ensure that
considerably less bureaucracy is involved in the development of
apprenticeship frameworks by ensuring that the standards and frameworks
are developed with employers and educators. The absence of consultation
is likely to make the process more bureaucratic because it will not be
as
responsive.</div><a name="09031255000216"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">10.25
