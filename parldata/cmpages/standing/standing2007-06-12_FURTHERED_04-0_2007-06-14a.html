						It
has become clear since those concerted claims were made on Second

the &#163;280 million that the LSC spends on administration and
bureaucracy, but it also includes a further &#163;1.5 billion, which
most certainly is not spent on administration and bureaucracy, but
which goes towards learner support, learner participation, local
intervention, capital expenditure and educational maintenance
allowances. To describe such expenditure as administration and
bureaucracy is disingenuous, dishonest and downright
deceitful.</div>

Minister is making a great deal of this; I think that he is slightly
scarred from my scathing attack on him earlier today and that he is
hurt. Understandably, he wants to get back at me a bit. The truth is
that I have looked at my speech on Second Reading, to which he is
referring, and I cannot find the details that he describes in the form
that he
describes.</div>
					<a name="07061475000029"></a><div class="hs_Para">Indeed, I
looked at the breakdown of the LSC&#146;s expenditure, and its annual
report makes it absolutely 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column126" />Column number: 126</div>clear that &#163;1.8 billion of expenditure is not spent directly with
those providing training. That is not to say that it is all wasted
money&#151;of course it is not&#151;but that was the only point
that I made, and I wish that the Minister would move on a little and
talk about the business before us, rather than this exaggerated series
of claims that he is making about the Conservative
Opposition.</div>

attenuated, the total cost of the LSC bureaucracy comes to &#163;1.8
billion&#151;a very heavy burden, and it comes out of what is
available for front-line education.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official

gather from what the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings is
saying, we are seeing an indication that the cat is out of the bag and
the Opposition are backtracking, that is something that I very much
welcome. The message that he has sent out by describing that
&#163;1.8 billion of expenditure as administration and bureaucracy is
that those areas are ripe for cuts. If that is the case, it will be an
enormous cause for concern to those young people in receipt of
education maintenance allowance, which has brought about the biggest
step change in participation in education at the age of 16 since the
early 1990s; those in receipt of the care to learn grant; those in
receipt of career development loans; those in receipt of dance and
drama awards; and the colleges, which have seen their capital
expenditure go from zero 10 years ago to &#163;500 million per year
today. All those items make up the &#163;1.8
billion.</div>

							<a name="07061475000357"></a>Mr.

						</b> The Minister speaks of dance and drama awards. I
have the LSC&#146;s annual report here and he is absolutely right
that serious money is spent on them&#151;some &#163;13.8 million.
That contrasts with the &#163;20 million spent by the LSC
between 2003 and 2006 on management consultants. If we are to have a
debate about bureaucracy and administration, let us have a
straightforward
one.</div>
					<a name="07061475000034"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister is
right that not all the &#163;1.8 billion spent is
unnecessary&#151;all organisations have administration
costs&#151;but the idea that the LSC is as lean and as fit as it
might be would not resonate much up and down the country in the further
education colleges, which desperately seek more funds to continue their
excellent
work.</div>

								Bill
Rammell:
						</b> We are seeing an eloquent, if misguided, attempt
to backtrack. The claim that was clearly and explicitly made on Second
Reading was that the LSC spends &#163;1.8 billion on administration
and bureaucracy. Today, we have demonstrated that that figure
is &#163;280 million, and I think that the hon. Gentleman is
on the horns of a dilemma. I respect him and his integrity, based on
his previous practice. Given his track record of integrity, he should
either stand up and admit that the 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column127" />Column number: 127</div>&#163;1.8 billion figure used to describe administration and
bureaucracy costs was a fabrication or signal the intention of a future
Conservative Government to cut the programmes of education maintenance
allowance, care to learn grants, career development grants, dance and
drama awards, and capital expenditure. I will happily give way if he
would like to intervene to clarify whether he acknowledges that the
&#163;1.8 billion claim was erroneous or, alternatively, that he
intends to cut those expenditure
programmes.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000036"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000359"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I will intervene to say that the only reference to
that claim that I could find in anything that I have said in the House
or elsewhere is drawn directly from the LSC&#146;s annual report.
That report says that more than &#163;1 billion of the LSC&#146;s
annual budget of &#163;10 billion does not reach bodies that provide
training. That is not to say that all those management and
administration costs are wasted; of course they are not. However, the
Minister told the Committee, on this very day, that he is determined
that the LSC should become ever more lean. Indeed, he told us that the
LSC has cut the amount of paperwork that it sends to colleges by 60 per
cent., which makes one wonder how much it was sending before.</div>
					<a name="07061475000037"></a><div class="hs_Para">We really must see an end to
the discussion on the issue. You, Mr. Atkinson, will become
impatient with it. Certainly the Committee is becoming impatient with
it, as am I, despite my affection for the
Minister.</div>

							<a name="07061475000360"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> My powers of perception are strong and I do not
detect that Members on this side of the Committee are becoming
dissatisfied with the debate. To be clear, the claim made on Second
Reading by Conservative Members was that the LSC spends
&#163;1.8 billion on administration and bureaucracy. May I take the
hon. Gentleman&#146;s intervention to mean that he accepts that that
claim is
erroneous?</div>

								Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> With your indulgence, Mr. Atkinson, and
the Minister&#146;s generosity, I draw his attention plainly to the
LSC&#146;s accounts. It is true that the &#163;1.8 billion that is
not spent directly on providing training is allocated to all kinds of
other things, but a substantial amount of that is spent on
administration, pay costs, depreciation, local intervention,
development and other programmes&#151;both non-DFES and otherwise.
Not all that money is wasted, but I do not believe that a budget that
is bigger than that of the Royal
Navy&#151;</div>

has reduced from 4.6 to 1.9 per cent. of total spend. I take it from 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column128" />Column number: 128</div>that intervention that the hon. Gentleman now acknowledges that
&#163;1.8 billion is not spent on administration and bureaucracy. The
figure is &#163;280 million, and it does not serve anyone&#146;s

Rammell:
						</b> Perhaps the hon. Lady is happy to allow the
Conservative party to make those fabricated claims, but the issue
relates to a serious and important debate. The significant point is
that those claims are part of the way that the Conservative party sells
the pass and creates the impression that it can make room for tax cuts
without affecting public
spending.</div>
					<a name="07061475000046"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is clear
that the new clause is unnecessary. We have made clear the moves toward
self-regulation and the ongoing rationalisation in the learning and
skills landscape. We have made clear the reductions in bureaucracy that
have taken place, and made it abundantly clear that there are strong
and substantive reporting mechanisms for the LSC and Ofsted. On that
basis, I hope that the Conservative party will withdraw the
motion.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000367"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> This is an extraordinary debate, because those on
the Government Front Bench have not focused on the new clause. I tabled
what I thought was a moderately worded proposal, requiring these
matters to be analysed and then reported to the House. They intervened
to ask exactly what form that report would take, what its findings
would be and how we might respond to it. That seemed curious because
the purpose of asking for a report is the expectation that there will
be some kind of empirical analysis of the problem from which a reaction
and a response might
arise.</div>
					<a name="07061475000048"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have since
been subject to what I can only describe as intimidation. I am a
sensitive man, as you know, Mr. Atkinson&#151;a sensitive,
romantic high Tory&#151;and the Minister has subjected me to a
barrage of complaints about things that I have not said. I asked him to
identify any mention in my speech on Second Reading of the matters that
he has described, which he has failed to do. I reminded him that what I
said had been fairly carefully worded because I do not like to say
things that I cannot justify, although all politicians&#151;I am not
exempt from this&#151;are subject, on occasion, to hyperbole. We do
tend to dramatise for effect, as we saw from the Minister a few moments
ago.</div>
					<a name="07061475000049"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have had no
response to our sensible suggestion of a review and a report to
Parliament, except from the hon. Member for Brent, East. She sensibly
pointed out that the new clause should perhaps not be in the Bill, but
should be taken seriously and considered by the Government. She is
right that there is an issue with it being in the Bill, but, because of
my absolute determination to hold the Government to account for the
findings of the Foster report, which they commissioned, I am determined
to press the matter. That report stated that the bureaucracy
surrounding further education should be rationalised and that we should
move with speed&#151;indeed, with alacrity&#151;towards
self-regulation.</div>

Governments need. If I were sitting in his place, I might take a
similar view, but I am not sitting there&#151;yet&#151;so I am
performing the proper role of the Opposition, which is to press the
Government and hold them to account. It is critically important that we
do so on the issue of the bureaucracy and its cumulative effect on our
further education colleges. We would be selling our colleges short if
we did not. It is therefore my intention to press the matter and also
return to it at a later stage in our

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000385"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I beg to move amendment No. 31, in clause 22, page
15, line 4, at end insert &#145;and</div>
					<div class="hs_AmendmentLevel2">(c)
the class must include organisations representative of persons who are
liable to make payments by way of levy in consequence of the levy
proposals.&#146;.</div>
					<a name="07061475000073"></a><div class="hs_Para">You
will know, Mr. Atkinson, that the levy system affects a
small number of organisations that contribute to training in two
particular sectors. We have debated 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column130" />Column number: 130</div>the matter at length. It is a relatively technical affair and, from my
discussions with Ministers, I understand that this part of the Bill is
also technical and not intended to act as a catalyst for a change in
that
process.</div>
					<a name="07061475000074"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
is perhaps worth saying for the record that, as Ministers
know&#151;we have discussed this publicly and privately&#151;I
support the way in which the levy system currently operates. There is a
slight risk that by changing the way in which the representative
organisations and employers work in this field, we might weaken take-up
of the levy. Some employers&#151;very small employers, new employers
and employers who are going through changes of circumstance&#151;are
exempt from paying the levy. However, I am anxious that we should
maintain the commitment to the levy from within the relevant industries
and am therefore somewhat concerned&#151;I put it no more strongly
than that, for this is a probing amendment, as hon. Members may have
guessed from what I have said&#151;to ensure that we do not endanger
that level of commitment by any albeit small changes that we might
make.</div>
					<a name="07061475000075"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that we
broadly agree on this matter, but I am interested to hear the
Minister&#146;s reflections on it. I shall pose two or three
questions that he may want to address, and then I shall draw my remarks
to a conclusion. First, I understand that there has been a decline in
levy take-up over time, which we have discussed in Statutory Instrument
Committees and elsewhere. I want to hear the Minister&#146;s view on
that and what we might do about
it.</div>
					<a name="07061475000076"></a><div class="hs_Para">Secondly, what
role do the sector skills councils play in all this? They seem to be a
helpful tool in that respect. I do not think that they have a statutory
role, but it would certainly be desirable for their involvement in the
process to assist in the collection of and commitment to the levy that
I have
described.</div>
					<a name="07061475000077"></a><div class="hs_Para">Thirdly, it
would perhaps be useful for the Committee to have some kind of profile
of who pays the levy. In the construction industry, which is one of the
industries involved, a broad range of types of business is liable to
pay the levy. I would be interested to hear whether the smaller
companies are depending on the very large companies, which, of course,
pay the levy, and what the balance of payments
is.</div>
					<a name="07061475000078"></a><div class="hs_Para">Those are all
fairly narrow points, but I know that the Minister will appreciate that
the questions have been posed in the interest of trying to get the
provision right. I look forward to his response as to precisely why the
changes proposed in this part of the Bill are, in his view,
necessary.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000079"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000386"></a>The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills (Phil
Hope):
						</b> I think that I can give the hon. Gentleman the
assurances that he seeks. The clause updates the legislation dealing
with how an industrial training board shows that it has the support of
employers to raise a levy. The changes made by the clause will give an
ITB the freedom to consult employers in its industry more widely. That
might include consulting any organisation authorised to speak on behalf
of its members who are likely to pay the levy, seeking the views of a
sample of employers or approaching employers directly in combination
with any of those methods. We want industrial training 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column131" />Column number: 131</div>boards to choose the consultation process that bests suits their
industry. In all cases, they will need to satisfy the Secretary of
State that the process that they followed was reasonable.</div>
					<a name="07061475000080"></a><div class="hs_Para">I appreciate that this is a
probing amendment, but it would mean that organisations that represent
sections of an industry must be consulted when ascertaining the level
of support for levy proposals. That would constrain an ITB&#146;s
freedom of action in doing what I have just described&#151;deciding
the method by which to demonstrate support. That would not be helpful
to the ITB, because it would constrain its responsiveness and
flexibility in demonstrating that support. However, the hon. Gentleman
made an important point in moving the amendment, which is the question
whether it would undermine the commitment of employers to the levy if
we were to go down that
route.</div>
					<a name="07061475000081"></a><div class="hs_Para">I assure the
hon. Gentleman that both the existing industry training
boards&#151;the Construction Industry Training Board and the
Engineering Construction Industry Training Board&#151;have always
placed, and will continue to place, great strength on their
relationships with industry federations that represent the various
subsections of their industries. Those will include representatives
from those federations, and it is clear from what the ITBs have told us
that they have no desire to reduce the input of federations in any
way.</div>
					<a name="07061475000082"></a><div class="hs_Para">We need to be
more flexible, because it is 25 years since the Industrial Training Act
1982, and over that period industry structures have changed. An
increasing proportion of employers have chosen not to join the employer
federations, which means that although the ITBs have evidence that
employers who are not federation members support the levy&#151;they
know that, because they have asked people&#151;the legislation does
not allow that evidence of support outside the federation to be taken
into account when an ITB is justifying its levy.</div>
					<a name="07061475000083"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						In future,
provided that the ITB can satisfy the Secretary of State that it has
taken reasonable steps to ascertain the views of those persons whom the
Secretary of State considers are likely to be liable to pay the levy in
consequence of the proposals, the ITB can go on to demonstrate that it
has industry support for its levy proposals in the manner best suited
to the industry. That will, of course, include consulting
representative organisations. We are keen to ensure that in situations
where no such representative body might exist for future
ITBs&#151;proposals are coming forward from industry on
that&#151;they would not be prevented from demonstrating that they
have the support of the industry, even though they have no federation.
This is a mechanism allowing those industries to do
so.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000084"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000387"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Under-Secretary is being reassuring about the
purposes of this part of the Bill. In essence, it is a means of
increasing flexibility, and by so doing, maintaining commitment. What
kind of mechanisms might ITBs use to consult employers, if they are not
using representative organisations as a conduit? When the 1982 Act was
enacted, part of the reason for using representative organisations was
that they provided a convenient vehicle for the type of consultation
that we are
describing.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000085"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000388"></a>Phil
Hope:
						</b> We have published draft indicative regulations about
how an organisation might go about 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column132" />Column number: 132</div>that. For example, it could take a sample of employers&#151;not inside
the federation but within the industry and subject to the
levy&#151;and do a sampling process of those employers. The
regulations would give the hon. Gentleman the reassurances that he
requires: there is a formal process that organisations have to go
through in order to carry out surveys and sampling outside those bodies
that are inside the federation of the ITB. That will be laid out in
regulations, which I believe have already been circulated for members
of the Committee to look at, so that he can be assured that those
regulations are there. Essentially, the ITB will be able to demonstrate
to the Secretary of State that there is industrial support, both from
members of the federation and from those outside of it, through the
sampling method. Those regulations include provisions about consulting
representative organisations. With those assurances, I hope that the
hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</div>
					<a name="07061475000086"></a><div class="hs_Para">I was tempted to take this
opportunity to observe that levies can be used to fund apprenticeships,
which would have given me a chance to comment on what the hon.
Gentleman said earlier about apprenticeships. However, I guess that you
would not allow me to stray so far from the clause, Mr.
Atkinson.</div>
					<a name="07061475000087"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I would not
want to intimidate the hon. Gentleman by getting my violins out again
and demonstrating that his accusations, which undermine the current
apprenticeship system, are wholly unfounded and wrong. Rather, I invite
him to celebrate success&#151;both the expansion in the number of
apprenticeships and the completion rates around the country. I shall be
at the apprenticeship awards next week to give prizes to the employers
and apprentices who are doing so much to raise skill
levels.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000088"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000389"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I said at the outset of this Committee that your
generosity and benevolence are legendary, Mr. Atkinson. The
Minister has sought to prove me right by managing at the very end of
his sensible comments on levies to launch into a series of remarks
about apprenticeships, but I shall not follow him, because that would
be wrong. I do not want to be seduced down an inappropriate path by the
Minister. He has spoken sensibly about levies, on which we have similar
views. This is not the time to explore the issue, but there might be
capacity, as the film industry shows, for further voluntary levy
systems, if an industry thinks that that is the right way to focus
attention on the need for training and development. Both Opposition and
Government would celebrate such a voluntary, industry-led approach to
increasing commitment to training.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000089"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000390"></a>Phil
Hope:
						</b> The hon. Gentleman mentioned the film industry.
Earlier, he referred to the role of sector skills councils in that
regard. The ITBs are separate from SSCs. Perhaps, however, future
legislation will introduce systems that will allow SSCs to develop more
generally. Those might be considered favourably by both sides of the
House, and I look forward to working with him when the time
comes.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000090"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000391"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> It is interesting that when the House is at its
best in Committees such as this, an exchange of views can lead to the
development of shared ideas. The Minister has drawn attention to an
example&#151;in this 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column133" />Column number: 133</div>case, the role of the SSCs&#151;that could be used as a model in other
industries, although I accept that the particular character of the film
industry makes that approach more straightforward than it might be in
other cases. I would welcome the opportunity to share further views on
it.</div>
					<a name="07061475000091"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have received
assurances about the amendment and about this part of the Bill. I
understand the need to move on from 1982, given the changing nature of
the relationship between employers and representative organisations. I
am a little anxious about the effect that that might have on the
representative organisations, because there is the slight risk of a
self-fulfilling prophecy of the decline in their influence. However, I
accept that one has to be practical, and on the basis of the
Minister&#146;s very sensible comments, I beg to ask leave to
withdraw the
amendment.</div>

						</b> Rather unexpectedly, this part of the Bill has been
thrown into sharp focus. Not for the first time in this Committee, I
have an admission to make. On Second Reading, I did not expect that as
much emphasis would be placed on this clause in speeches from
Government Back Benchers as was the case. I was slightly surprised. I
would not mind betting that some on the Front Bench were slightly
surprised as well about both the length and the nature of some of those
speeches. However, that did, of course, alert me to certain serious
matters that I must raise today in relation to the
clause.</div>

					<a name="07061475000096"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am pleased to
see that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales is here specifically in

earlier clauses as he sat expectantly waiting for us to hare towards

clauses. However, I am pleased that he is here now, and I have no doubt
that he will want to speak about this matter at some length.</div>

						Under
the Government of Wales Act 2006, the National Assembly for Wales can
seek to enhance its powers, given parliamentary consent, by way of a
new procedure known as a legislative competence Order in Council. I do
not know how much members of the Committee know about those orders. I
have no doubt, Mr. Atkinson, that, given your encyclopaedic
knowledge of the affairs of this House, you are familiar with them,
but, to be frank, I certainly was not until I looked at clause 25. I
now have a rather better knowledge of them than I would otherwise have
had, and I have learned that the Government can indeed use those orders
for the purpose that I have described. Indeed, that is the nature of
those Orders in Council. Yet, in this instance, the Government have
chosen to add schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 by primary
legislation. In other words, they have opted in this Bill to add to
that competence rather than pursuing an alternative
route.</div>
					<a name="07061475000103"></a><div class="hs_Para">Just last
month, the Welsh Affairs Committee reported its concerns about the
continued use of primary legislation for this purpose. To some degree,
that reflects the lively speeches that we heard from Welsh Members on
Second Reading who were anxious about consultation, the process and
whether the Bill was the right vehicle to do what it intends to
do.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000104"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000393"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> This is a question about clarification, and it
may be that the Minister has the answer. I wonder whether the
Government chose to do this in this way because the 2006 Act had not
come into force when this Bill began being debated in Parliament. Maybe
the Minister will be able to answer
me.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000105"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000394"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I wondered that too. I think that we will find,
when the Minister responds, that he will not use that as his defence,
because, having identified that as a possibility, I researched the
issue and found that that was probably not the case&#151;I see that
the Minister is nodding, if not speaking, to confirm my
analysis.</div>
					<a name="07061475000106"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Welsh
Affairs Committee reported:</div>
					<a name="07061475000309"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;We are concerned that
continuing to use primary legislation to extend the powers of the
National Assembly (in a parallel procedure to adding matters by way of
Legislative Competence Orders) will mean that matters introduced in
this way will escape the detailed arrangements for pre-legislative
scrutiny&#148;.</div>
					<a name="07061475000107"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the
point that hon. Members made on Second Reading. They felt that if the
alternative process had been adopted, there would have been
closer analysis of some of the proposals through pre-legislative
scrutiny.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column135" />Column number: 135</div>
					<a name="07061475000108"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Select Committee also
said:</div>
					<a name="07061475000310"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;It is unlikely
that a single clause in a wider Bill would be subject to the same
degree of scrutiny as a draft LCO, especially if the Bill is long and
complex and the relevant clause appears towards the end of it...We
are also concerned that the use of primary legislation denies the
opportunity for joint working between the Welsh Affairs Committee and
an Assembly committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny of proposed
LCOs...We are concerned that to continue to add matters by primary
legislation could therefore be a device for a general, rather than a
specific, extension of Assembly powers, which at the same time negates
the opportunity for specific and detailed pre-legislative scrutiny
either by a committee of the National Assembly or by the Welsh Affairs
Committee.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061475000109"></a><div class="hs_Para">For those
reasons, and having looked closely at the Welsh Affairs Committee
report on legislative competence Orders in Council, I have five
specific questions for the Minister. Having come here and listened to
the rest of the debate, he will get his money&#146;s worth, and so he
should.</div>
					<div class="hs_Para">
						Why was it
decided to use primary legislation in this instance? I am aware of the
difficulties of the minority Labour Administration in Wales&#151;it
is not easy now in Wales, or anywhere else, for the governing party. I
congratulate my colleagues in the Welsh Conservative party on their
splendid result in the recent Assembly elections. There are now 12
Conservative representatives in the
Assembly.</div>
					<a name="07061475000110"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						By
using parallel procedures, the Government have created confusing
arrangements under which the extension of significant powers escapes
detailed pre-legislative scrutiny by either the Welsh Assembly or the
Welsh Affairs Committee. Some people have said to me&#151;I do not
think that it is the case, but it is a lively matter, particularly
among Welsh colleagues&#151;that the Government did not want the
matter to be dealt with in the other way, because Welsh representatives
would have created more fuss, would have asked more difficult questions
and would have been more critical of some aspects, so it was easier to
get the legislation through on the sly. I do not think that that is the
case, because I do not think that these Ministers operate in that way.
With their answers to my questions, they need to reassure those who are
making such claims, however. On Second Reading, hon. Members expressed
their concern. The former Secretary of State for Wales, no less, the
right hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) said:</div>
					<a name="07061475000311"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;I am concerned,
however, about the way in which we deal with the pre-legislative

legislate for further education and training from Parliament to the

legislation to transfer power from Parliament to the Assembly, I think
it wrong to do so without

							<b class="B">Mr.
Austin Mitchell</b> (Great Grimsby) (Lab): I hate to see the
hon. Gentleman troubled, because when he is troubled, the speeches get
longer and we shuffle more in inattention. He is making heavy weather
of the issue. Devolution is a process; it is not a full stop. What has
gone before is not the end of the matter. It is a process of
transferring more powers to the Assembly. Why does not he address the
principle? Does he agree with the transfer to Wales of these
powers?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000396"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The principle of transferring powers stands
alongside the means of transferring them. If the allegation made by
former Welsh Ministers that this matter has not been handled properly
has any substance, then it deserves proper airing in this Committee. I
am not making heavy weather of this. Let us be honest, the Government
would not have put a Welsh Minister in this Committee if they did not
think that it was a big deal. If the Government had expected the clause
to be dealt with on the nod, the Minister would not be here ready to
deal with it.</div>
					<a name="07061475000115"></a><div class="hs_Para">I have
no doubt that Ministers and Whips were as surprised by the speeches on
Second Reading as I was. Having looked at the clause, I think it is an
important matter that warrants a little consideration in Committee.
However, mindful of the comments of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby,
I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion and put my four other questions
for the Minister in short order.</div>
					<a name="07061475000116"></a><div class="hs_Para">Before I do so, however, I
simply want to point out that the Secretary of State for Wales said
this in a written answer to the right hon. Member for
Torfaen:</div>
					<a name="07061475000313"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;To
assist parliamentary scrutiny, all framework powers granting wider and
more permissive powers to the Assembly will be accompanied by an
explanatory memorandum setting out the policy context underlying the
proposals. Copies will be sent to all Welsh MPs and will be placed in
the Libraries of both Houses.&#148;&#151;[<i class="I">Official Report</i>,
11 January 2007; Vol. 455, c.
661W.]</div>
					<a name="07061475000117"></a><div class="hs_Para">In those circumstances,
it would have been right and proper to have made that information
available to members of the Committee. I have checked, and I have not
received the explanatory memorandum, and I have spoken to the hon.
Member for Brent, East, who has not received it, too. I do not know
whether any of my hon. Friends have received it. Certainly, when I went
to the Library last night, the staff there could not locate it. I
finally came across it this morning, when I returned to the
Library&#151;following a contact with the Department, it had become
available. I got it about 10 minutes before I entered the Committee at
9 am. I am concerned about that. I do not suspect any lack of good
will, but I certainly think that that was not appropriate, given the
assurance that was made about fully informing Members in the way that
responsible Ministers normally do. I hope that the Minister will say
something about
that.</div>
					<a name="07061475000118"></a><div class="hs_Para">The memorandum
implies that the format set out in clause 25 for giving the National
Assembly for Wales 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column137" />Column number: 137</div>primary legislative powers will become the norm. Can the Minister
confirm that it will become the norm? If so, what measures for
pre-legislative scrutiny will be established? Has the clause been
referred to the Welsh Affairs Committee, and has the Committee
commented on it? If framework papers such as clause 25 extend the scope
of the Welsh Assembly, are they not subject to scrutiny by the Welsh
Affairs Committee in the same way as legislative competence
orders?</div>
					<a name="07061475000119"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that
the hon. Member for Great Grimsby is right. In essence, this is about
transferring power, which is not in dispute. What is in dispute is the
way in which the Government have gone about it. The Government should
be held to account, particularly when Members from both sides of the
House are raising serious questions about whether the process allowed
proper comment, scrutiny and discussion before we reached this
stage.</div>

							<b class="B">Sarah
Teather</b> (Brent, East) (LD): I should like to make a few
brief remarks. First, Liberal Democrats are very much in favour of
transferring more powers to the Welsh Assembly. If we had our way, we
would transfer all sorts of other things, but that is not under
discussion today. I am less concerned about the process than the
Conservatives. However, I am sorry that we did not have the chance to
consider the explanatory memorandum and hope that we will have the
opportunity to do so on Report, if questions arise.</div>
					<a name="07061475000121"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it is notable that
clause 17 does not allow Welsh colleges the freedom to award foundation
degrees, and clause 25 does not give the Welsh Assembly the power to
confer that freedom. Will the Minister tell us the reason for that
decision?</div>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Nick

Committee&#146;s debates, Mr. Atkinson, and I belatedly
welcome you to the Chair.</div>
					<a name="07061475000123"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						Some
interesting points have been raised. As the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings explained, he might not have spoken were it
not for the contributions made by my right hon. Friends the Members for
Torfaen and for Islwyn. Both are genuinely my friends: I was the
Parliamentary Private Secretary to the former when he was Secretary of
State for Wales, and I was the Whip and business manager at the Wales
Office when the latter was doing my present job. However, those
comments did not come as a surprise to the hon. Gentleman. I have had a
number of discussions with my right hon. Friends; they have genuine
concerns, and I shall address them
today.</div>
					<a name="07061475000124"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
owe the Committee an apology about the explanatory memorandum. Two Acts
have used primary legislation to pass legislative competence to the
Welsh Assembly. The first was the NHS Redress Act 2006, and the second
was the Education and Inspections Act 2006. Both went through without
great comment being made on the transfer of powers to the Assembly. The
practice followed for the Bill was the same as used for those Acts. I
wrote to all Welsh Members of Parliament and to the Welsh affairs
Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column138" />Column number: 138</div>in both Houses&#151;in the Commons, it is the hon. Member for Chesham
and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan)&#151;to explain what was
happening, drawing their attention to the relevant clauses and
enclosing an explanatory
memorandum.</div>
					<a name="07061475000125"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						It
was an omission that the Committee did not receive that explanatory
memorandum, and I apologise. It would certainly have been better if
hon. Members had had a copy to hand. However, irrespective of the
experience of the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, a
copy was in the Library, and it is unfortunate that it was not readily
to hand when he first requested it. I hope that he accepts my answer.
We are not trying to get the provision through on the sly, or we would
not have written to Members of both Houses informing them that the
relevant clauses allowed the transfer of powers and provided them with
a copy of the explanatory memorandum.</div>
					<a name="07061475000126"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman raised a
number of questions&#151;he said that there were four or five, but I
counted only three, so perhaps there were some sub-questions. He asked
why the primary legislative route had been taken rather than the
Order-in-Council procedure. The answer is simple. It is a question of
timing. At the moment, the National Assembly for Wales is conducting an
independent review of further education in Wales. That review will be
reporting in the autumn. If, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Islwyn wanted, we were to wait until the report was completed and thus
have far more detail about what was to be placed in a framework power
or an Order in Council, there would be considerable delay. In fact,
following the Government of Wales Act 2006, there are two routes
through which legislative competence can be transferred to the
Assembly, namely primary powers and the Order-in-Council
procedure.</div>
					<a name="07061475000127"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because
the Order-in-Council process&#151;an hour and a half debate in this
place and an hour and a half debate in the other place&#151;is not
amendable, we have encouraged the Welsh Affairs Committee to undertake
the pre-legislative scrutiny of Orders in Council, although we cannot
demand that it does so. We have encouraged it to take on that role,
because the opportunities for Members of this House and of the other
place to scrutinise Orders in Council are extremely limited. Orders in
Council are unamendable and, although they are debatable, the answer at
the end of the debate is either yes or no.</div>
					<a name="07061475000128"></a><div class="hs_Para">We have always argued that we
already have sufficient powers to examine the proposal to transfer the
competence from this place to the National Assembly&#151;indeed, we
are scrutinising the clause today&#151;and we are drawing attention
to these matters by the distribution of the explanatory memorandum to
relevant hon. Members. I am sure that we will give an adequate response
to the Welsh Affairs Committee report that highlights the issue. The
open evidence sessions that the Government have introduced at the
beginning of Public Bill Committees provide a further opportunity for
scrutiny.</div>
					<a name="07061475000129"></a><div class="hs_Para">Because of
the legislative timetable, the problem for any Government, irrespective
of their views about pre-legislative scrutiny&#151;this Government
are great advocates of pre-legislative scrutiny and of draft
Bills&#151;is that there is not always time to provide a draft Bill,
to inform a Select Committee that a particular Bill 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column139" />Column number: 139</div>is being produced or to allow for that Committee to conduct
pre-legislative scrutiny. The Government&#146;s record on having
tried to improve the scrutiny of our legislative process is excellent.
In our response to the Welsh Affairs Committee, we will highlight the
issues and mention some of the ways in which we can assist not only
that Committee but all Members to scrutinise the matter as much as
possible.</div>

								Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> The Minister is dealing with the matter in a
considered and professional way. He seems to be saying that it is
sometimes better to handle matters through primary legislation, because
that allows for the sort of full and open debate that we are having
here. However, the Welsh Affairs Committee is particular, as he has
identified, about the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny,
especially in the sort of case in which, in its terms, primary
legislation could be a device for a general, rather than a specific,
extension of powers.</div>
					<a name="07061475000131"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Bill has had a long journey
through the House. It started in the Lords some time ago, and it has
been a cause of frustration among Opposition Front Benchers that it has
taken so long to reach this Committee. Was the Welsh Affairs Committee
involved at all&#151;that is one of my five questions, of which I
shall remind the Committee at the end&#151;in this piece of
legislation? If it was, although the Minister&#146;s points are being
made in good faith, we still have a
problem.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000400"></a>
								Nick
Ainger:
						</b> My problem is that I cannot request the Welsh
Affairs Committee to undertake any inquiry or any pre-legislative
scrutiny, so it was not invited to do so. However, every member of that
Committee received a letter signed by me, including a copy of the
explanatory memorandum, which goes into considerable detail about what
is proposed. I know all the Committee members extremely well, including
the three Conservative members of the Committee and the Conservative
Front-Bench spokesman. If they had genuine concerns about the Bill and
what was being transferred to the Assembly, they would have drawn them
to the attention of the Chairman and requested some form of inquiry or
pre-legislative scrutiny. They have had time to do that, and I assume
that they decided that they did not want to, so it was not a question
of my inviting them. I drew to the attention of every member of that
Committee that the clause was going through the House, and I provided
an explanatory memorandum. It was for them to make that decision, which
I could not direct them to take. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts
that
point.</div>
					<a name="07061475000133"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
have touched on the explanatory memorandum and what the norm will be.
We will cover this in our response to the Welsh Affairs Committee
report. We will provide every opportunity, given the time constraints
in our legislative programme, for pre-legislative scrutiny. We are not
in the business of trying to slip any of this through. In this case,
even though there has been criticism, we were forewarning people of
what was coming through and what was being
proposed.</div>

about this important change. What form did they take, when were they

								Nick
Ainger:
						</b> There is a process between officials in the
Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Education,
Lifelong Learning and Skills in the Assembly. Once it was known that
the Bill was coming, the process of discussions at official level to
bring forward a framework power started. The White Paper preceding the
Government of Wales Act 2006, which was published in September 2005,
identified that one of the ways to give legislative competence to the
Assembly was through this primary legislative route, where framework
powers would be included, where appropriate, in UK or England and Wales
pieces of legislation. We flagged that up then, and since then we have
had the NHS Redress Act 2006 and the Education and Inspections Act
2006, which have given framework powers in those
areas.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000136"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000403"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I hear what the Minister has said about discussions
between officials, but for the record there have been no formal
discussions with Members of the Assembly. There has been no opportunity
for the Assembly to comment on or discuss the implications of this
change in primary legislation, which is quite significant in respect of
further education in
Wales.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000137"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000404"></a>Nick
Ainger:
						</b> No, that is not the case. I attended the Education
and Lifelong Learning Committee in February&#151;it is their
equivalent of our Select Committee&#151;to answer questions from
Assembly Members on this Bill, the framework powers and so on. There
has been that relationship. I also have regular bilateral talks with
Assembly Ministers, where these matters are discussed. There has been
considerable involvement by the Assembly itself in taking forward and
developing the clause.</div>
					<a name="07061475000138"></a><div class="hs_Para">I think that I have responded
to all the hon. Gentleman&#146;s questions and points. The hon.
Member for Brent, East, going back to clause 17, asked why clause 25
does not give further education colleges in Wales the power to award
foundation degrees. Wales is a small country with only 25 FE colleges.
Its further and higher education consortia have a good reputation for
working together. They enable education institutions to provide a wide
range of opportunities for learners through the sharing of resources,
such as staff, equipment and infrastructure. The current evidence base
suggests that delivery should continue to be via consortia arrangements
between further and higher education
providers.</div>

							<a name="07061475000405"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> It is not clear to me how that differs from the
situation in England. In one of Tuesday&#146;s sittings, all sides
agreed that there are good models in England for collaboration between
FE and HE
institutions.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000406"></a>Nick
Ainger:
						</b> The FE colleges in Wales are not demanding
degree-awarding powers. One or two might be, but others are perfectly
satisfied with the current consortia arrangements that they have with
HE institutions. As I said in my response to the hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings, however, an independent review of further
education in Wales is under way, so the issue will be raised by 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column141" />Column number: 141</div>
						Fforwm, which represents FE institutions in Wales.
Individual colleges may also make their case and the review will
consider that.</div>
					<a name="07061475000141"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						If there is
a clear recommendation that degree-awarding powers be given to FE
institutions in Wales and the Assembly agrees with it, there will be
the option to bring that forward as an Order in Council, but there is
not anywhere near as much pressure in Wales as there is in England for
FE institutions to have degree-awarding powers. That is why the measure
has not been included in the
clause.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Rob Wilson</b> (Reading, East) (Con): I should like to press
the Minister further on the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for
South Holland and The Deepings regarding consultation with Welsh
Assembly Members. The Minister suggested that there was a significant
level of consultation with them, but the right hon. Member for Islwyn
said on Second Reading that no consultation had taken place. Was he
just badly briefed? Was he out of touch? Why would he say that no
consultation had taken place? A trend seems to be developing: no
consultation with the universities, no consultation with the Assembly.
It all sounds a bit haphazard and rushed.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000144"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000408"></a>Nick
Ainger:
						</b> I reassure the hon. Gentleman that there was wide
consultation. Fforwm, which is the equivalent of the Association of
Colleges in England, is aware of the proposals and has welcomed them.
As I said, I attended and gave evidence to the relevant Committee in
the Assembly. Of course, we will not know the precise detail of what
the Assembly will ultimately propose until the independent review has
reported in the autumn. If the clause is passed by the House, the
Assembly will bring forward an Assembly Measure, which is primary
legislation&#151; the equivalent of an Act of Parliament&#151;that
goes through exactly the same level of scrutiny as does primary
legislation in this place. At that point, it would consult on the
detail of the Measure.</div>
					<a name="07061475000145"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sure that the hon.
Gentleman was making a genuine point, but I can assure him that there
will be considerable consultation, and not just through the process of
the independent review. Once that review makes its recommendations, and
if they are accepted by the Assembly, there will be thorough scrutiny
of any Assembly
Measure.</div>
					<a name="07061475000146"></a><div class="hs_Para">The clause
delivers the deepening of the Welsh devolution settlement, which is UK
Government policy. It ensures that the National Assembly for Wales has
the power that it needs, when it needs it, to debate and determine the
appropriateness of proposals for the development of further education
in Wales that are put forward by the Welsh Assembly Government. It is,
therefore, an important clause and I hope that the Committee will give
it full support.</div>

							<a name="07061475000409"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the
Committee and giving us the benefit of his advice. I asked five
questions. First, I asked why it was 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column142" />Column number: 142</div>
						decided to use primary legislation in this instance.
The Minister said that it was because it would enable us to have a
wider debate&#151;I guess&#151;on the subject. That seemed to be
the inference of his answer. Secondly, I asked him why the explanatory
memorandum was not sent to members of the Committee, and he has
generously apologised for that oversight. I think that we have learned
a lesson from that oversight and in future it is absolutely necessary
that that type of material is made available to members of the
Committee. Thirdly, I asked him whether this process was going to
become the norm, in terms of the use of primary legislative powers. I
am not absolutely sure that I received an answer to that question.
Forgive me, but I am going to ask him to return to question
three.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000148"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000410"></a>Nick
Ainger:
						</b> On that point, there are two routes to confer
primary legislative powers on the Assembly. One is through the Order in
Council process; I did not want to go on at huge length about that, but
I think that I explained it. The second is through primary legislation
in this place.</div>
					<a name="07061475000149"></a><div class="hs_Para">Perhaps I ought to take a step
back, to explain matters. The White Paper that we published in
September 2005 addressed the issue of how to enhance the legislative
capability of the National Assembly for Wales, following on from the
Richard report a few years before. The problem that was identified was
that the Wales Office, through the Welsh Assembly, had to compete with
all other UK Government Departments for a slot in the legislative
process. We felt that that was wrong. Therefore we proposed two routes
for giving the Assembly enhanced powers. One is the Order-in-Council
process, which is part 3 of the Government of Wales Act 2006. The other
route, which was announced in the White Paper, was that, where
appropriate, a UK Government Department would draft its legislation to
allow these framework powers to transfer primary legislative powers to
the Assembly. So, that process will be the norm whenever a suitable
vehicle&#151;a platform in UK legislative terms&#151;comes along.
If there is not such a suitable vehicle and the Assembly needs the
legislative competence, it can gain it through the Order-in-Council
process.</div>
					<a name="07061475000150"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Minister
for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, my hon. Friend the Member
for Harlow, was referring to the fact that it is not since the early
1990s that we have had a Further Education Bill going through the
House. Obviously, that would be far too long a period of time for the
Assembly, which has all the Executive functions that my hon. Friend has
but, unlike my hon. Friend, does not, at the moment, have the ability
to legislate. That is why we will use UK Government Bills as a platform
to transfer powers to the Assembly, in a process that is properly
scrutinised by this
place.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000411"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I thank the Minister. What is emerging from this
debate is that, in its response to the Welsh Affairs Committee, the
Government will clarify exactly when these different routes are
appropriate, and it may depend on the legislation itself.
Alternatively, it may depend on the legislative history of the subject
area, in the way that the hon. Gentleman has just described. I would
even imagine that it may depend on the complexity of the material and
therefore the need for detailed pre-legislative scrutiny. There is
beginning to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column143" />Column number: 143</div>emerge, certainly on this side of the Chamber, an understanding of
precisely where the Government&#146;s thinking is leading. It is an
iterative business, and I guess that as the Government respond to the
welfare state, within the dialogue that takes place between them, that
will all become clearer.</div>

						For the
record, the fourth and fifth questions&#151;so that <i class="I">Hansard</i>
can get an absolutely accurate picture of every word that I
issued&#151;were about whether the matter had been referred to the
Welsh Affairs Select Committee and whether it had been invited to
comment. The hon. Gentleman told us in response that it had been
&#147;notified&#148;, but that it had been up to the Committee to
decide what to do, rather than him. Finally, the answer to my fifth
question&#151;whether the Committee had commented&#151;is clearly
no, given the comments that were made on Second Reading and
elsewhere.</div>

been helpful. We are learning. Perhaps if there had been a greater
exchange of information in all kinds of ways, the comments that were
made on Second Reading, which stimulated the detailed discussions that
we have today, would not have been made. However, in a way, perhaps it
is good that we have had those discussions, because they have allowed
us full discussions of this process, in the way that the hon. Gentleman
has dealt with the matters. We will not want to divide the

							<a name="07061475000414"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> This group of amendments and new clauses
relates to improving the system of pastoral care created by supporting
and mentoring that exists for 16 to 18-year-olds who undertake some
form of training or education after 16, as defined in amendments Nos.
12, 13, 14 and 16 which seek additions to clause 29. The new clauses,
to which I shall relate most of my remarks, set out those four
improvements.</div>
					<a name="07061475000174"></a><div class="hs_Para">New
clause 3 would establish in law what is already best practice in a
number of schools and colleges, where a personal record of achievement
is given to students. However, what is critical, which is outlined in
the clause, is that it should not record academic achievement only, but
other skills that have been demonstrated, including any voluntary or
community work that has been undertaken. In addition, it would set out
the learning aims for post-16 education and training, and how those
aims can best be met, as well as, more generally, what the young person
wants to achieve in their future learning. The reason why this is so
important is that the degree of careers advice, the quality of that
advice, and the pastoral care that 16 to 18-year-olds receive, have an
important role in shaping the future career patterns of that young
person. If the school or college gets it wrong, it can have a
devastating impact, at least in the short term. I shall give a brief
example from my
constituency.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07061475000326"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.15
pm</div>
					<a name="07061475000175"></a><div class="hs_Para">A couple of
months ago, a young person and her mother come to my surgery. I am not
going to say which FE college she was attending&#151;I do not want to
embarrass anyone&#151;but the daughter was taking a diploma in health
and social care. She wanted a career in the caring professions, but for
reasons that no one can quite understand she was advised by the college
to do physiotherapy. She did not have the background or aptitude, or
even the wish, to study that subject.</div>
					<a name="07061475000176"></a><div class="hs_Para">When she came to my surgery,
she had been rejected by all the institutions to which she had applied.
Within three minutes I was able to understand that she wanted to do
social work, but by then it was too late in the applications process
for her to apply to study social work for the following year. As a
result, she is going to have to take a year out. That might be
character building for her, but it is not what she wants to do. It
points to a weakness that sometimes exists in the careers advice
available to FE colleges and schools. I hope to have demonstrated
through that example how important it is to have the best advice, and
for the person giving that advice to take the time to talk to the young
people and to be clear about what they want to achieve in their future
careers.</div>
					<a name="07061475000177"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 4
would give all young people undertaking post-16 study a mentor from the
school or business, or an appropriate voluntary-sector body, depending
on where the education and training is taking place. The mentor would
need to give advice on future training routes, on possible employment
opportunities and career development, and on how young people might
acquire other skills to enhance their life opportunities.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column147" />Column number: 147</div>
					<a name="07061475000178"></a><div class="hs_Para">Such mentoring is important to
my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman),
who recently raised the matter in a private Member&#146;s Bill. He
was most concerned, as am I, about the number of young people who are
not in employment, education or training. He argued that if, prior to
16 and immediately afterwards, young people could get a mentor to talk
to them about the importance of staying on in education or training and
advising them of the best routes, some of those who are not taking up
such opportunities might take them. It is a critical role and it would
require a skilled person to give such advice.</div>
					<a name="07061475000179"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 asks that the
provision of mentoring advice and support be made available to post-16s
in education. It applies also to those who have special needs. The
Minister will know that the review of special educational needs
undertaken last year by the Education and Skills Committee identified
the problem that young people with special educational needs do not
always get good advice or proper support to enter further education or
to undertake post-16 education in some other format.</div>
					<a name="07061475000180"></a><div class="hs_Para">There certainly seem to be some
weaknesses in the current system. It was found that more direct support
was needed to encourage young people with special educational needs to
take up further education opportunities. The argument behind the clause
is that if there was better careers advice, better mentoring and better
support for young people with special educational needs, they would be
able to take up more opportunities for post-16 education.</div>
					<a name="07061475000181"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New clause 6
seeks to make a requirement of what I think is already best practice in
a number of schools and colleges&#151;providing young people with a
range of opportunities to undertake voluntary work in their local
communities that would enable them to acquire and develop leadership
skills. The new clause argues for a wide range of opportunities to be
made available, such as a Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, or a limited
version of it that could take place locally. Thanks to a meeting that I
had recently with young people from some of the secondary schools in my
constituency, I know how much that is needed. They are very keen to
undertake some sort of community work locally, but they simply do not
have the connections with the community groups that would enable them
to do that. We have put a set of recommendations to local schools to
the effect that they should try to enhance the number of activities
that are available to young people to enable them to play a greater
role in their communities.</div>

							<b class="B">Jeremy
Wright</b> (Rugby and Kenilworth) (Con): I am interested in
the proposals that the hon. Lady outlines, and I have two questions.
The first relates to new clause 6. Is she at all concerned
that the rubric that it sets out might limit the diversity of
activities available through the voluntary sector? In many cases, they
are attractive to young people precisely because they are delivered
through the voluntary sector without the overlay, consultation and
interest of the state. Secondly, has she any estimate as to what all
the proposals will cost?</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000416"></a>
								Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman
that activities would be limited. In fact, I believe the opposite. The
whole point is to spread to 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column148" />Column number: 148</div>schools that might not already provide them a range of
opportunities for young people to undertake
community work or some other activity that would benefit their local
community. That seems to be a sensible and laudable thing to do. To
answer his second point, I hope that the cost would not be prohibitive.
Some schools&#151;in fact, a great many of them&#151;already make
some form of provision, but it would help if they could focus their
efforts to ensure that the opportunities are available to all young
people.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000417"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> Is the hon. Lady aware that Surrey has a scheme
that allows all schools to buy in to it? The Surrey school where I
spent a week shadowing last September has a scheme for sixth-formers
that is run and co-ordinated by the borough council. The range of
activities that it offers are partly structured and partly accessed by
young people through an introduction to opportunities to volunteer that
exist in other schools. It works well because it operates right across
the borough.</div>

							<a name="07061475000418"></a>Dr.
Blackman-Woods:
						</b> I thank the hon. Lady. That is the sort of
best practice that we want to see extended elsewhere as a result of the
new clauses.</div>
					<a name="07061475000186"></a><div class="hs_Para">If our
proposals do not become law, what is the Minister going to do to ensure
that schools, colleges and others providing post-16 education adopt the
best practice on pastoral care that is created by mentoring and
community
activity?</div>

							<b class="B">Angela
Watkinson</b> (Upminster) (Con): May I recommend to the hon.
Lady the project at Havering college called ROSE? That stands for
realistic opportunities for supported employment for students with
learning difficulties. It enables them to transfer from education to
employment with the help of local employers. Each student has a job
tutor who stays with him or her all day to start with, and is gradually
weaned off that relationship over, say, six months until independent. I
am sure that other colleges would benefit from sharing that example of
good
practice.</div>

						</b> The scheme that the hon. Lady outlines
appears to be an example of best practice relating to the employment
needs of young people. That is exactly what we would like to see
elsewhere.</div>

							<b class="B">Ms
Angela C. Smith</b> (Sheffield, Hillsborough) (Lab): I rise to
support the amendments and new clauses in the name of my hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham.</div>
					<a name="07061475000190"></a><div class="hs_Para">It is worth bearing in mind
that the present provisions relate to the transition at the age of 16
from formal schooling and education to post-16 education&#151;the
16-to-19 phase and above. As a country, we spend a lot of time focusing
on the needs of young people as they move from primary to secondary
school&#151;from key stage 2 to key stage 3. The Government and the
Department for Education and Skills have recognised the problems of
transition, and a lot of new ideas are being implemented to deal with
the transition from key stage 2. Is it not therefore about time that we
paid more attention to what happens to young people at the end of the
key stage 4, when they leave school to move into the adult
world?</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column149" />Column number: 149</div>
					<a name="07061475000191"></a><div class="hs_Para">The idea that we need to do
something is supported by evidence showing that too many people still
leave school at 16, or nearly 17. They then become NEETs, which I
always think is an unfortunate name for those who are not engaged in
education, employment or training, because it sounds slightly
insulting. The other interesting point is that many of the young people
who end up as one of those unfortunate statistics do so after a further
year of formal education. It is when people reach 17, or in some cases
nearly 18, that the figures start to rise, and that is certainly the
case in my area. That says something about the lack of support that
exists for young people once they move on from formal school and
education. We therefore need to do something, and I am pleased to see
the proposals before us.</div>
					<a name="07061475000192"></a><div class="hs_Para">Let me briefly remind the
Committee of why we need to do something. It is not only that such a
situation represents a terrible waste of the talent and abilities of
the individuals concerned or of the opportunities available to society,
but that the country cannot afford to lose such abilities,
because&#151;it is worth making this point over and over
again&#151;we are competing in a global economy. This country can
succeed internationally only if its people are sufficiently skilled to
allow it to stay ahead of the field and at the competitive edge of
international markets. For that reason alone&#151;to ensure the
future prosperity of our country and of all our young people as they
move through adult life&#151;it is important that we put all the
necessary measures in place from year 10 onwards, and indeed earlier,
so that we get things right.</div>
					<a name="07061475000193"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 3 is particularly
useful because it implies that the measures outlined need to be clearly
in place pre-16, and I would argue that a seamless programme of support
should be available to young people from year 7 or 8 onwards. It also
implies the need for clear collaboration to ensure that crystal clear
career pathways are available to young people once they are in
secondary education so that they no longer have a sense of confusion,
as they often do at the moment, about what they should do next, what
options they should pursue from year 9 onwards and what they should do
once they leave school.</div>
					<a name="07061475000194"></a><div class="hs_Para">Clear career routes and
professional pathways are a critical part of a young person&#146;s
education, and new clause 3 suggests to some extent the steps that are
necessary to ensure that we get all that right. Several local
authorities across the country are already working hard on the issue,
and the 14-to-19 work that is going on in places such as Knowsley,
Wolverhampton and Sheffield is fantastic. The Government need to learn
from all that, and they are indeed doing so, but they need to continue
learning and putting in place measures to address the issues as they
arise. To some extent, that is what new clause 3
does.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000327"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07061475000195"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 4 is
equally important. It is not just that young people do not go on at 16
or drop out of full-time education or employment and training at 17,
they sometimes get on the wrong courses. That is a big issue in
FE.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column150" />Column number: 150</div>
					<a name="07061475000196"></a><div class="hs_Para">I know that because I have been
there and I have seen young people on the wrong courses. I know of the
pressures that force tutors to encourage young people to take up places
on courses because they are desperate to make up their numbers. That is
just not on. In the end it is a short-term measure which unravels
because the young people end up dropping out. They are not in the right
place and they are not doing the right course. That is one of the
reasons why at age 17 the numbers of young people classed as NEETs
rise.</div>
					<a name="07061475000197"></a><div class="hs_Para">There is a need
for independent information, advice and guidance. Let us get the
concept of independence clearly on the table. It is extremely
important. It is important to have mentors for other reasons. Many
young people between the ages of 16 and 19 are incredibly ambitious.
They are much more ambitious than my generation ever was. They are keen
to earn money and to get the things that we never thought of having
until we were in our early 20s. A lot of young people want to buy a
car. They want to enjoy life. When I was 17 I thought that I would
enjoy life when I was a bit older and earning the money to do
it.</div>
					<a name="07061475000198"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I was a tutor
I often found that young people came into college in the morning
absolutely shattered. They were almost falling asleep because they had
been working at the local Morrisons on the night shift. That is a real
issue in many parts of the country. The education maintenance allowance
has done a great deal to address that problem, but let us not
underestimate how ambitious many young people are to have money in
their pockets. That is a very good thing, but we need mentors to ensure
that young people are advised about the importance of getting the right
balance between work, study and play.</div>
					<a name="07061475000199"></a><div class="hs_Para">That balance is encouraged very
well in university and higher education institutions, but it is almost
non-existent in FE. Usually it is down to the tutor to say to the young
person, &#147;Come on, you are doing too much here. You need to hold
back a bit. Your studies are suffering. Cut down your hours and let us
get this sorted out.&#148; That is a very difficult message to pass
on to a young person, especially one from a deprived background where
there is no parental income to supplement their lifestyle. These are
the people whom we need to help the
most.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07061475000328"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.30
pm</div>
					<a name="07061475000200"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 5 is
very close to my heart. Young people with special educational needs and
severe disabilities are almost completely ignored by the post-16
education system. Improvements have been made in recent years, but they
tend to be piecemeal. In Sheffield, the special school for young people
on the autistic spectrum and with communication disorders has
established a relationship with the FE college and developed pathways
post-16 for a number of young people on that spectrum. However,
provision is not comprehensive, because the support mechanisms are not
in place for children post-16 with special needs. That area of SEN
provision that has been neglected for a long time, and the new clause
is a start to the process of looking seriously at the issue.</div>
					<a name="07061475000201"></a><div class="hs_Para">A great deal has been done in
recent years on SEN. In Sheffield, our special schools have been almost
completely rebuilt. The programme is almost complete, so I want it on
the record now that the Government 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column151" />Column number: 151</div>have done a great deal to help SEN education in terms of the buildings
and the range of options that we offer young people through to the age
of 16. Now, having congratulated the Government on that record, I say
that it is time to start thinking about that post-16 period, because it
has been neglected for a long time. The problem has not begun to occur
recently, because it has been happening for
generations.</div>
					<a name="07061475000202"></a><div class="hs_Para">Attitudes
have moved on: 20 or 30 years ago nobody gave much thought to what
happened to young people once they left school at 16 if they were
disabled or had serious learning difficulties. It was all right for
them to stay at home watching television all day and for parents and
carers to have to cope with all that. Society has moved on, however,
and we are now not prepared to tolerate such a waste of a young
person&#146;s life or the strain that such responsibilities can put
on parents and carers. It is now time to address the particular needs
of that section of the school
population.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000203"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000422"></a>Mr.
Wilson:
						</b> I have been listening carefully to the hon. Lady,
particularly with regard to the neglect to which she says young people
over the age of 16 have been subjected. Does she think that that is why
the number of young people not in education, employment or training has
grown since
1997?</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000204"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000423"></a>Ms
Smith:
						</b> I have not said that. That section of the
population rarely had access to such provision in the first place. For
generations, its needs have been ignored, which is the whole point of
my argument. This Government have focused on special educational needs,
but it is now time for them to focus on the post-16 educational needs
of that section of the
population.</div>
					<a name="07061475000205"></a><div class="hs_Para">I should
like briefly to draw attention to new clause 6. The Duke of Edinburgh
award is successful in my city. Traditionally, it tended to focus on
schools in the richest part of the city, but it has moved forward in
recent years. It has worked well with the local authority, and it now
works in the vast majority of our schools. That partnership, as well as
the wider education partnership in the city, has attempted to reach out
to young people from deprived communities, who would not traditionally
have thought of achieving a Duke of Edinburgh award. That answers the
point that the hon. Member for Rugby and Kenilworth made about state
intervention in the voluntary sector. I understand his point, but a
sensible partnership between the voluntary sector and state education
can encourage and increase young people&#146;s involvement in
voluntary
activities.</div>
					<a name="07061475000206"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Duke
of Edinburgh award is a sterling example of a programme that is not
only enjoyable for young people, but improves their employability. I
know for a fact that it is highly regarded by employers, although I do
not forget that a number of voluntary leadership and skills development
programmes are available to young people, which is important because
not every young person is suited to the Duke of Edinburgh
award.</div>
					<a name="07061475000207"></a><div class="hs_Para">I commend the
new clauses to the Committee. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s
response to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for City of
Durham about the best practice suggested by the new clauses. I hope
that the Minister will feel able to tell us how that best practice can
be embedded in our education system.</div>
					
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column152" />Column number: 152</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000424"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> I want to make a few broadly supportive remarks.
I thank the hon. Member for City of Durham for tabling these useful new
clauses. She is absolutely right about the patchy nature of careers
advice in this country; in some places, for some young people, it is
good, but for many others it is either difficult to access or not of
high enough quality, and it often lacks adequate ambition to push young
people forward. In my constituency, sadly, the options are often
tailored to the expectations of a particular type of young person and
do not reflect all the things that they might be able to
achieve.</div>
					<a name="07061475000209"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough spoke well about the importance of
extending access, particularly for young people with special
educational needs beyond the age of 16. During the course of the Bill,
many charitable organisations have raised with me the fact that it is
often difficult for such young people, especially those with physical
or learning disabilities, to access
provision.</div>
					<a name="07061475000210"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There
are three issues that I would prefer to be separated&#151;mentoring,
careers advice and volunteering. The details of the three issues are
slightly conflated. Mentoring is something that should extend to all
young people at all stages of education, and it should probably take
place within the school or college setting. Careers advice, however, is
different. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough has used the
word &#147;independent&#148; several times, and careers advice
should be independent. That is crucial, especially if one is trying to
raise expectations and give tailored advice to the young person. We
need to get away from the type of prejudices that, sadly, can occur
within a school, where people, over a long period of time, have come to
know the performance or behaviour of a young person. I would like to
see careers advice taken away from that setting. In a sense, therefore,
I would like to separate careers advice and mentoring. Mentoring is
about pastoral care. Careers advice will obviously include a pastoral
element, and a student may wish to discuss the advice that they receive
from a careers adviser with their mentor, but careers advice has to
happen independently.</div>
					<a name="07061475000211"></a><div class="hs_Para">Furthermore, 16 is far too late
for careers advice to start. I know that both hon. Members who spoke on
this subject, the hon. Members for City of Durham and for Sheffield,
Hillsborough, said that, but it needs to start at 11. Hon. Members will
have heard me witter on about the Tomlinson report at great length at
every opportunity. Certainly, my vision is a flexible approach for 14
to 19-year-olds, so that young people can move between vocational and
academic courses at all stages between 14 and 19. However, if we are to
have that type of system, there must be access to good, independent
careers advice from the earliest stage and right the way through the
system, because the system will not work without it.</div>
					<a name="07061475000212"></a><div class="hs_Para">With regard to the ideas about
volunteering, I am very sympathetic to the points that the hon. Member
for Sheffield, Hillsborough has suggested. Personally, I would not want
to see this matter dealt with in legislation, unless the legislation
were a good less detailed than this Bill and only enabling legislation.
Volunteering is the type of issue that can be dealt with perfectly well
by encouraging local authorities to set up their own schemes and
encouraging schools to collaborate. Volunteering does not tend to work 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column153" />Column number: 153</div>terribly well with one school, and it is often necessary to have more
opportunities that schools can explore by collaborating with each
other. That is certainly an issue that local authorities could take a
lead
on.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000213"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000425"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> This is a useful series of amendments and new
clauses, and it has enabled us to speak about the context in which the
Bill will fit. The speeches so far have made those contextual points
powerfully.</div>
					<a name="07061475000214"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should
be frank about the dilemmas that we face, not as party politicians but
as public policy makers. The first of three dilemmas that I want to
highlight during this short debate is the conflict between the
importance of investing early in a child&#146;s life in the core
skills that are necessary for all other educational progress, and the
need to rescue those young people who have been failed by the
system.</div>
					<a name="07061475000215"></a><div class="hs_Para">Dealing with
that conflict is very difficult for the Government, because roughly
45,000 young people who leave school each year are functionally
illiterate and/or innumerate&#151;they are not entirely illiterate or
innumerate, but they are functionally so. Many of those young people,
although not all of them, will become NEETs. Much of the
Government&#146;s focus, therefore, has been on skills for life and
ensuring that those young people have a second chance, and one
understands why the Government have taken that view. Who could argue
otherwise, and why would we not want to bring those young people back
into learning? However, focusing on that problem prompts two questions.
If public policy attention and resources are focused there, does that
mean that there is less to spend on earlier education? Of course, the
answer is yes. Moreover, does it reduce pressure on schools to ensure
that those basic skills are acquired up to the age of 16?
</div>
					<a name="07061475000216"></a><div class="hs_Para">My two little darling
sons, who are aged three and six, will be taken by the state and
educated for a long time; as their parent, I am legally obliged to
ensure that that happens. If, at the age of 16, they could not read,
write or count proficiently, I would feel cheated, and they would have
been cheated. If the Government have any duty, it is surely the duty,
in terms of education at least, to ensure that people end up with those
core skills.</div>
					<a name="07061475000301"></a><div class="hs_ParaIndent">All kinds of
factors affect people&#146;s capacity to learn. Many come from
altogether less charmed backgrounds than the one that I enjoyed and
that I hope my children will enjoy, too. However, it is a mark of
failure that, barring extreme circumstances and particular special
needs, we still cannot ensure that all who enjoy a state education
leave school numerate and literate. Surely we have that
responsibility.</div>
				
					
					<a name="07061475000329"></a><div class="hs_Timeline">2.45
pm</div>
					<a name="07061475000217"></a><div class="hs_Para">The first
dilemma is about resources. Some in the primary sector will
say&#151;I am sure that the Minister has heard it said, as have you,
Mr. Atkinson&#151;&#147;We are worried that the emphasis
on the 14-to-19 age group will de-emphasise the significance of younger
children.&#148; I do not think that that is the Government&#146;s
intention. As public policy makers, we need to have an honest debate
about it. I do not know the answer, but we need a serious, open-ended
and even-handed discussion about the matter.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column154" />Column number: 154</div>
					<a name="07061475000218"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second dilemma is
highlighted in the Leitch report. In a slightly partisan fashion, may I
say how disappointed I am that the Government have delayed their
response to the report? We had expected and eagerly anticipated that
the Prime Minister in waiting&#151;the Chancellor of the
Exchequer&#151;perhaps the Minister and certainly the Secretary of
State for Education and Skills would this week furnish the Committee
and the House with their detailed response to the report, which was
published last December. We are now told that the response will come
later, but we do not know whether that is days, weeks or months away.
It certainly is not good enough that we still do not know where the
Government stand on the fundamentals of the Leitch review. I hope that
the Minister will say something about it today.</div>
					<a name="07061475000219"></a><div class="hs_Para">That is the partisan bit over
and done with; I return to my main theme. Leitch makes it clear that
the demand for unskilled labour is plummeting. Although it is contested
by some economists, I tend to share Leitch&#146;s view; he argued
that the demand for unskilled labour will fall radically. Indeed, he
said that it will fall by 2020 to 600,000 jobs. Simultaneously, the
number of NEETs, which has been referred to by members on both sides,
has grown to 1.3 million&#151;a growth of about 15 per cent. since
1997, as we heard earlier. If we take account of those young people
older than 24 or 25, and consider those aged between 30 and 35, there
is a substantial number of people not in work. Given the changing
macro-economic profile of Great Britain, we have little chance of
getting them into work unless we can get them skilled.</div>
					<a name="07061475000220"></a><div class="hs_Para">The second dilemma then is how
much emphasis should be placed on bringing those people back into
education and skilling, and how much we should concentrate on
upskilling and reskilling the existing work force. Given the
demographic profile, unless we do the second, we will not meet out
skills targets. That is another big dilemma for the Government, and a
big issue for public policy makers.</div>
					<a name="07061475000221"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third and final dilemma,
which is relevant to these helpful amendments and new clauses, is about
advice and guidance. I have come to the conclusion, in common with Lord
Leitch, that we need to disaggregate the careers service from
Connexions. Connexions does an important job for a particular group of
young people. It is true that some young people, particularly those who
are described as NEETs&#151;not a terribly helpful term, I
agree&#151;need a multifunctional service. However, I am not sure
that we have not lost something in the careers service by asking those
who run it to be Jacks-of-all-trades.</div>
					<a name="07061475000222"></a><div class="hs_Para">We should probably maintain a
service like Connexions, but have an all-age careers service running in
parallel. That could be cost-effective. The cost of the old careers
service was about half of what Connexions now costs us. As for the
throughput of people, there has been nothing like a doubling in the
number of clients. Taking into account what the Learning and Skills
Council spends in addition on adult careers, we could, within the
existing budget, reorganise the careers advice structure so as to
deliver much better advice both to young people and to those in the
work force seeking to upskill and reskill. That is why it will be
Conservative policy to develop an all age career service alongside
Connexions. Public policy makers will have 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column155" />Column number: 155</div>to address the dilemma of how much emphasis to place on the
multifunctional role&#151;dealing with people with
problems&#151;and how much to put on the careers role that is likely
to affect the majority of
people.</div>
					<a name="07061475000223"></a><div class="hs_Para">In conclusion,
let me say a word about mentoring. We have heard a lot about it, and I
want to mention it in relation to apprenticeships. I am sorry to raise
the matter again, because I know that every time I do so, the blood
pressure of the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Corby, of whom I
am immensely fond, rockets. I do not want to cause him any unnecessary
distress this late in our proceedings. However, I see that he is
getting his notes out; he is preparing his weaponry for a
counterattack. It is clear that there is not enough mentoring in
relation to apprenticeships. Most people think of an apprentice as an
eager young learner acquiring a key competence by the side of an
experienced craftsman, with a serious emphasis on workplace training.
It is not unreasonable to say that every apprenticeship that bears the
name should be employer-engaged and mentored, with a serious element of
workplace training.</div>
					<a name="07061475000224"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						When he talks
of mentoring, the Minister will tell us that that happens anyway. He
will say that much of my complaint is imagined. However that is not the
view of the adult learning inspectorate, which has said that it is
possible to complete an apprenticeship without ever having set foot in
a workplace. The inspectorate undertook a survey in which it found
examples of programme-led apprenticeships that were completed even
though they contained no significant period of time spent in employment
and little prospect of a job at the end of the programme. The survey
came across some engineering apprentices completing a full framework on
a six-month programme-led pathway with no period of employment and
little or no work experience.</div>
					<a name="07061475000225"></a><div class="hs_Para">Some apprenticeships, by no
means all and not in all sectors, are not mentored; many are
insufficiently mentored; some have no employer engagement; and many
have an inadequate workplace element. It is critical that the best of
the apprenticeship system should become typical. Indeed, it should
become the standard for the whole system. When we talk about mentoring,
let us talk about that, and let us once again, as public policy makers,
have an honest debate about it.

						 The hon. Gentleman just

today even in his absence&#151;but I think that he is a splendid
chap. However, we cannot blame him for what has happened in the past 10

happening now and what is likely to happen. I make no apology or

skills. But&#151;I want to put this clearly on the record and I
should like the hon. Gentleman to retract what he has been saying
repeatedly in the Chamber and now in Committee&#151;they cannot
complete their apprenticeship until they have demonstrated occupational
competence. This can be achieved only in the workplace. The scenario he
described is simply not
possible.</div>
					<a name="07061475000230"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, it
should be noted that these programme-led apprenticeships are not widely
undertaken. In fact more than 90 per cent. of apprentices are in waged
employment from the very start of their programme. I appreciate that
Conservatives now, unlike when they were in government, have decided to
take a positive interest in apprenticeships. However, it would be
helpful if, instead of running down the apprenticeship system and
over-exaggerating any flaws there may be, the hon. Gentleman could see
his way to celebrating the tripling of apprenticeships in this country
and their 60 per cent completion rate&#151;not the 43 per cent.
completion rate that his document describes&#151;and for once stand
up for apprentices rather than trying to run them
down.</div>

							<a name="07061475000429"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> Let us be clear about this. I enjoy these
exchanges. I know that the Minister&#146;s intentions are good and
right. I do not deny that he wants this to work. But we need to be
straightforward. The 2007 figures from the Office for National
Statistics make it clear that the number of enrolments for advanced
apprenticeships&#151;level 3 apprenticeships&#151;and the number of
enrolments in level 2 apprenticeships are falling. That is not a cause
for celebration or complacency but for considerable concern.</div>
					<a name="07061475000232"></a><div class="hs_Para">When I cite the Adult Learning
Inspectorate it is on the basis of its work in 2006. There may have
been a dramatic improvement in the last few months. I bow to the
Minister&#146;s greater&#151;I will not say expertise&#151;but
certainly his capacity to seek advice. I do not have civil servants
sitting behind me, although I have equally good advice from my hon.
Friends, who are immensely well informed about these matters. They do
not suggest to me that there has been that dramatic change in the last
few weeks and months.</div>
					<a name="07061475000233"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Adult Learning Inspectorate
said that it found that colleges were told to rebrand learners as
apprentices simply because they were working towards qualifications
such as technical certificates that were 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column157" />Column number: 157</div>also part of the apprenticeship framework. However, there was little
prospect of these learners progressing to full apprenticeships with a
work placement. The rebranding exercise enabled colleges to reach their
targets for apprentice enrolments, but of the 34,000 full-time students
designated as programme-led apprentices, only about 3,000 progressed to
full apprenticeships.</div>
					<a name="07061475000234"></a><div class="hs_Para">Even allowing for that sleight
of hand, the number of enrolments has fallen. Goodness knows what would
have happened if there had not been that rebranding. Yet to hear the
Under-Secretary one would think that there was not a
problem.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000235"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000430"></a>The
Chairman:
						</b> Order. I remind the Committee that this is about
mentoring, not apprenticeships. Although we have had an enjoyable
debate, we should return to the subject
matter.</div>

							<a name="07061475000431"></a>Mr.

face public policy makers. I tried to do so in a reasonably even-handed
way. The Under-Secretary and I will continue elsewhere to debate the
issues that you have told us we must not debate any further here,
Mr. Atkinson. However in anticipating his response, I hope
that we can have the kind of bipartisan discussions about the way that
public policy is prioritised in the terms that this debate has allowed
us to explore.</div>

							<b class="B">Mr.
Austin Mitchell</b> (Great Grimsby) (Lab): If the hon.
Gentleman thinks that those are a few words, I wonder what he thinks a
long speech would be. I am going to deliver a few words slowly. I
congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for City of Durham and for
Sheffield, Hillsborough on the amendments and new clauses, which have
been eloquently and articulately presented to us, in respect of further
education.</div>
					<a name="07061475000239"></a><div class="hs_Para">I am sorry
that the amendments and new clauses have been met by such quibbling on
the other side of the Committee&#151;the Liberals quibble that we
should do this, but not that; and that we should do it this way, but
not that way&#151;as well as the damned-by-faint-praise arguments
advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The
Deepings. I call him my hon. Friend because he and I are the little
fishermen. We went on a fishing expedition to Spanish ports to find
fish that were landed below minimum landing sizes to damn the Spanish
fishing industry. His Spanish was so bad that, after going directly to
the pilchard landings, which was the only thing that people could
understand with his Spanish, we never found any small fish. It was a
failed attempt to sabotage the common fisheries policy, but it was a
bonding
experience.</div>
					<a name="07061475000240"></a><div class="hs_Para">The other
side of the Committee is beginning to show signs of life. My hon.
Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings had reduced his
ranks to such a catatonic trance that they were totally 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column158" />Column number: 158</div>silent, until suddenly this issue came up and I saw eyes open, cash
registers begin to fly and figures appear&#151;this is going to cost
money, &#147;Kill, kill,
kill!&#148;</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000433"></a>Jeremy
Wright:
						</b> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving
way; the Committee always stays awake when he speaks. The question that
I asked was not designed to kill the proposals, but it is fair to ask
what they will
cost.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000242"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000434"></a>Mr.
Mitchell:
						</b> That is the perennial question; not whether it
is right in principle, or whether it should be done or whether it is
going to make for a better society, but what will it cost? That is
exactly my point.</div>
					<a name="07061475000243"></a><div class="hs_Para">The
hon. Member for Brent, East has reduced her party by firm discipline
into total silence, although there were signs of life when this issue
came up. The Whip has asked me to be brief, and I always accede to his
requests, so I shall speak for only about a quarter of an
hour.</div>
					<a name="07061475000244"></a><div class="hs_Para">I want to
commend the principle behind the amendments and new clause. We had many
problems in raising the school leaving age to 16, and we solved them
inadequately. We will have more problems keeping people in education or
training until they are 18, unless we provide the kind of imaginative
framework outlined by my two hon. Friends
today.</div>
					<a name="07061475000245"></a><div class="hs_Para">We always cater
so well for academics, the middle class and the intelligent in this
country, but they tend to get on, whatever happens, through their own
ability. However, we do not cater for, support and sustain those who
are less adequate intellectually. I understand the desire to get out of
school and into adult life and to be free of school trammels, but such
people are, in effect, throwing away their futures in many cases,
unless they are helped adequately and are sustained for what is a
difficult period. I am sure that parents help, but such people need
some other support mechanism.</div>
					<a name="07061475000246"></a><div class="hs_Para">The SEN students from
Sheffield, to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield,
Hillsborough has referred, will find it difficult. I constantly have to
argue about the ending of courses at the institute in Grimsby because
they do not lead to a diploma and therefore do not qualify for finance
that would provide a specialist for each student. We must have an
imaginative framework to help these people, because a skill, an
education or an involvement is a platform on which to build life. Those
people who are deprived of those things live a second-rate existence
and it is our job, in providing training and higher and further
education to see that people are sustained through the system and
helped to seize opportunities, rather than being cast into the dustbin
of life, as I would put it; that is, being cast out unsupported and
unhelped. It is a little impractical to include such ideas in this
Bill, but I hope that those are the lines that the Government are
thinking along as we go in for this all-important
transition.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000247"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000435"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> We have genuinely had an exceedingly good debate,
and I would particularly like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for City of Durham on introducing the new clauses. When we first saw
the new clauses in the Department, one of my officials, totally
unprompted, said, &#147;This person clearly 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column159" />Column number: 159</div>knows what they are talking about.&#148; Through their contributions
today, both she and my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield,
Hillsborough have adequately and emphatically demonstrated
that.</div>
					<a name="07061475000248"></a><div class="hs_Para">The Government
are sympathetic to the intention behind these new clauses. Indeed, key
elements of the proposals are already being developed as part of
Government policies through, for example, the &#147;Every Child
Matters&#148; and &#147;Youth Matters&#148; strategies. We are
also considering them as part of our own proposals on raising the
participation age. Given the circumstances and the changes that we are
considering, however, now is not the right time to create additional
legislation for young people aged 16 to
18.</div>
					<a name="07061475000249"></a><div class="hs_Para">Having said that,
let me address each of the proposals in turn. New clause 3 seeks to
place the Secretary of State under a statutory duty to arrange for an
assessment resulting in a personal profile for all students in their
last year of compulsory schooling. Progress files&#151;a similar
concept&#151;were recommended by the Dearing report in 1996, and
indeed they are now modelled as part of best practice across the
system. Most schools already have such measures in place in ways that
reflect the individual circumstances of both the young people concerned
and the school. I think that that is better than the one-size-fits-all
approach to
legislation.</div>
					<a name="07061475000250"></a><div class="hs_Para">On school
leavers, head teachers are already required under the pupil information
regulations to prepare a report briefly setting out details of progress
and achievements during the final year in curriculum subjects and
activities. Again, I think that that answer responds to the concerns
that have been
expressed.</div>
					<a name="07061475000251"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						New
clause 4 goes to the heart of the debate. It stresses the importance of
giving information, advice and guidance, but I do not believe that
further changes in legislation are necessary at this stage. At the
moment, any young person in the 13-to-19 age range can already access
an individual professional for advice and guidance through the
Connexions service. That is not a static situation, and it is evolving.
The Connexions service holds detailed assessment information about the
needs of young people, and Connexions personal advisers are trained
professionals who are responsible for providing information, advice and
guidance to the young people
concerned.</div>
					<a name="07061475000252"></a><div class="hs_Para">Connexions
and schools agree arrangements for making services available to young
people; in many cases, that involves Connexions having a direct
presence in the school. However, I would be the first to admit that we
need to do more. That is why this summer we are planning to publish a
set of standards for young people&#146;s information, advice and
guidance.</div>

Rammell:
						</b> As I was saying, I would be the first to
acknowledge that we need to do more. We are planning to publish this
summer a set of standards&#151;covering information, advice and
guidance&#151;to ensure that all young people benefit from high
quality advice and 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column160" />Column number: 160</div>guidance wherever they are, and that the standard of the services with
which they are provided is consistently high across the country,
although they will be differentiated to meet the needs of individuals.
We are keen to spread best practice.</div>
					<a name="07061475000255"></a><div class="hs_Para">Funding and responsibility for
Connexions is migrating from the Connexions partnerships to local
authorities, a process that we expect to be complete by next April.
That, combined with the introduction of quality standards for
information, advice and guidance, will further strengthen the services
that young people receive.</div>
					<a name="07061475000256"></a><div class="hs_Para">That was the most important
part of the debate. Let me now respond to some of the specifics,
particularly mentoring. One example of effective practice that we want
to encourage is that of transition mentors. In that model, an adult who
has been supporting a young person in school stays with him across the
transition, continuing to work with him at the start of post-16
learning. A number of areas are already using that approach. The mentor
can be based in a school, college, Connexions service, local business
or community.</div>
					<a name="07061475000257"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough raised some important
issues in terms of transition at the end of key stage 4. One of the
most significant things that we have to consider&#151;as she knows,
we are doing so&#151;is raising the compulsory education and training
age. For far too long, we have allowed 16-year-olds to lose all contact
with the world of education and training. That is crazy. We have to
ensure that we make the right offering available. That is why the
expansion of apprenticeships and the roll-out of diplomas is crucial.
When one considers that education and training until the age of 18 was
first proposed in this country in 1918, and that it appeared in
Butler&#146;s Education Act in 1944, the fact that that is still not
the situation today is lamentable. That is why we are pressing for it
so strongly.</div>
					<a name="07061475000258"></a><div class="hs_Para">Other
hon. Members have talked about information, advice and guidance. We
need to ensure in that regard that we lay a responsibility on the
further education provider to consult not only existing learners but
potential ones&#151;those who are not yet in the system&#151;to
ensure that college provision, courses and the way in which the system
operates genuinely cater for their needs. The hon. Member for South
Holland and The Deepings made the point that functional illiteracy and
innumeracy do not amount to people not being able to read, write and
add up. That is important; sometimes such terms are misunderstood. He
also, rightly, called for further improvements in the school system. I,
too, want improvements to continue. However, we need to acknowledge the
progress that has taken place. I have observed it particularly in my
constituency, where 10 years ago 28 per cent. of young people gained
five A to C grades at the age of 16. Today, the figure is 58 per cent.
That represents thousands upon thousands of young people whose life
chances have improved.</div>
					<a name="07061475000259"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon. Gentleman also asked
specifically about the Government&#146;s response to Leitch. I assure
him that that response will come very soon. However, we were right to
separate the response to Leitch from the important announcement that I
have been involved with elsewhere in London during the gap between 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column161" />Column number: 161</div>Committee sittings&#151;along with the Under-Secretary of State for
Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for Corby, the
Chancellor, the Secretary of State and Digby Jones. That was the launch
of the skills pledge, the incredibly important process by which
employers up and down the country sign up to commit to educate and
train their employees to level 2. That will be hugely important in
changing the culture of education and training in this country, and I
hope that it will be welcomed across the House.</div>
					<a name="07061475000260"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						There has
also been a lot of reference to NEETs. It is important to make it clear
that the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in education, employment
or training has remained fairly constant at about 10 per cent. for the
past 10 years. We have made progress: more than three quarters of
16-year-olds are in full-time education or training. That is the
highest proportion ever. However, the situation is not
static&#151;those in the NEETs category include people on gap years,
mothers looking after children and young people between jobs and
courses. We cannot simply say that there is a permanent 10 per cent.
who are excluded from the system. Nevertheless, there are causes for
concern, and we are setting ourselves tough and challenging targets to
reduce the figure further.</div>

						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000437"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> To save my putting down a series of incisive
written questions, which will cause the Minister no end of difficulties
and his civil servants still more, will he write to the
Committee&#151;or to me directly if he prefers&#151;giving the
breakdown of the number of NEETs? I think that he is right; it is a big
total, and it includes gap-year students and all kinds of other people,
some of whom have perennial difficulties, such as mental health
problems or addictions. A good breakdown of that figure would enable an
intelligent debate. I hope that he takes up the gauntlet that I have
laid and drops me a line about that.</div>

challenges that we face. Too often, the tabloid headlines do not do it
justice.</div>
					<a name="07061475000263"></a><div class="hs_Para">The hon.
Gentleman talked about the Connexions service and the position of the
Conservative party on that issue, which, he will forgive me for saying,
has not always been crystal clear. I remember the debate on widening
participation in education that took place on the Floor of the House a
couple of months ago. His hon. Friend the Member for Henley
(Mr. Johnson), when challenged on the Conservative
party&#146;s policy on Connexions, said that it was to abolish the
service, at which point the hon. Member for Havant (Mr.
Willetts) started pulling at his jacket. Literally five minutes later,
the Hon. Member for Henley was forced to stand up again and say that he
should have said that he would reform the Connexions
service.</div>

						</b> Just to reassure the Minister, I conveyed our

by anybody.</div>

Rammell:
						</b> The implied rebuke for the hon. Member for Henley
was clearly heard all the way across the Chamber.</div>
					<a name="07061475000266"></a><div class="hs_Para">My hon. Friend the
Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills eloquently put the
case in response to the points on apprenticeships that were raised.
People can play with figures, but the reality is that today, we have
250,000 young people in apprenticeships, compared with 70,000 10 years
ago. Completion rates have gone from 28 per cent. to 60 per cent., just
behind the performance of Germany, which has always been seen as an
exemplar in that regard. I am the first to admit that we can and should
do more, but given what happened to apprenticeships in the 1980s and
1990s, we should not take lectures from the Conservative party. In
response to documents written by the right hon. Member for Wokingham, I
say that putting skills training in his hands would be like asking King
Herod to manage the Sure Start
programme.</div>
					<a name="07061475000267"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause
5 deals with the transition from school to post-16 provision and adult
life of young people with special educational needs and disabilities.
It is an important issue for the Government. The 2005 report of the
Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit highlighted the difficulties that
young people face in their transition to adult life. It is crucial that
we do more. I am sympathetic to the sentiments behind the new clause,
but arrangements to provide those young people and their parents and
guardians with advice and information to help with the transition are
already in place, along with the statutory transition planning
arrangements, under the Education Act 1996, for young people with
statements of special educational needs. Crucial in that regard is the
annual review meeting, following which a transition plan is drawn up. A
special educational needs code of practice gives the Connexions service
responsibility for overseeing its implementation and liaising with the
young person, their parents or carers and post-16 providers. To my hon.
Friends, I say that we need to keep transition planning for those with
special educational needs under review. I have been discussing the
issues with campaigners recently and I hope that we can continue to
move forward on
them.</div>
					<a name="07061475000268"></a><div class="hs_Para">New clause 6
seeks to give the Secretary of State the power to</div>
					<a name="07061475000318"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;provide or secure the provision
of services to encourage, enable or assist...the creation of
programmes&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061475000269"></a><div class="hs_Para">to develop
young people&#146;s skills and qualifications,</div>
					<a name="07061475000319"></a><div class="hs_brev">&#147;in particular...for the
development of leadership skills and skills for future
employment.&#148;</div>
					<a name="07061475000270"></a><div class="hs_Para">I agree that
it is important to help young people to develop those skills, which are
key to supporting the transition to adulthood and to success in the
modern workplace. The new clause is not needed, however, because there
are already sufficiently broad statutory powers for the Secretary of
State to arrange that kind of provision. Sections 2 and 3 of the
Learning and Skills Act 2000, for example, give the LSC statutory
functions in relation to securing the provision of facilities for
post-16 education and
training.</div>
					<a name="07061475000271"></a><div class="hs_Para">The third
sector, to which a number of hon. Members referred, also has a crucial
role to play. Schemes such as the Duke of Edinburgh award, the scouts
and guides and the Prince&#146;s Trust do invaluable 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column163" />Column number: 163</div>work in that regard. The third sector is also a key partner with local
authorities in delivering youth opportunity and capital
funds.</div>
					<a name="07061475000272"></a><div class="hs_Para">A wide range
of opportunities to develop skills for leadership and work is already
available to young people aged 14 to 19, such as functional skills in
English, maths, information and communication technology, and personal,
learning and thinking skills. This has been an important debate. We
have had a good exchange of views. Many of the changes that have been
called for are already in train through particular strategies that we
are pursuing or ones that are under consideration. I hope that my hon.
Friend will therefore feel able to withdraw her
amendment.</div>

support young people in further education and training and to expand
opportunities in post-16 education. I am pleased to hear that guidance
is in the pipeline which might help to put a greater focus on some of
these issues. When his Department looks at extending the compulsory
school leaving age I urge him to ensure that these issues are high up
the agenda and that some opportunity is given to extending the range of
support that is available. I hope that he will keep a review of the
Connexions service in mind and consider whether it is the correct body
to provide all of this support. With that, I beg to ask leave to

							<a name="07061475000442"></a>Bill
Rammell:
						</b> On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. May
I propose a vote of thanks first to you, for chairing the Committee in
exemplary fashion? I am a keen sports fan and the best referees and
umpires are those who are not ever present and conspicuous. With your
quiet authority you have demonstrated exactly how a Committee should be
handled. I am sure that all Members are grateful for that.</div>
					<a name="07061475000285"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I also thank the<i class="I">
</i>hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings? Despite our
disagreements on bureaucracy, which I think will run and run, he has
throughout these proceedings been considerate, reasonable and
constructive. I was interested that he described himself as a mild,
considerate, romantic high Tory. Three of those I can agree with, the
fourth one puzzles me slightly. Perhaps on Report he can explain it in
more
detail.</div>
					<a name="07061475000286"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I
thank the hon. Member for Brent, East for her constructive engagement,
her clear commitment throughout the proceedings, and her prediction
that we would be done in two days. She has been proved absolutely
right. One of my right hon. Friends, who is genuinely a good friend,
sometimes describes the Whips Office as the Stasi. My hon. Friend the
Member for Brigg and Goole with his quiet diplomacy and force could not
be further from the reality of the Stasi. I hope that he takes that as
a compliment.</div>
					<a name="07061475000287"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						I thank the
Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for
Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire for his expert handling of the
Welsh elements of the Bill. I would also particularly like to thank the
Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my hon. Friend the
Member for Corby, who is a genuine friend. I know that all members of
the Committee are pleased to see him back in fitness and health. He was
working throughout his difficult times, and hon. Members can be
reassured that he never lost his sense of humour. That was proved when,
on seeing myself and the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who is as
follically challenged as I am, he looked us both in the eye and said,
&#147;At least after chemo, my hair will grow back&#148;. He has
been proved absolutely right.</div>
					<a name="07061475000288"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also offer thanks to my hon.
Friends, the Back Benchers on the Committee. The most difficult
challenge for Back Benchers supporting the Government when a Bill is
going through Parliament is to support it constructively while also
making a contribution to the Committee. I know that they have all been
able to do that, and have done so in an exemplary fashion.</div>
					<a name="07061475000289"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I offer thanks to all
the officials within the DFES and within the devolved administrations,
who have worked their socks off to get us to where we are today. I know
that I speak on behalf of the Secretary of State and the
Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for
Corby, when I thank them sincerely.</div>
					
					<a name="07061475000290"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<b class="B">
							<a name="07061475000443"></a>Mr.
Hayes:
						</b> I would just like to say a few words to endorse
much of what the Minister has said. His own 
<div class="Column"><a name="Column165" />Column number: 165</div>conduct, both before and during the Bill, has been of the highest order
and an example that I hope to follow when I take his job in a short
while.</div>
					<a name="07061475000291"></a><div class="hs_Para">I would like
to endorse the thanks given to you, Mr. Atkinson. You have
chaired our sittings with your usual competence and style. I also thank
all the officials who have made our meetings run as smoothly as they
have done.</div>
					<a name="07061475000292"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank
the hon. Member for Brent, East, with whom I have agreed to an alarming
degree. She must be terribly pleased that I have allowed her to indulge
her social diary, which I know is a whirlwind of exciting
events.</div>
					<a name="07061475000293"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank my
hon. Friends the Members for Upminster, who has kept me in order, for
Daventry, who is not here today, but is always a benevolent presence
when we debate issues relating to higher and further education, for
Rugby and Kenilworth, who is not entirely focused on financial matters,
although occasionally he is rightly focused on them, and for Reading,
East, who takes a profound interest and makes a valuable contribution
in these areas.</div>
					<a name="07061475000294"></a><div class="hs_Para">I also
want to thank the other Ministers, particularly the Under-Secretary of
State for Education and Skills, the hon. Member for Corby, whose
courage in recent weeks and months has been an example to us all. When
he looks in the mirror, he does not think first of his recent illness;
he thinks of that second. First, he thinks of his new-found virility,
on the grounds that men without much hair are at least reputed to be
particularly manly.</div>
					<div class="Column"><a name="Column166" />Column number: 166</div>
					<a name="07061475000295"></a><div class="hs_Para">I thank all the hon. Members who
have contributed to our debate. It has been a good, healthy, wholesome
and productive debate. I am grateful to have been part of
it.</div>

							<a name="07061475000444"></a>Sarah
Teather:
						</b> May I add my thanks, Mr. Atkinson, to
you for chairing this Committee so well and for getting us to the point
of finishing before 4 pm? I hasten to add that I do not have a social
appointment; I am meeting representatives of Barnardo&#146;s, who
will be waiting for me in Portcullis
House.</div>
					<a name="07061475000297"></a><div class="hs_Para">May I thank the
Minister for being constructive and willing to amend the Bill as we
have gone through it? It is good to have a Bill that is in a much
better form now than it was when it first came before our colleagues in
the other place.</div>
					<a name="07061475000298"></a><div class="hs_Para">I
suggested to the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the
hon. Member for Corby that he was obviously feeling better, because the
hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings was clearly irritating
him again, and he was willing to fight with him. I thank the hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings for a constructive
contribution and for often providing opportunities for joint working
which were helpful. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds,
North-West, who has had to leave just now, but who has been helpful
during the debates that we have had on the Bill.</div>
					<a name="07061475000299"></a><div class="hs_Para">Finally, I would like to add my
thanks to the Clerk, who is always extremely helpful on the detail of
amendments, and to the civil servants. I was able to pass on to them
the detail of what we wanted to do prior to the sittings of the
Committee, which was helpful.</div>
					<a name="07061475000300"></a><div class="hs_Para">
						<i class="I">Committee rose at sixteen
minutes to Four
