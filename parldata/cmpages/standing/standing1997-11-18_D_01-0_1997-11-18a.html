<P>
<H5>10.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chief Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mr. Alistair Darling): I beg to move,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the Bank of England Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Chair, and Mr. Butterfill, who will deputise for you, and Mrs. Dunwoody, who will act as a substitute for both of you, at least during this week. I am sure that the Committee will join me in that welcome.
<P>
Parts I and II of the Bill relate to the Bank of England. The Governor of the Bank has said that if any member of the Committee wishes to discuss any part of the Bill for which he has responsibility, or to meet him or members of the Monetary Policy Committee, he would be pleased to do so. I should be happy to arrange a trip--probably not collectively, as to hire a charabanc to go to Threadneedle Street would be inappropriate--if members of the Committee wish to take up that opportunity.
<P>
<B>Mr. Tim Boswell </B>(Daventry): I thank the Governor, through the Chief Secretary, for that offer. I rise to say that I am sure that that will be helpful to the Committee, and to pick up one phrase used by Chief Secretary. He referred to any areas of the Bill for which the Governor had responsibility.
<P>
It is important to put on record that the responsibility for legislation is entirely that of the Government, and they should acknowledge that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I think that the hon. Gentleman was intervening.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I had assumed that that was an intervention, otherwise it would have been out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Of course the Government are responsible for the legislation. I think that all members of the Committee had grasped that point. That is why I detailed those matters for which the Governor could be answerable. When I met the Governor last week in connection with another matter, he said that he would be happy to speak to members of the Committee, but, clearly, questions about the legislation itself should be addressed to Ministers, not to the Governor. The invitation was extended on the understanding that if Members wished to visit the Bank, they would go there to ask about matters to do with the Bank. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, however, for what I take to be an acknowledgement of that gesture from the Governor.
<P>
I have nothing further to add at this stage, as I am sure that the Committee is anxious to make progress.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I am sorry to delay my colleague. I recall from our summer debates on the Finance Bill that you are a stickler for procedure, which many of us welcomed. One question that was raised--which was rather more germane in the summer--was whether we could remove our jackets. I should love to do that, but I should hate to be pulled up by the Chair if I did so.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Of course, having asked, hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets. That does not apply to hon. Ladies, who may or may not do so as they choose.
<P>
<B>Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory </B>(Wells): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam, and I welcome Mr. Butterfill, when he takes over as your deputy, or alternate. I recall happy sittings in the Finance Bill under your chairmanship. I also recall, however, that you once made all of us put our jackets on again because we had anticipated your permission, and that we had to sit for half an hour in the heat as a penalty. During the rest of our sittings you were a model of correctness, helpfulness and humour.
<P>
Our sittings on the Finance Bill were successful, but I regret that that Bill--through no fault of the Chair--was rushed through in an unprecedentedly short time. We sat on every sitting day of the week, instead of twice a week as was always the practice with Finance Bills. Great areas of the Bill were left unscrutinised and undebated because its proceedings were under a guillotine and the Government wished to get it through before the House rose for the summer recess. Chunks of the Bill covering issues such as foreign income dividends remained in complete disarray at the end of the Bill's passage through the House. I hope that we can take this Bill at a more measured pace.
<P>
The Bill had an unfortunate origin in the rushed letter sent by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Governor of the Bank of England four days after the election. It was not until the House returned two weeks later that hon. Members were able to hear a statement. The Bill followed that. The original letter set out the independence of the Bank and everything that flows from that, but it got the balance between independence and accountability wrong. The flaws in that approach remain in the Bill.
<P>
It is particularly regrettable that there was nothing in the Labour party's manifesto about such an enormously important constitutional change. The manifesto contained a weasel-worded phrase about the possiblity of reforming the Bank of England, but it did not make clear the Labour party's clear intention--which it must have had--to make it independent in a number of important respects.
<P>
On Second Reading, the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) pointed out that new Labour's important business manifesto not only did not announce the intention to move towards an independent Bank of England or to introduce a contractual arrangement, but proposed a different structure. The right hon. Gentleman reminded the House that the business manifesto stated:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We propose a new monetary policy committee to decide on the advice which the Bank of England should give to the Chancellor.''--[Official Report, 11 November 1997; Vol. 300, C. 736.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
What ever happened to that pledge?
<P>
The Monetary Policy Committee will not advise, but will decide, on interest rate changes. It will operate according to a contract based on the inflation directive issued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Government have clearly broken their promise, and it is one of the many that they have broken. However, the breaking of the promise in the business manifesto is especially regrettable because it was broken within days of the Government taking office. The Bill's origins are unfortunate. 
<P>
I welcome the Chief Secretary's offer that the Government of the Bank of England will be able to talk to hon. Members about those elements of the Bill that involve the Bank. I expect, however, that the Governor regrets that more effort was not made to create a general coalition of interests in favour of the move towards the Bank's independence. In other countries with an independent central bank, a consensus has, over time, become established and all political parties assent to the arrangements. In setting up such arrangements, great efforts were made to create a coalition in favour of the central bank's independence.
<P>
In this country, the Chancellor of the Exchequer did nothing to assist that process. Not only did he not consult anyone else, but he did not give any notice, or tell Parliament of his plans. He disguised his intentions in the manifesto, and the Bill does not even make any genuflection towards trying to build a national consensus in favour of the move. I shall say more about that when we discuss the amendments later this morning. However, I welcome the fact that the Governor or the Bank will be available to meet hon. Members. I am sure that some of my hon. Friends will take him up on that offer.
<P>
We shall not seek to obstruct the Bill but we will subject it to proper scrutiny. The Prime Minister emphasised its economic, financial, political and constitutional importance. I am sure that I am speaking for all parties when I say that we must go through the Bill line by line, to discover its meaning and its future implications. We shall adopts a constructive approach and we look forward to the debate.
<P>
Question put and agreed to.
<P>
Resolved.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That during the proceedings on the Bank of England Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the first amendment I wish to make some announcements. First, I remind that Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments at morning or afternoon sittings.
<P>
The Committee comprises many new Members, which puts an additional burden on experienced Members to ensure that procedure is followed as closely as possible. In particular, I remind new Members that when the word ``you'' is used, it refers to me. On those grounds, I have been accused of some terrible things in the past.
<P>
Secondly, I should like to remind experienced Members and inform new Members that the grouping of amendments if for the benefit of the Committee, to ensure that we have only one argument on one subject. It is important that we keep to points arising from each particular grouping, though I know, of course, that there are times when an argument may need to be extended. I issue those small health warnings to encourage members of the Committee to think about what they are doing and saying in Committee.
<P>
Thirdly, new Members should not hesitate to ask me if there are matters that they do not understand.They should not worry; I shall not jump down their throats if they are wrong.
<P>
Resolved.
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Scheduel 1; Clauses 2 to 6; Schedule 2; Clauses 7 to 13; Schedule 3; Clauses 14 to 22; Schedule 4; Clause 23; Schedule 5; Clauses 24 to 26; Schedule 6; Clauses 27 to 37; Schedule 7; Clauses 38 to 42; Schedule 8; Clause 43; Schedule 9; Clauses 44 to 46; any new Clauses; any new Schedules.--[Mr. Darling.]<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 10, at end insert
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>`subject to the confirmation of those appointments by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.'<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
This modest amendment will improve the Bill and the future operations of the Bank of England. If the amendment is accepted, the composition of the court of directors will have the overtly expressed confidence not just of the Chancellor but of the House, which will have an important influence on the composition of the court.
<P>
The court is one of those rather mysterious British bodies. Its importance is acknowledged but few people know either its compostion or what exactly it does. I am more interested in what it will do in the future than what it did in the past.
<P>
In a memorandum to the Select Committee on the Treasury, Lord Kingsdown stressed that the court's role is vital. He said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The importance of Court in the management of the Bank should not be underestimated.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>He goes on to say:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``criticism in Court is taken very seriously, and one of the most powerful disciplines on the Bank's executive is the need to secure Court's agreement to major policy changes.''
<P>
</UL></FONT><H5>10.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
The Bill builds on that and it is clear that the court of directors has a most important role to play, not just because the Monetary Policy Committee will in part be accountable to it--we shall hear more about that when we get on to later sections of the Bill--but because it will have an overview of the performance of the Bank in general. That is well set out in the report of the Select Committee on the Treasury.
<P>
That report notes that the court of directors will be responsible for ensuring that the resources of the Bank are properly deployed and that it will also have an explicit role in
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``setting the strategic direction of the Bank''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>That quote comes from the Chancellor himself. The court will also act
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``as a source of advice for the Governor on business and market conditions''.
<P>
</UL></FONT>It will therefore be an intelligence gathering body too. We understand that the Chancellor particularly wants the court to pay attention to regional matters, to the economic performance of other parts of the United Kingdom, and so to filter, scrutinise and monitor sectoral information which will be useful for the formation of monetary policy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ross Cranston </B>(Dudley, North): Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that, in his submission to the Select Committee on the Treasury, Lord Kingsdown did not support a proposal along the lines now incorporated in the right hon. Gentleman's amendment?
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The hon. Gentleman can read Lord Kingsdown's entire submission, as can any other member of the Committee. I am drawing on his submission to show the importance of the court. That is what I am establishing and I will build on that argument to show that these appointments are too important to be left entirely to the discretion of one man--the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The other observations that Lord Kingsdown made, and other submissions, will be relevant to other parts of the argument and other parts of the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> It would probably be of great assistance to the Committee when dealing with the court, which has been in existence for many years, if the right hon. Gentleman could explain why, in the last 18 years, the last Administration did not offer confirmatory hearings in respect of its membership.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> Again, the right hon. Gentleman anticipates the remainder of my remarks. I am showing that under the Bill the court has a different and enhanced role. That is the point. The right hon. Gentleman cannot now start pretending that up until now the Bank of England has been able to conduct an independent monetary policy without reference to the Treasury. I served in the Treasury myself and I attended many meetings where interest rates were set. The decision was made not by an officer or employee of the Bank of England, or by any member of the court, but by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, answerable to the House of Commons.
<P>
It is now being proposed that there will be a decisive shift of responsibility from the Chancellor, from elected hands, to unelected official hands in the Bank of England, represented by the Monetary Policy Committee. That is an important change. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not say that this is nothing new, that it has all happened before and that my party presided over a similar regime for 18 years, because that is not so. It is most important that the Committee realise the importance of the change being proposed. The court clearly has a new and different role, which is why we suggest that the methods of appointment should be scrutinised closely. Our amendment offers a positive suggestion on how that should be done.
<P>
The court will have the important job of giving the Governor advice and overseeing the formation of policy generally, including the Bank's monetary policy. The TUC, which I assume is still a friendly body to the Labour party, has emphasised the importance of the court. It has suggested that it should become
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``a more active and outward looking body.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
That again is of interest to the House. If we agree with the TUC on this point we may try to ensure that that happens, and it can be done much more easily if the House has a role in making these appointments through the Treasury Committee.
<P>
I hope that the Committee agrees on the importance of the amendment as it affects the composition of the court. We agree that it is essential that the procedure whereby members of the court are appointed, or re-appointed, ensures the absolute integrity and impartiality of the members. Not only must they have great expertise, they should be seen to be free of any party political consideration. If the public, the markets and economic agents are to have confidence in the way in which the Bank of England discharges its functions, there must be absolute transparency. The appointments must be seen to be free from taint or suspicion.
<P>
We have seen during the past week or so that the Government cannot be trusted when big industry and large amounts of money come into the arena and they have to make important decisions. I refer to the fiasco over tobacco sponsorship and advertising. It is now known that the Government broke an election promise about tobacco sponsorship--a promise repeated recently by the Secretary of State for Health under pressure from the industry in question, which happens to have been a large donor to the Labour party. This is not speculation or opinion, it is fact. The Prime Minister has apologised for what happened. It is dangerous when a Government are seen to throw over a promise because they granted an audience to the industry. The three participants to the interview were donors to the Labour party--one to the tune of &#163;1 million--and it is possible that another donation was under consideration. Even if there was no wrong doing, it cannot be claimed that the system is transparent if the integrity and impartiality of the procedure were not evident, as they clearly were not. The Prime Minister--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Whether or not I have sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says, we are discussing the court of directors of the Bank of England, not the Prime Minister.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall not pursue the tobacco story, Mr. McWilliam, because by now it is all too familiar. Of course, collective responsibility applied there, as it will in the making of these appointments. But a Government who were known to bend, twist and give way to big business interests where a great deal of money was involved, and an election promise was broken, cannot be trusted to appoint members of the court when only one member--the Chancellor of the Exchequer--would be making the appointments.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is a Member of the House and we must regard all Members as honourable--as I am sure is the case. If the right hon. Gentleman continues to pursue the point that he is making, he may be in danger of being seriously out of order.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> The point that I am making is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer must be seen to be entirely free of partiality in the matter of the appointments. The system must be open and transparent. That would be best achieved by the establishment of confirmatory hearings, conducted by the Treasury Committee, for those important appointments.
<P>
I do not necessarily want to impugn the honesty or impartiality of a fellow Member of the House, and of course I defer to your strictures on that matter, Mr. McWilliam. However, it is most important that everyone should have confidence in the system that is being set up.
<P>
One of the main aims of the setting up of an independent Bank--and probably the main thinking behind the Bill--is that the setting of monetary policy and interest rate changes should give additional credibility to the system; that people should expect lower inflation in the future, and that that will help to bring about lower inflation. People must believe that the Bank is operating in what it considers to be the best interests of the British economy, without being influenced by outside or party considerations.
<P>
Later in the progress of the Bill we may consider quotations from a very good pamphlet--which has already been noted on Second Reading--by Professor David Gowland. Professor Gowland notes that independent banks in other parts of the world have been known to be politically motivated. In particular, he draws attention to the fact that Governor Arthur Burns was very anxious, in 1972, to facilitate Richard Nixon's re-election, and that that began to take precedence over other objectives. The Federal Reserve bank was set up in 1913 and has a long and generally hourable history. However, if Professor Gowland is right about its having begun to show political partiality in 1972, he has perhaps shown us that it is important to remove even the possibility of appointments being made on political grounds. Appointments must be seen to be free of such considerations. Amendment No. 1 would put those matters beyond doubt.

<P>

<B>Mr. Edward Davey </B>(Kingston and Surbiton): I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam, along with your team. I look forward to sittings of the Committee with you in charge. If, as a new Member, I ``you'' you too much--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman can ``you'' me as much as he likes. Anyone else would be a problem.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> That is what I meant. I am sure that if necessary your discipline will be applied speedily.
<P>
I support the amendment, but want to mention at the beginning of our sittings our general support for the Bill. Ministers will know that for many years Liberal Democrats have been keen on the policy to be implemented through the Bill. When the Labour party was in opposition we pushed it to come out in favour of the policy. We are pleased that in government it has chosen to do so. I do not want to make churlish remarks about manifesto commitments. That issue has been dealt with thoroughly elsewhere. I want to make constructive comments in Committee and I am pleased that the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) intends, like us, to adopt a constructive approach in opposition.
<P>
The importance of the Select Committee and confirmatory hearings is partly to do with accountability, as the right hon. Gentleman said, and partly to ensure that the court is representative. That is a point of substance. The Chancellor in Opposition, and when he made his statement, was keen to say that the court would be the body within the Bank that would represent sectoral and regional influences. We supported him in that proposal. He said, on the record, that it was incredibly important to ensure that the Bank, the court and monetary policy in general was seen not just to be representative of the south east and London but of the whole country. I am sure that the ministerial team, given the location of their constituencies, are fully aware of the need to ensure that economic policy represents the whole of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<H5>11 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
It was a slight mystery to me that there was nothing in the Bill about regional and sectoral influences and representation. That is why I support the amendment. Confirmation of appointments by the Select Committee is one way in which Parliament can ensure that the Government's intention, expressed in a statement, that the court is to be representative of those different influences, is put into practice.
<P>
In May, speaking about the need for wider influences in the court, the Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Court will be substantially reformed to make it representative of the whole of the United Kingdom and to take account of the full range of Britain's industrial and business sectors. These changes in accountability and the new breadth of representation on the Court amount to the most radical internal reform to the Bank of England since it was established in 1694--over 300 years ago.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>--a most radical step indeed. In a letter to the Chairman of the Treasury Committee dated 18 July, the Chancellor said:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I propose that the reconstituted Court of the Bank should review the performance of the Bank, including the Monetary Policy Committee, with particular regard to whether the Bank is collecting the regional and sectoral information it needs.''
<P>
</UL></FONT>The Committee will now understand why I was so surprised that the Bill does not mention the sectoral or regional influences, either in terms of direct representation on the court or in terms of its reporting requirements. Perhaps the Government think that those influences will be understood, and that members of the court will reflect them. The Chancellor's own words suggest that this is a major change and I should have thought that the Government would want to spell it out in the Bill.
<P>
There is an argument that the Government want a degree of flexibility and do not want to over-prescribe in the Bill. They do not want to say that two directors of the court should come from Scotland, two from Wales and so on, as clearly that would reduce flexibility. But I question whether the complete lack of prescription is sensible. I imagine that Ministers would like future Governments that do not reflect their particular political persuasions to have to ensure that the court reflects different regional and sectoral influences. We support that. My hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) made it clear on Second Reading that we would prefer a statutory approach to ensure that those interests are reflected in the court's proceedings. That is not the case in the Bill, but the amendment would mean that those influences could be secured through parliamentary scrutiny of the Chancellor's proposals. If the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, I should be keen to hear from the Minister how the Government intend to meet their stated aim of ensuring that he court represents different regions and sectors of Britain.
<P>
The Bill is an important first step in ensuring that monetary policy is more independent, accountable and representative. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gordon said, we would prefer a full-scale Bill introducing a United Kingdom reserve bank which properly reflected the federal element of the United Kingdom. It could provide a fledgling means--fledgling, at least at this stage--to build towards that aim so that we could move in future years towards a Federal Reserve bank much more like those in the United States and Germany. It may be too early for such a move, given that the federal nature of our country is still in its early stages, but Liberal Democrats hope that we will move in that direction. We hoped that the Bill would be structured so that the court and the Bank could reflect that development over time. As it stands, it does not.
<P>
I raise those points in a spirit of inquiry. Before the election, in economic policy debates on the Floor of the House, there was concern that inflation statistics were not properly collected and did not take account of the influences facing different sectors and regions. Thus the omission from the Bill surprises me.
<P>
The Select Committee would be able to ensure the court's representative nature and that it was properly accountable--a point pursued by the right hon. Member for Wells. On Second Reading, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that he had an open mind on the general issue of confirmatory hearings and that he would discuss the issue with the Leader of the House. I hope that he will tell the Committee how those discussions are going, because it is germane to our debates in Committee on the importance of ratification hearings.
<P>
The amendment, as it reflects not just on the court of directors but on the Governor and the deputy Governor, is especially important because of the way in which monetary policy may develop over the next few years. That is why application hearings are the right approach. If this country enters a single currency after the next election, the Governor of the Bank of England or the United Kingdom representative on the board of the Eurofed--the proposed European federal bank--will be an incredibly important person. The means of accountability of the independent Bank of England in the Bill would not be strong enough if we were relying on that one individual to represent the interests of Britain--
<P>
<B>Mr. Nick Gibb </B>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton): Am I not right in thinking that the representative from the United Kingdom at the independent central bank of Europe will not be allowed by European Union rules to represent Britain's views because he--or she--will have to take a vow not to represent only Britain but the views of the whole of the European Community?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not follow the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton in pursuing that particular point. Interesting as it may be, it does not arise from our discussion of confirmatory hearings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> The hon. Gentleman was making a fair point which relates to the argument that I am trying to develop--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I was trying to be gentle with the hon. Gentleman. The problem is that his argument should be advanced under clause stand part, not under the narrow amendment about confirmatory hearings.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> With respect, Mr. McWilliam, my point is that confirmatory hearings for the Governor will be increasingly important as monetary policy develops and takes on a European dimension. It is crucial that we have application hearings because the British representative at the Eurofed will represent Britain even if he has to take a vow that he will put aside his national background; he will still be seen by the British people as representing his country. If there is no proper accountability through ratification it will be weakened. That will undermine the Eurofed and how it is preceived to represent Britain's interest. It is important at this stage, as we move towards independence in the United Kingdom setting, that we have the much stronger accountability that ratification hearings would give us.
<P>
I am surprised that the Government have an open mind. I would have thought that they would want to go further. I believe them when they say that they are interested in enhancing the independence of the Bank of England and in ensuring that it is accountable. I cannot see any better weapon to achieve that than ratification hearings. They will ensure that the Bank of England, its Governors and directors of the court are seen as independent and accountable.
<P>
The amendment would strengthen the representativeness of the court and would strengthen accountability. I hope that the Government will accept it.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith </B>(Redditch): The ostensible reason for the amendment is a concern for openness and accountability in government. A friendly interpretation of Conservative Members' sudden concern for openness and accountability would reflect on the irony that it is because they are in opposition that they have decided that openness and accountability in government are important. A less friendly interpretation would be that members of the previous Government are being hypocritical in now showing concern for openness and accountability in decisions of national importance.

<B>Mr. David Ruffley (Bury St. Edmunds)</B><I> rose--</I><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. To which hon. Gentleman is the hon. Lady giving way? She may choose.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> I give way to the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell).
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> It is early in our proceedings, so I shall leave aside the hon. Lady's fruity choice of language. However, will she tell us who pioneered the use of Green Papers on taxation policy and which Government were assiduous in making more information available to the public? The amendment would be an extension of that process.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> As the hon. Gentleman will hear, I shall make points about the previous Government's contribution to openness and accountability. 
<P>
The debate has touched on party funding and its relevance to political parties' commitment to openness. We are being lectured by a political party that has still not repaid the funds it received from Asil Nadir, and we will never know from whom else it has received money because it does not openly publish the names of its contributors. Therefore, it is difficult to accept the basis of Conservative Members' arguments on this amendment.
<P>
The other justification for the amendment was set out by the right hon. Member for Wells who said that the court of the Bank of England has an important role to play. He argued that, because it has an important role, that in some way implies a need for confirmatory hearings. That link does not necessarily exist.
<P>
It was also argued that the court should be representative, and that was given as another justification for confirmatory hearings. Unfortunately, the facts that the court has an important role and that it should be representative--I agree with both those arguments--are not an argument for confirmatory hearings, which is the narrow proposal in the amendment.
<P>
There are significant difficulties with confirmatory hearings that have not been touched on in the debate. Even though there are arguments in favour of such hearings, we need only to consider the experience in the United States to understand that the introduction of such a procedure would create difficulties for our process of parliamentary democracy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Is that not the essence of the Government's approach? They are trying to abdicate responsibility for a crucial part of economic policy which, in the past, has been conducted by politicians elected to Parliament. They go through a confirmatory process conducted by the British electorate. The Government have decided to abdicate their responsibility to an unelected quango. Therefore, they must replicate a form of democratic accountability with all the problems that the hon. Lady has described. The problems have arisen because of the Government's decision to abdicate their responsibility and to remove decisions on economic policy from the democratic to a non-democratic process.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The hon. Gentleman has failed to recognise that there is a difference between democratic accountability and political interference. One of the reasons for putting forward the Bill is to get away from the political interference exercised by the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer in the setting of interest rates. We saw that political interference clearly before the general election, and it has been responsible for difficulties in the economy.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Who, therefore, will appoint the Governor of the Bank of England?
<P>
<H5>11.15 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> There is obviously a difference between the appointment of the Governor of the Bank of England and the specific political decisions about interest rates that we were discussing.
<P>
As hon. Members were suggesting, there are significant constitutional and procedural difficulties with confirmatory hearings that have not been considered this mornng. such hearings would not resolve the problem of whether the make-up of the court is representative; they would enable people only to confirm, or not, the suggestions that had been put forward. That is a wider issue, and must be dealt with elsewhere.
<P>
Finally, if Opposition Members are really anxious about openness and accountability, and that it should apply when an agency, an organisation, or a commitee takes decisions that are important in the national interest, why do we not hear them argue for more accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Will the hon. Lady explain the Labour party view when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) decided to open up monetary policy when he became Chancellor in 1993? Can the Committee hear the detailed arguments made at that time by the now Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, in response to the obvious change towards openness and transparency in monetary policy? I remind the Committee, especially, of the requirement that the Bank of England should publish an inflation report that was the subject of monthly meetings and that the minutes of those meetings should be published in their entirety for public scrutiny. What is that if not openness, and where was the Labour party when those matters were discussed?
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Those moves were welcomed by my hon. Friends, but there is a dearth of ambition in the belief that after 18 years of Government the most accountability that can be achieved is the publication of a set of minutes. [Interruption.]
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) should not heckle. If he wants to speak, he should stand up and he will be allowed to do so.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> I apologise, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Last Tuesday there were some interesting discussions about how far--or how ``unfar''--the Opposition went, when in government, in opening up accountability in the Bank of England. The Bill goes much further than was ever proposed by the Opposition; that is a key point.
<P>
If it is argued that, because a body is important to the interests of the country, it ought to be open and accountable. I must question Opposition Members about why, during the past 18 years of Conservative Government, so many arm's length agencies and individuals were put into positions of responsibility, with very little concern for their accountability. Why did the Director General of the Prison Service have very little accountability for decisions that were made? Why were decisions about school inspections taken by Ofsted inspectors with very little accountability?
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before I call Mr. Boswell, I want to caution the Committee that the amendment is extremely narrow; it says
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``subject to the confirmation of those appointments by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Hon. Members may make their own assumptions about what the Treasury Committee may or may not do, but they must not impute to it powers and motives that it does not have.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I am grateful for that advice, Mr. McWilliam. The hon. Lady makes an interesting contribution to the debate. On the specific issue of Ofsted, as a former education Minister, I should like to point out that Ofsted was created as an independent body to comment on educational matters. It would have been most improper, and unhelpful, if Ministers had intervened in Ofsted's conclusions. There will be other areas that the hon. Lady will no doubt develop, but I want to put that point on record.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I just played the advantage rule for the hon. Gentleman because of what the hon. Lady was saying. May we return to the amendment?
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> The point that you make, Mr. McWilliam, about the narrowness of the amendment is precisely the argument that I am trying to develop. We are currently looking at a specific area of policy. The whole issue of confirmatory hearings has much wider implications than we could possibly consider on this Bill. There are all sorts of other areas of public policy where under the last Government there was a lack of willingness to emphasise openness and accountability. I wish to highlight the inconsistency in the argument that is being put forward today.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> The hon. Lady is being inconsistent. I imagine that in Opposition she supported her Front Bench in opposing the lack of accountability of the structures and bodies that the previous Government set up. Consistency suggests that you should promote accountability in the structures and organisations that you set up.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> I am not promoting anything.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> That is precisely the point. Consistency suggests that when you promote accountability and openness you do so throughout the whole range of areas that affect people's lives. You do not, through this important but nevertheless very specific Bill, try to change processes that are in operation.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> Will the hon. Lady give way?
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> No. I am coming to a conclusion now. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, just as I did before I was a Member, I shall push for more openness and accountability, but I shall do so in a measured way across the range of public services.
<P>
This is a much broader issue for Parliament than we can possibly discuss this morning in relation to the Bill. It is not an issue only for the Treasury Select Committee and however strongly it feels about such an important issue, it alone could not make a significant difference to the way we carry out scrutiny. I am concerned about openness and accountability but I have far more faith in this Government delivering that openness and accountability than I ever had in the last Government, former members of whom are now proposing this amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> rose--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Gentleman, I should say that I let the hon. Lady get away with three ``yous''. Obviously, we do not wish to develop that into a flock.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I, too, will address the Chair, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
This Bill will be supported neither by those who oppose an independent Bank of England nor those who are in favour because it simply does not provide the level of accountability and independence that they require. The appointment of the Governor is a crucial part of what the Government are trying to do. By creating an independent Bank of England they have created a governorship, which is a crucial political appointment, so the accountability for that appointment is critical.
<P>
The letter of 18 July from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Treasury says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I believe it is important that the Bank should be subject to enhanced parliamentary scrutiny, in particular through your Committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It concludes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``You may wish to call the Bank to appear before you to give evidence before the publication of each Inflation Report.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
The memorandum submitted by the Treasury on 30 September 1997 states that the Chancellor will remain answerable to Parliament for the setting of monetary policy targets but that operational responsibility for monetary policy will remain with the Bank. That is the crucial issue at stake. The Bank of England will be responsible for delivering the inflationary target and the Governor will play a crucial role in that.
<P>
The only mention of accountability in the Chancellor's open letter of 12 July 1997 to the Governor of the Bank of England is when he says:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``I shall expect you to send an open letter to me, following the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee and referring as necessary to the Bank's Inflation Report, setting out: the reasons why inflation has moved away from the target by more than 1 percentage point; the policy action which you are taking to deal with it; the period within which you expect inflation to return to the target; how this approach meets the Bank's monetary policy objectives.<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
	You would send a further letter after three months if inflation remained more than 1 percentage point above or below the target.''
<P>
What would happen if inflation were at the wrong level for a month and a letter was sent, following which inflation remained outside the target for three more months and another letter was sent? What would be the status of the Governor of the Bank of England if, after four months, the Bank of England was still failing to reach the inflation target set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer? Would the Governor get the sack or be allowed to perpetuate the error in inflation policy? In the first case, what would happen about the appointment of a new Governor? Would the Chancellor consider the candidates for the job by examining their political viewpoints with respect to the conduct of monetary policy? Enormous debate is going on among economists about how to transact monetary policy. Would the new Governor of the Bank of England be a supporter of narrow money targeting, such as Professor Patrick Minford, or a supporter of the broad money targeting, M4, or a Keynesian? An enormous range of political and economic viewpoints will determine whether the Governor of the Bank of England will bring about low inflation or fail to do so.
<P>
The conduct of monetary policy is not an exact science. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said during the Adjourment debate on the issue in June,
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Setting interest rate objectives requires feel, touch and sensitivity,'' [Official Report, 11 June 1997; Vol. 295, c. 1073.]<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, there is something more important. Interest rate judgment depends on one's belief about how powerfully an interest rate rise or fall would affect the economy, and that belief depends on one's political viewpoint. The success or otherwise of the Bank or Governor will depend on the political and economic viewpoint of the Governor and the Monetary Policy Committee.
<P>
What I have described makes the appointment of the Governor of the Bank of England an enormously political decision. It makes him a politician. That was not the case before the Bill was published. This state of affairs is parallel with that created by the proposal to incorporate a Bill of Rights into United Kingdom law. That will make politicians of judges, who will be asked to make value judgments on the wording of a Bill of Rights. They will overrule Ministers and parliamentary decisions.
<P>
Some form of accountability to this House by the Governor, and with respect to his appointment, is important. Accountability through the Treasury Committee seems to be the ideal way to scrutinise the appointments not only of the Governor but of the directors of the court of the Bank of England.
<P>
When the issue was raised on Second Reading I was told that the matter should not be included in a Bill. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that an hon. Member who had been in the House a little longer would have known that the activities of Select Committees are the province of the House. Those Committees are appointed by the House and perform duties on its behalf, so there is no requirement for the Treasury Committee to be included in the Bill.
<P>
The memorandum submitted by the Treasury states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Government is responsible for achieving its economic goals and therefore it sets the target for monetary policy. The Bank's job is to set interest rates so that the monetary policy target is achieved. Both are accountable for the performance of their respective tasks.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 10 of the memorandum states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The Bank will be accountable to the House of Commons through regular reports and evidence to the Treasury Committee. The quarterly publication of the Bank's Inflation Report will provide a regular opportunity for the Treasury Committee to examine the Bank's performance.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 11 states:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Finally, through the publication of minutes and votes of the MPC, and the Inflation Report, the Bank will be accountable to the public at large.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
However, the 1990 Procedure Committee report, which followed the introduction of the next steps agencies--referred to by the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)--states in paragraph 43:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The relationship between executive agencies and their parent Departments raises important questions about the accountability to Parliament of the new bodies.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
Paragraph 44 continues:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``We have no doubt that they will wish to monitor closely the question of the accountability of agencies to the House, including through the medium of departmentally-related Select Committees. It is clear that, as their numbers and scope grow, scrutiny of the executive agencies, and of their relationships with their current Departments, ought to play an increasingly important part in the work of Select Committees.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
<H5>11.30 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
Here is the essence of my point. As executive agencies expand and begin to take over an increasing number of the functions of Government, it is important to allow our Select Committees to evolve. Our constitution has developed over the centuries by adapting to changes as they arise. Economic policy is changing from the province of Ministers of the Crown directly accountable to Parliament to unelected quangos--or to a next steps agency--so we must allow our Select Committee procedures to evolve.
<P>
The decision to give the Bank of England independence in its setting of interest rates is not the equivalent merely of allowing the driver and vehicle licensing centre to become a next steps agency: it is a crucial abdication or delegation of control over a massive area of governmental economic policy. Monetary policy is at least half of all economic policy-making decisions in this country; and economic policy decisions are a vast area of political debate. Handing over such a colossal part of the political process to an unelected Governor requires changes, as I said, to our Select Committee process.
<P>
The Government's response was:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Select Committees will devote increasing attention to the activities of those agencies which come within their purview. The Government hopes that when Select Committees wish to investigate matters delegated to an agency in its framework document, they will consider inviting agency chief executives to appear and give evidence, and that publication of agency framework documents and annual reports and accounts will enhance informed scrutiny''.<P>

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Is not the hon. Gentleman talking about the current situation regarding Select Committees rather than what is being proposed in the amendment, which is significantly different? As I suggested previously, that matter goes wide of the Bill's remit.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> I was quoting from the 1990 Procedure Committee report because its tone was that Select Committees need to evolve; to start taking evidence from chief executives in response to the development of next steps agencies. The Bill does not establish merely another next steps agency but something completely different--a wholescale transfer of economic policy making decisions from Ministers who are accountable to Parliament to the Governor of the Bank of England who is accountable to no one other than the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he is appointed. There is not enough parliamentary accountability.
<P>
During the past six months the Government have displayed a contempt for parliamentary procedures. Prime Minister's Question Time has been reduced to once a week, and the Prime Minister makes important statements about the tobacco industry on ``On the Record'' rather than to Parliament. That is typical of the way in which Parliament has been treated with contempt. The Government have, in effect created a politician who is not accountable to Parliament so we must have a method for ensuring that the Governor is directly accountable to Parliament. That is why the Select Committee process must evolve. The first step would be to ensure that the bill enables the Treasury Committee to require the Governor to be brought to account. I support the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn </B>(Guildford): I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam.
<P>
The Chancellor's announcement startled the City. It promised a revolution for the Bank, and there was no consultation. I refer not to the announcement in May but to the announcement in autumn 1979 when a Conservative Chancellor abolished exchange controls. That created an earthquake in our financial markets and in the running of the economy compared to which what happened in May was merely an earth tremor.
<P>
We now understand all this more clearly because we have had an opportunity to study the Bill. For all the promises in May of independence for the Bank of England, the Bill will grant only limited independence. There is clearly confusion among Labour Members as they discuss how accountable the previous Government used to be. The issue here is not the accountability of Government but whether an independent Bank should be accountable to the Government or to Parliament.
<P>
It is precisely because the Conservative party believes that the conquest of inflation takes political will that the political will of the people must be represented in its checks on the Bank of England. One of the great achievements of the previous Government was the creation of that will to defeat inflation--something that was sadly absent when the Labour party was last in power. The events of recent months have come about because of a lack of that will.
<P>
<B>Jacqui Smith:</B> Does the hon. Gentleman think that the refusal of the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer before the general election to recognise inflationary pressures in the economy, and his refusal to take the difficult decision to increase interest rates at that time, showed the people's political will or the Chancellor's political expediency, knowing that, before long, his Government would be out of power?
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I do not know what it shows but it does not arise from the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> I can only quote the comments today of the Governor of the Bank of England, who said how much he misses the Ken and Eddie show.
<P>
The question is, how should this political will be expressed? We know how susceptible the Government can be to outside, corrupting, influences: that has been made clear today. Therefore it will always be preferable for an independent institution to be answerable to Parliament, not to the Government. The choices of members of the new institution may well be good choices. They ought to be; it would be extremely unwise of any Government to make risky choices when the Bill that introduces the structure is going through the House. However, we must take a long-term view of the structure created by the Bill. There is a risk that, long after the Bill has become law, the choices will have been seen to be made to suit the Government's political needs rather than the needs of the country. I dispute entirely the inference from the hon. Member for Redditch. However, she clearly acknowledges the problem, and should vote with us for the amendment.
<P>
We heard only recently how the judgment of one of the most senior people in the land, the Prime Minister himself, could be susceptible to a Bernie. We must guard against that happening. I would much rather those choices were examined by the Select Committee developing its role--as my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) so ably suggested--than be left in the hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>
A justification has been given for this halfway house approach, which lies between the system that was used by the previous Government and a truly independent central bank. A distinction has also been drawn between political objectives and the operational aspects of the fight against inflation. The problem is that, because the Chancellor has so much influence over everyone involved at the senior level in the new Bank of England, political influence will be transmitted to the operational side. Political influence will not merely set the political objectives.
<P>
An old song--I do not propose to sing it--goes roughly along these lines:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>``It is said the whole world over,<br>
The story's just the same,<br>
It's the rich wot gets the pleasure,<br>
And the poor wot gets the blame.''</font></ul>
<P>
We suspect that the objective behind the Bill is for the Bank to get the blame and for the Chancellor to get the pleasure should there be any credit to be taken from the conduct of monetary policy.
<P>
A much wider concern is that the Bill will truncate the career structure in the Bank of England. If I may briefly go outside the clause's terms of reference, that will happen partly because so many of the Bank's important operations will be taken from it. It will also occur because almost all the appointments to senior positions in the organisation will, in effect, be in the gift of the Chancellor.
<P>
I hope that those on the Government Front Bench will tell us who may or may not be a member of the court. Those who are employed by the Bank could become members of the court by the simple expediency of giving up their contracts of employment with the Bank. It will be interesting to hear what Ministers say about that.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman should raise that matter on the clause stand part debate. Because his point arises out of the clause, I suggest that he makes it later when it will be in order.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. My point was that if the Bank's employees can eventually become members of the court--I am not convinced that that is a bad idea--whether those appointees--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to subsection (3), so that he does not get carried away with a brief that is clearly wrong.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> Confirmation by the Treasury Committee would ensure that any appointment, including the appointment of those who had once been employees of the bank, would not be political in the narrow sense of suiting the Government's purpose. It would fulfil the wider purpose of serving the people's will as a whole. Such an approach would be an improvement on the Government's proposal. There will be many criticisms of the Bill to come, but accepting the amendment will start to put things right.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell rose --</B><P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Before I call the hon. Gentleman, I give new Members of the House a health warning. Sometimes hon. Members are showered with briefs from all sorts of people who do not understand House of Commons procedure. If hon. Members stick too closely to such briefs, they may get into trouble with folk like me.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I assure you, Mr. McWilliam, that I shall do my best to stick narrowly to the amendment. I need not dilate at length on what has been an interesting and sometimes informative debate.
<P>
The amendment would subject appointments to the Bank's court or the appointment of the Bank's directors to confirmation by the Treasury Committee. It goes somewhat beyond the Committee's recommendations, which adhere to the proposals for the Monetary Policy Committee. It is important to establish a link between those and I shall do that later.
<P>
A certain continuity from our deliberations on the Finance Bill is noticeable from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and indeed, its Chairman, whom we are pleased to welcome again to the Chair. We concluded those proceedings with a discussion on films. One of my favourite films, which was not mentioned, is ``Cassablanca''. We all recall that in that film after the atrocity, the call goes out
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``Now round up the usual suspects.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
It is interesting, although it is a matter for the Committee of Selection, that the usual suspects have manifestly not been rounded up to participate in this Committee. Some of them have and I shall return to the hon. Member for Redditch in a moment.
<P>
<H5>11.45 am</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not criticising me in my role as Chairman of the Committee of Selection.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> That would be most improper, Mr. McWilliam. I merely draw the Committee's attention to the fact that a number of admirably qualified hon. Members, including one or two who spoke on Second Reading and a distinguished former employee of the Bank, the hon. Member for Bolton, West (Ms Kelly), have not been selected for this Committee. One of the advantages of that is that no member of the Select Committee is a member of this Committee, so we can consider things independently. But no one is, as it were, tarnished and nor would their vote on this or other amendments be influenced by their participation in those events, including the recommendation to impose a Select Committee filter. I thought it appropriate to draw that to the Committee's attention.
<P>
I agree with the hon. Member for Redditch that this is an important constitutional matter. I have some long-standing experience of Select Committees because, as a very junior researcher in the 1960's, I remember the experimental committees, particularly the one on agriculture, which made such a nuisance of themselves that they were closed down by the Wilson Government. They were brought back by Lord St. John of Fawsley in the late 1970s. They were a great constitutional innovation. We have never given them an executive role in the past. The question now is whether it is time to experiment with their having a limited executive role which would be to confirm Government appointments in the extremely critical areas on which my hon. Friends have been speaking. It would be at least appropriate to consider doing that.
<P>
I understand the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Redditch, which was why I sought to intervene just as she was closing her remarks. She said in effect that there is no point in making a one-off, piecemeal reform. She would like a more comprehensive look and, perhaps later, a more radical reform. That comes straight out of the text book, which in my case is a little book called ``Microcosmographia Academica'' by the late F. M. Cornford, a wonderful book which lists various lines of defence to adopt against any proposal for change. She got as far as the principle of the ``Dangerous Precedent''. If that fails, she will move to the principle of ``Unripe Time''. There will be other mantraps on the way before her great reforms take place.
<P>
All that has put the hon. Lady somewhat at odds with her own Front Bench. It is not for me to make trouble on the Government Benches, but she regards it as most inappropriate to consider even that kind of change because it is such a minor and piecemeal one, whereas the Chief Secretary has said that, at least in relation to the Monetary Policy Committee appointments, he is prepared to consider the matter. He has an open mind and will no doubt speak at the appropriate time on that.
<P>
In drawing my remarks to a conclusion, I shall explain why it is important that we also consider this filter for the court appointments. If the Governor remains a Crown appointment, effectively by the Chancellor, and his appointment as a member of the Monetary Policy Committee is then subject to confirmation by the Treasury Committee, the curious situation could arise in which the Governor is accepted and appointed centrally, but is not regarded as appropriate by the Select Committee, and thus cannot proceed to the subordinate committee. That would be grossly untidy. The problem should be considered in the context of appointing the Governor and the deputy Governors.
<P>
Those are the reasons for launching the constitutional experiment by accepting the amendment. However, if the Government are minded to resist the amendment, they should examine the nature of the appointments carefully. We are fortunate in that the Governor, his deputy, the bank staff and other court members, to whom we shall refer in the stand-part debate, are excellent public servants. I do not wish to suggest otherwise, or that their mode of appointment has been other than proper. However, it is important that sensitive appointments--all party appointments, such as those to quangos, to which the hon. Member for Redditch referred--are seen to be properly made and are as independent as possible.
<P>
I asked the Economic Secretary, in relation to the Monetary Policy Committee whether the appointments would be subject to Nolan filters. I received a somewhat qualified response. The Economic Secretary said that members would be highly qualified, and allowed to operate independently as long as that did not create a conflict of interest. It would be useful if the Chief Secretary could comment on the method by which he and his colleagues will try to make appointments, at executive level of the Governor and the deputy Governors, and also of members of the court of the Bank. The Government should be alive to the importance of openness and accountability. They should make the best possible appointments from those available to serve.

<B>Mr. Darling:</B> The hon. Member for Daventry made the shortest, most focused and most relevant speech in support of the amendment. He attempted to link the merit of confirmatory hearings to both the court and the MPC. Until this morning, discussions in the Select Committee centred on the merits of confirmatory hearings to the new Monetary Policy Committee, which has significant powers of fixing interest rate policy. The amendment refers to the court, which has existed for many years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> Will the Chief Secretary give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> In a moment.
<P>
As the right hon. Member for Wells said, the court's powers and duties have been enhanced. However, the court's essential task is to ensure that the Bank is properly governed. The role of corporate governance has simply been developed; it is not new. It has not changed as radically as the MPC. Subject to your rulings, Mr. McWilliam, and those of Mr. Butterfill, we will rehash many arguments about the MPC when we discuss part II. However, in view of our long discussion this morning, I should set out the Government's views on confirmatory hearings in general, and apply those principles to the appointment of the court.
<P>
Before I give way to the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I shall deal briefly with his point, as far as I understood it, about federal banks. We do not live in a federal country and we do not propose to become one. Therefore, analogies with the American Fed and the Bundesbank should be made with care. We are providing a British solution for this country's system.
<P>
<B>Mr. Davey:</B> I hope that the Chief Secretary will answer more directly some of the other points that I made in an earlier contribution. I acknowledged that at present we do not live under a federal system, and mentioned the need for a fledgling version. I spoke also of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's intentions, which his statement made clear. I hope that the Chief Secretary will address that point.
<P>
The right hon. Gentleman spoke about ratification hearings. As I understand it, those will apply to the Governor and to the deputy Governors. They are members of the Monetary Policy Committee and, as Governors of the Bank, are important individuals. The right hon. Gentleman cannot avoid the point simply by stating that the court is an old institution: the Governor and deputy Governors are key people, so it is important that the Treasury Committee is able to ratify their appointment.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Before the Chief Secretary goes down that path, I again remind the hon. Gentleman that clause 2 relates to monetary policy issues initially and that his present arguments arise from that clause, not from clause 1.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I shall try to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions and those of other hon. Members. Part of my difficulty is that this has been almost a Second Reading debate which, by its nature, has touched on a number of clauses, but I will try to deal with various points at the appropriate time.
<P>
The hon. Members for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) and for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton were slightly at cross purposes. One or other was off message, and what the Conservative party's message is--whether it is for, or against, the Bill--I cannot be sure. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that setting up a Monetary Policy Committee was an entirely new departure that was quite radical and something he would shy away from, whereas the hon. Member for Guildford said that it was a mere tremor compared with the steps taken by Lord Howe when Chancellor. They cannot have it both ways.
<P>
As we do know where we stand--as we are in favour of the Bill--we believe that the measure is a major step forward. When we reach the part relating to the MPC, there will, no doubt, be a full debate on its merits. I will not say anything further about it now as I prefer to concentrate on the amendment.
<P>
The right hon. Member for Wells, the shadow Chief Secretary, made a number of points to which I shall respond before returning to the central point--the merits of a confirmatory hearing.
<P>
The functions of the court and the MPC are quite distinct. The court's functions are set out fully in clause 3 in relation to keeping under review the Bank's performance, its financial management and internal financial controls, and the important matter of remuneration for its executives.
<P>
We have set out clearly--this has not happened up to now--the precise role of the court of the Bank of England. It is also given a further function under clause 16--to keep under review the processes followed by the MPC. The Chancellor has made it clear that part of the court's job is to ensure that it has a far broader base than previously for gathering intelligence--in its wider sense--from the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton commented on that, and it is an important function. We wish to ensure that all parts of the UK are represented and that representation comes not only from the City but from commerce and industry, so that the bank not only gathers intelligence from its network of intelligence-gathering facilities and its agents throughout the country--its formal mechanisms--but has some input from a court that is broadly based.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman and others asked why the Bill does not stipulate who will be included. There are two reasons for this. First, these are Crown appointments, and it has long been the practice that Parliament has not, in any Act of Parliament, attempted to fetter the discretion of the Crown. In practice, the Crown makes appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister in the case of the Governor of the Bank of England, or on the advice of the Chancellor in other cases. The Bill does not specify it in detail because we do not want to fetter that discretion. We also do not want to specify constituency-based representation--that we want two from the City, two from manufacturing districts in the north of England, one from Wales, and so forth. Rather we want to ensure--the Chancellor has given a commitment--that the court is broadly based.
<P>
<H5>12 noon</H5>
</P>
<P>
Before I come to the merits of the amendment, I want to illustrate one of the difficulties with confirmatory hearings. If the Chancellor puts forward 16 names from executive appointments, there will always be arguments--among fellow Ministers, hon. Members, members of Select Committees and so forth--over whether there should be two more from the north of England, more industrialists or fewer from City. I am not convinced that the Select Committee, through confirmatory hearings, would add much of value to that process. Who the members of the court should be will always be a matter of judgement. As with the present court, it is always possible to say that the appointments could have been better. That is not to say that the previous Chancellor who made the appointments was wrong; only that he might have taken a different view. Equally, if he were still Chancellor he might take a different view on future appointments.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Minister give way?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall finish this point and give way then.
<P>
We have given an undertaking that the court will be broadly based. We do not want to specify it more precisely in the Bill since circumstances can change. The Act may remain in force for many years. The 1946 Act remained largely intact for almost half a century. We see no point in building unnecessary and perhaps undesirable provisions into the legislation. Moreover, if Parliament specifies its constituencies--if I may use that word--it may preclude the Chancellor from appointing someone else in the future simply because explicit provision had not been made in the Bill.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> This clause gives the Government the power to appoint the Governor and the two deputy Governors. The later clause that deals with the Monetary Policy Committee automatically provides for those appointed. So when we are debating the character and political views of people appointed as Governor or deputy Governor, we are debating this clause. Yet the Chief Secretary seems intent on avoiding the crucial issue--what criteria will the Government use in appointing the Governor and deputy Governors who will automatically be on the Monetary Policy Committee?
<P>
My understanding of the Bill is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will no longer be responsible for determining monetary policy. He merely sets targets; the Bank of England will determine the monetary policy. The Chancellor has no view on monetary policy; he will therefore have no view on the monetary and policy views of the Governor whom he appoints. Who then does he appoint when a vacancy arises? What criteria--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Interventions should be interventions. The hon. Gentleman is developing a speech.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> Will the Chief Secretary address the points that I raised in my speech since he has not done so thus far?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> That is partly because the hon. Gentleman's remarks were not focused enough. If they were, it would be easier to follow exactly what he was saying. I shall try to deal with his intervention. I confirm that we are indeed discussing clause 1; we are also discussing amendment No. 1, which he would do well to remember. We are not debating part II of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman obviously cannot wait to get there. When we do, we can debate the rationale behind the Monetary Policy Committee and the wider objectives of the Bill.
<P>
I must put the hon. Gentleman right about one particular point. Clause 1 sets out what the court of the Bank of England will comprise. It does not deal with the appointment of the Governor or the deputy Governor. They are Crown appointments made on the Prime Minister's advice. The present Governor was appointed by Her Majesty on the advice of the previous Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), and the present deputy Governor of the Bank was appointed on the advice of the present Prime Minister. The clause does not deal with the appointment of the Governor or deputy Governor. It simply sets out the fact that they, the additional deputy Governor who will be appointed if the Bill is passed and the 16 directors of the bank will all be members of the court.
<P>
I shall take advantage of the fact that Conservative Members appear to have deserted their Benches to return to the general question in which those Opposition Members who remain were very interested. I made it clear when I appeared before the Treasury Committee, and on Second Reading, that the Government have an open mind on the principle of confirmatory hearings. We were invited to consider the matter with specific reference to the Monetary Policy Committee. A case is stateable in respect of that committee, precisely because of its new role. It would take a great deal of persuasion by those in favour of confirmatory hearings to persuade me that members of the court of the Bank of England should be subject to such hearings.
<P>
As I said on Second Reading and before the Treasury Committee, before deciding to implement the idea of confirmatory hearings at all, the House should consider the merits of such hearings and decide on the contexts in which they should be instituted. I believe that we would then confine them to the Monetary Policy Committee or, as supporters of the amendment would have it, the court of the Bank of England. Other appointments, such as the regulators, are independent. In an excellent speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Redditch mentioned Ofsted. I did not understand the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Daventry about the importance of independence in this context. If what he said is right, the same argument could be applied to the Governor of the Bank of England, who has always been an influential and important player in economic matters. One of the factors contributing to the influence and reputation of Governors in the past was the fact that they were seen to be independent. They were not simply an adjunct of Government. Something that is good enough for the Monetary Policy Committee or the court must be good enough for a range of other appointments. My hon. Friend the Member for Redditch also mentioned the Director General of the Prison Service, whose appointment has not been without controversy in the past. Exactly the same argument could be applied to it.
<P>
Even if Committee members are persuaded of the merit of the amendment with respect to the court, we should not adopt the principle in the Bill without an opportunity for the Government and the House of Commons to debate the matter. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton drew attention to my comment on Second Reading that Select Committees were independent of the Government--and rightly so. It is for the House of Commons to decide whether it wants Select Committees to have confirmatory powers. If the House were to recommend that, the Government would have to consider it. If the Government were intending to pursue such a course, they would make the necessary changes to legislation or procedures. However, it is not right for that to be brought about in the Bill. I have particular difficulty in accepting the argument in relation to the court.
<P>
The court's purpose is to discharge the functions that one would expect to be discharged by the board of directors of any company. Boards of directors exist to represent shareholders. For the present purpose, the shareholders are the Government acting on behalf of the general public. The directors' main duty is to ensure that the Bank is run properly. The structure of the court, its powers and the terms and duration of membership have been designed to represent best practice, following the Cadbury report, the Greenbury report and, latterly, the Hampel report. The object is to ensure that the Bank of England is properly run. Those functions are set out in clause 3, which we will debate later today or later in the week.
<P>
As I said, the duties of the court are expanded, but they are not radically different from the duties that it has had for many years. Conservative Members' arguments would have had more strength if, at some point during the past 18 years, they had shown the slightest interest in confirmatory hearings. I know that the Conservative party is now a party that cares. The hon. Member for Guildford quoted us a song that is more properly an epitaph for the previous Government. We had the distinct impression--certainly throughout the 1980s--that Lady Thatcher blamed the poor for just about everything and that the rich got richer. The Conservative party is now the party of open government. Some of us--who have, I admit, been in the House for only 10 years--must have missed something along the way.
<P>
I take the new-found conversion of the right hon. Member for Wells with a large pinch of salt. He was a member of the previous Government until he fell out with his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe over Europe. He now tells us that the Conservative party was wrong for 18 yeas and that there should have been confirmatory hearings. I find that statement difficult to take.
<P>
It was interesting that at no point did any Opposition Member tell us why confirmatory hearings would make the appointments better. It seemed to be assumed that the appointments must be better because there were confirmatory hearings. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will tell me?

<TR><TD>
<P>

<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> The argument was not that confirmatory hearings would necessarily improve the quality of the appointments; it was that they would open up the process to transparent scrutiny to see whether Ministers were making political appointments. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out, there is a political element to any function of the central Bank or its directors. The directors are, in a real sense, political economists, even if they would not accept that. They make political judgments whenever they make economic judgments. Conservative Members are keen to see whether political appointments have been made by Treasury Ministers.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Horror of horrors. Politicians sometimes do political things.
<P>
When the Chancellor appoints members of the court or of the MPC, the test is not only how that is viewed by the House, but how the world at large looks at such appointments. When my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made his appointments to the MPC, they were broadly welcomed by the world outside. One of the reasons that long-term interest rates dropped after my right hon. Friend's announcement was because the markets, in particular, had confidence in the people that he had appointed. If any Chancellor made appointments to the MPC, the court, or any other body, that were blatantly political, the desired results would be completely undermined.
<P>
The hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) will know, for example, that during this party's stewardship of Wales, the general feeling in Wales was that the only way to be appointed to any quango was to join the Conservative party, or to be a friend of the Conservative party. That helped undermine confidence in the regime, and is why Wales is one of the places in the UK where a long, hard search will not reveal a Conservative MP.
<P>
The test, therefore, is not what the Treasury Committee--or any other Select Committee--might make of the appointments, but what the World at large makes of them. I want to examine some of the difficulties that I see, and I will develop the arguments further when we discuss the MPC.
<P>
I understand the Treasury Committee's view that, had there been confirmatory hearings, it would have felt that it had more responsibility for the appointments and would have approved them. The Select Committee will see MPC members anyway, and those appointed to the MPC must fall within the terms of clause 13(4), which means that they must have knowledge and experience that is likely to be relevant to the Monetary Policy Committee. The Chancellor does not have a free hand, but I understand the Select Committee's argument. Against that, we must consider the problem of precedent and the issue of independence. I wonder why the appointments would, de facto, be better. For example, will there be an argument about whether someone is a better economist that someone else? We know what is said about economists: they do not agree with each other, so how can we agree which one is better? How would the Treasury Committee form a view on whether there should be more members from the north and fewer from the south, or more from the City and business? I have not yet heard the Opposition Benches argue why the proposed system would be better than the current system.
<P>
<H5>12.15 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> That is the very essence of our argument for the amendment. The point is that economists vary in their political views; there are good economists, not so good economists and bad economists. They all have track records and forecasting records and we can read their views in articles. Every economist has a different economic view and those views are highly political in nature. Therefore, it is better to have the Governor's and the deputy Governor's appointments scrutinised by the Treasury Committee so that those views can be examined and we know the economic viewpoint of the people who will play a key part in this country's economic policy in the future. That is the essence and purpose of the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> That makes my point. To avoid embarrassment, I shall take the example of someone who is dead. [Interruption.] I am afraid that my years of training as a lawyer are beginning to show. In law, unless people are dead, their views are of no effect whatever. If they are dead, they assume an authority that was not always apparent when they were alive. I shall apply that principle to economists.
<P>
Let us suppose that the Chancellor had it in mind to appoint John Maynard Keynes either to the Monetary Policy Committee or as Governor of the Bank of England--it does not matter which for this purpose. No one would dispute that Keynes was a great economist, possibly one of the greatest this country has ever produced. There would be, as there was then and as there will always be, an argument about whether his views were right. He changed his views many times during his life. If the Chancellor is responsible to this House for his judgment, what would happen in a hung Parliament, for example, or if the Select Committee took the view that Keynes was unsatisfactory and therefore wanted someone else to be appointed? Where would that leave the Chancellor, who, ultimately, is responsible for the overall conduct of economic policy, if he sought to appoint Keynes as Governor but his decision was overturned because a majority on the Select Committee did not agree with his views, not because he was not a fine man or a leading intellect, but because they thought he was wrong? I am not sure that that makes the lines of accountability any better; the public at large--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the right hon. Gentleman please accept that we have been debating clause 13 for some time, but we are on clause 1, amendment No. 1, and it would be quite nice to return to it. I am beginning to take a view about clause stand part from the way that the debate is going.
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> All I have to do to get back to clause 1 is to move Mr. Keynes from being the Governor and member of the Monetary Policy Committee to being a member of the court, although he may feel that that was downgrading and not commensurate with his importance. For the moment, let us suppose that he was the man representing East Anglia; the same principle applies. The point is that in respect of these appointments it is a matter of judgment and opinion whether they are good or bad people. The amendment would have us accept that the Treasury Committee's judgment must take precedence over that of the Chancellor, but it is the Chancellor who is responsible to the House, not the Treasury Comittee.
<P>
<B>Mr. Edward Davey:</B> I shall tell the right hon. Gentleman why the ratification hearings would improve the appointments process: the economic argument behind an independent Bank is that it is seen to be credible in setting monetary policy and is seen to be independent of Government. The ratification hearings--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. Will the hon. Gentleman please understand that he can debate that matter in clause 13 or clause 2, but not in our discussion of clause 1, amendment No. 1?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman.
<P>
<B>Mr. Gibb:</B> In discussing the amendment, has not the Chief Secretary revealed the problem with the Bill? He is saying that the Chancellor is responsible to the House for his judgment in appointing the Governor and deputy Governor of the Bank of England and members of the court. He has implied that the Chancellor will consider the political and economic views of those people when making the appointments.
<P>
Is it not the essence of the Bill to make the setting of interest rates and the determination of monetary policy independent of the Chancellor? Yet the Chief Secretary is now saying that they will be dependent on the Chancellor--
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. The hon. Gentleman has done it again. We are discussing not clause 13 or clause 2, but clause 1(1).
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> Perhaps I should have given more thought to the order of consideration and started with clause 13. We could then have worked our way through to the less exciting parts of the Bill. You, Mr. McWilliam, would stop me in my tracks if I dealt with the central point that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton raised, which is the merits of the MPC. I shall not do that now, but I will deal with it when we reach clause 13.
<P>
I repeat that the Government have an open mind about confirmatory hearings in general, but I do not think that it would be wise to apply them to this Bill without considering the other appointments that might be affected by the procedure. Even if we were going to apply the procedure to one part of the Bill, I am not persuaded of the merit of applying it to the court of the Bank of England, which fulfils the function that it has had for many years. That function is wholly distinct from the points made by Opposition Members about the fixing of interest rates. For those reasons, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> It has been an illuminating debate. Although, on occasions, it has strayed a little wide, it has done so in a way that has shed additional light on the thinking behind the clause.
<P>
The amendment is about the process used for appointing members of the court. It remains our view that the House of Commons, through its Treasury Select Committee, should have influence over that process. It is a comparatively modest proposal and neither the Chief Secretary nor the hon. Member for Redditch have put up a convincing argument against it.
<P>
The hon. Member for Redditch got into a tremendous muddle in trying to show the Committee that she was critical of what she described as ``arms-length bodies'' while saying that she supported the Bill--which, of course, will set up yet another arms-length body. When the hon. Lady said that she was in favour of--and would continue to press for--openness and accountability, she had some difficulty explaining why she would not support the amendment, which has been tabled to improve openness and accountability. It is a case of, ``Lord make me virtuous, but not yet.''
<P>
It is disappointing, although inevitable, that we have run into a fresh bout of inconsistencies from those on the Government Benches so early in the proceedings. The hon. Lady's ill-judged intervention shows a deep-rooted problem in the Bill. The Government talk a lot about fresh accountability and new measures to democratise our institutions, but they move in the contrary direction.
<P>
The Chief Secretary played down the changes to the court, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes it clear in his letter to the Governor of 6 May that the court will have a new and different role. He writes:
<P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> ``The non-Executive Members will review the performance of the Bank as a whole, including the Monetary Policy Committee.''<P>
</UL></FONT>
<P>
I am aware that we shall have other debates on the monetary policy committee, but that letter touches directly on the role of the court. It will have an explicit new role and the spotlight must be on the individuals who appointed or reappointed to it.
<P>
The Chief Secretary said that he intends to draw the membership of the court widely, both regionally and from various sectors of finance and industry. I am sure that that is his intention. The Government are full of good intentions and encouraging words. Before the election, we heard a great deal from them about openness and transparency. They spoke about devolving power from over-centralisation in Whitehall and how they would democratise all the long-standing august institutions, allowing a fresh wind of democrary to blow through them. There has been no shortage of rhetoric, but the Government never deliver. We have not had a freedom of information Bill or, indeed, any proposals along those lines.
<P>
The Opposition are not inclined to accept encouraging words that are contradicted by what the Government do. Those important appointments will remain the sole discretion of one person--the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Chief Secretary seemed to suggest that confirmatory hearings would undermine the independence of the institution, which is not the case. If appointees are seen to be appointed without bias or partiality, it would enhance their independence. We suggest not that the House of Commons should continue to interfere in the day-to-day workings of the court, but rather that the appointees should be confirmed. We suggest not that the members of the court should be proposed by the Treasury Committee, or that it should present a list of possible candidates, but rather that the Government's own suggestions should be confirmed, which is a very different thing.
<P>
The Chief Secretary tried to pray in aid, although his argument rather back-fired on him, the supposed goings-on in Wales before the election. He alleged, quite wrongly, that if you contributed to the Conservative party, you were certain to be put on a quango.

<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have never done either.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I shall just add one point to that, if you will allow me, Mr. McWilliam. If that is the case, it equally must appear--I stress the word ``appear''--that if you give a lot of money to the Labour party, you can get it to break an explicit election pledge on tobacco advertising.
<P>
<B>The Chairman:</B> Order. I have done neither of those things.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that I have satisfactorily demolished the Chief Secretary's argument.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Would my right hon. Friend like to comment on the apparent concession made by the Chief Secretary to the effect that there are some functions and some agencies for which confirmatory hearings would be appropriate?
<P>
<B>Mr. Darling:</B> I did not say that.
<P>
<B>Mr. Ruffley:</B> Then I apologise. I thought that the Chief Secretary said that it would be appropriate to consider confirmatory hearings for certain functions.
<P>
<B>Mr. Heathcoat-Amory:</B> I think that my hon. Friend is right that the Government are considering the possibility of confirmatory hearings, which we welcome. However, we are debating the issue today, and it would have been helpful if, rather than hearing all the arguments against it, the Chief Secretary had said that he might return to the matter and consider our amendment on Report. Instead we heard only negative reasons, although the amendment is an argument for openness, accountability and transparency, for which I thought the right hon. Gentleman was in favour.
<P>
It is not that we dispute the integrity or expertise of existing members or the re-appointments of the court, but it is important to make them clear to the outside world. The underlying philosophy of making the Bank of England independent is to enhance its credibility and the confidence that we have in it. That can be helped only if the important appointments are not at the sole discretion of the Government but are confirmed by the House of Commons through one of its Committees. In that spirit, I shall press for a Division.

<P>
Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<H4><center>Court of directors</center></H4>
<P>
<H5>12.30 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 17, line 9, leave out `3' and insert `4'.
<P>
We come now to the detailed consideration of the appointments structure. The amendment would restore the existing practice of a four-year term of appointment for directors to the court. We did not have a clause stand part debate, so this may be the appropriate moment to point out that the Government's proposal is that all existing directors should put their appointments on the line and be reappointed, or not, as the case may be.
<P>
It is interesting, in these days of new Labour, that probably not too many Labour Members know the words of the Internationale. Their proposal is entirely consistent with that song, which is about making a break with the past. I understand operationally why that is being done, but we are concerned about the independence of the new directors of the court.
<P>
We feel that a four-year period would involve greater independence. The three-year period--which, I concede, is the normal length of Government appointments--involves a relatively short cycle. As some of my colleagues pointed out on Second Reading, that period is far shorter than the life of a Parliament. A four-year period would broadly subsist with--and in many cases would straddle--the life of a Parliament and of a Government, and would therefore involve greater independence. However, the four-year period is not as long as the term of appointment of a director of the Bundesbank or of a United States Senator. There is a balance to be struck, and we should not move from the existing practice without good reason. The Government must explain why they prefer three years to four.
<P>
Although I appreciate the constraints on appointments--I listened carefully to the Chief Secretary's comments on that matter--it would be helpful if the Economic Secretary would explain further the appointments process for new directors. How many appointments will be for shorter periods in order to phase in the scheme? Could she also say a word about the new relationship between the directors and the court? Save the Governor and the two deputies, there will be no executive directors to the court. I take it that that is being done for greater representation and breadth, which may be welcome, but the relationship needs further explanation.
<P>
We retain an interest in the perceived independence of the directors of the court, which needs to be carefully balanced against the changes which the Government unfortunately propose in the appointments system.
<P>
<B>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury </B>(Mrs. Helen Liddell): I am grateful to the hon. Member for Daventry for reminding us of the words of the Internationale. As I have a cold, I shall resist singing it, although I have sung it on many occasions--usually, I hate to say, at funerals.
<P>
There seems to be a different theme in this Committee than in the Committee that discussed the Finance Bill, when we heard much about the hon. Gentleman's family. I got the impression that the theme in this Committee will be songs. There is a song that Labour Members are especially fond of called ``Things can only get better''. We are word perfect on it and, indeed, things have got better.
<P>
The amendment would extend the time that non-executive members serve on the board from three to four years. It appears to come from the recommendations of the Treasury Committee, which itself was divided on the matter. The vote was two for, two against and the amendment was only passed on the casting vote of the Chairman. Issues of judgment and balance must be taken into account.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> The hon. Lady made a point that I should have made--that the Treasury Committee endorsed our proposal. Am I not right in saying that the Treasury Committee's report--whatever may have gone on in the deliberative sessions--was a unanimous report?
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I made that point because I do not want to go into the issues raised by the Treasury Committee report. We have already spent much time on that this morning and on Second Reading. My point was about the need for balance. The Government were helped in their deliberations by the recommendations of the Hampel committee's preliminary report on corporate governance. We are discussing a governance issue. The Hampel committee concluded that all directors of companies, not just of such august organisations as the Bank of England, should be required to submit themselves for re-election at regular intervals and at least every three years. That recommendation was a deciding factor in reaching a conclusion on the issue of balance.
<P>
One reason why three years is more attractive than four years is that it allows people time to play themselves into a job, because that does take time. I have been a Member of Parliament for just over three years and I still cannot find my way around the building, although I am managing to find my way around Bills slightly better than I did. I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, on such matters. The period of three years allows directors time to get into the bones of the job, but does not tie them up for long if they prove to be ineffective in that role. It is important to ensure that if there has been an appointment which, for whatever reason, is inappropriate for the job, there is an opportunity, as part of accountability, for the appointment to be rescinded. There is nothing to say that directors cannot be reappointed; they could serve for three, six, nine years or whatever.
<P>
With regard to the Hampel recommendations, we are aware that throughout industry there is a need to take into account issues of accountability. Perhaps it is appropriate for the Bank of England, as one of the most august organisations in this country, to give guidance--which backs the deliberations of the Hampel committee.
<P>
The hon. Member for Daventry also mentioned the difference between the Bank's executive directors and non-executive directors. As he knows only too well, it is important to achieve the right balance in any organisation between executive management and non-executive input to ensure that the wider public interest is more fully represented.
<P>
That balance is even more important for the Bank of England. As the Government remain the chair of court, which is expected to ensure that all non-executive members have all the information that they need to fulfil their duties successfully, a very important link is created.
<P>
One of the important functions of the court is to set objectives for the Bank's executive employees and directors, and to monitor progress against objectives. It is therefore important that non-executive members have a greater role in ensuring that the wider public interest is considered.
<P>
I hope that I have answered the question asked by the hon. Member for Daventry. The Government cannot accept the amendment and will oppose it.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> It is fair to say that that confirms a view that I expressed earlier. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. In the short term, the Bill will have some dramatic effects, but in the longer term, by curtailing the independence of the new Bank of England in so many ways, the level of political control behind the scenes will be considerable.
<P>
As the Committee has rejected amendment No. 1, it is even more important that a greater measure of independence be given to those appointed to the court. If there are to be three-year appointments--it is clear that such appointments will be staggered, so in the first instance some will be for less than three years--at any point in time it will take only 18 months for half of the membership of the court to be changed.
<P>
It is conceivable that in the course of 18 months the Government will radically change their mind. Any of their policies or assertions can be tossed aside due to many different influences. I would be very worried indeed if over a period of just 18 months, the course of monetary policy could be affected in such a political way. That could happen not overtly, as in the past, when we all knew where the decision making process rested, but through the influence either of changing membership of the court, or through inference by court members as to which way they should be leaning in order to continue to curry favour with the Government when their re-appointments are drawing near.
<P>
[Mr. John McWilliam in the Chair]
<P>
The Minister told us that things can only get better. She may think that after last week, but I suspect that they could get a great deal worse. One of the reasons they will get worse in terms of monetary policy is if, having made the decision to grant a measure of independence to the Bank of England, the Government are determined to be so mealy-mouthed about it.
<P>
The other aspect about which I am anxious is the effect of the new system on career structure. I understand that court members will have responsibility for setting the remuneration of the Bank and of those who work in it. The way in which the reorganised Bank of England is being established is likely to have a detrimental effect on morale in the Bank, just as the way in which the Bill is being introduced is having a detrimental effect on morale in the regulatory organisations that will be superseded.
<P>
If political control is exerted on court members, the interests of the Bank--its operation and the motivation of its staff--may take second place to the political imperatives of the Government of the day. There are tremendous pay pressures in the financial sector and it is important that those who work in the Bank of England represent the ablest people available. If that is to be so, the pay structure at the Bank of England must be imaginative and must take account of the special circumstances of the City of London.
<P>
<H5>12.45 pm</H5>
</P>
<P>
There is real concern that political meddling by the Government of the day will be used to influence factors such as the pay and remuneration of the people who work in the Bank. The possibility of political meddling will be greater if court members are subject to reappointment every three years. As well as being able to change the composition of the court within an 18-month period, a Government could, within the course of one Parliament, exert a subversive influence over pay and conditions at the Bank.
<P>
Those are among the reasons why the directors should be given a wider rein. We have suggested that directors should be appointed for four years instead of three. There is an argument for some of them being appointed for an even longer period and for those with good and lengthy service to be given even more independence so that on the operational side the new Bank will have the freedom of operation that it has enjoyed in the past.
<P>
I shall support the amendment because we shall have enough of a battle to persuade Labour Members to agree to a four-year term. If they vote against the amendment, they will again signal that despite the hullabaloo of the Chancellor's statement and after the early stages during which they must be squeaky clean and not put a foot wrong in making appointments to the court, the Government's hidden agenda in the Bill is to keep everything under the thumb of the Chancellor and the Treasury. The treatment of the provision will be a litmus test of that statement.

<P>

<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That was a revelatory speech from the hon. Member for Guildford. He raised a number of issues that gives us a better view of where the modern Conservative party stands. It has not moved much further from the pre-election Conservative party.
<P>
The hon. Gentleman made much of the court's remuneration and everything that he said is directly in opposition to what was outlined in the Cadbury committee's report on the governance of the nation's companies. The background of the Cadbury report was to ensure the utmost probity in corporate governance and to separate the remuneration of executives to non-executive committees of boards to ensure distance between the two.
<P>
<B>Mr. St. Aubyn:</B> The hon. Lady misunderstands the thrust of what I said. My concern is with those who are employed by the Bank and how their level of remuneration will be influenced by the structure proposed in the Bill. My concern is directed not at the level of pay of court members, but at the effect of the system on the pay structure throughout the organisation.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's elucidation, which helps me make my point. He referred to the effect on the career structure. We believe that some jobs are sufficiently interesting that people are committed to them not only because of the remuneration. The hon. Gentleman made some sweeping assertions about morale at the Bank of England but we heard the same on Second Reading about morale among the regulators without any facts to back it up.
<P>
We must deal exclusively in facts in considering this part of the Bill. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that he intends to reappoint existing court members for the balance of their terms to allow continuity. It has also been made clear that the pay structure for executives in the Bank remains a corporate matter for the Bank, though, as with any organisation, that must be dealt with within the Bank's financial constraints and must take into account the most efficient use of the Bank's resources. We will return to that point under clause 2(4).
<P>
The hon. Gentleman has not made a convincing case for the amendment. The recommendations of the Hampel committee, underpinned by advice from the Cadbury committee, point to the Government's conclusion that the term of office for members of the court should be three years.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I must respond to the hon. Lady's extraordinary remark about remuneration for people who do important and responsible work. She began in the context of the Bank of England but went rather wider. Her remarks will be noted carefully. If they are in any sense an instruction to the senior salaries review body or others, they will be noted with concern.
<P>
Our exchanges have been interesting. The hon. Lady has been unable to appreciate the Opposition's concern is not with getting the best coporate governance, on which we are at one with the Government; our concern is whether the political process will be allowed to subvert what would otherwise be the objective intentions of the court of directors. The right way to underwrite their independence, and to act in the best interests of the Bank and the nation, is to allow them a term that will enable them to do their jobs without fear or favour and without undue political influence being brought to bear on them.
<P>
My hon. Friend the Member for Guildford pointed out that a malicious Government, or one bent on a particularly narrow political agenda of any variety, could turn around a majority on the court within a short time. Such concerns do not apply to the Ministers at the moment, who have expressed the intention to reappoint and provide a broadly balanced pattern of appointment. They apply to the danger that things will change if push comes to shove--if monetary policy goes badly or there is a recession or political recrimination. We do not believe that we should give away the extra year of independence accorded to directors of the Bank under existing, long-standing practice.

</FONT>Question accordingly negatived.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 18, line 10, leave out `month' and insert `week'.
<P>
This is a probing amendment about the standard meetings of the court. The annual report explains the existing practice in greater detail. It says that most meetings are held monthly but that shorter weekly meetings are also held. The purpose of the amendment is to invite the Minister to explain why the provision for weekly meetings is being removed.
<P>
I can imagine that within the Treasury and the Bank, people are saying, ``Why do we have to meet every week just because it is described in statute, even when there is not much to do? If we had a more flexible arrangement, we could still meet if we needed to.'' If that is the argument, the Minister must make it. I believe that there is a risk in doing that. Sometimes, there is merit in public institutions--I have in mind the Cabinet, which, even in its somewhat devalued state under the present Government, does actually try to run the country--meeting on a regular basis. The absence of a meeting--Sherlock Holmes' dog that did not bark--or the presence of a meeting when one is not required, is in itself a matter of remark. So this is more than a technical issue.
<P>
The Bank will retain its central banking responsibilities, in particular the management of systemic risk within the financial sector and the management of its international economic and monetary relations. Those are hugely important tasks. If the court is told that it need only meet once a month and we then find that more regular meetings are needed they may well be in present circumstances--perhaps even overnight, that will be a matter for further concern. I do not mind whether business is transacted at those weekly meetings but they should not be given up without some explanation from the Government.
<P>
<B>Mrs. Liddell:</B> That change was requested by the court when it found that weekly meetings became impractical because of the time pressures placed on members of the court. However, it may help the hon. Member for Daventry to know that, if the court wishes to meet more frequently than once a month, nothing in the schedule prevents it from doing so. The hon. Gentleman's very valid point is met by the schedule.
<P>
<B>Mr. Boswell:</B> To be honest, I am not sure that it does answer my point. I put the case for having meetings as a matter of course, whether or not they are serious meetings about threats to the financial system. However, I do not wish to press the amendment, although it is right that the argument should be rehearsed in Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>
Schedule 1 agreed to.

<B>The Chairman:</B> I have an announcement to make. For the benefit of new Members, despite the fact that in the sittings motion we agreed to sit on Tuesday afternoons, that does not yet apply to the first Tuesday afternoon of a Committee, so we shall not be sitting this afternoon. However, I must inform the Committee that that matter is under consideration.
